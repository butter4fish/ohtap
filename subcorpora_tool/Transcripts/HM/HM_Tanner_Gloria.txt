Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I usually--my mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] had a favorite one, and I usually say the same thing.  The older I get, the more often I said, I get more like my mother.  I guess, this too shall pass, and that's--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 614783
Speaker 1: Well, let's, let's begin by talking about your mother.  Tell me her name, spell it for me, please, and tell me where and when she was born?
Speaker 2: Blanche Arnold Travis, and she was born in Maxeys, Georgia in 1904.
Speaker 1: And did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: A few of them, yes, not a whole lot of them, but she did tell me a few things about her upbringing.  Her mother was fourteen when she was born.  Her mother worked for the man that was her father and worked in his home at that time.  And Tom Brightwell was his name, and she was impregnated by him and had my mother, and she was fourteen years of age at the time.  And my mother stayed with an aunt, and stayed for a while with her dad's sister at that time.  And when my grandmother got married after, I guess, my mother was about four or five, my grandmother's husband said, "I don't want this half-white child."  And she went to stay with some relative in Florida for a while, but was born in Maxeys, Georgia, so between Georgia and Florida, she spent her childhood.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her, her schooling?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  She just told us a little bit about it, how her aunt that was her father's sister, would take her to school, and bring her back, and how she'd write on the wall.  And they still have things there on the wall, you know, when she was growing up and became an adult and go back.  I never went to Maxeys, Georgia, but some of the children did, and they met the Brightwells and so forth, but I never, I don't know too much about them.
Speaker 1: So, she lived with Tom Brightwell's sister?
Speaker 2: She lived with her for a while, sure did.
Speaker 1: Do you know her name?
Speaker 2: I don't, I sure don't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, she went to, so she went to school there as well--
Speaker 2: She went to--uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess what, what they would call it, maybe at that time, the colored school or something, my mother said.  I'm not quite sure what the name, but she went to the seventh or eighth grade.  She didn't finish high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your, her grandparents, your grandparents, your mother's mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Sophrina Arnold [ph.].
Speaker 1: Can you spell that, please?
Speaker 2: S-O-P-H-R-I-N-A, I think.  I'm not sure, I'm not quite sure, but I think it was the spelling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she also was from Maxeys?
Speaker 2: She was from Maxeys, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get to meet her?
Speaker 2: I did, but I was about four or five when she died.  I think I was four, but I sure did.  I remember her.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about her?
Speaker 2: I remember she was a small, petite lady.  Then, I was the favorite grandchild, and nobody could touch me or spank me (laughter), or discipline me at all 'cause she wouldn't let them.  And I remember when she died and when they came and took her body out of the house.  I didn't go to--
Speaker 1: And, and did she die because she was old or what happened?
Speaker 2: No, she was just in her forties when she died.  She had a stroke, and she died that morning when she right at home when she had the stroke.
Speaker 1: And her husband?
Speaker 2: I did not know anything about him at all, nothing at all.
Speaker 1: And is that as far as you can go back in your family history on your mother's, on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, that's as far as I can go back to Tom Brightwell and my grandmother.
Story_ID: 614784
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about your dad.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Marcellus Travis [Marcellus Travis, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in, not Maxeys, Georgia, I have to think the name of it.  It was near Savannah [Georgia], but a little small town in Georgia.
Speaker 1: So, is Maxeys near Savannah?  Is it south Georgia?
Speaker 2: I guess it's south Georgia.  I don't know a whole lot.  I've never been to Maxeys so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I bet it is south Georgia, somewhere near Athens there, near Athens, Georgia.  I think it's close to that, 'cause my mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] knew a lot about Athens, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in 1906.
Speaker 1: And did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little, because his mother died when he was six years old.  And his brother was two years old, and he was--his aunt from Atlanta [Georgia] came down and got him and took him to, took him to Atlanta to live, so he was raised in Atlanta so.
Speaker 1: And what was his mother's name?
Speaker 2: Victoria Travis [ph.].
Speaker 1: And his father?
Speaker 2: His dad's name was Albert Travis [ph.].
Speaker 1: And do you know the aunt that raised him, what her name was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do, yeah, I do, like our, she's like our grandmother--Hattie Mosley, and that was his mother's sister.
Speaker 1: And what about your father's schooling or growing up in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: My dad grew in Atlanta.  My dad went to private schools and he finished high school.  And he and his brother both went to private schools.  And my uncle went on to Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] and finished.  And my dad dropped out after high school.  He didn't go to college.
Speaker 1: And your father, what was your father's brother's name?
Speaker 2: Arthur Travis.
Speaker 1: And do you know the schools, private schools that they went to--names?
Speaker 2: I don't know the name of them, no, I sure don't.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: My dad went to Washington High School.  In fact, I think his class was the first black class--well, there was a black high school at that time, but his class was the first class to graduate from Washington High School, but he went to high school.  That's a public high school, Booker T. Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: So, his aunt and uncle, do you know what type of work they were in, that they could afford to send him to private school?
Speaker 2: I do.  They were both in domestic type work.  My aunt was, cleaned house and cooked for a family, the Hoags [ph.], and that's where she worked.
Speaker 1: And your uncle, Albert, what did he do?  He was also--what did he do?
Speaker 2: You mean my grandfather, Albert?
Speaker 1: That's what--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know what he did, I sure don't, but that was her--'cause she died at such an early--when my dad was just six years old, so he didn't talk about his dad at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I guess I meant your uncle, Arthur, that's Arthur Mosley, right [sic. Richard Mosley]?
Speaker 2: Oh, he, yeah, he made jewelry and he ran a jewelry place where he made watches and different things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they owned their own home?
Speaker 2: They owned their own home--they sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know anything about their education?
Speaker 2: Whose educ- now who's--
Speaker 1: Your aunt and uncle, Hattie and Arthur?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, Hattie and Arthur--now Hattie was not, that was his aunt, too.  She raised him.  Arthur was my dad's brother, see, that's my father's brother.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, so now, we have it straight, okay.
Speaker 2: Hm, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 614785
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your father [Marcellus Travis, Sr.].  What type of person was your father?
Speaker 2: I think my father was a good person, but he was a weekend alcoholic and he drank every weekend, and I can remember that so well.  Yet, my youngest sister [Violet Travis Ricks], she doesn't--she's fourteen years younger than I am.  And she doesn't remember any of that because he had stopped by the time she was, by the time she was old enough, you know, to know.  But when I was growing up, I remember every weekend that he was, he was a weekend alcoholic that, and he'd go to work on Mondays.  He was a diabetic, and he learned that he was a diabetic in his late twenties, and he would be sick a lot, you know.  We had to learn how to give him shots.  I remember that, you know, and growing up, and that type of thing.  And he'd work Monday through Friday, he'd work as a cook.  And then he worked in welding sometimes, different things he would do, but on the weekends--I remember on Friday, he'd start drinking, and stop on Sunday, so I remember that very well.
Speaker 1: And what did your mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother worked at the Biltmore Hotel in Atlanta [Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments, Atlanta, Georgia] for thirty some years.  And she was a supervisor of the pantry there, and that's where they made salads, and these type of things.
Speaker 1: Was there a story about how your mother and father met?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't really know.  My mother worked at one of the stores there and it's called J.P. Allens [J.P. Allen Company], I think, in Atlanta [Georgia].  And my dad was in that store one day, and that's how he met--well, she was a stock person, putting clothes and taking them back, and putting them up, and so forth.  And I think they met, that's how they met.
Story_ID: 614786
Speaker 1: And tell me about your mother [Blanche Arnold Travis].  Describe her to me and, and talk about, a little bit about your relationship.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, I, we all--the thing about my mother, it's seven of us, one boy and six girls.  And all the girls thought that we were the favorite daughter, but I really believe that it was my brother [Marcellus Travis, Jr.].  Now that we're older, we all laugh about it because my mother made us think that we were the favorite daughter.  She would tuck us in bed at night, every night, and kiss us goodnight, and tell us how beautiful we were, and how important it was to be as beautiful on the inside as the outside, and to reach out and help others.  And she, she was really my role model, a fantastic woman that got up every morning and went to work, and walked to work.  And if she needed shoes or something, she would put boards or something in them.  If we were in a play or we were in this--one of my sisters was the queen of her school, and this and that.  She'd take the money and buy what my sister needed, and take that, and do without, so she was to all of us, she was our shero--I guess you'd call it.
Speaker 1: And what was the relationship with your mother and father [Marcellus Travis, Sr.], being that your father drank?  He's--tell me what type of person he was even though he drank.  What was your relationship like with him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My relationship was not that good.  I have to be very honest and tell you, because I, I did not like it, you know, I didn't.  He and my mother seemed to have a pretty good relationship.  I can never remember my father fighting or screaming or carrying on with my mother, you know, or any things like that.  But I just thought, always thought that my mother was close to being perfect.  And I thought my father had so many problems that it just wasn't a good match.  I never thought, you know, that it was, but with seven kids, you know, they never divorced or anything, but--and never did a lot of arguing and fighting or anything like that.  But I, I just thought that she deserved the better, so it wasn't the best relationship.
Speaker 1: Do you--can you tell me what characteristic or trait you think you received from your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do, I, I, I can.  I think determination, be willing to try and try again if you don't succeed, that failure is not an option, that you--that failure only means that you go back, and you try again.  Her compassion, she's a very compassionate person.  Her willing to reach and help others, and she had, sort of a nonprofit mentality, like I have.  I have it like her, I guess I could say.  She's always never worried about what it paid, but what I can do, you know, and that type of thing.  So, I think I'm a lot like my mother.
Speaker 1: Do you believe you have any traits of your father's?
Speaker 2: No, I don't (laughter), I don't.
Story_ID: 614787
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your brother and your sisters.  How about naming them in order of birth, and where you fit in, and just tell me just a little bit about each one of them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My brother was the oldest.  And my sister--
Speaker 1: What was his name, tell me his name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Marcellus Travis, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my sister, Victoria [Victoria Travis Jackson], was the oldest girl, named for my daddy's mother [Victoria Travis (ph.)], and she was his favorite and they were, you know, real close.  And then, I was next, the third child.  And then, my sister, Betty [Betty Travis Dunson], she was the next.  And then my--I have a sister, lives here in Colorado in Colorado Springs, Hattie [Hattie Helen Travis Clay], she was next.  And then, I have a sister, Joyce [Joyce Travis Spearman], next.  And the youngest was Violet [Violet Travis Ricks].  She was the baby.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And we thought my mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] had finished, and here comes Violet (laughter).
Speaker 1: And she's the one that's fourteen years younger than you?
Speaker 2: She's fourteen years younger than I am, and sixteen years younger than my oldest sister.  And my brother was eighteen when she was born.
Story_ID: 614788
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of family life?
Speaker 2: I, I can remember when I was three years old, I can remember a good family life at that time from my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Such as--
Speaker 1: Just, whatever you remember, what is your earliest--you said you--
Speaker 2: I remember, yeah--
Speaker 1: --you could remember when you were three.  What--
Speaker 2: I remember my uncle [Arthur Travis], my dad's brother, coming over in a T Model Ford [Ford Model T] taking all the kids for a ride.  And then, I didn't know at that time that I had sort of something, like vertigo that I would get sick in the back seat of the car, and they'd have to bring me back.  And the kids would get so angry with me because every time they started off, they'd have to bring me back.  And I'd still want to go again.  And I remember that car and, and getting in the car with him.  I remember my [maternal] grandmother [Sophrina Arnold (ph.)] taking me to the Baptist church with her when I was three or four.  I remember going and hearing people sing and shout, and all those, those are some of the things that I do remember.
Story_ID: 614789
Speaker 1: And what were holidays like at your house?
Speaker 2: Lots of fun, there were so many of us, so it was always--it, with the girls, not with my brother [Marcellus Travis, Jr.], but with the girls, "You got my sock, you got my shoe, you got this, you got that," you know.  So, we did fight with each other, but it was a lot of fun having a lot of--we were pretty close knit.  We had no first cousins at all, so it was just us, so we were a pretty close knit family.  My mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] is an only child, and my dad [Marcellus Travis, Sr.] had the one brother [Arthur Travis], so it was just, just seven kids and my mother and father.
Speaker 1: Besides holidays, did your family go on vacations together or--
Speaker 2: No, we couldn't afford that.  We didn't, you know.  We'd go down to Athens, Georgia where relatives were some of the people that were related, distant to my mother, distant relatives, but not really.  Other than that, no, we--Miami [Florida], people would come up there, you know or we'd go down there.  But other than that, we don't, in a car driving, but never, never long vacations, no.
Speaker 1: But you said you went to Miami to visit people?
Speaker 2: My--well, I only even remember going once, but my family went more than once.  And they'd come up to, they'd come up to Atlanta [Georgia] a lot 'cause my mother was, you know, lived there as a child when she was little, so.
Story_ID: 614790
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about the neighborhood.  What is your memory of your neighborhood?  Tell me who lived in the neighborhood, and who some of your friends were.  And this is up to--let's stay in--up to elementary school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I don't remember too many friends in the neighborhood when, 'cause we, my mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] kept us kind of to ourselves when we were little.  There were a few, but when I, when the, when we lived in south Atlanta [Georgia], there were family next door.  I can't remember their names now, but we went to a private school out there.  We didn't go--that's before my father [Marcellus Travis, Sr.] start all the drinking that--on the weekends, and they could afford.  And we, my mother, they bought a house out there, went to a private school a couple of years, and we moved back into what you call the inner city in Atlanta and went to public school, and we had to walk a long way to school.  And most of my friends were kids at school, you know, I didn't--not too many in the neighborhood or anything.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, where did you first live?  You said, in, in south Atlanta, Southwest Atlanta (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we lived, well, we lived in the inner city, and I, I don't know what would, you would call it. I just call the inner city.  And then, maybe some people call it Fourth Ward or something [Old Fourth Ward, Atlanta, Georgia].  And then we moved to south Atlanta, and then after a couple of years, two or three years, we moved back into the city.  And that's when we started back to public school again.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the private school that you attended?
Speaker 2: I don't, but I remember the name of the public school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, let's go to--you're back in the inner city 'cause that's kind of what you remember, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was the public school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Gray Street School [Atlanta, Georgia], G-R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers or anyone that you remember in elementary school that might have encouraged you, or a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember my first grade teacher, Ms. Carter [ph.], I'll never forget her.  I remember the principal there.  She'd always greet us as we come in the morning and so forth.  And then, I left there, and when I came back there, I must have been in the fourth grade or so.  So, I guess I was in the second or so when I left, and I came back to that school again.  And I remember the teachers--I'm kind of forgetting names of them--but that thought I was the brightest thing in the class because I had gone to private school.  And we had fifteen people in the class, and they took a lot of time with us and I was just advanced.  I wasn't that smart.  I was just advanced over the other students, and she encouraged me.  She let me do everything in the class, 'cause I'd finish before everybody else and so forth.  But I was no smarter than the rest of them.  I was just, had just had a private education and that's, and I was a little advanced over them.  I had had what they were learning, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So, you were a very good student?
Speaker 2: I was a good student and they'd skip me.  I didn't go to the sixth grade.  They sent me on to junior high school [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia] after the next year.  So, my older sister [Victoria Travis Jackson] and I graduated together.
Story_ID: 614791
Speaker 1: What other activities in elementary school?  Were, were you involved in any other activities?
Speaker 2: Just plays and things.  I liked to do a little acting, a little exercise, dancing and stuff like that.  That was what I was more involved in.  Girl Scouts, I--from, from Brownies all the way to senior Girl Scouts, I was in the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America].
Speaker 1: And, and what about church?
Speaker 2: You know, it was never that important in our lives.  My dad [Marcellus Travis, Sr.] and my aunt [Travis Tanner's paternal great-aunt, Hattie Mosley], we went to Big Bethel A.M.E. Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  I guess we, fourth or fifth generation there.  My mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] didn't really care.  She, she wasn't really brought up in the church, so she'd go visit her mother's church.  It was a Baptist church, but my father, they were staunch A.M.E.'s [African Methodist Episcopal], and we were in plays and things at Big Bethel.  And we would do--that's where my aunt, so like our grandmother that raised my dad, but that's where we had four or five generations in the A.M.E. church there, but we were never forced to go to church.
Speaker 1: Is that where the Girl Scout troop was--at the church, or at the school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, at school, at school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and you said you remember the principal at Gray Street School [Atlanta, Georgia]?  Do you remember--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ms. Green [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Ms. Green?
Speaker 2: --was her name.  I sure do, very well.
Speaker 1: As a elementary school child, did you have any dreams or aspirations about what you would be, or what you would become?
Speaker 2: At that time, no--
Speaker 1: No--never?
Speaker 2: --I never, no, I didn't, not at that time.
Speaker 1: What about things that you did alone?  Did you read?  Did you--what were some of the things that you might have done?  Because you had such a big family, did you always do things with your sisters, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes, but I read, I did.  I, I was a reader, I actually enjoyed reading.
Speaker 1: What were some of the, what were some of the things that you liked to read?
Speaker 2: Most of the fiction type things.  And when I got older, it was just the opposite.  (Laughter) I didn't like the fiction as much as I did, but they were--I can't remember the books, but they were fiction.  They were never anything that taught me too much, you know (laughter).  I didn't learn too much from them.
Story_ID: 614792
Speaker 1: So, you go to junior high school in--let me see, what year would that be?
Speaker 2: I went to--it turned into a senior high school, but I went to junior--I think maybe '46 [1946], it was.  Yeah, '46 [1946] or '47 [1947], one of, one of those two that I started to junior high.  And it was only junior high that one year.  They became a high--'cause at that time, Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] was the only black high school there.  Then Howard became a black high school, David T. Howard [David T. Howard Elementary School; David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  And then, of course, a lot of other start adding on--Carver [George Washington Carver High School, Atlanta, Georgia], and all the rest of them, but at that time, it was just the two high schools.  And I went to--went there.
Speaker 1: To--which one?
Speaker 2: I went to Howard--
Speaker 1: Howard--
Speaker 2: David T. Howard High School.  And I was in school with Maynard Jackson, Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], A.D. King [Alfred Daniel Williams King], Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  They were all--A.D. was ahead of us, you know, but he was there, and Martin Luther King was not there.  He had graduated when it was a junior high school and gone on to Washington High School.  He wasn't over there, but his brother was there.
Story_ID: 614793
Speaker 1: Now, before we go on to high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], thinking back to that time, if you were, if I were to ask you about a sound or a sight or a smell that remind you of that time, what would you think about?
Speaker 2: A sound or a sight or a smell--well, the only thing I could probably tell you would be a smell, that with my mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] cooking biscuits and different things in the kitchen would be, you know, the mornings.  I remember that very well.  But, and the radios, and loved to wake up in the morning, hear the birds and bees in Atlanta, GA [Atlanta, Georgia].  I remember the radio being on and those type of things but not really.
Story_ID: 614794
Speaker 1: So you told me, the smell of your mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] cooking biscuits--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (unclear).
Speaker 1: Did she, did she cook breakfast for you every morning?
Speaker 2: No, we had cereal.  Just on the day she was off (laughter), no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then, you said the radio for sound, so what, what sights remind you of that time?
Speaker 2: That time?  I guess, Georgia Tech [Georgia School of Technology; Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] because the football games would be--and we lived at one time close to Georgia Tech.  So, it would probably be the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] and Georgia Tech.  They played every year and the football games would probably be--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 614795
Speaker 1: What about during that time, Sweet Auburn Avenue.  Did you have any--
Speaker 2: You mean, in high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, because our high school was close to Auburn Avenue.  We were on Houston, which you probably call Houston Street [John Wesley Dobbs Avenue] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Houston.
Speaker 2: We were on Houston Street.  And Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], with Martin Luther King's father [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], was the minister there--Daddy King.  And we had our baccalaureate there and everything.  So, we used to go down to Yates and Milton [Yates and Milton Drugstore, Atlanta, Georgia], the drugstore there on Auburn Avenue.  And then, WERD [WERD Radio, Atlanta, Georgia], we had the first black radio station, I guess, I don't know within the country, but probably close to that because we'd go down to the radio station and listen to the music and talk on it sometimes.  They'd let us say what we liked, and so forth and so on.  And then, we had the YMCA down on Butler Street [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia].  We'd all hang out down at the Y and play basketball and stuff, so we were down there.

Speaker 1: So, had you thought, now in high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], and you and your sister [Victoria Travis Jackson] are now in the same grade, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Had you thought anything about college while you were--
Speaker 2: I thought (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your first or second year?
Speaker 2: I thought I couldn't afford it, so I couldn't find a way that I could.  And one of the [U.S.] Air Force recruiters came out.  Most people don't know that I've ever been in the Air Force, but I went into the Air Force right after high school, and got, and I got the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], and I came out.  And after I got married--I met my husband [Theodore Tanner] in the Air Force.  And then, we got married, and I went to college on the G.I. Bill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went after, I, I went a little bit before I got married.  And then, he was at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and I was at Grady [Grady Memorial Hospital School of Nursing] in Atlanta [Georgia], Emory University, and we both dropped out and got married.  He went back in the Air Force.  And I had sta- stationed out here in Denver [Colorado]--he did, and then, we both knew we were going to finish college.  But we didn't know when, but we, we thought the world would end, and we wouldn't be married, so we dropped out and got married 'cause of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, before we, before we, let's, let's take it a little slow.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's just back up just a little bit because I still want to know more about your high school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and preparing for--
Speaker 2: For, for--
Speaker 1: --um-hm, for what you're going to do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you, you thought that you wouldn't be able to afford--
Speaker 2: College.
Speaker 1: --college?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what were your thoughts?  Did any of your sisters or brothers go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have--my youngest sister is a lawyer.  She finished college.  I have one that went for six months, and she dropped out and got married.  So, I think Vi [Violet Travis Ricks] and I are the only two that got degrees but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 614797
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you want to talk about as far as your high school years [at David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia] that were memorable for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I enjoyed high school, but I'll be very honest to tell you I was not a serious student in high school.  I never thought about--I thought about going to--I knew that I wanted to go to college, you know.  But the whole time I was in high school, I worked at the--out where my mother [Blanche Arnold Travis] worked.  I was the elevator operator out at the Biltmore Hotel [Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments, Atlanta, Georgia].  I worked out there.  And then when I got out of high school, I went on into the [U.S.] Air Force three or four months later.  And I, I knew that I could go to college then 'cause I knew I had the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  But I didn't think--I knew that I would go to college, but I never knew when, you know, I wanted to.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any other extracurricular activities in high school?
Speaker 2: I did.  I played basketball.  I was--and my sister [Victoria Travis Jackson] was on the team.  I never was good enough to make the team.  And I was in the Girl Scouts there and I was the treasurer of the Girl Scouts.  So, I was active in student government, that type of thing, I was.  And I was active in my neighborhood.  Atlanta [Georgia] was a different type of city than most cities.  They--in order to get anything, lights fixed in the neighborhood, you had to really go to the mayor and insist on this or that.  And we were very well organized, and we'd get out and walk and put leaflets with the--during elections on the porch, saying who to vote for, and so we were an active neighborhood.  So we--I was active so, because my mother was active, you know, so.
Speaker 1: And, and this was--what, what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Do you remember who the mayor was during that time?
Speaker 2: I sure do, 'cause they named the airport for him.  His name is Hartsfield [William B. Hartsfield], yeah, Hartsfield.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: It, it's named for Maynard [Maynard Jackson] and him now, though--I think, Hartsfield or something, yeah.
Speaker 1: Hartsfield-Jackson [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hartsfield-Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were actively involved in doing something about your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this was in, in the, the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950s], uh-huh.
Story_ID: 614798
Speaker 1: So now, you say that you go into the [U.S.] Air Force a couple of months after high school [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: About three months.
Speaker 1: And where were you--what, what was that like?  Where were you stationed--
Speaker 2: At the, in--
Speaker 1: --and was it what you thought it would be?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't (laughter) what I thought.  I swore, and I said that now, I'll never have another job I can't quit, and you couldn't quit once you--but I enjoyed it.  I can't say that I didn't enjoy it.  I got stationed--first, we went to San Antonio [Texas] for training for three, twelve weeks.  And then, I got stationed in Houston, Texas, and I enjoyed my stay there.  I got out a little bit--no, no, I stayed until August until--'cause I got accepted at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, in the school of nursing [Grady Memorial Hospital School of Nursing].  So I, I, when I got out, I went on there to school.  And my husband, we were engaged by that time, and he went back to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  And we just seemed to be too far apart, and after a year or so, we just got married.  We were engaged and we went on and got married, and dropped out of school, and he got stationed out here in Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 1: And what was your husband's name?
Speaker 2: Ted Tanner, Theodore Tanner.
Story_ID: 614799
Speaker 1: So, once you came out to Denver [Colorado], tell me what began to happen then 'cause now you're out of the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: Out of the Air Force, and had been in school for a while, and came on out here.  We got--I got active because Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was running for president, so I really got active in that.  I had become a Catholic during the time I was in, in the Air Force.  I had gone to Catholic church as a child, but my aunt [Travis Tanner's paternal great-aunt, Hattie Mosley]--they were staunch A.M.E.'s [African Methodist Episcopal], and they said, "Wait until you're eighteen.  Don't do that, you know, it's hard enough being black.  Why do you want to be a Catholic, you know?"  And it was--they just tried to talk me out of it.  And I finally did it on my own and--
Speaker 1: Well, well, tell me, how, how, how did you experience your first, first going to a Catholic church?
Speaker 2: My girlfriend was a Catholic and she--we were in high school together [at David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].  And she attended and she talked and she brought me books.  And I knew the prayers and I knew everything as well as she did because--and then she'd take me with her sometime to finish, you know, to Mass with her.  And I'd finish her book, and tell her what I've learned, and so forth and so on.  And I, I thought the quietness and everything that was really not at the A.M.E. church was loud because it wasn't.  You know, at that time, they were highly sophisticated, but I just enjoyed the Mass, and I just kept on from there and then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 614800
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit before we go further about the [U.S.] Air Force.  You know, you told where you were stationed, but tell me what was the experience like, being a black woman in the Air Force?  And this is 1952.  What is it like?
Speaker 2: Things had changed a lot then.  I guess that's--was--I got in after it was integrated.  It--I guess it was the Army Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces] at one time before the '50s [1950s] from my understanding.  And then, there were separate, but never when I was in there.  So, I didn't feel, you know, if there were any prejudice, I didn't feel it.  I, I--at that, where I stayed, everybody got along with each other and everything.  It wasn't my lifestyle, because I didn't--I, I just didn't want a job that I couldn't quit when I wanted to, you know.  And I felt like, I'm ready to change now that I've done this.  I'm ready to go do something else.  And there was--(laughter) you couldn't do that so.
Speaker 1: Well, what were you doing?  What was your job in the Air Force?
Speaker 2: When I was there, I was a medical assistant and I worked in the medical administration.  I worked for a couple of excellent doctors.  And I was--set up the appointments and do things like that.  And when the patients would come in, we would assign them to a room and so forth and did medical files and all that kind of stuff.  And I, I enjoyed it, and that's what I probably got carried away and decided I was going to go to nursing school, because one, a couple of the nurses worked there with us, you know, and I thought I'm--and the doctors encouraged me to do.  They were young doctors, and they were great to work for, so they encouraged me also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and--
Story_ID: 614801
Speaker 1: Tell me the story about how you and your husband [Theodore Tanner] met.
Speaker 2: Well, I was at a football game on the base.  Our team was playing somebody else.  I was at Ellington Air Force Base [Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, Houston, Texas], and they were playing another team--I guess from Waco [Texas], one of the bases down there.  And he was at the football game, and we were just sitting in the area, the same area we were sitting in.  And, and we just turned around and looked at each other.  And I said to my girlfriend, "Who is that guy?"  And she said, "I don't know."  I said, "He must be new, I haven't seen him."  And 'cause it was a small base, so you run in at the dances and things, you run into people, you know.  And, and then the next time I saw him was in the dentist's office.  I was there, and he had an appointment at the dentist's office, and he looked over and smiled, and I smiled back.  And he said, "Didn't I see you at the football game?"  And I said, "You did."  And we start talking there, and he called me, you know, I told him my number and everything, and he called me, and it started.  But when I got back to the barracks after my dental appointment, I said to my girlfriend, "You know the guy we saw at the football game?" I said, "Yeah," I said, "I'm going to marry him," (laughter) and joking.  I was only--and he swears that I set it up to trap (laughter), you know.  I said, "You're crazy," (laughter), "I was just, I was only kidding," you know, but, anyway, that's how it started, and that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the time, I was going to college at night in Houston [Texas].  I would take courses while I was in the [U.S.] Air Force, and I had classes in town, so I'd come back to the base.  And then, he started taking a couple of classes, so we spent a lot of time together, 'cause we'd have to get the bus to Houston, and then come back.  Texas Southern, TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], I guess it was called where we were taking classes at.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you both decide you can't live without each other and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did.
Speaker 1: --and you marry and settle in Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 2: Settled in Denver, yeah.  He went back into the Air Force 'cause he was at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and I was in Atlanta [Georgia] in college [Grady Memorial Hospital School of Nursing].  And it was just--he'd drive down there sometimes, but we just felt it was just too far apart, so he didn't have a job, so he went back into the Air Force.
Speaker 1: And what did he do in the Air Force?
Speaker 2: He worked in--what would you call it--computer type things, you know.  He worked on the--I've forgotten what kind of machine they called it, but it was feeding something into a computer or something, data entry or something like that, that he was doing.
Speaker 1: What year did you marry?
Speaker 2: We got married in December 30, 1955.
Story_ID: 614802
Speaker 1: So now, once you get married and, and you're settled here in Denver [Colorado], what's next for you?
Speaker 2: When we got married, we first went to Wichita Falls, Texas to train in school.  He went--they sent him to a computer type school there to learn the data entry or something again.  And we--if you were in the top of your class when you graduated, you could pick--the top two people could pick the base they wanted to go that had openings.  And the other guy was ahead of him.  He stayed number one in the class until the last test, and he became number two.  So, they had Lowry Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Kansas, Wichi- Wichita, Kansas [sic.], 'cause we were in Wichita Falls, Texas at the time in school.  And the other guy was from Wichita, Kansas, so he decided he wanted to go home, so we got Denver.  We got lucky and he--we came on to Denver in May of that year of '56 [1956], and been here since then.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do when you got here?
Speaker 2: When I first got to Denver, because of the background that I had in nursing, I knew that I could get a job as a nurse's aide or practical nurse or something.  I went out to Rose Hospital [General Rose Memorial Hospital; Rose Medical Center, Denver, Colorado], and I got a job out there as a nurse's aide in--while my husband [Theodore Tanner] was in the--and I start going to a business college for--and I went to Barnes Business College [Denver, Colorado] for a year.  And then, I took another job at that time with the State of Colorado.  I start working for the Department of Revenue [Colorado Department of Revenue], clerical work there.  And, and by that time, we start having our family.  And my husband, when he got out of the [U.S.] Air Force, we just stayed here.  And he--I, I thought that he wanted to finish his degree first, so I was going to give him the opportunity to do it.  Like most women, we do, and then, he decided he wasn't ready to go back to school then.  So, I waited the next year, and he said, "No, I'm not ready, I got too many other things I'm doing."  So, I said, "Well, I'm going."  So I started back to college.  And then, later on, he came, went on when he saw that I was determined.  So, when I finished my bachelor's [degree], I got a grant scholarship.  I say a grant, to get my master's [degree], and he said this is it, 'cause both his parents had their master's when he--his mother, when he was born, and his dad, you know, got it while--in fact, a picture in there in the den is dad holding him when he got his master's.  So, he, he, his parents, his mother--I guess, was pushing him more than I, I, 'cause after I saw that he didn't want to do it, I didn't keep pushing it, you know.  And he, he stopped at a bachelor's 'cause he was a mailman, a postal worker, and as a postman.  And he liked his job, and he had, he was doing what he wanted to do, you know, so.
Speaker 1: What, what college did you attend?
Speaker 2: Metro State College [Metropolitan State College; Metropolitan State University of Denver].
Speaker 1: And where was that, where is that located?
Speaker 2: Denver, here, in Denver, Colorado.
Speaker 1: And that's where you got your bachelor's in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bachelor's--
Speaker 1: What type of degree did you get?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Political science--
Speaker 1: --political science?
Speaker 2: --and, um-hm, and minor in urban affairs.
Speaker 1: And then, you got a grant to--
Speaker 2: From HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], um-hm, competed for a grant.  And they only took fifteen out of--I didn't think I was going to get it.  It was about three hundred applied for it, and they took fifteen people.  I got lucky.  I got--was one of the fifteen, so I got the grant, and they paid my tuition and so forth.
Speaker 1: Where did you get your master's?
Speaker 2: University of Colorado.  And we were the last class to finish in Boulder [Colorado], but we went to town here to DU [University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado], but we graduated up there, but we went to CU in, in Denver.
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: It was Colorado at Denver.
Speaker 1: What year did you get your, your B.A.?
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976], I got my master's; '74 [1974], my bachelor's.
Story_ID: 614803
Speaker 1: And you began to have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had started.  And I had my first child, we got married in '56 [1956], and two years later, fifty--October '58 [1958], I had the first child.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And when I had my youngest one in '62 [1962].  And when she start kindergarten, that's when I really start going and taking a lot of hours, you know, working and going--
Speaker 1: What are your children's names?
Speaker 2: Terry, Terrence, really, but Terry, we call him Terry [Terrence Tanner (ph.)], Tanbis, T-A-N-B-I-S [Tanbis Tanner].  It's a combination of my name and my husband's, and Tracey, T-R-A-C-E-Y [Tracey Tanner].
Story_ID: 614804
Speaker 1: So now, with these degrees, what were your, your thoughts about what you would do with all of the education that you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I sold real estate part time while I was going to school, and I thought that I might want to do that for a while.  And I went into real estate for a couple of years and decided it was boring.  I didn't like--I'm a people type person.  Although you're working with people, it's not the kind of thing that I wanted to do, so I went back into my own field in public administration.  I worked for the federal government for a while, and then, I left there and went to work for the lieutenant governor of Colora- ran his office, the executive assistant to the lieutenant governor of Colorado.  And George Brown [HistoryMaker George L. Brown], at that time, was the lieutenant governor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and there's a story behind--what, well, we'll see, what year is this?  Let's, let's step back a little bit because in '50 [1950], okay, '55 [1955].  Well, let, let's go back to the federal government job.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me, where did you work in, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I worked for the [U.S.] Department of the Interior, the [U.S.] Bureau of Reclamation for a while, and that's when the computers first came out.  I worked on the computer for them, and we did specs for the engineers and their specifications that they write up, and we put them on the computer.  And then, I went to work for the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  And there was a black lawyer that was in charge of that office, and he asked me to come work for him.  He was in the same building, and I went to work for Mr. Gordon [ph.].  And when they closed the office down and transferred it to Washington, D.C., I chose not to leave Denver [Colorado] and go.  So, I stopped, and that's when I went on and finished my master's [at the University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado] after I did that.
Speaker 1: And you said you worked in real estate?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Which real estate company did you work for?
Speaker 2: I worked for Town and Country [Town and Country Real Estate, Inc.] with Jesse Johnson [ph.].  At the time, he's a civil rights leader out of Topeka, Kansas that had moved here.  And I worked with him, but now I'm, I still have my real estate license and practice a little bit.  And I'm with Coldwell Bankers [Coldwell Banker Real Estate LLC] now, but I was with Town and Country for many years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, give me a little history about George Brown.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What can I tell you about George Brown?  He was the first lieutenant governor, black lieutenant governor in the country.  Merv Dymally [HistoryMaker Mervyn M. Dymally] was second because California's time is an hour behind us.  So, they both got elected the same night (laughter), but it's, but California is an hour behind Colorado, so George was, for an hour, he was the only black lieutenant governor for a while.  But he's--he'd left here and moved, you know.  After he left office, he moved to Washington, D.C., but it was an enjoyable job.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: He went into--let me think about what year did he go into office?  Probably '70 [1970], '70 [1970], did he go in, in '70 [1970]?  He went in, in '74 [1974], I think [sic. 1975], 'cause I went to work for him in '76 [sic. 1978], and I just worked the last two years.  Josie Johnson worked the first two years as his executive assistant, so I think it was '76 [1976] that, but I think he went in, in '74 [1974].
Story_ID: 614805
Speaker 1: Well, we passed a little bit about the civil rights era in the '60s [1960s].  So, you alluded to earlier, to the fact that you worked--Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was getting ready to be elected.  Did you work in any politics at that time?
Speaker 2: I worked, yeah, as a committee woman.  I worked as a volunteer to block work for John Kennedy when he ran in my neighborhood, my precinct.  I did, I started working as a block worker, and then I became committee person.  I went on to become the district captain of the district, you know, and from there, to all kind of national, political.  I went '76 [1976].  Eighty [1980], I went to four or five national conventions and--as a delegate.  And once, I got started in the '60s [1960s] in the Kennedy years, I did stop.  I was--
Speaker 1: Let's go year by year.  But, first, tell me about this block committee.  What, how--
Speaker 2: Block worker (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) block worker, okay, block worker.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you just, you just put literature on porches--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so forth, for your candidate, you know.  Like when I ran, I had my kids [Tracey Tanner, Terrence Tanner (ph.) and Tanbis Tanner] walking with me.  You just stop and talk to the person about your candidate, and tell them what they have to offer and--
Speaker 1: It's like canvassing, like you did for Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] this time.
Speaker 2: Canvassing, sim- for Barack, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then, what was the next position that you--
Speaker 2: I went from block worker to committee woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's kind of in charge of that precinct and, and making sure the literature gets out and everything.  And the party, you know, that they, they need you to do, you do for that precinct.  And then, I went to district captain, and I was in charge of all the precincts at that time.  And then, I went from district captain to chair of the senatorial district, and I chaired that district, and--
Speaker 1: And, and what did that entail?
Speaker 2: Most of the work that had to do with that is when the person that was running for Sen- the Senate [Colorado Senate] in that district, you chair the meetings that the county assembly, you're the one that conduct the meetings and do all--they have to write letters that you send--I intend to run, and then you chair the meetings and so forth, and make sure things that run orderly at the county assembly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Then I became a campaign manager.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who were you the campaign manager for?
Speaker 2: Senator Groff, Regis Groff.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: He ran in '72 [1972], or did he--'70 [1970], '74 [1974], '74 [1974], 'cause he became, he took senator--George Brown [HistoryMaker George L. Brown] was a senator.  He took his seat when he became lieutenant governor, so that was in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --okay, in '74 [1974], okay.  And then, between '74 [1974], in '74 [1974], that's when you finished your master's [at the University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 2: I finished my bachelor's in '74 [1974]--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --master's in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976], okay, okay.  And then, you go to work for George Brown, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I went to work for George, and maybe before I even finished my master's.  But around that time--
Speaker 1: Time--
Speaker 2: --it was, 'cause, yeah, it was around then, 'cause I left, and he left in '78 [1978], so the end of '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 614806
Speaker 1: And so, what was next?
Speaker 2: After that, where did I go to work?  I, I went back to real estate after George Brown [HistoryMaker George L. Brown] left.  And I worked, I worked for Odell--well, I still worked for Jesse Johnson [ph.] at Town and Country [Town and Country Real Estate, Inc.].  And then, I changed to Odell's office, maybe two years after that in the '80s [1980s], yeah.
Speaker 1: When you say Odell--
Speaker 2: Odell Barry--
Speaker 1: Barry--
Speaker 2: He was a Bronco [Denver Broncos], and while he played with the Broncos, he used to hang around our real estate office.  And I talked him into going into real estate, and then when he got out, he became the mayor of Northglenn [Colorado].  And he opened his own real estate office and I went to work for him.
Story_ID: 614807
Speaker 1: You wanted to--we kind of brushed over the civil rights era.
Speaker 2: The era, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we, we tried to go back and then we, we got a little lost, but you wanted to share a story--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about that time.
Speaker 2: I, when I got out of the [U.S.] Air Force, as I told you, I got accepted at Emory University, Grady School of Nursing [Grady Memorial Hospital School of Nursing, Atlanta, Georgia] there.  And when I was there, the civil rights, it just really started with the Rosa Parks and everything.  And the black students and nurses, we had a different dormitory.  And for the least little thing that would happen if you were late coming in, five minutes, anything that would happen and, and you would get suspended and kicked out of school and everything.  It was not happening to the white student nurses.  So, we decided to go on strike there, and we all sit in the auditorium.  And finally, they sent the dean there and she said to us, "If you don't get back in your classes, and get back in that hospital, you're all going to be maids, like your mother--like your mothers."  And, and she never tried to tell us, we're going to try to make it right or anything, and that was really when it got started.  And they, they finally suspended some of the students, you know, that got--they said, they got it started, and so forth and so on.  But that--by that time in '56 [1956], I, in May, I left Atlanta [Georgia], so I wasn't there any longer.  When I got to Denver [Colorado], most people worked for the government, so they all made around the same salaries.  They were teachers.  They worked at the Federal Center [Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado].  So, didn't have much of a civil rights thing going on here 'cause they didn't feel like they needed it, which I didn't agree, but they didn't feel that they needed it here.  So, it was not really--the only thing you could really do is send money.  And then things start getting tough here with gang type stuff, you know.  And that's when people got involved here a lot, but before that, it was not a whole lot.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], I can remember coming here a few times, but not a whole lot of things.  But I had faced so much prejudice as a child, drinking out of the coloreds' fountains, and going up all those steps to the Fox Theatre [Atlanta, Georgia] there that Senator Martha Ezzard was a senator here like I was.  And she and I were back there in Atlanta for the Democratic Convention [1988 Democratic National Convention, Atlanta, Georgia].  And they took us over to the Fox and took pictures.  And she showed how she went in the front door and I had to go up all these stairs, you know, and stuff.  So, it was so many things that I remember--sitting on the back of the bus, and not being able to sit at the counters to eat lunch at the downtown drugstores, at Kress's [S.H. Kress and Co.] and all that, that a lot of things that these people here probably had not faced, you know.  I don't know, but I do know they did have problems in Denver, but nothing like we had probably.  So, I, I--it's a lot of memories back there, a lot of things that happened as a child, you know.
Story_ID: 614808
Speaker 1: Can you think of any other incidences?
Speaker 2: I could remember a, a, a cross being burnt in an Italian family's yard.  I saw the cross burning.  I don't know--didn't know too much what it was about, you know, but I can remember that.  I certainly remember on the buses where you had to get up, and give your seat to somebody, you know, that you couldn't sit there in the seats.  And, as I said, the Fox Theatre [Atlanta, Georgia].  Our families tried to protect us a lot in Atlanta [Georgia].  That's why we had our own bank.  We had our own radio station [WERD Radio, Atlanta, Georgia].  We had our own learn and higher learning institutions, you know, and so forth, so we, they were very protective.  We had a lot of our own stuff.  We had car washes, and we had different things you could--grocery stores that you could go to, because they didn't want you to have to face all of this.  But they were very protective of us--our parents, and things, but it went on, and you knew it, you know, you could see it.
Speaker 1: Well, during this time, too, the black businesses were actually booming.  That's where they were--
Speaker 2: Booming, they were, you're right, absolutely.  That's--and they, that's what I'm saying.  They own, you know, we owned a lot of our own, so you didn't have to patronize others.  You could go, you know, into your own and get things, so we didn't have to.  It was the education center of the South.  Atlanta was--so a little more sophisticated, I guess, than some of the other places were, but I had experience.  I know, I tell my grandkids, I know what it is.  I've seen it, you know, seen Jim Crow in action, but probably not like my parents [Blanche Arnold Travis and Marcellus Travis, Sr.] did and everything, but I did, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a time that you had to get up to let a white person sit in the seat you were sitting in?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?  I mean, how did it make you feel?
Speaker 2: I was a child, and I thought, it's an adult, so I'm just getting up, you know, because it's a person, an adult.  But I did not move back to the back where they tell you when you get up to move to the back.  I stood right there, and held the thing where the bus--while I was standing, you know, but I do remember getting up.  Or the bus driver would come back and ask you to get up.  If you didn't get up, they'd come and ask that, you know, get up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And the books at the school, all of our books were from white high schools, the used books.  I remember Brown [Joseph E. Brown High School, Atlanta, Georgia], O'Keefe [Daniel C. O'Keefe High School, Atlanta, Georgia], all these different--Grady High School [Henry W. Grady High School, Atlanta, Georgia], all these different schools with our books, the name of our books, that the books that we got, they were used.  We very seldom ever saw a brand new book in our school.  So, it was, it was trial and tribulations (laughter), I tell you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Who was the principal of your high school, of Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia], when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Gideons, well, he was--Sullivan [Floyd Sullivan] was the principal when I graduated, but he was the principal most of the time I was there.  And he was scared to death of white people.  Downtown, they, the administration would come to that school and he'd, get out of the halls, he'd scream at us--do this.  And he, he was really afraid of downtown administrators.  They come over there, and maybe he might not have been the only one, but I never forgot that.  I thought, isn't it awful that he has that kind of fear?  But he was the principal most of the time.  Charles Gideons, and then Sullivan came for the year, the last, my last year of high school.
Story_ID: 614809
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assass- assassination, because now, you're, you're Catholic.  And when Kennedy is assassinated, do you remember the time?
Speaker 2: I do, I do remember exactly what I was doing and everything.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: I was moving into a house I'd just bought on November 3rd of 1962, I think it was--
Speaker 1: Sixty-three ['63]--
Speaker 2: Sixty--'63 [1963], but I remember I was moving that day.  And I heard it on the radio, and we were ran to church,  As soon as I got over to the house, I called my husband [Theodore Tanner], and we all ended up in the Catholic church praying that he didn't die, you know.  And then, we heard that he died, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the same type of thing, what were you doing when King was assassinated?
Speaker 2: I was at home when that, I heard that, and, and I was just in total shock.  In fact, I went to work the next day, and had--I worked for the federal government at the time, and had to leave and come home.  I was sick; I was just sick over it.  I just couldn't believe that it had happened 'cause I knew the family, you know.  I knew Christine [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris], the sister.  I knew A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King].  I knew Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], and Mama King [Alberta Williams King] that we all knew.  All the neighborhood knew all of them, you know, so just a shocking thing.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Blanche Arnold Travis], you said was very active in politics as well?
Speaker 2: Not pol- well, well, in the community, um-hm--
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, in, in the civil--community work?
Speaker 2: --community work, she did, yeah.  She--we walked with her, passing out flyers and doing different things when she had the time to do it 'cause she was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 614810
Speaker 1: You leave, 'cause we went back, so I want to go back to where we were.  And I think you had went back into real estate for a little while--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --after working for George Brown [HistoryMaker George L. Brown], right?
Speaker 2: After working for George, I went back into real estate--I sure did.
Speaker 1: And you worked for Odell [Odell Barry] for his real--
Speaker 2: And I still do part time, I still do, yeah, but that's--
Speaker 1: --okay, okay, all right.  So, what, what happens next?
Speaker 2: After I ran--well, I, I didn't really run.  After I was campaign manager for Senator Groff [Regis Groff], even before then, people kept asking me to run for public office.  But my husband was the kind of person that he was a very private person, and he didn't particularly want me to do that.  And I talked it over with him, and he said, "No," that, "I don't think we need anybody, you know, we're, we're private people."  I don't want to be--and then, they kept asking me to run, and he finally said, "Well, you're out there.  You're running everybody else's campaign, you're doing this, you're doing this, so you might as well go on and run."  So, I did.  I decided to get in the race against a twelve year incumbent that had been in office, you know, for twelve years.  And in the meantime, my husband got cancer, and within ninety days, he was dead, so right in the middle of all of this.  So then, on election night, they told me--thought I had won, which I still believe that I did, but they did a recount because they were using different--the primary date was different for the election.  They used these boxes to put the votes in.  They were all taped up.  Somebody had opened one of them, and they went back and did a recount 'cause she thought she should have won--my opponent.
Speaker 1: Who was your opponent?
Speaker 2: Arie Taylor [Arie Parks Taylor], a really fantastic woman that had a few problems, and they wanted her out.  But we, we--it was when they went back and did the recount, they found twenty-one votes difference--that she had won by twenty-one votes.  So, it was in--someone said you should go to court, but I was grieving my husband's death, and I didn't want to do that.  And I'm glad that I didn't because she and I turned out to be pretty good friends later, so I'm glad that I didn't do that.
Speaker 1: And tell me what year this was.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-two [1982] when I ran the first time, and I lost in the primary.  And then I ran in '84 [1984], and I won in the house, for the Colorado House of Representatives.  Arie chose not to run that year; she didn't run.
Speaker 1: So, now tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: It was, it was tough because with my husband being sick, you know, not knowing anything like that would happen during that race.  It was pretty tough, and it was pretty tough running against another black woman that I had respect for.  But she, she ran into a few drinking problems, and she couldn't pay her bills, and all of the--a Republican woman got in the race, and a lot of people said, "If you don't get in, we're going to run--we're going to vote for her."  Well, I don't think she could have won in this district anyway, but she got in the race.  And I talked to my husband, and then they came over here, and we all sit around on this floor talking.  And Ted [Theodore Tanner] said, well, you might as well, you're doing it anyway, so you're out there.  So, I went on and got in the race but--and it kind of divided the community.  It wasn't really--I'm not sure if it was healthy for the community.  It wasn't like Atlanta [Georgia].  You run and you lose or you win, and it's over with, you know, it was still--grudges carried for a while after that.  It, it, it created a few problems.
Story_ID: 614811
Speaker 1: But in 1984, when you ran again, she [Arie Parks Taylor] didn't run and so you--
Speaker 2: She didn't run, no, she decided not to.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: There were some people in the race, but it wasn't her 'cause she wasn't--
Speaker 1: Right.  So, really, what my question was the experience as, as a house representative.  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Now, your husband [Theodore Tanner] died in '82 [1982], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, in '84 [1984] when you ran, I want to know about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I was still grieving.  I, I really wasn't ready to get back into it again, but the community had invested so much in me.  I, I didn't know how to say, "No, I don't want to do this again."  And my first year down there, I was still grieving.  I, I, I thought, what did I do?  This is too much time.  I don't need to do this and I, I think it helped me, though, to work through my grieving stage, so in stages that you have to through, whether you want to or not.  I had to do it.  And, and things became okay 'cause I was in the minority party, so it's tough.  It was--I think, out of the sixty-five people in the house [Colorado House of Representatives], seventeen of us were Democrats, and it was just really tough to get anything passed or anything done at that time.  And after a few years, we, we got more Democrats down there.  I never did serve in the majority party.  Even when I went to the senate [Colorado Senate], I was always in the minority party over there, too, but I got more done.  In the senate, it was only thirty-five, and I was successful in getting on the joint budget committee, and six of us wrote that budget and everything, so I felt like I had more power than I'd ever had in my (laughter) life so.
Speaker 1: Did you pass anything while you were in, in the house?
Speaker 2: I did--I passed quite a bit, few.
Speaker 1: Can you remember, what was most memorable?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the one that you probably have heard about lately is the abandoned baby bill [Colorado Senate Bill 00 - 171].  That was my bill that within seventy-two hours, you can take a baby to the fire station or take it to a hospital, and turn it in without putting it on a--or here, they had put one on the shelf at the store, and laid one in an alley, you know.  And I think, it's saved now in Colorado, twenty-four, twenty-five lives since that bill in 2000--I, I think it was 2000 that I passed that bill.  But marital discrimination, when they were firing women usually if their husband worked at the same place, and was the supervisor and so forth, I passed the bill to make sure because in Denver [Colorado], The Denver Post was one of the, yeah, our newspaper.  Grand Junction [Colorado], sheriff department, you couldn't work and supervise one another.  The--so woman usually ends up leaving, you know and that, so that was another bill that I passed.  Parental responsibility, where you had to take your kid whenever, if they got into trouble, the parents had to go get counseling with them and work with them, and make sure to try--keep them out of the system 'cause once they got in there, they kept going back in there, and back in there.  So we--they would let them stay out if the parent would take responsibility, so that was another one.
Story_ID: 614812
Speaker 1: Some labor laws, I did--I can't remember every, yeah, I'm trying to think of all the--oh, the one of them that [HistoryMaker] Paul Stewart, I helped him.  There's a town here called Dearfield [Colorado].  Did he tell you about it?  Well, anyway, Paul Stewart is our--
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about Dearfield.
Speaker 1: Dearfield is an all-black town during the 1920s.  The guy from Ohio [Oliver Toussaint Jackson] moved here, and he discovered it.  And he--it was just nothing but black people lived there.  And they had dry--what do you call farming where you don't have any water and stuff?  I've--it's another name for it.  But he--they were in, in the dust storm and so--for people moved out.  Kind of a deserted place now, but we were trying to save it.  And I got to a quarter of a million dollars to help do some work, and they still need a lot more money up there to get it done.  But they are doing soil testing and the old buildings, they're buying.  One man just gave them one of his buildings and, hopefully, we'll be able to take tours, and take people up there to see.  I think out this way that was the only all-black town.  So I was able to get a bill passed to help them on some money there.  And on parental leave for adoptive parents, where it's another bill that I passed, where if you had adopted a child, you'd have the same amount of time to bond with that child as a biological parent would have.  And that, that was one of my bills, and there are a lot of others.  I just can't--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, you leave the House of Representative [Colorado House of Representatives] after one term?
Speaker 1: No, I was there nine years.
Speaker 2: Nine years?
Speaker 1: Would you believe, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you accomplished many things.
Story_ID: 614813
Speaker 1: You have to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, after nine years, what happens?
Speaker 1: I--Senator Groff [Regis Groff] got offered a job with the state, and he was my state senator.  I had been his campaign manager, so he left, and I ran for his seat.  And you had to get appointed by committee people and things at that first, and I ran and got appointed.  And then I went on and got elected a year later to that senate seat [in the Colorado Senate] so.
Speaker 2: Now, now, what year was this?
Speaker 1: That was our--when did he leave--try, '93 [1993]--I think it was '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-three [1993], yeah, it would have been nine years after--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, 'cause I was--
Speaker 2: --'cause you got elected in '94 [1994]?
Speaker 1: I was, I got elected in '94 [1994], so I was appointed in '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993]?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, now, state senator.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: For what district was this?
Speaker 1: Thirty-three [Colorado State Senate District 33].
Speaker 2: And tell me some of your accomplishments there.
Speaker 1: Well, the most I accomplished there was getting on the Joint Budget Committee.  I, I, in the house [Colorado House of Representatives], I did hold, I was the caucus chair there.  I was the second black person to hold a leadership position in the house.  But when I got over there, I just wanted to be where I had some power, and could control some funds.  So, I was able to get on the Joint Budget Committee so that was the most successful thing that, that I did while I was over there.  I did a lot of bills over there: prostate cancer bills to make sure that the insurance companies would, 'cause they wouldn't pay for PSAs [prostate specific antigen test] at all.  And some things that I did over there, a diabetic bill, and different bills, but the most successful thing for me was getting on that budget committee, and I was able to do that.
Story_ID: 614814
Speaker 1: And I know that you belong to other outside organizations?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Lots of them, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are some of your, your favorites--I guess I would say (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I won't say (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter), we won't say favorites.
Speaker 2: I'd rather not get myself in trouble but--
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll, I'll rephrase that.
Speaker 2: But I--
Speaker 1: What were some of the--
Speaker 2: --I'll tell you some of them that I belong to (laughter).  I want to say, but I'm a Delta, a Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.  It's a public service sorority and I belong to that.  I belong to a social and civic club called the Regina's Social and Civic Club that will be celebrating our anniversary next year for it will be fifty years old--would you believe next year?  I'm a member of the women's forum, the national and the International Women's Forum, and Colorado women's forum [Women's Forum of Colorado].  And that's a, a group of women that, what would you say--high achievers and, and contribute a lot by being role models for other women, and doing some things on the education level.  But it's, and they have it--I went to Atlanta [Georgia] to one of the dinners there that they had there in Atlanta.  So, they have a chapter there, too, but they're all the country.  And the women's forum, but I am in the Colorado women's forum, and that means I'm in the national and International Women's Forum also.  I think there's something else that you probably--I'm in the Women's Hall of Fame.  I got inducted in the year 2000, into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, 2000 or 2002--2002, I think I went in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when did you pledge Delta?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], the year I finished college [Metropolitan State College; Metropolitan State University of Denver, Denver, Colorado], '74 [1974], '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it's over thirty years, and now, yeah it's '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And besides, I, I'm involved in quite a few--I'm chair of the Colorado Black Round Table here now, which I'm trying to get out of that position to retirement a little bit, but I chair the black round table here and--
Speaker 1: Tell me what the black round table--
Speaker 2: It consists of different organizations and individuals that work on legislation work and educational type things on health issues, on different issues, and address them with the city, state.  We're going to be something, a reapportionment is coming up.  We were working on that, and work on the communication with the police department and different things concerning some of the issues that black people have--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --some of our problems that we try to help solve.  And we--it's a group that meet every month and we--similar to the Hungry Club in Atlanta [Hungry Club Forum, Atlanta, Georgia] where we used to meet at the Y [Butler Street YMCA, Atlanta, Georgia] and do those kind of things.  But I started the--one of the founders of the black round table.  And I'm also in--Colorado Black Women for Political Action is a group that I founded also.  And we're--what, twenty-five years old now, over twenty-five, maybe twenty-seven.  We just had, we have a tribute to black women every year and we also work on different issues in the community, and making sure black women get appointed to boards and commissions.  And sometimes, we support black men, too, but usually women that we work with more.  So, I've been--
Story_ID: 614815
Speaker 1: So, how long did you--how long were you a senator?  From '94 [1994] until--
Speaker 2: Until--I left 2001, in January of 2001, when the new people came in.
Speaker 1: You say the new people (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's what--we're term limited here.  So I, your, your term is up and, and then, new people--there's a new senator that came, and took my seat.  And Penfield Tate [HistoryMaker Penfield W. Tate III] took my seat so.
Speaker 1: And I know that you, you said you were going to retire when it was over (laughter).  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you haven't really retired?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't (laughter).
Speaker 1: What happ- what happened in 2001?
Speaker 2: That I didn't retire?  (Laughter) At the time, I was the national president of the National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women known as NOBEL Women, and I was the second national president.  Senator Diana Bajoie--not Diana Bajoie--she came after me, but Senator Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson], out of California, that was--went on to become an ambassador.  Now, she's a congresswoman.  She was the first president of it, and I took her seat.  So, I started a leadership institute with NOBEL Women, and we have a partnership with Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] at the Eagleton Institute [Eagleton Institute of Politics] called the organization for women [Center for American Women and Politics] in that institute.  And we train black women to run for public office, get appointed to serve on corporate boards, and that type of thing.  And after my--was term limited out, I, I decided that I wanted to see this institute go on.  So, as national president of NOBEL Women at that time, I thought, well, the best way for me to make it to go on is to create myself a job with this organization.  So, Diana's executive assistant had gone on to some other place, so I decided that I'd like to have that position.  So I--Di- Senator Diana Bajoie, out of New Orleans [Louisiana] got elected, and I became the executive assistant to her, and, well, to NOBEL, to the whole orga- executive director of the organization, and I was able to work to make sure the leadership institute continued.  And now, I'm leaving next week for Portland [Oregon].  We do health workshops, you know, up throughout the country and different things.  And we have a national conference every year, but we work on women issues and especially health issues that they have, so pertaining to black women and so forth.  And Senator Margaret Carter, out of Portland, she's the president pro tem [pro tempore] of the senate there [Oregon State Senate].  She's the national president now, so I work for her.  And, and so, I ended up--I thought it would be part time.  It's pretty close to full time 'cause you put in a lot of hours with it.
Story_ID: 614816
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about the different organizations that you are a part of, but now, as a senator [in the Colorado Senate], you were a senator from '94 [1994] to 2001.  And the Joint Budget Committee--
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993] to 2001 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: So I was appointed--
Speaker 1: Appointed--
Speaker 2: --and then I was, and I went, and elected.
Speaker 1: --and then elected in '94 [1994]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were telling me off camera about the Joint Budget Committee, that you don't really have a lot of time to do legislation?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Speak to that a little more.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You don't have a lot of time to do legislation because you spend so many hours working with the budget.  You travel throughout the state.  You listen to different budgets and different departments, and so forth, so you can't carry a lot of legislation when you're on the Joint Budget Committee.  You can carry some, but you just don't have the time to really spend doing all the research that needs to be done, and making sure your legislation get through both houses, and so forth and so on.  So, it wasn't in my, in my, you know, the years in the senate wasn't nearly as much, but there were, there were some significant things that meant things to me, like the abandoned baby bill [Colorado Senate Bill 00 - 171] was during that time.  And so was the money for--when I got on the budget committee for Dearfield [Colorado], a quarter of a million dollars that I was able to do for them and so forth.  So, there was some significant things that were--and then, you co-sponsor, you know, a lot of legislation.  You might not be the prime sponsor, but you can co-sponsor a lot of stuff, and I did that, too, so that was, that, you know, with that I did.  And, and serving in the minority party, if you get two bills through, even if you get one that year, that you, you've done well because it, it's not easy.  The majority party controls everything.  A lot of people had asked me when I go out to schools to speak to the kids, they would say, "Well, how does it feel to be a Catholic, a woman, and black, too?  Don't you have a discrimination?"  I said, "Well, if I have it, I think it's because I'm a Democrat.  I never thought that was," (laughter), "because I was a woman or black or--," I said, "It's always because I serve in the minority party, so I never had a chance to think about the rest of it."  I said, "The first thing, I think, they're saying, 'I'm not going to let that Democrat get that bill through.'"  I said, "But--so you don't get, but you get some through because you have to work across the line."  You have to know how to reach out and work with both parties, so that's the only way you're going to accomplish anything is compromise.  And that's what politics is about, but you have to reach out and work with the other side of the aisle.
Story_ID: 614817
Speaker 1: And so, that's what made you so successful in the different organizations, you know, for, for women, and making sure that they get appointed.  What was, what are some of the things--you talked about a lot of different organizations.  But in the, and, and a lot of them have to do with women and making sure that, you know, they get appointed to boards.  And what are some of the things that, that you had to accomplish to get these things done?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing you have to help women to believe in themselves, to believe that you can accomplish this, and that you can do it.  We always put everybody else before we put ourselves.  We got our children.  We got our husband.  We got the house to take care of.  We got this.  We always have an excuse that we don't have time, and a lot of times, we don't, unless we can get our schedules together and set up priorities and do things.  But the first thing you have to make women think that you, you can do it.  You've done this at home.  You've, you've done these kind of things before.  You just didn't know you were doing it, you know, and get them to think that you can, you can accomplish it.  And you can do it, and you are needed, and this is why you're needed there, you know, because if you're not there, these things are never going to come up 'cause, you know, men, men usually don't bring up some of this stuff, especially when it comes to things like parenting.  And any kind of legislation that they--in fact, they used to tell us all the time, "That's the problem with you women that you don't get on the budget committee, or you don't get a leadership position 'cause you're always talking about families."  Well, shouldn't they be concerned about families, too (laughter)?  Are we the only one?  But they think they talk about the big things, and we talk about the small ones, you know.  So, you have to instill in women that we are capable of doing the same thing, you know.  I think the only difference is that we're more sensitive.  They say, we are more emotional, but I think being more emotional is--women make us more sensitive to these things, so that--but I, I think is really, really important.  I think the most important thing for me, when I walked through that senate door every morning, was to realize how many shoulders I came in on, and how many people are going to be looking at my shoulders to see, can I climb on them, you know?  But you got to do something to make it right, a lot less troublesome for women than it has been before.  And from the Northeast, too, you know, you have, you have to look at those things and see.  And people always say, "Aren't you proud of being the being the first black woman elected to the senate [Colorado State Senate]."  I say, "No, I'm not, I'm honored because they finally opened the door, and let one in."  But of a hundred years, that'll be, have the senate or so it just shows how many have been denied.  It doesn't--I'm not so carried away with just being the first black woman, but what am I going to do with that?  I'm going to make sure that I'm not the last one, that's for sure, so that's, that's some of the things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so--
Story_ID: 614818
Speaker 1: Some of your organizations mentor other women, to--
Speaker 2: They do, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get into legislation?
Speaker 2: In fact, we have a class now.  We have it now (unclear).  We're going to Washington, D.C. in December for our second phase.  We just got back from Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] two weeks ago.  We had four day session there.  We trained black women to run for public office and to seek appointed positions, and on boards and commissions, and to sit on corporate boards and that type of thing.  So we, we do, we certainly do, and--
Speaker 1: Who are some of the other women involved in, in this training?
Speaker 2: In this training?  All of us are legislators throughout the country.  We come out of California, Gwen Moore, former assemblywoman out of California, Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson] was back at the last one; she's a congresswoman now.  [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters was a former member of our organization, and she's out of California also.  But there, there, Senator Margaret Carter, out of Portland [Oregon], is the national president now.  But women from all over the country, Senator Gloria Lawlah [Gloria G. Lawlah], out of Maryland, is with the leadership institute--just a lot of women throughout the country.  Connie Stokes out of Atlanta [Georgia], was one of the first women to help raise funds to get it going.  But when I was president, we put a conference on in Atlanta, and she raised the first fifty thousand dollars to help the institute get going.  So, there are a lot of women throughout the country that have really--a lot of speakers, Donna Brazile, some of the dynamic secretary of states, that I can't think of her name now, but she was one of our speakers, too.  They've, they've just had dynamic women there that really give their time to make sure that we're training black women.  I think we're the only national institute of this type that I know of anyway.
Speaker 1: And where do the women come from?  And I mean, how do they apply?
Speaker 2: They usually apply through a legislator.  They get in contact.  We send applications.  We have a website, and we tell them to go on that to pull an application out, and either they can get one, call us, and we send them one.  But we advertise it and have the legislators to tell some of their interns and different people about it.  And then, we just pick a class of twenty or twenty-five people, and then we go from there.  And that's, and there are places, like I have the Future Black Women Leaders of Colorado here where we also have a training institute [Senator Gloria Tanner Leadership and Training Institute for Future Black Women Leaders of Colorado].  I have a training institute for black women, and this is a little bit different from that because the one thing that we do here to know who to put your hands on when there are certain things going on in this community.  Who do I go to?  Who solves--what's the difference between federal, state, and local government, and that type of thing?  So, the--we, and we don't have a class this year 'cause I had a heart attack, and I couldn't do it, but next year, hopefully, I will start another class again.
Story_ID: 614819
Speaker 1: As far as this year and the national, Democratic National Convention [2008 Democratic National Convention], did you have a role in what was going on here in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: I had the most enjoyable role of (laughter), and that was entertaining the delegates every year.  I wasn't a delegate this year because, as I said, I did have a heart attack in April, so I kind of pulled back a lot, but I did get involved somewhat.  I got involved money wise with some of the campaigns a lot.  And, as far as volunteer time, though, I didn't put a lot, but we did NOBEL Women [National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women] at three or four events during the Democratic Convention here.  So, we, we were very much in the middle of it 'cause a lot of our members were delegates to the convention, so we did quite a few things.
Speaker 1: Were you surprised when the, the, that, that when Denver was able to bring the convention here?  Did you ever think it would happen?
Speaker 2: I didn't think it would happen, but I know [HistoryMaker] Elbra Wedgeworth.  She's a pusher and she was in charge, and she and I are good friends, and I thought if Elbra is behind it, it's going to happen.  And, and I just kind of felt positive about it when I knew that she was a front runner in it, you know, so but I was glad that it, it happened in Denver.  And first African American president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] of this country started right here in Denver was just--that was, that made me real happy, very, very, very, it felt very good.
Story_ID: 614820
Speaker 1: And about Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] run, tell me your thoughts about ever seeing an African American president (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--yeah.  You know, I thought I never would, I never thought my children would, but I thought my grandkids might.  But I never thought my children or I would ever see this happen.  But I think that Obama was the right person.  He's, he's smart, he's, he, he knows how to campaign.  He, he was a good state senator there [Illinois].  He did a good job as a community activist.  He, he, he--at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], he was a top--he's everything that people wanted.  He, he's compassionate.  He's all the things that people have been looking for.  And I think he was the right man for the right time, and I think that we needed him, because we're hated everywhere now.  I think he'll bring all of this--I'm a traveler, and I travel all over the world.  And, and I have never seen things like it is today.  So, I don't even have any interest in traveling because we're hated so in so many places now, but I think things are going to change.  He's inheriting an awful lot, but I think it, it will, I think that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what are your thoughts about him not even finishing his first term in the [U.S.] Senate?
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes when you got a lot going for you, and you're that bright, and you're needed at that place at that time, you can't wait until a later time because it might not be the same thing, so you do it when you have to do it.  And I have no problem with him not finishing his last two years, I think, he has left on his term because I, I think he was at the right time for the right job, and I think he needs to move on.  He's too bright to stay just there and not do anything when he's needed.  And I think he will heal a lot of wounds in this country.  And the, the, the vision and everything else, I think that he will bring that all back together.  I'm, I'm just real pleased that it happened.
Speaker 1: In this, in this time?
Speaker 2: In this time, it's the right time, it's the right time for him.
Story_ID: 614821
Speaker 1: Now, you talked about travel, and where have you traveled to?
Speaker 2: Oh, I've traveled to South Africa.  I have been to Germany, Austria.  I have been to France; I have been to Aruba, all the different islands, I've been to.  I've been to Mexico, Canada.  Where else?  I've been to Africa three times, South Africa, (unclear).
Speaker 1: Have you ever met Nelson Mandela?
Speaker 2: I certainly have--been at the reception with him and everything.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience?
Speaker 2: I've been to Israel.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was, oh, it was touching, very touching.  And when I was back at John F. Kennedy School of Government [Cambridge, Massachusetts] one summer studying, he was in town and we went to a reception there for him at the Kennedy library [John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Boston, Massachusetts].  And he was full of energy, and he was dancing and talking.  And I was just surprised to see how many years he was incarcerated, and his health was so good and he was doing so well, it was--'cause I, the first time I went to South Africa, he was still incarcerated at that time.  And I don't remember what year, but he was still incarcerated.  And then shortly after that, he got out, and but I was really, that, that was the highlight of my life to meet him.  He--really have a lot of admiration for him.
Story_ID: 614822
Speaker 1: Any other special times in your life that you can think of that were very meaningful to you?
Speaker 2: Well, there are a lot of times, like the birth of my children [Tracey Tanner, Terrence Tanner (ph.) and Tanbis Tanner] and different things like that.  But I think Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], as far as public life is concerned.  And, and Mandela [Nelson Mandela], being that, that's another time in my life.  And I, hopefully, I live long enough that there will be some others, too, that we will see a woman elected president of the United States at one time.  I don't know that I will, but I think, you know, that there is--that it's what, what's happening in the world today, I think there's an excellent chance that a woman will be president.  There are leaders all over the world and other countries, so I think that will happen here.  In fact, I thought it would happen before an African American.  I thought, surely, a woman before a minority.  Nobody could have ever made me believe this, but it shows if you live long enough, what you'll see.
Story_ID: 614823
Speaker 1: Well, we--you talked about your children and, and we did mention them earlier when they were born.  But what are your children doing now, and do you have grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have (laughter), I have seven grandkids.  My daughter, her husband had a daughter when they got married, so Latoya [Latoya Phillips (ph.)].  And then, I have six biological grandkids, and my oldest one is twenty-four, and then I have--
Speaker 1: What's his--his or her name?
Speaker 2: Her, her name is Tiffany [Tiffany Tanner (ph.)].  And I'm a great-grandmother 'cause she has Daphne [Daphne Salazar (ph.)], her daughter, so I have a three year old great-granddaughter.  And then, I have Dajir Adams [ph.], he's a college soph- junior in college this year.  And then, his sister, she's thirteen, and they all live in San Jose [California].
Speaker 1: What is her name?
Speaker 2: I get my grandkids' names mixed up--I have so many.  I can't remember her name--her name is Tracey also, Tracey Gloria [ph.], she's named for her aunt and myself.  And I have Terrence [Terrence Phillips (ph.)]--he's a freshman in college this year.  And then, I have Teddy [Teddy Phillips (ph.)].  He's autistic, and he's sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: Six, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, that's all of them.  And my son lives in Denver [Colorado].  He works at the post office [U.S. Postal Service] and Terry [Terrence Tanner (ph.)], and then I have--I told you who they are--Tanbis [Tanbis Tanner] and Tracey [Tracey Tanner] live out in San Jose.
Speaker 1: What does your daughter do for a living?
Speaker 2: Tracey is a technical writer and Tanbis works in sales in one of the stores out there.  But the, Tracey, the youngest one, is the one with the high tech out there, and she's a technical writer.
Story_ID: 614824
Speaker 1: So, what is next for you?
Speaker 2: I probably should tell you, retirement (laughter), but it doesn't seem to be happening.  I think that I'm trying to pull back a little bit.  So, after having a heart attack, I don't seem to have as much energy as I had before, so, but there is nothing in the works that I feel, like I have to do right now.  You know, you've seen things like before the leadership institute [Center for American Women and Politics, New Brunswick, New Jersey], I was just gung ho over making sure these things happened.  Most of the things that I wanted to see happen have happened and hopefully it'll keep growing.  I want to see the growth in these institutions and the round table [Colorado Black Round Table], Colorado Black Women for Political Action, the Future Black Women Leaders of Colorado.  All these groups that I have gotten started, they seem to be doing well.  And I wanted--make sure that continues to happen.  And other than that, that's, that's, that's about it.  I, I have no intentions of ever running for--I have been approached, but I, I--that's out.  At my age, I don't want to do that anymore.  But other than that, that's, that's about it--and enjoy my grandkids really.
Story_ID: 614825
Speaker 1: Well, if you had to speak to women who--and, and you do, but I'd like to know some of the things that you came up against as a senator, some hard things, that you came up against that you--what kind of advice could you give to someone who is looking to be in office?
Speaker 2: I think you just have to keep your eye on the prize, that to know they're going to be a lot of obstacles.  And you make opportunities out of these obstacles and not, there are going to be things when you go--especially when you go into public office that you'll be criticized for.  And you take the constructive criticism, and you deal with it and try to make it better.  And the rest of it, you just let it fall off your shoulders, like, you know, because you can't--if it's not constructive, you can't deal with it that well.  I found that as not only as a minority, but probably as a woman, too, when you talk about issues that people don't want to hear about.  And committee rooms, when you get on a committee down there in the senate [Colorado State Senate], the chairs start turning this way and that way to keep from listening in to what you say and so forth and so on, but you deal with that.  You learn how to keep pushing and making sure--if you think it's right, and it's the right thing to do, never back off.  Stay there.  You might have to compromise, and you will in politics 'cause that's what--politics is compromising, but don't back off.  If you feel it's right, you keep pushing and just hang there until you make sure that it happens.  And I will tell any young woman that, you know, don't look back.  Keep looking forward, and I think you will accomplish what you, what you set out to do.  It can be accomplished.
Story_ID: 614826
Speaker 1: What are your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: There are a lot of concerns, but my main concern, I guess, would be our youth.  I don't see the positive type things that I'd like to see.  Instead of moving forward, I think we've moved a little backwards with our youth.  I, I don't have any problems with fads and things 'cause we went through it as young people, too.  But the way things are going now, they're not just fads that become a lifestyle, and they take it over into their adult lives, and I, I'm really concerned about that.  That would probably be the main thing that I'm concerned because I think you should improve in each generation that--I can remember, and I'm sure that most people my age, younger, some of them that our parents say, you know, I might sweep the floor.  I might drive a cab.  I might do this, but you're not going to do it.  I'm going to make sure of that, you know, and you watch each generation improve upon the other.  But I, I don't quite see that's happening now.  I think Bill Cosby, even Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] when he spoke out and said, you know, I think we need to look at that and see, as individuals, what can we do to change this?  What can we do to make a difference?  If you never run for a public office or any, any, get appointed, or any of those things, if you bring up good quality children, if you've done something that helped people contribute something to this society, and try to make the world better for a next generation, you've done a hell of a job.  So, you know, you don't have to be in public office to make that happen, but you can, you can make it happen.  Each individual within our own homes can make sure that that happened, and I don't see that's happening right now.
Story_ID: 614827
Speaker 1: And what about education?  Where do you see education in the future?
Speaker 2: Where do I see it going?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I, I think that we're still stressing it.  And, and I think we're falling behind in this country, compared to other countries, and especially in high tech and things like that, that we should be--well, even the basic three Rs, you know, we don't seem to be as, as advanced as Japan and some of the other places now.  So, I think we need to find a way to really, really improve the quality of public education and not concentrate that much, like we've been doing on school of choice.  I guess, they got desperate and decided we got to have something.  Differences, public education isn't working, but I'd like to see us put more emphasis, and I don't mean all the time, money, 'cause it isn't money that makes the difference, you know.  It's the type of teacher training and all the other things that you need to make--character training for those students and everything to make sure that they get a good quality education.  You don't have to always throw money.  Money helps, but that's not, but I'd like to see us emphasize more of our resources and not, just as I said, not just financial resources, but resources on public education, than we're doing now, instead of pulling out of public education.  And I don't think that our kids are going to be up to what they need to be in the years to come if we don't do that, because we don't seem to be advancing as fast as some of the other institutions, through--educational institutions--throughout the world.
Story_ID: 614828
Speaker 1: Because this is going to be shown and, and archived for many generations to come, if you had to send a message to the future generation, what message would you like them to hear, say, fifty years from now?
Speaker 2: Fifty years from now?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it could be any time, just for the future generations, what message would you like to send?
Speaker 2: I would say, learn, learn, learn because I think that right now, I guess, even with a college degree, there are no jobs out there--anything.  But I think that once it opens, that if you are ready, you can step right into it, so you learn, learn, learn.  And I think that if you make more money, you have a better quality of life in this country.  So, I think you need to be prepared to step into the job market and everything else if you keep up with what's going on.  And I would just say learn, learn, learn, never stop learning.  I think education is a lifetime process.  It doesn't just stop, even doesn't stop with the doctors, you know, enough.  I go back to school now to just take courses that I'm--religion of the Eastern world or Western world or something.  You just take things that you want to learn, and I think you keep learning.  It's a lifetime process.
Story_ID: 614829
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you want to--well, let me ask you this.  What, what is it that you want to be your, your legacy?  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: If I think about a legacy, I think that I would want it to be that I reached out and tried to help and make this world a little bit better than I found it; that I was willing to share and care about others and to give and to forgive and to work with people to make sure that we all are in this together and, and share our knowledge with each other.  And never, never fear that somebody is going to learn more than I am, going to have more than I have, but always be willing to help and share your education, share your resources, and whatever you can do to help.  So, if I--my legacy is that she really tried to share whatever she had.  And this world is a better place because she lived in this world.  Then I would be very pleased.
Story_ID: 614830
Speaker 1: Now, it's very similar, but how do you want people to remember you?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Such as--I, I, I'm not getting what you're saying.
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  We understand, I understand what your legacy you want to be, but how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, that's--this is what I just said.  I want to be a person, remembered as a person that was willing to give, to share with each other.  That's, that's--if you mean, do I want to be remembered as a public official or something like that?  I, I, I don't have any sire- desire to do that.  I want them to say, she was a good person.  She shared, she cared, and those are the kind of things that I'd like to remember about.  She was a good public servant.  She was a good mother.  She was a good grandmother.  She was a good community activist.  Those are the things that I, I--whether they say, you know, you got this award, or she was in the hall of fame [Colorado Women's Hall of Fame], or this kind of--that's not as important to me as being able to say what, that I did care about my community, and I tried to do what I could to help.  And that's how--now, if that's a legacy, I don't know, but, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 614831
Speaker 1: You were going to tell me about, you know, accomplishments that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you have achieved?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I've achieved a lot of accomplishments, but I guess the one that I, I can think of some of them--really would be the number of black women that have gone into public life that have done things that would help people that have--and like, in my national leadership institute had--I, we had the first class of sixteen.  Out of sixteen, four of them got elected to public office.  One ran for [U.S.] Congress.  One became the assistant to Nancy Pelosi.  And, and that, to me, was quite an accomplishment, you know, to see these women strive and get what they want to and, and keep climbing.  They--that, that would be, I guess, one of the--starting Colorado Black Women for Political Action here in this state was a big accomplishment 'cause we have carved out doing the reapportionment ten years ago.  We have carved out District 17 in Colorado Springs [Colorado] in hopes that an African American would be elected down there, and a couple of them ran.  I guess, we just didn't have a strong enough candidate.  It didn't happen, but at least we got someone that, you know, we wanted, that could represent our concerns out of that area there, which is a staunch conservative area down there.  And Colorado Black Women have gotten so many people appointed to boards and commissions.  We've got them in public office and things, and that's the local one, besides the national one.  When I think about those kind of things, I think that, that, that those would be some of the things that I would say I'm the proudest of that.  It is, it's happened, you know, and I--it wouldn't have happened if we had--nothing ever happens as it just happens usually.  Somebody is there to make it happen.  If you're not sitting at that table to bring about the concerns and make the issues known to others, then it's not going to happen.  That's why I tell women, it's so important to be sitting at that table to make sure.  Sometimes things don't happen because you're there and, and you don't want it to happen.  You might not be able to get something through, but you might be able to kill a few things that you know is bad for your community or something.  So you--and to be aware of what's going on, you know.  Those are, those are some of the accomplishments that I'm the proudest of, I think.
Story_ID: 614832
Speaker 1: When you think back over your life and, and there were some, some obs- obstacles that you can think about that you overcame to get something accomplished.  What would you think about?
Speaker 2: What would I think about?
Speaker 1: What obstacles do you re- recall that you had to overcome to get something accomplished?
Speaker 2: Well, there were a lot of obstacles.  When I started back to college [Metropolitan State College; Metropolitan State University of Denver, Denver, Colorado], there were obstacles.  I had three little kids [Tracey Tanner, Terrence Tanner (ph.) and Tanbis Tanner], and here I'm--I had a full time job, and I was serving on boards and commissions at that time.  I can remember standing in the middle of the floor running the vacuum cleaner, and just turning it off, crying, saying, "I can't do all of this, what am I doing," you know.  And my husband said, "Who asked you to do it?"  And I thought about--did he say that?  And he said--I said, "What did you say, Ted [Theodore Tanner]?"  He said, "Who asked you to do all this?  Why are you doing all this?"  And I thought about, it's because this is something I wanted to do.  And I, I got the strength to go on because I thought he's right.  I'm, I'm the one that's pushing myself like this.  Nobody else is doing--he doesn't care if I do that, or don't do that, or so forth.  So, I could, I had to really get over a lot of obstacles to, order to get to the second step, the third step, you know.  But I took a step at a time, and then I was able to overcome them.  I just, you know, it's, it's a triple whammy when you're black or a woman, Catholic--all the things that I, you know.  It, it, it's, it's, it's a triple whammy.  You're going to run into stuff that you normally wouldn't run in, as I did--used to.  At a party one night, they said, what are you ought--what would you be if you come back to, in here again?  And a lot of them got angry with me, but I said, I'd be a white male Protestant.  They said, why would you want to be a white male Protestant?  I said, then you don't have any problems at all to worry about (laughter).  And some of them didn't like it because I said it, but, and it might not be true.  I'm sure everybody have a few problems they have to worry about, but I just thought, you know, being all of the things that a minority, a female, you know, all the things that I am that--
Story_ID: 614833
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you look back over your life, would you do anything different?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would, I would.  I would have stayed in college before I got married, finished my degree, and then got married, and then worked a couple of years, and started my family.  And that, I think would have made it easier.  I wouldn't have had nearly as many obstacles as I did have, but I thought the world would end without me being married to my husband [Theodore Tanner], and he thought sort of the same thing, too (background noise).  So, that, that would have been different.  Other than that, I, I think probably, I--because you make mistakes, you know, and you, you, you just, you know, you look back, and I probably would have done the same thing, but you learn.  As long as you learn from your mistakes, I think you're fine, you know.
