Story_ID: 11641
Speaker 1: But I'd like to have your parents' names, and if you could--.
Speaker 2: My father's Clark Emory Payne Sr.  My mother was Lois Sikes Payne.  They were born in Georgia, you know, my father in 1910, my mother in 1914.  Now both deceased.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  What do you know about him and his growing up and you know?  Well they grew up initially--well he grew up in the rural south in Georgia.
Speaker 2: Do you know where in Georgia?
Speaker 1: In Milledgeville. A small town sort of near Macon, Georgia.  I had the impression that at least initially my father's father had land.  And they were--although they weren't 'wealthy wealthy', at least they had some resources.  Over the years, before my grandfather died, the land was somehow [laughs] removed from the family.  And my father and his older brother and their families sort of left Georgia in the '30s [1930s] during the Depression, coming North looking for jobs.  He married my mother and they were married for sixty-three years.  My mother married when she was sixteen.  I have twelve brothers and sisters.  Actually thirteen brothers and sisters.  The first born in our family, Clarence, died in infancy.  But the rest of my siblings are all alive and well.
Speaker 2: Did he--was your father a very talkative man?
Speaker 1: Not really.  Quiet strength.  Very, very committed to family.  Very committed to keeping our family together.  Didn't have much formal education.  But, you know, always, you know obviously a lot of common sense.  A lot of sort of wisdom about life and about what it took to keep a family together, and --but didn't talk much.  Didn't talk much about it.
Speaker 2: So he didn't really talk about much about growing up either?
Speaker 1: No.  Not really.
Speaker 2: Now do you know--when he left Milledgeville they came--did they come directly to the North?
Speaker 1: They came to Elizabeth [New Jersey]--.
Speaker 2: --to New Jer--Elizabeth, New Jersey.  And eventually he and his older brother and younger brother settled in, you know, like one house.  And then as they got jobs and, you know, raised their families, they, you know, people branched out.  Got their own properties and--but actually my father never really owned a house, or owned a car [chuckles].  He as--you know, I was born, you know I said I had a lot of brothers and sisters.  And I was born in about the middle.  So my older brothers and sisters who are now in their early sixties and late fifties, early sixties.  They actually had some responsibility for bringing in money when they got in you know [laughs] high school.  And my older brothers owned cars and they sort of in that sense took over some responsibilities in driving people around and things.  My father was very much responsible for setting the moral tone and authority of the family.  For, you know, providing the basic, you know--in--basics of shelter and we--although we didn't have a lot of material things, we never sort of saw ourselves as poor, in that respect.  We were really all very one big family, committed to being a big family and keeping and sharing as a family.  And that was really sort of my father, it was very clear that, that was important to him.  That was his vision and that's what we should do.
Speaker 1: Did your father come from a large family?
Speaker 2: He had three brothers and two sisters.  So it wasn't, it wasn't particularly,  particularly large.  My mother had three sisters and two brothers.
Speaker 1: Now your mother, was she from Milledgeville [Georgia] also?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] General area.
Speaker 1: So they grew up--okay.  Okay so the--did they meet in Milledgeville?.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were met and my oldest--well let me see, my two older brothers and older sister were actually born in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk or anything about her family and growing up?  Or she was another quiet one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, quiet, quiet type [laughs].  She--tremendous maternal instincts.  I mean I think the thing I remember most--my mother just died actually.  Last January, January of this year.  And the pastor, you know, said at the funeral--and the thing that sort of captures my mother's life is she said,  "You know, a great matriarch is gone.  Another great matriarch is gone."  And that was sort of my mother.  She really dedicated her whole life to sort of raising us and the family.  And had a very sort of quiet strength about her.

Speaker 1: Your siblings, can you give me their names and just the order.
Speaker 2: [laughs] Okay.
Speaker 1: [laughs] You don't have to give me any dates.
Speaker 2: Claude is my oldest brother.  Then there's Gladys my oldest sister, and there's Clark Jr., Margaret, Delores,  Amelia, Allie, there's me and then Sharon.  There are two--there's a set of twins, Joan and Joel, Barbara, Debbie.
Speaker 1: So there were more women--more girls.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.  Nine sisters
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Nine sisters.  Oh.
A: And three brothers.
Speaker 1: Three brothers, okay.
Speaker 2: And actually Clarence was the first-born.  He's the one that died in infancy.
Story_ID: 11643
Speaker 1: What are some of your earliest memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest memories of growing up?  Being in, you know, Elizabeth, New Jersey in sort of a--I remember actually riding in a car.  Like my first real memory is riding in a car.  It seemed like there were twenty other people in the car.  But I'm sure that couldn't have been [laughs].  'Cause it wasn't a bus or a van or [laughs].  But riding in a car, going from our--the home where apparently my parents [Clark Emory Payne, Sr. and Lois Sikes Payne] had settled in when they moved from Georgia, to a new house in sort of uptown Elizabeth.  Which  was really an area in central Elizabeth, New Jersey, near the courthouse.  It was definitely a step up for our family, and I sort of remember driving in this car and moving into this new house.  I must have been about five years old at the time.  I remember there always being people around in the house.  And I remember having a lot of friends.  Just people.  A lot of, you know, other children my age, my brothers and sisters, you know.  I had--there were sort of two sets of us.  There were my older brothers and sisters.  Then there was sort of the middle group which--and me.  And so there were always kids around, and I remember that.  There were always children around.  And just always being people around.  Family reunion--family holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas.  Always lots and lots of people.  Another early memory I have is my older sister Gladys.  She was married got--in 1958 and I was the ring bearer [laughs] at her wedding.  And so I remember that.  My younger sister Sharon was a flower girl.  And I remember, you know, dressing up in tuxedo and having to go to the rehearsals.  And having--then going to this reception and having all this food and cake, and those are some of my, you know, some of my earliest memories.  And, you know, was a very, very sort of happy, content childhood.
Speaker 1: Now do you have any like smells and sounds that you associate with growing up?
Speaker 2: Smells and sounds--.  Sounds, laughter.  You know, 'cause again always people around.  Just sort of, you know, having a good time as a family.  Smells, nah not really.  Not in particular.  I've always been sort of a finicky eater.  My mother and my aunts and--always cooked and cooked and cooked [laughs].  But I was never one who sort of enjoyed eating.  I suppose some of my other brothers and sisters would think about the smells from the food.  But that's something I never really tur--that never really turned me on.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any other instances of family life or life, you know, as a young person?
Speaker 2: Any other memories [thinking].  Yep, my other brother, oldest brother Clark.  I remember when he--he must have just graduated from high school.  I'm not sure.  But I remember he bought a car.  It was a big deal.  He bought this pink Ford [laughs].  It was probably about a 1956 Ford.  And I remember how proud he was.  And he bought it from somebody who lived up the street from us.  And I remember that he paid cash for it.  And it couldn't have been any more than two or three hundred.  'Cause, but I remember him counting out the money with my father to make sure they had enough money.  And it seemed like that was like, you know, half of the money in the world [laughs], that they were counting out over the kitchen table.  I remember that.  And how, you know, he came back with the car. I was real sort of proud of that.  And we, you know.  He would take us around, to the parks and things on weekends and things.  I--that was a, I mean you know.  It's amazing how things like that sort of stick in your head.  I also remember my aunts and uncles.  You know, always sort of dropping by the house.  My father was in some ways closer to my mother's brother than he was to his own brothers.  And our Uncle B, that was his nickname.  It was Morris Benjamin.  He was--he and my father were in many ways just sort of the big, great patriarchs of the family.  They were the, you know, the male strengths of the family.  And he would always drop by and talk with my father.  He didn't--he lost--Uncle B lost his brother as a young man.  And so my father was like his older brother to him.  And we were of course were quite close with his children, my first cousins.  And I sort of remember him always stopping around, always joking with us.  And he was, he was really close, close to us.
Story_ID: 11644
Speaker 1: What things were forming in you, you think as a young person?  I mean you are out of a large family.
Speaker 2: And you're in the middle som--are you in the middle?
Speaker 1: Middle.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eighth born.
Speaker 2: Right.  Do you find that--you know, a lot of times they say middle children, you know, can't find their way sort of.  Or they aren't--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You know, of course, you know, [laughs].  I have no insight and I just sort of--and everything I've done in my life has sort of always seemed like the natural and right thing to do at the time.  And there were sort of like two sets of us.  You know there was the--sort of the older kids.  'Cause when I was and, you know, like one of my earliest memories is actually going to my sister's wedding.  So she was up and sort of out of the house when I was really growing up.  I always, you know, I always was good in school.  I had sort of a natural aptitude for science and math.  And although I didn't have the kind of parents who were sort of, "You gotta do good in school. You gotta."  It was something I was always interested in and they would certainly encouraged that.  But apart, you know, I just sort of, you know [laughs].  It was, it just seemed like a natural thing to do.  To do--you know, to be interested in school.  To do well in school and to just have a good time.  Play with my friends.  I liked baseball a lot.  I played a lot of sport--I mean I played baseball. Not a lot of sports, but baseball.  The school I went to, you know, in those days.  You know, you didn't have a whole lot of choice.  You just, you know.  Particularly in a large family with not a lot of financial resources.  So the schools I went to were right in the neighborhood, right around the corner.  Those days--in retrospect I didn't know this, but I was tracked [laughs] into, you know, the classes with the brighter kids in school.  So I actually got the best of what was being offered in public schools in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  And at the time, you know, the school system was really quite good.  And the people who were graduating from, you know, in the  honors sort of track were going, you know, to everywhere, Cal Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], [laughs] MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], and, you know, the public school system was really quite good.  And Elizabeth we had a little unique system in that in high school, it was--it was not coeducation.  The girls had their own high school and the boys [laughs].  So there was Battin High School [Elizabeth, New Jersey] for the girls, Thomas Jefferson High School [Elizabeth, New Jersey] for the boys, and you know, that was it.  Those were the only two public high schools in the city.  So everybody went [laughs] together.  And I guess the wealthier people went to private schools like [The] Pingry [School, Martinsville, New Jersey] but that wasn't part of my world.  The other interesting thing is that in those days, there was still housing segregation and so I remember that the two black physicians in town lived right down the street from me.  Now they--clearly they had more financial resources than we did, but they didn't have a lot of freedom to live in other areas of the city.  So I went to school with their children.  I--you know, they were our doctors.  They were like early on role models for me, so that was, that was helpful.  I've often said, [laughs] this is sort of almost heresy to say.  But you know, one of the--one of the positive things about housing segregation then was that there was this stable black middle--everybody.  The black middle class and upper class worked together and we went to school together.  And I think that was--I think that had implications for the school system.  It had implications for, you know, really having role models in the community, so that was interesting.  But, you know, at the time I wasn't conscious of that.  I was just sort of living my life [laughs].

Speaker 1: Give me your elementary school and your junior--did you go to junior high?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: [unclear] Okay.
Speaker 1: I went to Winfield Scott Elementary School [No. 2, Elizabeth, New Jersey] which was literally like right around the corner from my house.  And I went to Lafayette Junior High School [Marquis de Lafayette School No. 6, Elizabeth, New Jersey], and then Thomas Jefferson High School [Elizabeth, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: I found it interesting that you had--they had a male and female public schools.  I never heard of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was unique.
Speaker 2: Now what's the--what type of--how large was Elizabeth New Jersey?
Speaker 1: It's a city of about 100--120,000.  Manufacturing kind of town, Singers [Singer Sewing Company, Elizabeth, New Jersey] the sewing machine people had a big plant there.  My--a couple of my uncles worked  in Singers.  My father worked there for a while.  Merck Pharmaceutical Company in Rahway [New Jersey] was right down Route 109.  There was even also early on a large Latino community, particularly a Cuban immigrant community.  So, you know, my classmates in school were from really all races and socioeconomic groups.  It was really quite interesting.  So it was a--Elizabeth was an industrial sort of town.  You know, it's adjacent to Newark [New Jersey], the largest city in New Jersey.  And we could get on the train station in Elizabeth and go into midtown Manhattan [New York] here in twenty minutes.  And so, you know, as--and of course, in school, you know, we often had day trips into New York.  And as we got older, we were able  to take advantage of being near New York City [New York].  But by and large, our life [laughs] revolved around a couple of blocks where you lived.
Speaker 2: How large--do you have a sense of how large the black community was out of the 120,000 though?
Speaker 1: No, interesting question.  I'm not sure.  I just know there was a large black community, sometimes it seemed like my whole family [laughs].  But, you know, a large--there was a large black community.  I would guess 30 percent, 40 percent of the city was black.  But I'm not, you know, that would just be a guess.
Speaker 2: But you went to basically an integrated school placement--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Integrated, right.
Story_ID: 11646
Speaker 1: What teachers along the way did you have that you were conscious--people who influenced you, encouraged you?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well I was encouraged.  I think I remember.  Interestingly enough I was talking to one of my sisters about this the other day.  I remember my first grade teacher Mrs. Phillip.  You know, when you're--when you're in elementary school your teachers seem so old [laughs], you know.  And I did--I had this idea that Miss Phillips was like seventy years old.  I'm sure she was only forty [laughs].  But she was--I just sort of remember her as someone who sort of was always encouraging me. Probably my most influential elementary school teacher is my third grade teacher Mrs. Randolph, who was African-American.  And I just remember her being particularly encouraging.  Always that sort of, you know, basically telling me--pushing me, that  you know.  You know, she knew I could do good work and so that was, that was helpful.  It would help my--I had a sense even then, that was helpful to my self-esteem and confidence.  In junior high, that's like a little bit of a blur [laughs].  I can't quite remember.  Except, you know, I, you know, I did well.  Actually that's not true.  There was a very influential teacher I had in junior high in the ninth grade.  It was an African-American man taught algebra.  And I remember the first marking period in algebra.  And we were graded then on a numerical system, with seventy was passing, anything below seventy was failing, up to 100.  And I actually got a hundred, a perfect score in algebra.  And I remember him telling me that, how impressed he was about that, and there was another very bright student in the class, a girl who was white.  And I remember being very conscious of competing against her for grades in algebra.  But my algebra teacher in junior high was very--when he gave me that 100 I sort of said, "Oh  You know, I could really be good at this, [laughs]"  So that was helpful.  That was very, very helpful to me.  High school was interesting.  I had a number of teachers of who were quite influential.  But none more so than my math teacher in geometry teaching tenth grade, Mrs. Schneiderman.  She was a Jewish woman whose son was also in the school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Elizabeth, NJ], Henry Schneiderman.  And Henry was in my view like the brightest kid I'd ever met [laughs].  And he just seemed to be very well read, to know everything.  And--but his mother who was my geometry teacher was always sort of encouraging me to, you know, to read more, to do projects, etcetera.  In the eleventh grade [laughs] Henry Schneiderman actually took his SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] exams and applied to college.  And applied to two colleges, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and [laughs] Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He didn't get to Harvard.  He got into Yale. He actually skipped the twelfth grade.  He went from the eleventh grade to Yale.  And I thought that was like the most [laughs] impressive thing that anybody could ever do.  Now I was very, you know.  I knew his mother well.  And she--and Henry I knew well.  She encouraged me to visit Henry.  And so like early in my senior year, I went up to Yale to visit Henry.  And he encouraged me.  And that was a big reason why I actually ended up going to Yale as an undergraduate.
Story_ID: 11647
Speaker 1: My chemistry teacher in the eleventh grade in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Elizabeth, New Jersey], Mr. Thompson was very influential.  He pushed me--actually got me to apply to a National Science Foundation program in biochemistry.  Which was taught in a private boarding school in Hartford, Connecticut called the Loomis Chaffee School [Windsor, Connecticut].  It was staffed by faculty at Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts].  And it was for bright high school science students who wanted, you know--who were interested in science.  And so I was encouraged by my--Mr. Thompson who was white, to apply to this program.  I got in and I went up to Loomis Chaffee.  I remember my father [Clark Emory Payne, Sr.], you know, and just--he--being so, so proud that I, I, actually did that. So we went up the summer of my junior year.  And I spent six weeks and it was very intense.  Really we were taught college level like biochemistry.  And there were maybe twenty-five, thirty other kids from around the country.  And I remember thinking then, "You know, I really can compete with these kids," you know, I was sort of interested in medicine even at that time.  And sort of starting to wonder, you know, "Well, you know, could somebody like me go to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] [laughs] like Henry [Schneiderman] with," you know, "with no resources?"  You know, and my financial resources--was that even possible-- would I get in college?  I was convinced that intellectually I could do it, having finished that program in biochemistry.  I was actually even invited to come back as a tutor in my senior year.  So I sort of viewed that program as a, as a important program.  That  was also happening in a very interesting time, that was the summer of '68 [1968] and the summer of '69 [1969], you know.  One--so [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had been assassinated in April [1968] and actually Robert Kennedy in May.  So there was a lot of sort of poli--I was the only black, [laughs] black student in that summer program.  The kids--we didn't talk much about politics and race.  But I felt very conscious of the fact that I was the only black student there, felt a little pressure with that.  The other interesting thing about that era was, that was the era of the [The] Apollo [Program] missions [1963-1972] at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], you know.  And being somewhat interested in science, I was very fascinated by that.  And actually, the next year in '69 [1969] when they actually landed on the moon, I was in Hartford [Connecticut].  We--I remember staying up with all of, you know, the students in the program.  And, you know, witnessing the moon landing and things, 'cause that happened during the summer  in '69 [1969].  And, you know, it was all of those things, particularly the science program and the NASA stuff and being at a National Science Foundation program sort of convinced me that I could actually have a career in science and medicine.  It wasn't something that was that was far out for me.  But it was difficult in the sense that I've always fe--I've--that was the first time, unlike in high school, I was sort of feeling the pressure to perform [laughs] because I was sort of--almost felt like I was representing my race, 'cause I literally was the only black person around.  But I think, you know, I handled myself.  The kids that were in the program with--some of whom I still stay in touch with today, were all interested in going to medical school and going--you know, were applying to schools like MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale.  I remember one girl in the program who had gotten this [Danforth] Westinghouse Award here in New York City [New York].  And was like the most brilliant mathematician I'd ever, ever met.  So those were heady times, very exciting times.  I, you know, I would--during those summers I felt like, you know, there wasn't anything I really couldn't do if I really put my mind to it.  And every--the environment was very encouraging.
Story_ID: 11648
Speaker 1: But I wanna go back.  Because you said earlier that you knew you had a facility for math and science.  Is that always the case, people have it in math and science or English [laughs]. You know, but--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean--but did you have a facility for both and when did you become familiar with it?
Speaker 2: I don't--you know, I really don't have a sort of conscious feeling, it's, just that it's something I always was able to do reasonably well.  I remember wanting to get a chemistry set when I was in elementary school for Chris--as a Christmas present.  And my brothers and sisters would laugh at me.  I guess they were calling me a nerd [laughs], and I didn't realize it.  But it was just something I always sort of liked to do or thought about, you know, how things worked and isn't it neat to sort of figure out things.  So--but I can't tell you when I actually sort of knew I had that facility.  Except I guess the first conscious recognition was in junior high school [Marquis de Lafayette School No. 6, Elizabeth, New Jersey].  When I was able to get like--to me getting a perfect grade on my report card--like [laughs] the best thing that could happen to me.
Speaker 1: That was Mr. Thompson?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No that was--you know, I-it's sort of interesting.  I cannot remember his name.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Okay.
Speaker 2: I see his face as clearly as yours.  But I cannot remember his name.  Mr. Thompson was my eleventh grade chemistry teacher who referred me to this [National Science Foundation Young Scholars] program in biochemistry at the Loomis Chaffee School [Windsor, Connecticut].  I also thought it was ironic sort of being in this school.  I was told that, you know, the Rockefellers and you know, people of that social class had sort of built this private school and here, you know, [laughs] and here, Rich Payne, you know is actually there.  In fact the science center that we were in for this summer program, the Clark Science Center at that school was bigger than my whole high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Elizabeth, New Jersey].  Well, it was really kind of an amazing experience, and so, you know, I, I've been fortunate though, and I did have nurturing, nurturing teachers, and sort of an educational environment.  And you know, there was no other option except to go to a local public school.  Fortunately for me at that time, the local public schools, you could get a good education if you tried.
Story_ID: 11649
Speaker 1: What kind of person were you as a young person?  Did you dream about being--or becoming anything?  And I'm talking about, you know, early in your life?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I--although I deeply respected my father [Clark Emory Payne Sr.] and my uncles, I knew [laughs] that I wanted to be a professional of some type.  I knew I didn't want to work as a laborer.  You know and I almost feel badly saying that 'cause it, you know, in some ways it sort of almost comes across like I'm being disrespectful but it wasn't that.  I just sort of knew that I wanted to be a professional.
Story_ID: 11650
Speaker 1: I remember saying that I wanted to be a professional of some type.  I thought that being a doctor was a cool thing.  I had this role model of these doctors who lived just up the street from me.  And I remember one day saying, "Boy"--I had no idea what my father [Clark Emory Payne, Sr.] made.  But I'm sure it wasn't more than $10,000 a year.  This is in the--and I was saying like, "Oh if I could just make $80,000." For some reason $80,000 stuck in my mind, and this was like when I was in junior high, high school.  "If I could just make $80,000 I'd be like, like the, the--my life would be a success" [laughs].  And I don't know, I just always sort of had those thoughts and I always, you know, and it was--I guess I was very fortunate, in that I was always in an environment that sort of supported and nurtured me, you know, to keep pushing.
Speaker 2: But this was really the school environment.  It wasn't necessarily the home environment.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 2: But the home did not discourage--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] It certainly didn't discourage.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And it took pride in what you did.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I do remember in 1967, the church that we belonged to moved.  Built--there was this big building fund in the church for several years.  And the church actually--there was this new church built, which would again move from this--about a half a mile from my house to literally like three blocks from my house.  And this church, the new building had this educational wing.  And there were classrooms there, which were to teach Sunday school and I guess Bible classes and things.  But I remember my mother [Lois Sikes Payne] and father helping arrange [laughs] with the pastor of my church for me to go to this church to study at night.  'Cause it was, you know--it's kind of noisy and busy in my house.  And we obviously didn't have no room or a desk to study.  And that worked out, 'cause the pastor would let me go to the church and work in this classroom, quiet classroom.  And I remember that as--that being very important to my mother and father that the church be able to help me in that way.  So my home environment--there wasn't anyone--I didn't have any role model at home.  I was the first one to go to college.  Although I always say that my oldest sister [Gladys] [laughs] was probably the brightest person in my sib--of my siblings, and had she been born you know, when I was born, she would have surely gone to college.  Now everyone after me with the exception of my youngest--my baby sister [Debbie] has gone to college, went to college.  So yeah the home--there were no role models per se at home.  You know, people who had been to college and had had academic achievements.  But it certainly wasn't discouraging.
Speaker 2: Now but what type of person were you?  Were you a quiet sort of introspective person?  Did you daydream a lot?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] [laughs].
Speaker 2: Or were you, you know?  I assume you were well mannered.  But--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm just saying what--.
Speaker 1: I was definitely more of an introverted than an extroverted type.  I don't know if I daydreamed a lot.  But I certainly--yeah I thought a lot about what I would want to do with my life.  But yeah I was--I think if you ask my friends and my siblings they'd say I--they would describe me as a quiet introvert.  I think that would be accurate.
Speaker 2: So while you were quiet what was happening up in that noggin of yours?
Speaker 1: Thinking about, you know, how--what I would, you know.  Well in high school, I wanted to do well, and I wanted to get into a good college.  And I just had a sense that a way would be made, you know, even if I could get--if I could get into a Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] even though there's no way my father could have paid for that, but some how, someway would be made for me to go.  So I was a little naïve actually [laughs] in retrospect.  Although it did happen, you know, I got scholarship and da-da-da and the church helped.  Yeah, I was just sort of always thinking about in that way.  In that respect, you know, sort of what the next step in my life was, and how I could be successful.  And that I did have this sense that I wanted to be a professional of some type, and even early on in high school that I wanted to go into medicine.
Speaker 2: Now what--did you have a favorite math course that you took?  I was wondering if-- did and why?
Speaker 1: --Algebra.  And algebra was and chemistry were my favorite courses, and because there was sort of an orderliness to 'em, and I did well.  You know, you tend to like things that you can do.  Oh and I was a reasonably good writer and I did well in English.  I hated history.  It's sort of interesting, now I find that I tend to do a lot of reading in nonfiction in history.  I sort of like it, but back in high school and in college, I didn't like history.  I just, you know, I thought it was sort of a lot of facts that didn't really relate to much, and but the science and math were the more exciting.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  So you were good in English too.  A lot of people they don't have that--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah.  I didn't like--I just didn't--intellectually it didn't excite me much.
Story_ID: 11651
Speaker 1: Henry was an icon figure in many ways.  Right?
Speaker 2: Henry Schneiderman.
Speaker 1: Right, Henry Schneiderman was an icon.  Did you have a rel--I couldn't tell if you had a relationship with Henry.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah we did.  We were friends.  We were friends.  And I considered him an intellectual superior [laughs], but he chall--you know, it was a challenge trying to sort of stay up with him.  I actually just saw him for the first time in about twenty-five years, about two months ago.  It turned out that his daugh--son and my daughter attended the summer program for high school students at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And we just happened [laughs] to be walking on the old campus at Yale, and I ran into him.  Yes, he was, he was yeah, he was a cha--an icon for me, a challenge, but I think in a good way.  He was also somebody we--you know, I could talk, you know, we went out together.  Went to the movies sometimes in high school, but I was always a bit intimidated 'cause I saw him as intellectually superior.
Speaker 1: Now did he--what is he doing now?
Speaker 2: He is in--he's a physician.  He--and a geriatrician actually.  He works in Connecticut and is on the faculty of University of Connecticut School of Medicine [Farmington, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Now did you--because he--did you get exposure through the Jewish community, sort of--the Jewish community--?  Did any of that come into play?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Not, not really.
Speaker 1: [unclear].  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Henry happened to be Jewish.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But not really.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so now when you--when it's time for you--so that--you went away [to the National Science Foundation program at the Loomis Chaffee School, Windsor, Connecticut], you say you--it was the beginning of your junior year.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] In the summer of my junior year.
Speaker 1: In the summer.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Just--it was only the summer.
Speaker 1: Going into--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you come back, that experience has changed you in a lot of ways right?
Speaker 2: 'Cause it's been--you said you felt pressured, but you made it through successfully.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  So are you--at this point--and that's the year Henry goes--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] That's the year Henry goes--.
Speaker 2: Off to Yale.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you come off this program, Henry goes off to Yale, you wanna go there also.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so you have--you have this more of a fire in your belly.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Than what you had before.
Speaker 1: And also if I had any doubts that I could compete with students like him, [laughs] I don't know, they were less-lessened in my mind, because I was, you know, in the same environment with a lot of very bright kids.  And I did well enough that I was invited back as an advanced student the following summer.  Yeah, I definitely came back right, with a fire in my belly, with a sense that, you know, "This is what I wanna do and I wanna go for it."  I remember although I loved to play baseball, and I was on the varsity baseball team, I actually remember dropping out of the baseball team the next year to just make sure that they focused more on academic stuff.  And yeah, I was--I would also describe myself as driven.  I was, you know, really focused on getting into the best college I could get into.  I didn't have any preconceived notions that that would be Yale or in--but I was actually looking at an Ivy League school or MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], that was Ivy League school or MIT, that's where I wanted to go.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And did you--in this whole thing did people ever refer to you as a nerd?  Or was there any of that being--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Not--No.
Speaker 2: Was there any concern--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Not--.
Speaker 2: On the part of your parents, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: "He's too driven." Or--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] No.
Speaker 2: Okay, balance.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  They all just took pride.  Okay.
Story_ID: 11652
Speaker 1: How many schools do you apply to?
Speaker 2: I applied to probably seven or eight.
Speaker 1: And is Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] your first choice because of it's where Henry [Schneiderman, a friend from high school] went?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I got into Yale.  I got wait-listed at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], into Rutgers [University, Newark, New Jersey] and I got wait-listed at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey]. Where else?  Where else?--I didn't get into MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and--but I got into my first choice, so, [laughs] you know it's funny.  I was--so yes, so that's what happened.  I don't--I didn't apply to that many schools.  I didn't apply to any of the historically black schools.  I was just not interested and didn't know anybody who went to them.  So, you know, I really had nobody encouraging me to go to one.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Did you find--okay.  So then you--had you--did you visit the campus as part of the application process?  Or did you go there as--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] You mean to Yale?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well Henry had invited me to Yale.  And since New Haven is relatively close [to his hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey], I just--one weekend I went up on the train and, you know, it was a lot of--you know, it was very exciting.  Here I was a high school person--student, you know, going to a college environment, so that in and of itself was exciting.  But, you know, having sort of, you know, my friend sort of show me around and I didn't meet--I don't remember--I actually interviewed at the time I was there.  So I went up for the interview and to visit the campus and I was very impressed and so yeah that's how it happened.
Speaker 1: So when you got to Yale, how--what was that whole experience like? Because--and I say that because, you know, you have been--even though you were away for that summer program, you had been in this small community--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: You know, ever since--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right, right.
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering how this--.
Speaker 2: --And this yes--it's very interesting.  This was--so I entered Yale as a freshman in '69 [1969].  Okay.  This is like, you know, the Vietnam War is raging, you know, the Black Panther movement--in fact, you know, Bobby Seale's trial was in New Haven [Connecticut].  And our freshman year on campus there, our final exams in my freshman year were cancelled because of the campus disruption in the spring of '70 [1970], the Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] shootings.  That was a very [laughs] interesting time, when I got to Yale, I was, you know, excited.  I did request a single room and I was given a single room 'cause I had never been able, you know, to have my own room and this and that.  So I got a single room, because of, you know--this was the late '60s [1960s] right, Black Power, the King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination occurred [1968], all the Panther stuff.  All the black students at Yale were, you know, quite political.  We had our own--there was the Black Student Alliance at Yale.  So there was, in fact, a lot of pressure for the black students to eat together, to socialize together, which I didn't have a problem with, but I sometimes felt that there was a tendency to, you know, to be excluded in a sense from what was going on in the larger body.  But my freshman year was such an unusual time because of the political fervor and the Kent State issue.  The other thing about Yale at that time was the class of '69 [1969] was the first class of women admitted to Yale.  And my wife [Terri Payne] was admit--my [laughs] future wife was admitted in that class.  So there were women on the campus.  And, you know, it was a [laughs] really, really interesting time.
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that that.  So Yale was all male?
Speaker 2: Yale was all male until--?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] But your assistant--.
Speaker 2: I think in '60 [1960] well--.
Speaker 1: It wasn't like Harvard-Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, now Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study-Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No it wasn't like Harvard-Radcliff and I don't know what the sister school would have been.  But '68 [1968] I think they had taken transfers from--and a lot of women from Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and [Mount] Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts] and Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] had I think transferred into Yale, so there were women.  But the class of '69 [1969] was the first class where they admitted women before you know, and we called them the class of the superwomen.  'Cause, you know, these were obviously women who could have quite [laughs] gone to any school in the country.  Very, very accomplished women, and actually my--as I said my future wife was included in that class.
Story_ID: 11653
Speaker 1: I was very focused, very driven.  I was pre-med, majored in biophysics and biochemistry.  There were--and which was sort of the major to be in if you were pre-med [laughs].  It was intense, competitive and, in fact, I remember--and my wife [Terri Payne] will tell you this.  The first time that we actually met was at my freshman year.  And she tells this story about my having all these books in my hand going up to Sterling [Memorial] Library with all these books [laughs], and she,--you know, it was like on a Friday night or something [laughs].  But yeah, I was--I was--I was--you know, my whole thing at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] was that I wanted to get into medical school.  And you know, I wanted to get into the best medical school [laughs] I could get into.  And so I had a good time in college.  It was definitely a tremendous professional and personal growth.  But I was very, very focused.
Speaker 2: Now what were some of the things that lead to that?  You know, professionally focused, you know, during college?  'Cause a lot of what I consider appropriate in processing [unclear]?  So I'm just wondering , you know, how--what things you were learning and being exposed to at that point?
Speaker 1: Well learning that there was a big world.  That there were people with all sorts of backgrounds and views and, of course, the political situation sort of tended to polarize people, you know, that was still really the '60s [1960s], right.?  So you had the very liberal sort of pro-drug, antiwar people, and at a place like Yale, there was, of course, a very old elite money class, very politically conservative.  And it was in--I could have--never sort of heard any sort of systematic kind of discussion, that political perspective.  I found that interesting [chuckles] actually that people sort of had these very conservative, political views.  I thought it was, they held those views because it was bad.  And that I could never hold those views, because, you know, it was sort of irrelevant to the kind of--you know, my own personal experience.  Nonetheless I thought it was interesting that there were these people around, you know, that it was a whole--and again, the '60s [1960s], there was this whole issue about, you know, liberating lifestyles, gay students, you know.  It was not something that--I'm sure there were gay students that went to high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Elizabeth, New Jersey] but I had no idea what a whole gay lifestyle was like.  So it was--I just found, I just found college to be a very liberating experience in that respect.  And I--just fascinating--I just, you know--there was just sort of like now the whole world is open to me literally.  But nonetheless, [laughs] I felt like I had one job to accomplish, and that was to get into medical school.  So I was focused like a laser beam, you know.  You know, I had all my strategy mapped out.  You know, what courses I was gonna take freshman year, sophomore year, junior year, senior year.  And my whole--the life at Yale was sort of planned around that major thing.
Speaker 2: Now did you--were there any teachers or experiences that either made you know that your decision was right?  Or maybe even prodded you a little so--I don't [unclear].  You know, we--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 2: --have our challenges.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean was there--.
Speaker 1: Not really.  I found some of the courses and classes sometimes, you know, particularly in the physical chemistries very difficult.  But never, never--I never got discouraged.  Never had the sense that this isn't something that I couldn't do at that medicine or biological sciences, and there were enough other students from my background and my friends white, black, many black who were going through the same thing with me.  We were a good peer support group, and, you know, I just sort of had my plan mapped out.
Story_ID: 11654
Speaker 1: How many blacks were in  the pre-med program with you [at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: [Sigh] I'd say about fifteen or twenty, some you're probably gonna be interviewing.  [Dr. Benjamin] Ben [S.] Carson was in my class [laughs].  Who else that was black.  [David] Dave Nichols, who--I don't know where David is.  Probably Ben is the most famous person, he was in my class.  There were--you know, when we--there were I would say about ten or fifteen people, and although, you know, I knew students who were in other majors and things.  Carol Storey-Johnson who is now dean of the curriculum here at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].  So, you know, we had our own peer support group and got through it.
Speaker 1: And this is a time too that the schools are opening up and there are more black students period.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay [unclear].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] That's right.
Story_ID: 11655
Speaker 1: Now were you a part of any of the secret societies?  Or was that--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yep [chuckles].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just--okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: [laughs] Yep, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] was known for its secret societies.  Yeah, yeah.  I was in Book and Snake.
Speaker 2: You were!  I thought black people didn't--I asked that question.  I didn't know black people got in those societies.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was--.
Speaker 2: [laughs].
Speaker 1: Well I think Book and Snake was one of the more quote liberal.  And, you know, you get in by being asked--tapped in by upper classmen, and I was tapped in.  And actually one of my fellow classmates was Henry Louis Gates who is now of course, quite famous [laughs].  And Terri, my future wife was in that, and Carol Storey-Johnson, so there were, were about five or six black upper-class seniors in that--in this society, and it was great.  And we had a very good--it was a good mechanism--institution to help us really get to know people in more depth.  I'm--actually now that I've settled back into New York [New York], I'm going to be sort of supporting from an alumni perspective, to the Book and Snake society.  'Cause I think it is important to maintain sort of a lineage of African-American students who can, you know, experience the same secretive--secret senior society, whatever you want to call it.
Speaker 2: Dr. Payne for those who don't know what those societies are all about, can you talk about it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it sounds like, you know.  I mean I--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 2: [laughs].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, so these--You've been on the campus at Yale--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I've never been to Yale--I mean I've been there.  I never got accepted to Yale.  But--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] [laughs].
Speaker 2: That's where I really wanted to go and that's a whole--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] [laughs].
Speaker 2: --'nother story.  But.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously laughs] Well there were buildings on campus that had no windows.  They were like mausoleums, and actually Book and Snake was literally across the hall--across the street from the cemetery.  And the idea is that you are supposed to form a close bond with fifteen or twenty other members of your class.  And the way it works is that you have a formal dinner once a week.  And this--at this building, but that you, you know, you're certainly encouraged--and we all ate, you know, informally, socialized together.  And after--but after the formal dinner, we each had to give a biography of our lives to the group.  And it was--it was a little [pause]. It was--that was not the easiest thing to do 'cause you did have to open up to your classmates.  And I remember, for example, one of my classmates in the society, Matthew Coles, telling us that he was gay.  And now Matthew is actually quite a famous lawyer in San Francisco [California] with the gay liberation--Gay Men's Health Crisis in San Francisco.  But I remember having this very intense discussion about what it was like to be gay even in this so-called [chuckles] liberated, you know, Yale environment in the '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  So we had these dinners, where we'd sit around and we'd open up our lives and talk about--there were--one of the--my classmates was Sheila Ford--Sheila Firestone Ford [chuckles].  And Sheila had some interesting stories, perspectives on life.
Story_ID: 11656
Speaker 1: Sheila [Firestone Ford] for example in her bio that shared with us [the Book and Snake secret society for seniors at Yale, in which each member had to share a detailed life story with the others]--that she was sitting in this campus [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] lot meeting, and, you know, the [Black] Panthers were, you know, going on about how, you know, all the inequities in society.  And how the rich elite had to pay for the  consequences of keeping the poor, poor, and how one day all the Rockefellers and the Fords are [laughs] gonna be killed.  And this and that and how--you know her whole perspective sitting there.  You know, to me sitting there hearing that, it was sort of interesting political rhetoric, but, you know, it was, it was sort of interesting hearing her perspective.  But that--seniors--so the secret society [Book and Snake] really--but they're not these things where you have these satanic rituals, which [laughs] most people happen to think of them.  They were really a way to get to know in a more close relationship, in an intimate way some of your classmates.  And we'd also have an opportunity at these dinners, you know, each society, which is supported by the alumni, has a che--cook, you know and the refrigerator is stocked.  You'd go there and study and there was television and stereo and all that and you go there and just cool out.  But at our formal dinners we could--we also had the opportunity to invite major university figures.  We had Jimmy Brewster [Kingman Brewster, Jr.] there at the dinner.  He was at the time president of Yale.  And Les Aspen I remember, who came a congressman and for--Yale graduate.  And we'd actually sit down in a room, you know, with these people and talk about issues.  So it was a--it was a great experience.  And for me personally, it really, you know, really solidified my relationship with my wife [Terri Payne].  So we were really sort of famous in that sense, in that we were known in some--as a couple that got together at senior year, and we married as a result.
Speaker 2: So was she in this society [unclear]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So wait, you're saying out of fifteen or twenty--.
Speaker 1: Out of fifteen or twenty there were seven--let me see--let me count [laughs].  Me, Terri, Carol Storey-Johnson, Ray [unclear], Skip Gates [Henry Louis Gates], so it's five, five.  Five out of fifteen, twenty, maybe thirty.  It seems that those students--I mean there were probably less African-American students there, but there could have been more.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you think that you learned some things that other people didn't, you know?  Is it important networking?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It is an important networking opportunity, and particularly if you get into that stuff, because you can develop relationships with alumni through the support and the [unclear].  For example, our alumni, sort of chapter is based here in New York City [New York], close ties to a lot of the Wall Street and financial people here in the city.  So, I never sort of chose to go that route.  But, you know, I got to know Skip Gates [Henry Louis Gates, Jr.] very well because we were in the society together.  And have kept up, you know, a relationship, not a real close relationship with him, but a relationship with him over the years.  Yeah, so it's just a tremendous opportunity.  It's not like a fraternity in that sense.  In that it's not at least overtly like such a social, you know, partying kind of thing.  But it is a way to get to know a slice of your classmates in a more--much more intimately.
Story_ID: 11657
Speaker 1: You and your wife really come together.  And now your wife, her name?
Speaker 2: Terri.
Speaker 1: Terri, okay.  She's also pre-med?
Speaker 2: No [laughs].
Speaker 1: No she wasn't.  Okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Nope.  Nope.  She was a psychology major and was not pre-med, not--.  Although, you know, she--psychology I guess is sort of a science.  She doesn't really--she's isn't really into science or considers herself a scientist.  She's a much more humanities kind of outgoing, social person than I back--well say--opposite to her [laughs].
Speaker 1: [laughs] Okay.  Now was she from--where was she from?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Virginia.  Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Graduated from a segregated high school in Norfolk, Virginia and was valedictorian of her class.  Very--did very well and I think chose to come to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] as opposed to either Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] or [Mount] Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 11658
Speaker 1: That brings me to another question, and that's just because you had mentioned in say the opposite--I didn't go to HBCU [Historically Black College and University], but can you talk about the value you see in going to an Ivy League institution?
Speaker 2: Well I think for me, I always, you know this, this is--I'm sure this is part of, you know, sort of advertisement and marketing.  But I always had this idea in high school, because, you know, the kids always read that the Ivy League schools were the best schools.  And, you know, I was into getting into the best school, so that was my attraction.  And so the, the, the--and by best meaning the school with the best--not just the best resources and the best facility, but also there was implied sort of this best sense of being able to network and move your career on, because of who you meet in that setting.  And like I said, I had no role models of people who had gone to historically black universities and colleges, so I just didn't--that world just didn't exist for me.  I always thought that my kids would sort of--.
Speaker 1: [Off camera discussion, mic falls].
Speaker 2: I always thought that my kids would be more interested in going to historically black colleges.  And my wife [Terri Payne] and I always had these conversations.  That's 'cause, you know, when she grew--went to a totally segregated high school.  And I don't--I don't think she applied to any historically black schools either.  But my kids, because, you know, have grown up most--in mostly sort of white middle, upper middle class elite neighborhoods and I thought they'd be more interested [laughs].  Now my son goes to Seton Hall [University, South Orange, New Jersey] and my daughter is still in high school.  It will be interesting to see where she wants to go. But, you know, I was, it was--I think my own view was sort of, that's where  I was sort of socialized to go.  That, that, you know--I had this sort of ideal peer [Henry Schneiderman] who had gone to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  I really respected and, you know, and I had positive experience at that time, so--.
Speaker 1: Now when did you decide--now when you were in Yale, did you decide you wanted to go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  I mean was that--or--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah, and it was this idea of just trying to get into the best place, so I had a limited number of--you know, I had done relatively well.  I had done very well and so I had options, and so I applied to Harvard, Yale, Columbia [University, New York, New York]
Speaker 1: (Noise.) Is that thunder?
Speaker 2: No.  I think they're building, yeah--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're building this whole operating suite right beyond that wall there.  I applied to Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], New Jersey Medical College [now University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey] as a [chuckles] quote "safe" school, and that was it.  And I--oh and [Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical College of] Cornell [University, New York, New York].  The other thing that happened is that I--in the summer of my junior year at Yale, I heard about a program for minority medical students, minority premedical students at Cornell here in New York.  It was funded by the Massey Foundation, and my pre-med advisor suggested that I look at it.  And I applied, got in and I came here, and I spent that summer in the medical school dormitory down the street here, Olin Hall.  And we took medical school level physiology courses.  And we were paired up with medical students.  And we went around and saw a couple patients with the medical school faculty.  So I spent like eight weeks doing that.  And I got to know Cornell.  Now I later found out that was sort of a recruiting device [laughs] for Cornell.  That was a way that the medical school could sort of, you know, actually recruit students who--minority students who they might be interested in and sort of test us out.  But I think it also gave me and the other students a good sense of what at least the taking of basic sciences in a medical--going to medical school might be like.  So I did that in my junior year.  And I planned--I was very impressed with Cornell, so I applied here.  So, you know, I got into everywhere except Columbia.  Columbia didn't take me.  I didn't want--I was very impressed with Cornell, but I wanted to get away from New York for a little bit.  And I was--and my premedical adviser said, "Well Harvard is the best medical school.  So go to Harvard."  So that's why, that's why I went to Harvard.  And Terri--we weren't married at the time.  But Terri graduated from Yale and went to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And she was majoring--well she had majored in psychology at Yale and was in gerontology women's development at the University of Chicago.  Now we got married in my senior year of medical school. So she never finished her PhD.  She came back.  She moved to Boston [Massachusetts] and I finished medical school and did my internship and residency at the Brigham--Brigham Hospital [Brigham and Women's Hospital] in Boston before coming here to New York to do my neurology and oncology and pain training.
Story_ID: 11659
Speaker 1: Now how did you decide the area that you wanted to go into?  That's--I'm just sort of curious, because you didn't have any clue about anything, you know.
Speaker 2: No, no.  Although I was interested generally in neurosciences, you know.  The neurological sciences were, you know, the brain.  You know, it was, you know --it was this big mystery.  This wonderful organ what makes us unique, and what separates, right, us from other life forms.  And it was always sort of interesting to me to try to understand how the brain worked.  So I took a lot of neuroscience courses at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] even as a undergraduate, and I remember taking a particularly fascinating course in neuropharmacology.  At that time the Neuropharmacology Department at Yale was like the best in the world.  When I was a senior, I went up to the medical school and I took an undergra--took a course in neuropharm--got turned on to sort of really neurobiology.  So I went to medical school thinking I was gonna be in neurological science, either neurology, neurosurgery something like that.  Actually thinking more neurosurgery.  And I was just always very interested in  nerve--in pharmacology physiology, the nervous system.  In fact, my interest in pain management sort of derives from that.  Because when I finished medical school [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts], did my postgraduate training and came here to New York Hospital [New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York] to do neurology, I became exposed to neurologists who had this perspective that understanding pain and the influences of medications that control pain was really about understanding the nervous system, because pain is mediated through the nervous system.  So that was sort of a logical progression of my you know, sort of developing intellectual interest, so that's how. I was just sort of interested in the nervous system and how to better it.  If we could understand you know--understanding this really helps us understand what makes us human.  What makes us different from other biological forms.  And that was always fascinating to me.  And so then it was sort of logical for me to go into neurology.  I decided not--I didn't wanna go into neurosurgery, because neurosurgery--surgery itself is a discipline.  It seemed very militaristic to me in [chuckles] terms of its training.  I was a little naive I think in that, I didn't quite understand that in order to be well trained, and to be a good surgeon, you had to be very disciplined [laughs], and you had to.  You know, there was--I mean there were things that you had to learn, that somebody just had to tell you.  You had to do it this way because this is what worked.  And you can't necessarily experiment on a person while you're learning, but I didn't understand that fully.  And so surgery came across to me when I was in medical school as this very top to bottom militaristic almost anti-intellectual kind of experience.  And so I was a little turned off.  And where as the medical aspects of neurology and neurosciences were more exciting to me.  As I later [chuckles]--it's so interesting--as I later developed and did research and got grants and developed an animal model to study drugs, and had to do surgery on animals [chuckles] I--you get quickly impressed at how important it is to be disciplined and to be, and to be--well really disciplined in your surgical approaches.  And I really--it was sort of interesting that through this animal work that I had to do, I became--I got a much better appreciation for what the clinical training really needs to be.  But still I'm very happy with what I've decided to do.
Story_ID: 11660
Speaker 1: The neurological sciences, how does--cause when you know,  you talk about the brain a lot of times you know, I think, "Okay, psychiatrists."  You know, because that's--they're--that's a part of it.  And then when I hear let's see, the issue of pain I think of anesthesiology. You know, so I'm just wondering how you went--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: You know, what are those differences?  And what--'cause there are some overlapping there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they're all an output of the nervous system.  Okay, and you know, and I--I think it is the case that the--it is the case that the mind and consciousness is sort of the highest order output of the nervous system.  And things that anesthesiologists do to block nerves and to dull reflexes are at another level of the nervous system.  But the issue is understanding how the nervous system works.  And so I really see this as all quite complementary.  In that, in a sense that the neurologist has the more broader, holistic picture, because what we really try to do is to rati--to understand in a very rational way how a symptom reflex disorder of the way the brain or spinal cord is working or not working.  So it is true that if you looked at the specialties and if you just asked the question, "Well what specialty is most represented in pain management?"  It's anesthesiologists and that's in a sense because anesthesiologists have the capacity to do these interventions to help pain.  But looking at it from a more scientific perspective, one of the things we've been trying to advocate in our program here, and then actually trying to go out and train more neurologists.  Because we think neurologists have a lot to offer patients, because we know the nervous system.
Speaker 1: And anesthesiologists don't.  They know how to--not administer--but they know--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] They--.
Speaker 1: --what drugs do what things.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they are experts at generally these techniques of applying medications and doing procedures, which are quite important.  But sometimes there's this phenomenon if, you know, if you hammer a hole well it looks like a nail.  And sometimes I think patients who have pain like the person you mentioned with the facelift--the pain, what you need is somebody who can take a broad picture of what all the medical, physiological. biopsychosocial issues that this person faces and synthesize that, and put that together.  And that's really the fascinating sort of art of being a doctor and being a pain management specialist.  Because what--it sounds like what that person really needs is a little bit of maybe medication, but also maybe some psychotherapy.  Maybe, maybe, somebody reevaluating whether  there should--some--which nerves were damaged and whether that should be--it should be an anesthetic approach applied.  She really needs somebody pretty broad in their understanding of the subject and I think neurologists come closer to that than psychiatrists or anesthesiologists.
Story_ID: 11661
Speaker 1: You come here for your residency right?  For your--again what was it called?  For your neuro--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well I came--I did my medicine--internal medicine residency training at--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Peter Brent--
Speaker 2: At the Peter Brent Brigham Hospital [now Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts], and I then came here to do neurology at [the Joan and Sanford I. Weill Medical College at] Cornell [University, New York, New York] at New York Hospital-Cornell [Medical Center].  And as part of that neurology training, we rotate to--we rotated to Memorial Sloan-Kettering [Cancer Center, New York, New York] to get training in neurology and oncology. And it was here that I met Dr. [Kathleen] Foley who later became my mentor and she is a neurologist who had become an expert in pain management and she is the one who made this connection for me from neurology to pain.  And the cancer aspect of this can't be underestimated to, because cancer as it affects the nervous system is often painful and many of the neurological complications of other cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer are often painful.  So neurologists are often asked to see patients who have cancer not only to diagnose specific conditions, but also to help treat the pain associated with those conditions.  So this environment is a very rich environment for neurologists to understand, you know, the neurological complications of cancer and the treatments of pain associated with cancer.  So that's sort of how I evolved to this.
Speaker 1: Now you were here for how many years?  When did you go from [unclear] ?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah.  Oh--[chuckles].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was here from--I came to start my training in 1979 and I completed my neurology residency training in 1982.  I then--part of that training was spent at here at Sloan Kettering.  I then did two additional years of fellowship training in neuro-oncology and pain management with Dr. Foley and Dr. [Jerome] Posner here.  That ended in 1984 and from 1984 to 1987, I was on staff as a junior faculty member as an assistant professor in the department of neurology here.  And 1987, you know, my son was six years old, my daughter was a year old.  We were finding it very difficult [chuckles] to support a family here in New York [New York].  I was getting a little interested to see what the world was like beyond this little northeast corridor.  And so I had offers from first Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] to go there to help them develop a pain management program as part of a cancer center they were developing.  And that was a--so I went to Cincinnati and sort of felt like, "You know, wow  This is what the real [laughs] world outside of New York and Boston [Massachusetts] is.  This is how people really live."  You have a house.  You have a, you know, a back yard and you make a decent income.  You can drive a car to work [laughs] and that was nice.  The problem was for me that after four or five years, Cincinnati--the job became very, very confining.  That I had a bigger vision of sort of where I wanted to go, than I was sort of able to do in that environment.  So, I was at that point being recruited to get really back into a major cancer center at the MD Anderson Cancer Center [University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center] in Houston [Texas].  MD Anderson and Sloan-Kettering are by far the two largest cancer centers in the United States.  So Houston--so MD Anderson was, you know it's an excellent--had an excellent reputation.  They were needing someone to come and really develop what we had developed here earlier at Sloan-Kettering.  And so I thought that was a big--major challenge. The only problem was it was Texas and Houston and, you know, far, far away from my family, [wife] Terri's family.  But, I thought I was still young enough to, [laughs], you know go out and do that and we did.  And I really loved it 'cause MD Anderson's a wonderful place.  It challenges--the intellectual administrative challenges were great but we had resources to deal with.  But, in the end, you know, my parents were getting older, Terri's parents were getting older and there was a pull to get back closer to our family.  And then Dr. Foley, my mentor was stepping down as head of the program and I was recruited back here to run the program.  So I've [laughs] sort of come full circle.  So in 1998 I came back.
Speaker 1: So were you the Dr. Foley in Texas when you start the program there--I mean--you said they had their--you start--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well I--no there was a--there was a physician there, a Dr. [C. Stratton] Hill who had started the pain program there but had no, but--he was not a neurologist.  He was an internist and he had not put together sort of the--a comprehensive clinical research and training program and that's sort of what I came there to do.  So yes, I was sort of like the Dr. Foley when I got there and from a professional perspective, I could have stayed there, I think forever 'cause it is a great place you know and the institution is a great institution.  Lots of challenges.  But it was really a--for personal family reasons that we came back east.
Story_ID: 11662
Speaker 1: I wanna understand.  Your  specialty, is it in the cancer area or outside?  I mean I'm just--okay.  'Cause--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It's a little confusing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So  there--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] There's pain and then there's--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We think that we okay, pain, it is complicated.  The expertise to evaluate and manage pain theoretically and ideally should cut across all disease facets.  Historically because canc--the patients who had cancer often have pain, much of the historical development of pain as a specialty grew out of cancer centers, okay.  And grew out of this perspective of patients having a potentially fatal illness having pain.  As opposed to patients who did not have a fatal illness as your--with pain.  Like your example you gave of someone who's had plastic surgical procedure and has chronic pain.  Well, you know, it's not likely that they're going to die as a result of that pain from that procedure.  Whereas, in the cancer world, we grew up from this perspective that often when patients were reporting more and more severe pain,  it was because their cancer was progressing and there was an issue not only of dealing with pain, but dealing with the meaning of pain.  And the actual threat to, you know, survival of the individual.  So, there has been this sense that there are these two worlds of pain.  It's somewhat artificial but there is this sense that there--this is--there are pains that occur as a result of serious medical illness.  Where the issue is not only dealing with the pain itself, but dealing with the meaning of pain to the individual.  And the fact that the pain in many ways becomes a metaphor of the illness and the threat to the person's survival, so cancer, AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome], you know, multiple sclerosis, pain from spinal cord injury, you know.  As opposed to people who have chronic pain from an industrial accident, okay and who may have just as severe pain, but the meaning of the pain in that individual is a little different.  And so it poses a challenge actually, as to how you sort of train people to live and to be comfortable and competent in evaluating the total pictures in these worlds.  And I like to think of myself as predominantly a pain and palliative care specialist dealing with cancer and serious medical illness.
Story_ID: 11663
Speaker 1: I'm not board certified in psychiatry.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] You're not.  But you use that--.
Speaker 1: But one of the core competencies that I have developed as a pain--is to be more sophisticated--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: --in psychological assessment than the average neurologist [laughs] okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you're right.  And in fact, there is now this whole move to make pain management its own specialty.  That you would be board certified not in neurology or not in psychiatry or in anesthesiology but in this thing called pain management, okay.  And you would then have to certify that you've had sufficient training dealing with this whole breadth of patient populations from the chronic low back pain from industrial accident to the patient experiencing physical pain from cancer, okay.  And that you--it's been a challenge to understand how one would structure training programs that would, in fact, give people competency across these areas.  That's actually a contemporary and a quite contentious sort of--not argument, but experience going on right now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that really leads me leads to my question I wanna ask you.  Well, do you think that the--[laughs].
Speaker 1: I have some pictures.
Speaker 2: You have some.
Speaker 1: But I can give you other pictures.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'll have to send them to you later.
Speaker 2: No.  We like to have them here--okay.  But--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] [unclear].
Speaker 2: 'Cause you--when you got involved in this and it was really--the focus really as a training was really, sort of almost  specialty so that--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] That's right.
Speaker 2: But what I hear you saying--and that's why I wanna say, like in--you know, that's why I had started to ask about the twenty  years.  I was really also asking about you know, [unclear] friends.  But in this theory-your belief system is that you have to consider pain across disciplines.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, and I think our experience of trying to understand pain as an impact on an individual has certainly lead us to that perspective.  I also can make an editorial comment, that I think that one of the problems with medicine today is that we have no sense.  It's both a blessing and a curse, we become too specialized.  It's a blessing in that we can have these enormously tremendous, heroic rescuers.  You can transplant a heart.  You can, you know, transplant a kidney.  You can literally, you know, pull someone from death's door from, you know, being very, very skilled in the techniques of advanced life support and critical care.  The problem is that those skills don't translate necessarily to being a good doctor when people have chronic progressive illnesses.  And the world I live in is a world where we're trying to maintain the quality of life of an individual with chronic progressive illness.  And so we have to be in that sense a little more of a generalist.  Much broader in our sort of perspective of what we're gonna consider and what we can train to deal with.  Than if you are a you know, a neurosurgeon who is interested in, you know, clipping an aneurysm to prevent it from bleeding.
Story_ID: 11664
Speaker 1: What is palliative care?  Or what--okay. What does it mean now than--[unclear]?
Speaker 2: The original sort of intentions and meaning--definition of palliative care is that it is a area of medicine, medical--not really specialty in area.  An expertise in medicine, which attend to the medical, emotional, spiritual aspects of the patient's experience, recognizes death as a part of living.  Doesn't hasten death, but doesn't deny death either, okay.  And that--so palliative care is often focused on treating symptoms to maintain the patients at the highest possible quality of life even if one cannot cure the person.  And that--but it's more than just treating symptoms because it really is treating symptoms so that the patient and their family can actually experience the highest possible quality of sort of existence that they can, given the limitations of their disease.  Now when you think about it, [chuckles] those sort of broad principles treating symptoms, attending to spiritual, emotional, psychological factors in the patient, are really things that should happen all the time.  There's nothing about sort of facing death, which makes those more or less important.  And so there is this movement now to move quote palliative care upstream that is to say, "That this isn't just about hospice care, end of life care.  But these basic principles should be incorporated from the very disease--time of diagnosis."  So that when your cancer is diagnosed and your diabetes is diagnosed, your doctor should in addition to thinking about your cure, should also be thinking about what impact these treatments are gonna have on pain, on depression, on fatigue.  How the doctor and the health system needs to support you in terms of your emotional and spiritual well being, as well as your physical well being.  And that's--those are sort of the basic precepts of palliative care that we're talking about.  So initially, yes, this was focused on sort of end of life care.  When people--where you wanted to treat symptoms and really focus and try to get people to not deny that they were dying and to maintain them.  Maintain patients and families at the highest possible quality of life.  But now we recognize that those things should be part of good medical care in any stage.  So the disease--so the definition has, in fact, shifted.
Story_ID: 11665
Speaker 1: What do you think are some of the important trends that you've seen in medicine then?  Because--I mean doctors have become sort of clinical about things.  I mean this is--do you think that there were more outside sources that sort of impacted by--well there's the, you know, holistic movement that occurred., or, you know, their beliefs, you know, people believing that there are certain things.  You know, especially when it comes to cancer.  So much now [unclear] gone into cancer research and yet, you know, some things we're trying outside of the traditional more clinical medical range.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right, right, right.  Well I think there have been these--a lot of these competing trends and there's a tension.  Sometimes healthy, sometimes not so healthy tension between sort of rigorous science, evidence based approaches as to more--for want of a better word, touch or feely less scientifically rigorous approaches.  I think these things are sort of existing in a sort of a loose tension.  So for example, you say doctors have become more clinical and all that's true and you know, in 1971 [Richard Milhous] Nixon signed the National Cancer Act and we had this war on cancer, right.  Now you might on the one hand say, "Well there's still hundreds of thousands of Americans dying of cancer, so we've not won this war."  But on the other hand, when I went to medical school, if you were a child and you had acute myelogenous leukemia, you--that was a death sentence.  You were dead in a year.  Now that's curable.  Okay.  So there are these major battles that [laughs] we have won in terms of cure and I think having being very rigorous scientifically and being very clinical were critical to making these advances to get you know sort of these cures.  The big problem with cancer is that the cancer that affects the large number of adults--lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, many of which now we're now getting a better understanding on environmentally and sort of lifestyle.  'Cause, we haven't had the great success outside of breast cancer in effecting cure.  So I think people have this sense that we haven't won the war.  No we haven't won a war against cancer but we made significant advances.  And there's a side of me that says, "That those advances were only made because of an insistence on scientific rigor and really hard science."  At the same time, I think we have to be open that there are approaches that right now seem very unconventional and therefore hocus-pocus, almost voodoo medicine that if we take the time to learn more about, we might find have some scientific bases. And so I've always been in favor of keeping an open mind about some of these things.  The hard part is that when people who are very vulnerable, when they have a serious illness, sort of latch on to something where we have evidence doesn't work.  And deny themselves medical treatments that we know have some efficacy.  I think that's the hard part, in trying to convince people to give up on things that they are sort of--they want to embrace.  Because they have this more holistic sort of natural appeal, although they may not or are not effective.  So I think we live in this very tense world of having--wanting to push more and more to understand the science of cancer, so that we get more and more cures.  But in also dealing with people and where they are, and supporting people psychologically and emotionally if we can't--don't have the cure today that will help this individual with colon cancer or lung cancer.  And I think we just have to be smart and open and have an honest discussion with people about what we know, what we don't' know.  And even if we don't have a cure--here's where another big aspect of palliative care, palliative care is not giving up care.  It's not doing no--it's not, "Well we don't have a cure.  So there's nothing more we can do for you.  So we're gonna do this palliative care thing."  You can always care for people.  You can always provide symptom management, psychological support, emotional support and that's doing something, that's not doing nothing.  And often people say, "Well you're not--if you can't cure me, you're not doing anything for me."  But there has to be I think a broader societal discussion about this.  About sort of what's real, what's real, what's not real and what we're willing to accept in terms of when death is inevitable.
Story_ID: 11666
Speaker 1: You've been active in the whole area of trying to equalize, like Dr. [Harold P.] Freeman, you know, care--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: And in the minority community.  So there would be accessibility for the same, you know, types of care.  Now when I interviewed Dr. Freeman, he almost appeared if he were a sociologist or social scientist on this.
Speaker 2: Meaning?
Speaker 1: Well he spoke about--you know, at first he thought when he was doing his studies that, you know, black people got, you know, certain types of can-- maybe cancer more than a--they were more subjected to it because of who they were.  You know, being black but then he found out that it was really more of the socioeconomic and not getting access or, you know, not being diagnosed early enough.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: It wasn't that they--their bodies were more--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So I--that's what I, you know.  And I had not heard that sort of articulated, you know--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 2: --in that way.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 2: So I'm just wondering, in the research that you've done, are you really on target with him?  Or do you come at it at a different place?
Speaker 1: No, I'm fundamentally in agreement with Dr. Freeman that there are very few basic biological differences between blacks, whites, Latinos, Chinese people, and etcetera.  That most of what you see is these great disparities in mortality rates and in symptoms that people experience are really related to an effect of access to care and fundamental sort of socioeconomic phenomenon.  Now I think that there's racism in there somewhere, 'cause I think that race we know is an important marker for socioeconomic status, okay.  But I think in terms of the biology of these differences, these health outcome differences, there are a few exceptions.  But it's hard to attribute these things to biological or genetic differences.  They really are more related to who gets access to care and how people are treated once they are in the system.
Speaker 2: But in the common--I mean the common discussion those--that's not--that doesn't come across very much at all.  I mean what you hear are more things are tied really to race.  You know, "The blacks have this propensity--" or, you know, they were saying more, you know more subject or, you know, I mean there's this whole discussion of AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome].
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] What--.
Speaker 2: But, you know, it's not clear what's causing a community--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] But those are--.
Speaker 2: No--no education.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well but those are--those fundamentally relate to life style.  It isn't that the HIV [human immuno-deficiency] virus is more likely to hit--it is , it is more likely to infect in a minority person because of lifestyle issues and because of environmental issues not because the host itself is biologically more vulnerable to get that infection.  There was a study, for example, are you familiar with the cardiovascular studies that were done?  This very famous study now.  Haitians were videotaped.  Actors were videotaped with symptoms, okay, with chest pain symptoms as if to mimic cardiovascular disease.  So black, white, male, female and I think other minorities, I think maybe Latino and Asians were videotaped.  These videotapes were shown to physicians, okay.  And now the patients were basically exhibiting the same symptoms., okay.  And the physicians were then asked to recommend a course of diagnostic assessment of treatment therapy.  And women and minorities got a different set of treatment strategies than white men.  Now what is that about?  Okay. And so that tells me when you look at statistics that say, "If you're black, you're more likely to die of cardiovascular disease at age sixty-five than if you're white."  Than this kind of thing has something to do with that.  It's also the case that if you're black and if you're not well educated, you're probably eating a high fat diet, probably not exercising to the extent that you should and, you know, you're probably living in a more stressful environment than you would if you had other resources and lived in other parts of the community.  Which also contribute to this though, so I think this is a--it's a complex mostly socioeconomic issue.  That isn't to say race doesn't play a factor 'cause I think race is a marker [chuckles] for socioeconomic status in this country.  Now we do have some studies that show that there are certain enzymes, which are responsible for metabolizing medications, pain medicines.  And if you're--and that there may be some differences in the presence or absence of these enzymes that are, in fact, racially based.  So, for example, the most commonly cited example is an enzyme, which breaks down codeine.  When you take codeine pills, actually codeine is broken down in your body to morphine and it's that breakdown to morphine, which allows codeine to provide pain relief.  So it turns out that ten percent of whites lack this enzyme to break down codeine to morphine and only about one percent or fewer blacks and Asians lack that enzyme.  So, in fact, if you're white and if you happen to be in that ten percent of people who don't have that enzyme, then you get no pain relief from codeine, okay.  Or, if you're black and you're in that one, you get no--so there are these kinds of racial genetic differences.  But in terms of the big picture, and explaining disparities and outcomes and in treatments affects, those are relatively minor.  I think that there--the much broader issue related to the, you know, who has insurance?  What kind of lifestyle people are living?  What knowledge and education they have about healthy life-promoting behavior.  I mean that is going to be a major thing that influences mortality differences.  I can't think of many physicians that I know of who are not--who haven't, who haven't stopped smoking if they were smokers, who aren't out there exercising, okay.  If nothing else, walking, but many of the people that I know are running, going to these gyms.  I--that to me--and that's a class thing, okay.  I mean and--it's a class and it's an education thing.  And I think that has as much to do with improved survival from cardiovascular disease and cancer as being--having access to the doctor.  So I think there's a very--and the fact that we live in a society where there is not universal access to health care and to these life-promoting health behaviors.  I think is as much the problem as anything else.

Speaker 1: Did you ever think that you would see medicine in this light [taking into account socio-economic and racial issues]?
Speaker 2: No.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Well, you know, I thought that, you know, you just get out there and become the best scientist [chuckles] technician that you can be in that sense and you cure people.  And that God forbid, you know, that the system itself is gonna discriminate or treat people differently.  No.  I never saw that.  Now, you know, there's been a little backlash to this kind of thinking.  But people now are talking about, why are we practicing quote politically correct medicine?  Why are we diverting energy to talking about these racial social differences and outcomes in care?  That doctors shouldn't be about that, doctors should be about advancing the cure and that's--those are political decisions.  Those are, you know, sociological decisions that physicians should by and large not be involved in even this discussion.  I disagree with that quite strongly but, you know, there are people who are saying that this is a diversion of resources and energy and--from what the health care system should be about.
Speaker 1: And who are those people saying that?  Are they--are the AMA [American Medical Association]?  I mean who--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Nah, these are--well these are--well there's a book now called 'Politically Correct Medicine' ['PC, MD: How Political Correctness is Corrupting Medicine'] this Dr. [Sally] Satel who's not--who's a white woman who sort of--I mean I think I've heard her speak on C-SPAN and things and she said things like, "Well obviously if there's racial discrimination, that should be excluded but by and large these big difference that"--well the argument's there that mainly that people have to take more responsibility for their care.  It's not a societal problem.  That if you--anybody in this day and age oughta know if you smoke, you're gonna die early than if you don't smoke.  And everybody oughta know that you need to control your weight and exercise.  And that's a personal responsibility.  And that physicians we--yeah, we should perhaps be giving health--we should be giving educational information to people but we shouldn't be out--.  You know, that's partly the extent of it and I think that we fundamentally have to advocate more for people to get the treatments and to get access to this information.  And I don't think it's quite that simple.  But yeah, there are people talking about politically correct medicine.  The other dimension of this, of course, is that there have been people saying that, "One problem with this disparate mortality rates are that physicians don't understand enough from different social classes and racial backgrounds.  Don't understand enough about the lifestyle of their patients to fully educate them and, therefore, if you had more physicians from diverse backgrounds they would be more effective."  And that gets into a whole affirmative action debate.  And, of course, that drives the politically correct people crazy.

Speaker 1: Now you're here at [Memorial] Sloan-Kettering [Cancer Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: And it's sort of viewed as the--you know, well it is sort of--.
Speaker 2: Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and--I mean or even the problems of the wealthy.
Speaker 1: --are those who, you know, have the wherewithal or know, you know--are gonna search for the best care.  So I'm just wondering how you--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, settle those two issues?  Because here you are, you know, having [unclear] as a partner.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] right.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: That's something I think about because it is true.  I think that, you know, Sloan-Kettering does have this reputation of being, you know, an elitist kind of place for the social, politically wealthy.  I like to think that in some [chuckles] respects on the--at--I'm the conscience of the place.  I'm certainly--been working with Dr. [Harold P.] Freeman to move the institution to work with North General Hospital [New York, New York] to develop a cancer center in Harlem [New York] that is a collaboration between those institutions.  Yeah, it's something though I struggle with though because I--I hope I haven't sold out.  But, you know, I feel like though I can--that we can--that the influence of the Sloan-Kettering and being able to train people to set the, you know, the improved knowledge, to get knowledge out there, to be in the forefront of education.  I think that can move the expertise that we have into a broader area but frankly it is something [chuckles] I think about, and struggle with.  But the bottom line, I've been around.  I went to Cincinnati [Ohio] which is sort of a, you know, it's a medical center in a, you know, medium sized Midwest city.  Served the [unclear] of the community.  But I found that in that environment, I didn't have nearly the influence that I have in this environment.  And so, you know, I chose to work in this environment 'cause I think I can make a difference.

Speaker 1: Now do you--and it's surprising, you're still very young.
Speaker 2: I'm getting older.  I'm getting older.
Speaker 1: I just had my fiftieth birthday [laughs].
Speaker 2: I know, but I' just saying, you know.
Speaker 1: [laughs].
Speaker 2: [laughs]. The people I interview are like in their eighties.  [laughs]. So, you know, I used to have that perspective, you know, and they're so vibrant.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah they are.
Speaker 2: So that [unclear]--but, you know, I'm just wondering what--you know, as someone who--you were very directed early on.  You're the type of person who knew exactly what they wanted to do and it doesn't seem like you really had regrets either.  You know, you're not--you know, "Like I made a wrong decision or--."
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 2: "--I was too focused here."
Speaker 1: I can't think of anything else I'd rather do except maybe be an announcer--a sports broadcaster [laughs], that's about the only other thing.
Speaker 2: [laughs] [unclear].
Speaker 1: [laughs] Golf [unclear].  But I don't know if I have the ability though--.
Speaker 2: --to be a professional golfer.  But yeah, I have no regrets.  I mean when you--you know, I don't wanna sound high-browed here, but I have a good feeling about coming to work, you know. I know I'm trying to help people.  So yeah, I don't have any regrets.  I mean, you know, there are--medicine--the business of medicine is becoming increasingly frustrating but in terms of the fundamental reason why I've been into this, no regrets.
Story_ID: 11670
Speaker 1: [Beginning of tape] ...one of the big advances that we've made in our neurological understanding of pain mechanisms in the last decade.  That the brain and spinal cord and nerves aren't just like a simple electrical cable; that there's a lot of very dynamic processing.  And when you injure something that sets up changes that go all the way up to the brain, those changes, if they aren't rapidly reversed, can become self-perpetuating to promote pain.  And so nobody has psychogenic pain, okay.  Psychogenic pain is a meaningless term in that sense and that pain is a result of activity in the nervous system that--and some of it is obvious--related to obvious pathological processes, some of it related to not so obvious pathological processes.  But it's all real.
Speaker 2: So have you been successful yourself with something where there should be no apparent pain but there is a reason from a neurological--.
Speaker 1: [simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 2: --standpoint? And someone's pain subsiding?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And in what instances?
Speaker 1: Oh we see people who have had amputations, who have phantom pain, right.  That's the clearest example, you have a cancer in your bone the surgeon amputates your arm and now you feel like you still have your arm there and it hurts.  And there are several treatment approaches to that.  Medications can be given.  Nerve blocks can be given but we have successfully treated that pain.  There are patients who--we--had surgical procedures, who have had injuries to nerves. For example from a surgery, women--there are a certain percentage of women who had operations on the breast, post-mastectomies for breast cancer.  And who have post mastectomy pain related to an injury to nerves in the chest wall.  Those women actually have--are cured of their breast cancer and have tremendous pain from the surgery.  And we've been able to treat their pain with electrical stimulation, with physical therapy and with medication.  Absolutely.
Story_ID: 11671
Speaker 1: I'm very interested in this whole issue of how we change the medical system to be more equitable, in allocating resources for all sectors of society.  That's a whole area of policy, health policy research and that--that I've gotten interested in, health care delivery system.  I'm also interested in trying to make sure that there are people--there have got to be people like me growing up now who like, you know, don't--you know who feel like they don't have--may not have had access to their opportunities--to the best opportunities.  I want to be able to try--I want--I'm thinking about how we identify sort of my next generation of people like me. Growing up in not wealthy environments but who's got a lot of talent, ambition, skills, very motivated.  I think we absolutely have to make certain that people like that have opportunities, not in medicine or whatever.  And so I think if I had another job, and if I had an infinite resource, I'd like to be head of some foundation that would go out and, you know, figure out ways to find young people who are from so-called disadvantaged background.  I never felt I was from a disadvantaged background but that's the term and to make certain that we are identifying and supporting people who can really make differences.  To me those are the more interesting challenges.
Speaker 2: And who's a good doctor?
Speaker 1: The doctor is competent yet humble. A good doctor is a good biologist who knows the basic things about how bio--you know the nerve root--the body biology system should work and understands that a person is more than just a sum of a group of cells.  And I think a good doctor is a person who can make decisions always having incomplete information.  But who can sort of synthesize incomplete information and make the best decision possible at that given time.  And always I think having some sense of not--of being serious but not taking yourself [chuckles] too seriously.  You know, being competent and serious about what you do but recognizing that you can make an error.  And that that's in a sense okay as long as you tried your best.  And as long as you were considerate of all the things that you should be considering.  Including what's important and valuable to the patient and the family.  I think that latter consideration is never in the discussion, before, and I think we now know or we're now more accepting of that having to be part of what being a good doctor is all about.
Story_ID: 11672
Speaker 1: When you think back to the two doctors that were on your street [when you were growing up]--you know, the ones that you looked up to--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Dr. Down and Dr. Poag.
Speaker 1: Are they still alive?
Speaker 2: No, they are--Dr. Poag recently died.  Dr. Down is still alive, not practicing.
Speaker 1: What do you think they would think of you?  I mean did they ever see your success? Or did you--?
Speaker 2: Well actually it is interesting.  About ten years ago, I was asked to do a grand rounds presentation, a medical lecture at Elizabeth General Hospital [Elizabeth General Medical Center, Elizabeth, New Jersey], which is where I was born.  And they were practicing,--[chuckling], I remember Dr. Down got up and said, "I can't--I remember when you were born [laughs].  This is wonderful."  So yeah they were both there in the audience and they both commented that it was nice you know to see some one come up through the ranks.  No I think--and I think that as black physicians, I think they appreciated the opportunities that we younger physicians had that they didn't have.  So yes I did have that one very wonderful experience of interacting with them on a professional level that I'll always cherish.
Story_ID: 11673
Speaker 1: And what do you either want to be remembered for?  Or what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: [Sighing].  Boy that's a tough one, you know, I think, I don't know.  I don't know, maybe someone who tried to, to combine this issue of competency and compassion, yeah competency and compassion.  And we often feel like we're on the fringe of medicine now that this palliative medicine bit is, you know, not mainstream.  And in--by the time I'm ready to retire, palliative medicine is recognized as, you know, as every bit as legitimate as cardiology [chuckling] or radiology.  I would feel like that's part--I left part of that legacy.

Speaker 2: Now how do you spell-is it--?
Speaker 1: M. D. Anderson?
Speaker 2: Is it  E-M-D  or--?
