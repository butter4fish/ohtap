Story_ID: 649596
Speaker 1: We do, as I said, life oral histories.  I want to start out by asking you to give me your father's name; and what you know about his, his background and his growing up.
Speaker 2:  	My father's name was Tommie Levert, Sr. My father was basically a steelworker.  The first time I really became aware of my father he was in the [U.S.] Army, and I still remember the picture of him with this Army uniform on, and this cap.  That's the image of my father that stays with me.  A very quiet man, very--a working man, family orientated.  Me and my dad, we never really talked a lot, because he was more of a, you know, a no nonsense kind of person.  Either you're going to do what you're supposed to do or you're messing up.  That's, there was no, there was no in between.  You'd either do what you were supposed to do, or you're not doing the right thing.  That's it with him.  And he believed in work.  He believed in his family.  He was a family man.  He worked, but for his time period that he lived in, he got caught up in things like all black men did at that time.  It just was hard.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 2:  	Whenever, you know, they had problems, there was always a drink in the house.  There was--and sometimes this became a problem.  But he, he stayed there.  My parents separated very--when I was young, very young (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How young?
Speaker 2:  	Six or seven years old.  And I went to stay with my mom [Blanche Boykins McCloudy].  She--and then from there I went to stay with my dad who had--it was more of a--it was more of a stable situation with my dad, because he had a house and we had a dog.  You know, the re- the possible American dream, that image, we had that with my dad, you know.  He, he, he provided, you know, and then he went into those trouble spots and it would get kind of hard, you know what I'm saying.  But as a father now growing up, I understand those things and how those things can overtake you.  So the older I get, you know, I understand that that can happen, that you can get caught up in those things when drink comes in.  And we get, we get those moments where we only think of ourselves and we become very selfish.  And I think that's primarily what happens to men nowadays.  We get to the place where we get selfish and we can only think about our own wellbeing, and we make bad decisions, bad decisions that will affect our children and the rest of the family, you know what I'm saying?  Because we feel like we need to be happy, but not without thinking of--we're only thinking about we instead of thinking about the whole me--we need to be happy.  That's how we need to think.  And one person's happiness well, is not enough.
Story_ID: 649597
Speaker 1: What did he do?
Speaker 2:  	My dad [Tommie Levert, Sr.] was a steelworker.
Speaker 1: He was a steelworker?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, is this is in Bessemer [Alabama]?  Was it in Alabama?
Speaker 2:  	This was--this was in Canton, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is in Canton, okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, this is when I really, when I started having a relationship with my dad.  I had no relationship with my dad or my mom [Blanche Boykins McCloudy], because I stayed with my grandmother [Mozell Johnson Carter] after they separated.  I spent--up until I was seven years old the only parent I knew was my grandmother and my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now, grandmother and grandfather on which side?  Your father's side?
Speaker 2:  	My mom's mother.
Speaker 1: Oh, your mother.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 649598
Speaker 1: Let me--did--so is your father [Tommie Levert, Sr.] originally from Alabama?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Both of them, both of them are from there.
Speaker 1: Do you know where in Alabama?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, wow.  Oh, I really do know, I just have to think.  Like, most of my dad's people are there.  And most of my dad's people are like college graduates, you know.  They, they, they, their family was a little bit more into upscale education and owning their own land and, you know, planting their own food.  My aunts and my uncles, you know, they owned cows and, you know, farms and chickens.  And whenever I would go stay with them it was always a great time, because they were self-sufficient, where on my mom's [Blanche Boykins McCloudy] side it was just a harder struggle.
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about your mom.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because I assume that you--on your father's side, you don't know--how far back do you know?
Speaker 2:  	On my father's side I go all the way back to my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	My grandfather, he was a little short man.  I was named after him.  His name was Ed Levert, too.  And my name was Ed [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert], you know, so I was named after him.  He was a, they were just--my mom--I never--like I say, I never did--did have a really great interaction with them until I turned around seven.  And those, and those times were very, weren't the easiest (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 649599
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Give her name.
Speaker 2:  	Her name, Blanche McCloudy [Blanche Boykins McCloudy].
Speaker 1: And what did she--so what ho--do you know about her background?  You obviously knew her parents, your grandparents?
Speaker 2:  	I don't really--I don't really know very much about my mom's background.  All I--you know, like I said, I spent a lot of time with my grandmother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So let's talk about your grandmother.
Speaker 2:  	Her name was Mozell [Mozell Johnson Carter].  She basically raised me and my brothers up until the time we, I turned seven.  She was the only disciplinarian that I knew.  We stayed in a--in a--it was almost like a--everybody--the backyard was everybody's backyard, you know.  Whenever they would kill a pig or killed a cow, it was like a big deal.  And the whole neighborhood would participate in it, as they cut it up and did whatever they did--cured the meat and all of that stuff they would do in these big kettle pots.  They'd boil the lard off of it and get the hams and the pig feet and all of that stuff.  You know, I remember this as a kid, that this went on.  And some of the, some of the things, you know, like, as I'm with my grandmother, you know, this was during the time that the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] would burn a cross up on the hill, and everybody would end up hiding up under the bed until they said that the danger had passed and the Klan had gone past.  This was, this was the kind of life I was living.  It was not really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when you, when you think of your grandmother, what makes you--what reminds you of your grandmother, let me ask you that; Mozell.
Speaker 2:  	My grandmother was a very, a very strong disciplinarian person.  And she, one of the things I really remember about her--there were some good things about her, too.  But one of the things that I really remember is when she would whip us.  You know, sometimes, you know, you would try to run from her.  And she had got to the place where, you know, "This is the way I'm going to whip you.  Now you won't be able to run."  She would take your head, put it in between her legs, and all that's sticking up is your butt (laughter).  And she'd be tearing that butt up.  And so she was doing this to me one time, and so I got the clever idea that what I'm going to do, I'm going to bite her on the leg, and she's going to have to let me go.  And I bit her on the leg, and that was the wrong (laughter)--that was the wrong thing to do.  She, she crucified me (laughter).  But overall, my grandmother, it was hard times then, you know what I'm saying?  Very hard, because we had no food, or we stayed in a shotgun house where you could see through the front door all the way to the back.  And there was maybe three rooms with a kitchen.  And, you know, me and my two brothers [Tommie Levert, Jr. and Andrew Levert] and her and her husband, we all stayed under those conditions.  And, you know, sometimes there was not enough food, but she made do with what we had.  We, we, she, you know, she made it--you know, we lived, I lived through it, you know what I'm saying.
Story_ID: 649600
Speaker 1: But you're saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Some of these things--some of these things--you know, a lot of things--it's like I tell kids nowadays.  You know, they'll say, "That was back then.  Those were times back then.  There was, it's a different time.  Now, it's not the same."  I said, "But the hurt, and the misery, and the want, and the praying, and the crying--all the same.  It never changes."  You know, those things are--they don't change, you know what I'm saying.  Like some of those things I wanted to forget, and I probably have forgotten, threw them out of my mind.  Because I wanted better.  I prayed for better, and you know when you're sitting and you're a kid, and you pray for Christmas to be a lot better and it don't get any better.  You pray for--have better clothes, and it don't get any better, you know what I'm saying.  And you keep praying for these things.  I think you have a tendency sometimes to wipe out those memories, to say, "Well, maybe I'll just try to throw them out of my mind, and I'll forget."  And in doing all of those things, I think it made me a much stronger person.  I don't, I don't--it's hard for me to accept people who give up and stop trying.  Because it's just not--it's just hard for me to accept people who say, "Well, I'm giving up, I'm done."  You know, you still have to keep fighting, because you're still alive.  You know, you still woke up the next day and it didn't change.  You know, your struggle is still the same.  If you--do you understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: I do.  So, you're saying--and first of all, our whole project is based on reawakened memory.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, so I'm wanting to engage you in memory right now.  But you're saying that you had to really, in many ways, survive?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And so if you gave up, you wouldn't be here?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And you wouldn't have had the career, but?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let--
Story_ID: 649601
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory?  Do you have an earliest memory?
Speaker 2:  	(Pause) I, I just remember being with my, being with my cousins and aunts and uncles, and having a wonderful time swimming in the ponds and eating watercress; the good parts of it, you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: What were some of the bad parts you can remember?
Speaker 2:  	Well, the bad parts was there was no--there was no dad, there was no mom.  There was--you know what I'm saying?  My [maternal] grandmother [Mozell Johnson Carter], she was struggling, you know, to try to take care of three boys and herself.  And then these, then you got the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and all of that kind of mess going on.  And you know, she's trying to work and then she gets sick and she can no longer work.  And my mom [Blanche Boykins McCloudy] is trying to send money.  And, you know, it's never quite good, you know.  And I, and I'm not sitting here saying that everything was bad.  I'm saying to you that there were great days and there were good memories, but some of the things, you know, I think I blocked out of my mind and just remember that I had to struggle.  I had to, I had to overcome not having this and not having that.  I had to, I had to keep dreaming, keep dreaming and keep hoping.
Speaker 1: So how large was Bessemer [Alabama]?
Speaker 2:  	Very small, very small.
Speaker 1: A couple of thousand?
Speaker 2:  	Country, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) A country town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 649602
Speaker 1: So, you're--the kid--so you're the middle child?
Speaker 2:  	Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, your oldest brother is?
Speaker 2:  	My oldest brother suffered from sickle cell [sickle cell anemia].  So, I was really the one.  And so he--but from my oldest brother--I mean he had had a stroke, so he could not use certain parts of his limbs.  He was not able to really interact as a normal kid, but he was not a lazy person.  My brother was one of those kind of guys that he would not--I would tell him, "Okay, man," after I became successful, "you just sit down and don't do nothing."  He would always find him a job.  He would walk to work, even if it was in the snow.  I got--from him, I think I got my tenacity and the ability to overcome.  Whatever is ailing you, it's not that bad.  Because whatever was wrong with me was not as bad as the burden that he had.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  No matter what was happening to me, it was like I could look at him and say, "If he's able to do this, then what is my excuse?"
Speaker 1: Because really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) That's what he was to me.
Speaker 1: --people didn't even know that much about sickle cell back then.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, that's right.  Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: It's very painful.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: So, his name was?
Speaker 2:  	Tommie Levert, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you're Ed.
Speaker 2:  	I'm Ed Willis.
Speaker 1: Ed Levert [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert].
Speaker 2:  	And then I had Andrew Levert.  That was my brother under me.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2:  	They both, both of them have passed.  Both of them are gone, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what was the age range between you?
Speaker 2:  	We were at least two years apart?
Speaker 1: So, stair steps?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 649603
Speaker 1: Can you take me back there?  We can do this here or we can do it in Canton [Ohio].  But what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2:  	Kindergarten, and I don't know why it's kindergarten.  It seems like, it seems like when they had milk, it was really milk.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  The way milk tastes now and the way it tasted then was, it's completely different.  I mean it was really, really fresh; really, really good.  Tomato juice, all of those things.  It just seems like at that time it was really pure.  Everything was clean and, you know, there wasn't no worries and all of that stuff.  That stuff only started once I got to grade school, and all of a sudden there was--my mom [Blanche Boykins McCloudy] was gone and my dad [Tommie Levert, Sr.] was in the [U.S. military] service, and I was with my [maternal] grandmother [Mozell Johnson Carter].
Speaker 1: So, that, that--what we were talking about was taste.  So, what about--
Speaker 2:  	Taste.
Speaker 1: --what about sounds?  What sounds do you--
Speaker 2:  	The train, the train.
Speaker 1: The train.
Speaker 2:  	The, the, the train.  I used to go to sleep by the sound of the train rushing down the tracks, because it went right past.  It was maybe three or four doors from my house, and across the street was the train tracks.  And as it came through, this long train would be coming (makes train sounds), the train going past.  And I would fall asleep from it.  That sound, wherever they were going, sometimes I wished that I could have got on it and see where it was going to take me, and be a part of it.  And eventually I did get on it, and we went north.  But that was one of the most sig- significant sounds of my, of my childhood.
Story_ID: 649604
Speaker 1: What about smells?
Speaker 2:  	I've always been a fried chicken fan (laughter), and my [maternal] grandmother [Mozell Johnson Carter] could really cook some fried chicken.  And yeah, just the smell of it, yeah.  And blueberries, because we used to go and find blueberry patches and go and pick them, you know.  And the foundry, the smell of the foundry, because the foundry was right across the street from my house, and you could see them working and you could see the fire coming up from these stoves and all of that, and the smoke and all of that.  And then on the days that they weren't working, they had these big, these big bins that carried sand.  And we as kids would hop over in the bin and play in the sand on the weekends when they weren't working.  Yeah, and the factory.  And the school on the top of the hill where they'd ring the bell.  And we could walk from the house to the school, it was just up the hill.  The school was right on the top of the hill.  Good times, they were good times.  All of them wasn't--you know, I still remember going across the tracks over across the pond and over to my aunt's house where she could--she was my aunt Florence [ph.].  She, she really, you know, she had chickens and goats and all.  And you'd go there and you could play with, you'd play with the animals, and then she'd cook something to eat.  The sound of the animals.  And then, you know, at night the singing of the fireflies flashing, and catching them and putting them in a jar.  Catching frogs and cooking frog legs, yeah.  And see, the backyard was like everybody's backyard.  So whenever someone would be cooking, they'd be cooking out there on the fire, and you'd always smell it.  You could always--you know, they'd be cooking something great.  And everybody shared, everybody shared.  It was like a communion.  Everybody shared what was there, and you knew--everybody knew everybody.  It was a big fig tree that everybody used to climb and pick the figs off of it.  And then, you know, there was a time my grandmother, when things were really great, she had cows.  I used to go and have to take the cows to pasture.  I had to get the eggs from the chickens, walking through all of that chicken poop.  And it, it was really bad (laughter).  But, yeah, I remember I saw them kill a pig.  And I hope this is what you're looking for but (laughter)-- but they killed a pig in the back of the, in the yard.  They took a knife, this great big knife, and just cut his head off.  And he's running around squealing, you know, with this knife sticking out his neck, and he finally keels over and then they take the skin off of him and cut him.  And then you get your chitlins and your hog maws, your cracklings, and all of that.  I know you've heard of all this stuff (laughter).  And they just, and everybody ate from this.  Everybody got some of this, the whole neighborhood.  Those to me were great times, really great times.
Speaker 1: And bad times just involved maybe arguing and, you know--
Speaker 2:  	Well, like I said, I don't remember--
Speaker 1: That part?
Speaker 2:  	That part.  Maybe I just tried to shut them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--shut that out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And they, and then they separated; and once they separated he [Levert's father, Tommie Levert, Sr.] went north and she [Levert's mother, Blanche Boykins McCloudy] went north and--
Story_ID: 649605
Speaker 1: Then the next thing I know they were not together, and we were with my [maternal] grandmother [Mozell Johnson Carter].  And then the next thing I know, my mom [Blanche Boykins McCloudy] sends for us and we go to Detroit [Michigan].  And we're with her, and she's got an abusive husband, he's very abusive.  This guy is--
Speaker 2: So the three, all three boys go to Detroit?
Speaker 1:  	All three go to Detroit to stay with my--
Speaker 2: And it's a situation where--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, he's abusive.  He's drinking, he's beating her, he's beating us.  And so finally, me and my brother--up under me, me and my youngest brother [Andrew Levert], we're tired of it.  So, he beats her one day and he comes back and he beats us, and then he falls out on the bed drunk.  So, we take a baseball bat and we beat him with it.  And then we ran down to the neighbors, and from there the neighbors got in touch with our father [Tommie Levert, Sr.], and we went to stay with our father from there.  I guess my mom just--you know, and in the meantime while we were in Detroit she went, we went to Cleveland [Ohio] for a while to stay with my aunt Lois [ph.] and my uncle Frank [Frank Boykins] and my aunt Annie Mae [Annie Mae Boykins].  They, you know, they were doing quite well, and they had, they had their own homes and apartments and stuff.  And my dad and my dad's sisters and his brothers, they were there.  So, between those people there were good times, there were good moments.  And, you know, and finally we ended up in Canton [Ohio] with my dad.
Story_ID: 649606
Speaker 1: So when you get to Canton [Ohio], it's all three of you boys [Levert and his brothers, Tommie Levert, Jr. and Andrew Levert]?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2:  	We're there, and my dad [Tommie Levert, Sr.] has remarried.  And this woman--we're, we're, we're there with a new mom, and a dad that we haven't spent that much time with.  But he has this home, and she's not a bad lady.  She's teaching us how to wash our clothes, how to wash dishes, how to clean up behind ourselves.  She's teaching us all the things that we need to know.  She was a good woman, because she taught me everything I needed to know as far as helping provide for myself and working, and work ethics, and, you know, how to cook.  Because she used to say to me--her name was Annie Frank [Annie Frank Levert].  She's now eighty-nine.  She's, she's--they've only given her, they've only given her about six months to live, because she's got cancer and its terminal.  And I've got to get down there to see her.  Within the next month or so I've got to go there.  But this woman really gave me all the things that I needed to know as far as the basic work ethics; cleaning up behind myself, taking care of my stuff, being God fearing.  She used to say, "You got to learn how to cook, so if you get married and you run into a lazy woman, you won't be beating her up because she don't cook nothing."  And that was her favorite line to you.  And she--as far as work was concerned--so one day I'm cleaning; she has me cleaning the floor.  And she comes up and she says, "Put some elbow grease on it."  I go to the cabinet looking for elbow grease (laughter).  And then she finally tells me, you know, "Your elbow, your elbow.  That means put some effort in it."  And this is--I'll never forget that, because I really went to look for that elbow grease.  And when I finally realized what she was talking about, I applied it in my life.  I've applied it in my children's lives.  They, they, they felt it and heard it, too.  And I think she's made me the kind of man she helped to make.  The man that I am today, she had a lot to do with that.
Story_ID: 649607
Speaker 1: So there was probably a lot of trepidation on your part, you know, when you went to Canton [Ohio], in a way (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Because it's all new?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, and you've been in several different situations?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So, what, so, but it's the three of you?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And so you're-- sort of as a unit traveling?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So, did she--especially after the situation with your mother [Blanche Boykins McCloudy] and that situation--were you, did it take time to be trustful of her [Levert's stepmother, Annie Frank Levert]?
Speaker 2:  	To warm up to her?  Absolutely.  Because you know, being a kid, I don't know why kids want to think that a grownup like that has got a vendetta against you for some reason.  And probably in some cases, it does happen.  But she was, she persevered.  She, she, went through it.  And my dad [Tommie Levert, Sr.] went through it with us, you know.  We, we became, we became better in time, you know.  But the older--and the older I got the more I started realizing who she was and what she was to me and what she meant to me, and also what she meant to my dad, and what she's meant to me in my life as far as who I am now, you know what I'm saying.  I would have to attribute this woman to being at least 75 percent of what I am.  It's because of her.
Speaker 1: So you're, you said you're nine or seven?  What--how old are you?
Speaker 2:  	I'm now, now we're at seven, eight, and nine years old (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, when you're in Canton?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 649608
Speaker 1: And what are you like at that point as a you- you know, 'cause what are you--what is [HistoryMaker] Eddie Levert (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Trouble (laughter).
Speaker 1: Trouble?  Mischievous?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, trouble.
Speaker 1: Trouble, in what way?
Speaker 2:  	Trouble in--you know, I still want my--you know, you go to school, you're hanging out with the kids.  You're doing what kids do, you know.  The school we're going to is a mixed school now.  And--
Speaker 1: So this is--?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, this is the school in Canton [Ohio].  We're, I think I started off in the third grade up there at--it's a mixed school.  Black and white kids are going, and now, you know, I got white friends.  I go to their house and we're playing and having, you know, fun at their house, and eating cookies and all that good stuff.  It was quite a change, you know what I'm saying; quite a change.  You know, it's almost that American dream kind of thing, you know, the fence and the dog.  And you know, when TV first came out we got a television, you know what I'm saying, one of the first people in the neighborhood to get it.  At that time, you know, my dad [Tommie Levert, Sr.] worked at the steel mill, and the steel mill was practically right around the corner.  All he had to do was get his lunch and go to work and come walk back home.  It was a working neighborhood.  And the neighbors--and the funny part of it was you had weird people then just like you do now in the neighborhood.  You had the recluse, the people who never left their, they never let their shades up.  Then you had the hillbillies that stayed down the street, and the old lady that lived by herself but was always wise and always watching everything.  It was, it was a melting pot.  There was an Italian family that lived in there, and their dad was a mechanic.  But he, you know, his wife was one of the nicest people you'd ever want to know.  Her name was, oh--I know the kids' names.  One of them was named Corky [ph.]--and Frankie [ph.].  But their dad, he, you know, he worked at the steel mill too, and he got off work at three [o'clock].  Now, their mom didn't mind the kids coming over playing in the yard and all that, but as soon as it was time for Frank [ph.] to come home--that was his name--whenever Frank came home, all the kids had to get out in the yard.  But Frank was, he was, Frank was, he was all bark and no bite, you know what I'm saying?  No matter what he said, no matter how he acted, you know that he really was not that person.  He was not--he tried to act like a racist, but he was not, you know what I'm saying.  At the end of the day, you know, he was one of the guys in the neighborhood that you could depend on, and if he could help you, he would.  But he didn't--he just didn't--, "Don't you kids hang around my, don't be in my yard.  Take your butts home and don't come over here," (laughter).  That's who he was.  And there was a lot of characters in that neighborhood, a lot of characters.  Oh, my goodness, what characters.  Oh, man, Mr. Layman [ph.], Mr. Yonk [ph.], all of these guys were people that would come by the house.  And when my, when my dad--now my dad could make moonshine.  And when he would make the moonshine, they would all be around the house getting their taste of that moonshine (laughter).  And then, you know, and some people in the neighborhood, that was their hustle.  You know, they sold that moonshine.  You know, you'd come by, and if you got a quarter you can get you a pint of moonshine, you know.  And they, that's the kind of neighborhood it was, you know.
Speaker 1:  Were there any numbers?  Were there numbers in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2:  	They was running the numbers.
Speaker 1: The numbers?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah, you had to, you know, get you a number, whatever your number is for today, and you go play it.  You could play it for a nickel, you could play it for a penny, you know.  That was just an everyday occurrence.
Story_ID: 649609
Speaker 1: And you know, the neighborhood--all the neighborhood kids--that's when I ran into--in Canton [Ohio] it's when I ran into Walt Williams, who we, who I sang with.  It was at the age of, he was six and I was seven.  And--
Speaker 2: You were?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, we knew each other that long (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, you then moved to Canton before--because I thought you--
Speaker 1:  	He was there when I got there.
Speaker 2: Right.  So you moved--okay, so you were seven?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: So he was there?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, he was there when I got there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And did he live right in the same, on the same--?
Speaker 1:  	In the same--he lived right down the alley from me; one, two, three houses down the alley from me.  I could walk out of my front door, go to the alley, turn down the alley, and three or four houses down was his house.  And he had fifteen kids, fifteen people living in his house, fifteen kids in that house.  And I mean they only had about what, four or five rooms.  So, you know, just thinking about that, you know, at that time.  And I'd go down there and hang out.  Because his step- he had a stepmom too.  She was, his dad had married again because his mom had passed away.  I'd go down there because she cooked some of the meanest biscuits, you know, in the whole wide world.  You wanted them biscuits (laughter) because she could, she knew how to do it.  And you'd just stand outside her door waiting for her to give you one, you know.  And it was really, really, really a great time.  And this is how--and at that time I was singing.  I was just singing, just singing, singing, singing.
Speaker 2: So, that's what I wanted to know.  Was there music around your ho--homes much?
Speaker 1:  	No.
Speaker 2: So you just sang?
Speaker 1:  	Just sang, just wanted to sing.  Just natural, just something that I wanted to do, and I was doing it.
Speaker 2: So none of your--your mother [Blanche Boykins McCloudy], father [Tommie Levert, Sr.]?  No grandmother [Levert's maternal grandmother, Mozell Johnson Carter]?
Speaker 1:  	No, they did.  My dad used to sing with a gospel group, but I never heard them that readily, you know what I'm saying.  My mom always had a great voice, but I never heard her really sing that much.  So I inherited what I got, you know, and I just sung.  I just, it was just something that I liked to do.  It wasn't like there was people telling me, you know, go get vocal training, go get piano lessons.  No, it was just something that--the innate ability to do it.
Speaker 2: Your brothers?
Speaker 1:  	Huh?
Speaker 2: Did your brothers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) My brother Andrew [Andrew Levert], we started singing in church.  We got us a gospel group.  It was me, my two brothers, and Walter Williams.  And we went to church and we were singing at what they call the Sanctified church.
Speaker 2: Oh, you were Sanctified?
Speaker 1:  	The Holiness, yeah.
Speaker 2: The holy roller?
Speaker 1:  	You know, where they had the band and they had the tambourine.  And we would go there and we would dance and hop around.  And they'd play the music and then we starting singing every Sunday for them at the Sanctified church, and that's what we used to call it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the name of that church?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1:  	No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	No, you're testing me now.
Speaker 2: Okay, but--
Speaker 1:  	I might think of it.
Story_ID: 649610
Speaker 1: But was your family churchgoing?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	All, all my life, all my--because we had a lot of preachers in my family.  I--a couple of my uncles were preachers, ordained preachers.  Some of them are still.  And they always tell me, "You're going to preach one day."  But I think it's getting a little late for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so, you, so you start singing.  Now, you start when you're eight and the woman said, "You're going to go to Hollywood."
Speaker 2:  	That's in Canton [Ohio].  That lady, let me see.  What's that lady's name?  Her daughter--because I used to hang out with her grandson.  And she would, I would come down that same alley I was talking about, where I'd walk down to Walt's [Walter Williams] house.  Her house was on the left side, and his house was on the right.  She would be, on the left side she would be maybe--there would be a farm, there would be a garden, then her house.  And she would have her window open every morning.  And I would, on my way to his house I would be singing.  And she would look out, she would look out her window and say, "Boy, you really sound good.  And if you keep on singing like that, you're going to Hollywood."  I ended up in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2:  	But I wasn't making no money.  So, I'm saying the lady should have said, "You're going to end up in Hollywood making money," (laughter).
Speaker 1: So let me--so the other thing I read was--so, these are your boys that you're really performing with, you know?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: But at what age was that, though?
Speaker 2:  	We started out, oh god, about sixteen.  But that's when we actually really got into it.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2:  	Because at sixteen--we didn't meet up until I was sixteen, because we met up in high school [McKinley High School, Canton, Ohio].  We, when we met up--now my brothers--that was me, my two brothers [Tommie Levert, Jr. and Andrew Levert], and Walt.  That was at seven, eight, and nine.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's seven, eight, and nine?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.  We, and we're singing in church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	We're not, we're not doing no R and B, or none of that stuff.
Speaker 1: But that's--but I'm asking about--in church.  So, when you--what are you learning though, about singing and music?  Because a lot of our, a lot of our singers are coming out of the church.  What are you learning there?
Speaker 2:  	Basically, I'm just getting the feeling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	The feeling of knowing that music touches me.
Speaker 1: So, what--
Speaker 2:  	It does something for me.
Speaker 1: So what, what, what song reminds you of that, you know, seven, eight, nine--you know, in church?  When you hear it, what song takes you back there?
Speaker 2:  	Wow, wow, when I hear anything by a group of guys called The Pilgrim Travelers.  Oh, I'm trying to think of that song.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But I know The Pilgrim Travelers.  You know, I went through a big transition about church.
Speaker 1: When did that happen?
Speaker 2:  	Now, I've always, I've always felt like my role model was always Jesus Christ, because I always wanted to be like Jesus Christ.  Because I felt like if I could be that, then I could maybe--I could maybe change--you know, touch people and heal them.  And if I could stay, if I could stay true to that and be all of that, and don't waiver in my belief and my strength, then I could be a healer or I could--that was my image.  I wanted to be like Jesus Christ.  And then I discovered that that wasn't going to happen, because it's hard (laughter).  That's a hard one, man.  I don't, I don't know anybody who could ever pull that off.  That's a hard one.
Speaker 1: You know, just being on the straight and narrow (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, the straight and narrow.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: And, and, and being, you know, just being someone who can use their mind for good and, and never deviate from it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	That's a hard, hard task.
Story_ID: 649611
Speaker 1: So you, so that's what--so school, let me understand school.  So what is, what is the third grade?  What's, what is the name of the school?
Speaker 2:  	That's J.J. Burns [J.J. Burns School, Canton, Ohio].
Speaker 1: J.J. Burns.
Speaker 2:  	And I'm going, we're going to school over there.  And it's a mixed school.  I'm in the third grade, I'm learning that--the singing now.  I'm singing in the third grade, and they're doing this play called 'The Ugly Duckling.'  And they got, they got somebody else in the lead role, and now he gets sick.  And now they need someone for it, and I try out for it.  Now here I am, black as tar and running around with a gap in my tooth, and now I'm going to be the ugly duckling (laughter).  So, now, can you imagine the shit that I had to take (laughter)?  Excuse my language, but can you imagine how those kids got on me about "You're the ugly duckling now."  But I did well in it, I did well in the play.  I remember one song I had to sing was called, it went, "I went 'round and around and around and around," (laughter).  Oh, there I was with these paper feathers down, like walking like a duck and singing this song.  And you know, the kids, kids are cruel.  They had no mercy, (laughter) especially my friends, "You're an ugly duckling."  I had to live with that all the way through grade school (laughter).
Speaker 1: So even, this is your stage debut (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, that's right.  And it turns into being, you know, it stuck with me throughout grade school because they, they all, they wouldn't never let me forget that I played that part.
Story_ID: 649612
Speaker 1: So you go to junior high school, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And then what is that?
Speaker 2:  	Junior high school is now Canton [Ohio], McKinley High School.  That's the ninth grade (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 2: Canton McKinley is known for--
Speaker 1: So elementary [J.J. Burns School, Canton, Ohio] went up to eighth grade?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, absolutely, absolutely.  As soon as you got out of eighth grade you went on up to the ninth grade.  At that time, you know, that was an achievement.  And so I went from there to ninth grade, me and Walter [Walter Williams].  And this is how we finally got to meet each other, through semester exams.  We, we're--the exams--it's time to take the year end exams, and so you only go to school half a day.  So we would go to school and we would do that.  And so every now and then everybody would hang out in the hallways, you know, after the class was over.  And so we're standing down there and, you know, people were just singing.  And so the hallways had these--these big hallways would echo.  It sounded like you were in an echo chamber.  And so we started singing and we liked the way we sounded in those hallways--myself, Walt Williams, Billy Isles [Bill Isles], William Powell, and Bobby Massey.  And we get to sing, and we like it.  And we call ourselves The Emeralds.  But then we find out somebody else is named The Emeralds, and so we call ourselves, now we call ourselves The Triumphs.  But everybody, now everybody wanted to call us The Tramps (laughter).  So, I'm, you know, it's like we go to--we go from there, we go from there to--we're coming from the park one day and we're singing.  And there's this store in the neighborhood called Gervasis, and they're Greek.  And we're singing coming past the store, and that's the neighborhood store where everybody shops at.  And their son comes out and he hears us singing and he says, "Do you guys know anybody that sings?"  And we look at him like, "Duh, what was we just doing?  We sing, yeah."  He said, "Well, I got some songs, and I want to see if you guys know anybody who could sing them?"  We said, "Yeah we can sing them."  So, he started--he invited us in the store and played the songs for us.  And we started, and he started rehearsing us on this song.
Speaker 1: Now, who is this?
Speaker 2:  	His name was Lee Gervasis [ph.].  He was, he was the son of the guy that owned the store.
Speaker 1: Now had he--
Speaker 2:  	And everybody shopped at that store.
Speaker 1: --had he written the songs?  Or what--
Speaker 2:  	No.  He and the guy was, his name was Andy Andretti [ph.].  And he and this guy was writing songs together.
Story_ID: 649613
Speaker 1: And so they--he--this guy Andy [Andy Andretti (ph.)] played the piano, so he started teaching us the songs.  And so after we learned the songs, we all got in his Pontiac, five of us and the two of them, seven people in this one Pontiac, and we drove to New York [New York] and auditioned for Decca Records.  And--
Speaker 2: Now what year is this?  Because, have you graduated at this point?
Speaker 1:  	No, no, no, still in school [McKinley High School, Canton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Oh, so this is like the late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, this is still in school.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950]?
Speaker 1:  	Around, yeah, around '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	Fifty-eight [1958], something like that.
Speaker 2: Because it says in '58 [1958], that you formed The Triumphs in '58 [1958] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we're, now he gets us, and we get in this car and we drive to New York.  We're in New York, and the first place we go, we go to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  We're going to check in there, because the YMCA got rooms in there cheap.  And as we're going to check into the hotel this guy is standing at the desk, and the guy comes in behind him and hits him in the head with a two by four and splits his head wide open.  Now, this is our first time in New York.  Now, we've heard about New York.  And so, we're sitting there like, "What?"  And he's laid out on the floor.  And now we get back in the car and we've got to find someplace else to stay.  So, now we get, we get back in the car and we find a cheap hotel.  And we go up to Decca Records and we do the audition.  And we do, we have an arrangement of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' and they really liked it.  And we, we, we--they said "Okay, you guys go back home.  We're going to call you back in about a couple of months."  Okay, then right after that The Skylarks did a version of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow,' and it was our version of it.  And well, they didn't do it exactly like us, but they took the idea and gave it to them, and they did it and got a hit record on it.  And we were disgruntled again (laughter).  We were very disgruntled.  So--
Speaker 2: So, what is--they're disgruntled--
Speaker 1:  	They're disgruntled, too.
Speaker 2: They're disgruntled--
Speaker 1:  	But there was nothing we could do.
Speaker 2: Could do.
Speaker 1:  	It wasn't our song.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1:  	It was their--you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1:  	--the song had--you know, it was--you--anybody could have done it.  And they did it; and they got a hit out--hit on it.
Story_ID: 649614
Speaker 1: Now we go, we decide that we're going to go down to King Records down in Cincinnati [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Now, who (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1:  	--(simultaneous) which is closer to--at this time, us and Lee Gervasis [ph.], we sort of parted company, and we're trying to do, we're trying to do something different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because you were disappointed?
Speaker 1:  	So yeah.
Speaker 2: You didn't want to have that experience again?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah, right, right.  So we go down, so we go down to Cincinnati and we audition for Syd Nathan, who was the president of King Records.  At that time they had Hank Ballard and The Midnighters.  They had James Brown, they had--they were really making a lot of noise.  So we go down there and they sign us; they sign us right there in the office.  And then they take us right from the office down to the studio and start cutting the original songs that we just wrote.  And they put it--and they cut our songs.  We have not signed anything for the songs or any of that stuff.  We're just young kids that they're--, "Come on down here and let's make a hit.  They might be the next Frankie Lymon and The Teenagers."  And we cut the songs, and they tried to put them out.  The first one that we, the first song that we did was a song that I'd written called 'Here Comes the Rain,' and they put it out.  It was, it was, it was a regional hit there in Cleveland [Ohio].  Because at that time I think it was Will Rudd and Ken Hawkins, and they were playing, they played our record there in Cleveland.  So we were able to get a regional hit from that song to--up to Buffalo [New York].  So we were able, now we were able to spread our wings a little bit and go to work in different places.  That, that was like playing the Chitlin' Circuit.  And some days you might get paid, you know.  And you know, backtracking back to Canton [Ohio], when we were just getting started one of the first gigs we did was at the Akron civic center [Akron Civic Theatre, Akron, Ohio], and that was the first time we ever got paid as The Triumphs.  And we made twenty-five dollars, and that was five dollars apiece.  And from that point on we knew that we wanted to be in this business; and that we might be able to make a living at it.
Story_ID: 649615
Speaker 1: You get known regionally, and you had--take me back--so you get--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you get known regionally.  Who are you paying attention to, though?  Who is like your idols at that point?  It was--?
Speaker 2:  	At that time you got--you got James Brown, you got Hank Ballard and The Midnighters, you got Etta James, you got [HistoryMaker] B. B. King, you got Little Anthony and the Imperials.  You got--oh god, you got--it's a gang of people--The Flamingos, Nat King Cole, Little Willie John.  I'm trying to think of all these people that were--Sam Cooke, Lou Rawls, all of these people were in the business at that time.  And so now you're trying to be, you want to be like The Flamingos.  You want to be like Lee Andrews and The Hearts, you know.  A lot of great people, a lot of great people.
Speaker 1: So when you're with Syd Nathan, you're with King Records [Cincinnati, Ohio] how long?
Speaker 2:  	We were with King, we were probably with them for about four, three or four years.
Speaker 1: Four years?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that--now, was it during that time that you recorded 'Miracles'?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2:  	No, that was after that.
Speaker 1: 'Miracles' is after that?
Speaker 2:  	That's after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	That's, that was our next, that was our next move, and that was like up to Detroit [Michigan].  That was when we first, we had run into Eddie O'Jay at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that's--so--
Speaker 2:  	And that was 'Lonely Rain,' 'Miracles,' yeah.  Eddie O'Jay--
Speaker 1: When is it?
Speaker 2:  	This is when Eddie O'Jay is coming into the picture.
Speaker 1: Right, but no, but you're--at the first part, do you change your name to The Mascots?  Because you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) No, Syd Nathan changed our name to The Mascots.
Speaker 1: Your name to The Mascots.  Now, why did he change--
Speaker 2:  	And we had--because he didn't like Triumphs [The Triumphs], and I think at that time he owned that name.
Speaker 1: He owned The Mascots?
Speaker 2:  	In other words, he owned The Mascots name, you know.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	Do you understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: So, so, who is Syd Nathan by the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Syd Nathan was the president of King Records.
Speaker 1: King Records.
Speaker 2:  	At that time.
Speaker 1: And you said the reason was because it was at least in Ohio?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you knew them, okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 649616
Speaker 1: How do you come to the attention of Eddie O'Jay?  That's what--?
Speaker 2:  	I think that the song called 'Lonely Rain,' which was part of that 'Miracles.'  Well, 'Miracles' came after that, but we had a song called 'Here Comes the Rain.'
Speaker 1: Now, what I read was that your first single was 'Miracles.'  Is that--that's wrong (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: See, that's why it's important to talk.  So what is--?  So--
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: --educate us.
Speaker 2: The first single was one called 'Lonely Rain' (singing), "Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain."  And it became a regional hit, and that's when Eddie O'Jay and Will Rudd and Ken Hawkins became aware of The O'Jays.  And then they started, we started doing record hops there in Cleveland [Ohio] because they thought that we, you know, that we had something going on that we were going to at the Call and Post ballroom in Cleveland.  Now, we're doing the record hops, we're doing 'Lonely Rain.'  And here comes Will Rudd and he says, "Well, you guys, you need a manager."  So he starts managing us, and then here comes Eddie O'Jay.  He says, "Well, I can help you better.  And we're going to go to Detroit [Michigan]."  After--because, see, nothing was happening with Will or Ken Hawkins.  And so Eddie O'Jay says, "Well, I got some connections.  Come on let's go to Detroit."
Speaker 1: And he has more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: He has more notoriety.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, that's right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Because he's on the radio.
Speaker 2:  	He's a popular deejay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	He's prime time, he's the man.  You know, so he says, "Okay, let's go up to--we're going to talk to, we're going to talk to [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy."  Berry Gordy wanted 50 percent of everything, and Eddie O'Jay didn't feel that at all (laughter).  I mean, he says, "No, we're not going to do that.  Come on, guys, we're going to go out to the West Coast and we're going to, we're going to get with a guy by the name of [HistoryMaker] H. B. Barnum."  And the first thing we did with H. B. was the song called 'Lonely Drifter,' a song--another one of my compositions.  You see, all my songs had tears in it (laughter).  I'm crying a lot (laughter).  I'm crying (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you're making other people cry (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	Right, along with me.  You know, making everybody cry.
Speaker 1: You know, what I don't want to skip, but when do you start writing?  Because you never talked about that.
Speaker 2:  	I--
Speaker 1: You didn't--
Speaker 2:  	I started writing very early.  Because the first thing I wrote was a--I joined a contest for Kellogg's Corn Flakes.
Speaker 1: At what age?
Speaker 2:  	And this was around about, I was probably about eight or nine years old.  And what I wanted to do--they had a contest for somebody who could write the commercials for Kellogg's Corn Flakes.  I didn't win, but I wrote something that was really interesting, and they sent me twenty-five dollars for maybe fourth place or something like that.  And that's when I really started writing.  And then, you know, being a kid, and I've always been a daydreamer, so you know, I was, I always loved girls.  And so, and they would always break my heart, and so I would write about them, you know what I'm saying.  That's when I wrote "the 'Lonely Drifter,' 'Lonely Rain,' 'Here Comes the Rain,' 'Lonely Drifter': will I 'ever be a lonely drifter, will I 'ever be, will I never find nobody that's going to love me for myself and love me like I want to be loved.  That was the gist of all those songs.  And most of the time--then I wrote something called, 'Oh How You Hurt Me.' You see, all of my songs were painful.  The girls were treating me really bad (laughter).  And so I was writing all of these sob songs.  But, but it so happens that 'Lonely Drifter' got to be a Top 40 record for one of the songs that I wrote, and H. B. was the producer on that.  And see, while we were H. B., we did a lot of things.  We did a lot of background work for Nat Cole [Nat King Cole].  We did a lot of background work for Phil Spector, The Ronettes and all that.  We were doing background work for a lot of those, a lot of those big records that they had (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 649617
Speaker 1: Well that was a--I mean there was a lot of activity happening there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And then, you know, we actually interviewed H. B. [HistoryMaker H. B. Barnum], you know, for our archives.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, he tells a story about you guys coming (laughter)--and you're like five guys, you know.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then I think one of--one of you, not you--but one had--he had to have an eye operation?
Speaker 2:  	That was Walter [Walter Williams].
Speaker 1: And he's like no one's singing (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	And he ended up in the hospital for about a year with that.  I mean he almost lost his eye, you know.  Because he had, he had, his eye had developed some kind of pressure behind it, and they had to put him in the hospital.  And he was, he had to suffer with that for about a whole year before they finally got him out of the hospital.  And he didn't want to go back home, so he stayed out there with one of the people that worked in the hospital.  And he stayed there until he got better.  And because, see, when we recorded 'Lonely Drifter' he was not, he did not sing on that record.  Do you know who sung on that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2:  	You know the actor, his name is Morris Chestnut.  His father, Morris Chestnut, cinder- Sr. [Morris Chestnut, Sr.], sung on that record.  He did the bass part, because Walter was in the hospital and he couldn't make it.  And it became a hit record, and we--the Top 40, I couldn't believe it.  You know, but it didn't mean anything because Top 40 at that time, you needed to be in the top ten, you know, for it to really matter.  But it also gave us more avenues to go out and work.  We could, we were--instead of five regional cities now, we might have had twenty regional cities.
Speaker 1: So, you're going around the country--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and you're not just in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2:  	No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2:  	We're--and see, at the time that we're in L.A., we're also--how should I put this?  We're also--
Speaker 1: Exploring yourselves?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah, well (laughter), and also--we're also becoming--now at that time, to get other groups from the East Coast all the way out to the West Coast would cost a lot of money.  So a lot of the promoters would say, "Okay, you guys come up here.  They don't know really who The Coasters are.  You guys be The Coasters tonight," (laughter).  And we did that (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is--you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) That was wrong (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is the (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but that would work?  That would--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, we did it.  We were Little Anthony and the Imperials.  We were The Coasters.  We were everybody (laughter).  We were The Platters.  And the funny part of it is when we came and did--some dates we would come and do, you know, one week we were Little Anthony and the Imperials, and the next week we were The Coasters.  And there would be somebody there, they'd be talking about, "Man, wasn't you up here with Little Anthony?"  "Man, I don't know what you talking about.  I don't know nothing about--naw, it wasn't me,"  (laughter).  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now that's--I have never heard that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, we did that to survive.
Speaker 1: Well, you had to have a good repertoire, too?
Speaker 2:  	We knew their songs.  We knew their songs, we knew how to sing their songs, and we knew how to mimic them, you know what I'm saying?  Because we, we had seen all of these acts.  We knew--I knew how to sound like Little Anthony [HistoryMaker Jerome "Little Anthony" Gourdine].  I knew how to do it, you know.
Story_ID: 649618
Speaker 1: Are you The O'Jays at this point?
Speaker 2:  	At this point we are The O'Jays, and we're trying to make ends meat.  So, we'll be The Coasters too (laughter).
Speaker 1: At least you're coming clean on that.
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Don't let the others hear that (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) It's true, it's true.  They'll probably--they're going to come up to me and say, "You owe me money," (laughter).
Speaker 1: "You got paid," (laughter).  So, so you worked with--so this is really--when you go out there it's 1963?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  With--
Speaker 2:  	H. B.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] H. B. Barnum?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what do you--do you also sign with Imperial Records at that time?
Speaker 2:  	During this same timeframe, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, H. B. has a company called, it's Little Star Records.
Speaker 2:  	Little Star Records, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2:  	And at this time, remember now, H. B. is leasing our product to Imperial Records.  He's Liberty Records--he's leasing out our product.  From his studios, he's leasing our product to Imperial Records or Liberty Records.  They--
Speaker 1: Leasing them?  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Leasing.  When I say leasing, they are distributing on the national side for him.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	You know, he's got a small--Little Star, they don't have--Little Star does not have the international ability to distribute the records all over the country, but Liberty Record does.  So, he does a lease agreement with Liberty Records.
Speaker 1: So who's managing you, though?
Speaker 2:  	At this time it's primarily supposed to be Eddie O'Jay.  But Eddie O'Jay is back in New York, in Buffalo and New York City [New York, New York], and he's doing his thing.  And he originally sent us out to be with H. B. for three weeks, and we were supposed to come back home.  Three years later is when we come back east.  Because H. B.'s gotten us out here, and he's now grooming us.  He's showing us harmonies, he's teaching us how to--the proper way to sing, and different kinds of ways to interact our act and get our act together.  So, yeah, we spent three years with him, in him grooming us.  And you know, it was, we still were stupid.  Because at that time, Imperial Records, which was run by Bob Scat [ph.], they had given us the run of the studio.  All we had to do was go in there and cut music.  That's all day long we could have just went and cut music.  But we never went in there one time.
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2:  	Because we were stupid.
Speaker 1: But H. B. didn't know any different either?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, but he couldn't talk--he couldn't make us do it.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	You know what I'm saying?  He couldn't make us do it.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2:  	He couldn't make us do it.
Speaker 1: So, you're just having fun.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, we're just out here, just--
Speaker 1: You're out having fun.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Stupid.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.
Speaker 2:  	A waste of time, just a total waste of time.  That's why I say, yeah--when I tell you that I can talk to these kids and I can tell them about wasting your time--having an opportunity and not taking the opportunity.  You know, they have to realize that when people are giving you something to help you to get there, you need to use every inch of it to your advantage.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 649619
Speaker 1: So, even--you talked about how you got started, it took you sixteen--I think you said sixteen years to become (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --known, or you know, to start.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But was that partly because you didn't have the right direction in some respects?  Is that part of it?  And then did you--okay, that's one question.
Speaker 2:  	Well, I don't--you know, what I--no, I think that was it.  There was no one there really saying--H. B. wasn't there.  H. B. was having fun, too.  I know you talked to him, didn't you (laughter)?  You talked to him.
Speaker 1: He said he tried a little, you know.  He said good things.
Speaker 2:  	We were, we were his pupils.  So, the pupil can't learn too much more than the teacher.  H. B. was having a great time, too.  And we were having--look, he's saying--we're staying up in--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2:  	Those guys are from Canton, Ohio, and never been nowhere.  We're in California, girls everywhere.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	We're with [HistoryMaker] H. B. Barnum, and he's got, he's living up here in the hills.  We got a swimming pool.  We got girls coming in by the droves.  He's got girls coming in by the droves.  And I know he told you all of this (laughter).  Because we were, we just off the chain.  And he, he's arranging very talented--H. B. is a very talented man.  He's arranging, and so he's getting money hand over fist for making arrangements.  He's getting money from producing.  He's getting money, because he's got his own record companies.  And he's writing songs and he's got different albums, and he's got different deals with different record companies.  So, money's just coming in.  And he, he don't have time to tell us, "You guys need to get down there to the studio," so there's no one to say, "Well, today you've got to be at the studio at four [o'clock], and you've got to do it from four to--," from one to five.
Story_ID: 649620
Speaker 1: --From one to five [o'clock], or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you think you would have done better--have you ever thought about what would have happened had you been at Motown [Motown Records]?  Because there was more discipline there, wasn't there?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.  If we had been there, they'd have probably made--we'd have probably--I don't know, we might not have stayed together.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1:  	You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: You don't think you--was the group (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) We might not have, we might have--we might have--
Speaker 2: You need a little flexibility?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, I don't think, I don't think--we might not have stayed together.
Speaker 2: It was too, you think that was too controlling for you?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.  I think that's what hurt them a great deal, like The Temps and--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1:  	--you know what I'm saying?  The only, the only people that I think really came out of there maybe--
Speaker 2: Intact?
Speaker 1:  	--partly unscathed was maybe Diana Ross or maybe even, maybe even Jackson 5 [The Jackson 5].  They got what they came there to do.  Lionel Richie, these people came out intact, Stevie Wonder, Marvin--even Marvin Gaye didn't get through there intact, as talented as he was and as much as he wrote.  [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson was very sound in there, you know what I'm saying.  So everybody who, everybody that was there that was just talent and not writing or producing, they struggled.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1:  	You know, because they never--they never were able to coexist with the guys that was writing.  You know, like when you take Norman Whitfield making--writing a lot of songs; Holland, Dozier and Holland [Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland], you know, the other Stevens boys [ph.] and all of them, you know what I'm saying.  These people, you know, they were writing music.  They were about the business of music.  Do you understand?  Everybody who was just a group like The Marvelettes, The Temptations, The Contours--when you were just being the act, I think it was just a little bit--I don't think it was helpful to them.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, that's an interesting perspective.  I haven't, I haven't heard that perspective.  But I think there's some merit there.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, because they all ended up in trouble, all of them.  You know, I think the saving grace for The O'Jays was the idea that we did go through those schools of hard knocks, and that when we finally got the message and we learned that we had to own our name, and we learned that we had to own our music, and now today we've lived long enough to know that these are the ends of the music that long last, and keep you in the music and keep you eating and keep your family eating.  These are the things that you have to be worried--you have to be conscious of these things, you know, and I think we've lived long enough to get there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, but when di- how long did it take you to learn those things?  That's what I--I'm just trying to--?
Speaker 1:  	I'm seventy-one. I'm still learning.
Story_ID: 649621
Speaker 1: When you--so you're out there [Los Angeles, California] for three years?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then what brings you back then?
Speaker 2:  	The--wanting to--we felt like being on the West Coast, the West Coast music was softer than the East Coast music.  So we wanted to come back and get back in the trenches, back to the New Yorks [New York, New York], the Philadelphias [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But who are you--
Speaker 2:  	--the Howard Theatres [Howard Theatre, Washington, D.C.] and all that.
Speaker 1: But who are you seeing that you want to be like, or you're feeling like, you know, we get back, this is what we--
Speaker 2:  	We're going to be in, we're going to be in the mix.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And then we're listening to Motown [Motown Records].  We're listening to The Temps [The Temptations], we're listening to The Spinners, we're listening to all of that good stuff that they're putting out--The Contours and all of that stuff, all of the people that's coming out of there.  We're listening to all of this good music that they're doing.  And all of it is coming from the East Coast.  And we're out here on the West Coast, and you know, the music--we're feeling like it's really--its R and B, but it's soft.  We need to go back, get back in the trenches.  And that's what drove us back east.
Story_ID: 649622
Speaker 1: You were married though at some point.  Did you--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I was married then.
Speaker 1: You were married then?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were out [in Los Angeles, California]--?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I was married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your first wife?
Speaker 2:  	Her name is Martha.
Speaker 1: Martha--okay--
Speaker 2:  	Martha--
Speaker 1: --Levert [Martha Levert], okay.  And then you have--what about your sons?  One--
Speaker 2:  	I have--we had--me and her had, we had two sons and one daughter [Kandice Levert].
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  While you were out there?
Speaker 2:  	No, when I got back.
Speaker 1: When you got back, that's what I thought.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you get back and what--and where do you move when you get back?
Speaker 2:  	When I get back, I buy, I get a--first I get an apartment and decide that I really don't like apartment living, because you know, people are too close.
Speaker 1: You get an apartment where?
Speaker 2:  	Up in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Oh, so you go back to Cleveland?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I go back to Cleveland and I get an apartment.  And then, well then after I get married I-- we rented an apartment in a house down in Canton [Ohio].  That was, that was my first place.  I'm staying, I'm staying with in-laws at first, okay.  And I find out you really don't want to stay with in-laws, because they--they get a little funny after a while, you know what I'm saying (laughter).
Speaker 1: You don't want to be with in-laws and in entertainment too, either.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, well you know, you know, but I'm still, I'm still very much into--I've never quite been a really wild person, you know what I'm saying.  Like I told you, I wanted to be like Jesus Christ.  So, it stopped me from doing a lot of wild things.  I was wild now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying that--I was wild, but I was not over, over the top, you know what I'm saying.  So, when I got married we rented a place in Canton, and that's where Gerald [Gerald Levert] was born.
Story_ID: 649623
Speaker 1: Then after that, we moved to Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Because Gerald [Gerald Levert] was born 1966 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  We go from, we go from there, we move up to Cleveland.  And then Sean [Sean Levert] is born.
Speaker 2: And Sean was born I think two years--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is it a year or two years?
Speaker 1:  	Two years, I think it's two years.  Sean is born while we're in Cleveland.  Now we're doing, we're working at a place called Leo's Casino [Cleveland, Ohio].  They become my manager.  His name is Jules Berger and Leo Franks [sic. Leo Frank].  They, they're managing and they got this club they call Leo's Casino.  So they keep us working there whenever we're not working on the road.  We can work there and we're making--I'm making a hundred and twenty-five dollars a week.  And I'm paying rent and taking care of my two kids and my wife [Levert's first wife, Martha Levert].  Incredible, huh (laughter)?  Incredible.  So now, so I'm doing this and we're doing gigs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are you performing--you're performing on weekends--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, I'm doing--
Speaker 2: --at the casino?
Speaker 1:  	I'm performing whenever I can, weekends, you know, you name it.  We're performing, we're trying--I need to make ends meet, you know.  So, I'm in the apartment and now I decide that I don't like apartment living.  So we rent, we get a house and we rent it on 31st [Street] in Cleveland in Garfield Heights with all the kids.  We ended up with three bedrooms and you know, the kids, they got their room.  And Kandice [Kandice Levert] is not born yet.  That's my--
Speaker 2: Daughter.
Speaker 1:  	That's my daughter.  She's not born.  So now, you know, it's a struggle.  We're struggling.  We're trying to get a hit record.  We're doing--we're working every job that we can get.  And so now we're playing at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  And we're playing that with The Intruders who now have their record called 'Cowboys to Girls,' done by Gamble and Huff [Gamble Huff Productions, Inc.].  Okay, now we're at the Apollo Theater and--
Speaker 2: Now, who got you the gig at the Apollo Theater?
Speaker 1:  	This--we're working with Ruth Bowen at this time.  She's got her own, her own booking agency.  I'm trying to think of what the name of the booking agency is.  Boy, Eddie [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert].  Yeah, it was the Queen booking agency [Queen Booking Corporation].
Speaker 2: Let me mark this down.
Speaker 1:  	Ruth Bowen, the owner, is the first black woman to own her own booking agency, you know, unheard of.  She's making inroads, so she calls it Queen booking agency.  And they're booking us in the Apollo, the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.] (background noise), the--the Uptown Theater [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and all of that.
Story_ID: 649624
Speaker 1: --Theater [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], and we're with The Intruders, and Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble and HistoryMaker Leon Huff] is coming up to see them.  And The Intruders say, "Well, we want you to meet Gamble and Huff."  So they introduced us to them, and they said they wanted to hear us.  They wanted to see us perform in a nightclub.  So we were performing in a place called the, in Akron [Ohio] called--I can't think of the club.  But anyway, I'll think of it.  We were performing in Akron.  They decide they're going to come down and catch us in Akron.  They see us in Akron and they decide that they like us, you know, and they want to record us, okay.  We go down there and we make an agreement.  They, they, we sign the contract and all of that good stuff.  At that time, you know, I'm really, you know, I'm struggling, I got the kids.  Me and Martha [Levert's first wife, Martha Levert], we're married and we got this house I'm renting.  I'm almost what?  So, you know, I'm paying--I'm making a hundred and twenty-five dollars a week.  So, we do this song.  We do this song, 'Deeper (In Love)' ['Deeper (In Love With You)'].  It's pretty good, it gets on the charts.  And then we do another one called Looky Looky Here ['Looky Looky'] or something like that.  And what happens there is that Leonard Chess--now Chess Records [Chicago, Illinois] is now distributing Gamble and Huff's music.  Okay, now Leonard Chess dies and now their contract runs out and nobody wants it.  And so after Leonard Chess dies, they pay nobody.  They don't pay Gamble and Huff, they don't pay The O'Jays.  They keep all the money.  And so, everybody's disgruntled now.  Gamble and Huff is disgruntled, and we're disgruntled with them because we ain't getting no money.  So, "Look, man, we're done.  We're going back home, and until y'all get our money, we're done."  Okay, we come back home.  At this, during this time, though, the 'Deeper (In Love)'s and all of these things have been chart (hiccups)--chart records.
Story_ID: 649625
Speaker 1: We've made inroads because now we've become really great friends with, with, with--oh god, he used to sit in for--he used to sit in for Johnny Carson, black guy.
Speaker 2: A black guy who's sitting--oh, you mean the comedian?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, the comedian.
Speaker 2: The comedian.  You're talking about--
Speaker 1:  	Flip Wilson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, he used to sit in for Johnny Carson.  Now, we become big friends with Flip.  And Flip Wilson says, "Okay, I'm hosting Johnny Carson.  You guys come up and do the Johnny Carson show ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson']."  So we go on there and we do Johnny Carson.  And we do, we do 'Deeper (In Love)' ['Deeper (In Love With You)'] and we do 'Little Green Apples' ['Something/Little Green Apples'] and we do a cover of The Beatles song.  And it makes a good impact, okay.  He, he's given us this break, okay.  But now that Leonard Chess has died, all the music is stopped, because everybody ran off.  So now I'm at home, and now I'm about a year behind in my rent, okay.  Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble and HistoryMaker Leon Huff] calls up and says, "Eddie [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert], we got a deal with CBS [CBS Records].  And you can come on down, and tell the guys to come on down and we're going to record them."  I tell the guys that they called me and they want us to come down and record.  And the guys said, "No, man, we're not coming down, because they didn't pay us.  Until they pay us, we're not coming down."  So, I'm a year behind, and I'm telling them, "Look, man, I need to go down there because I've already told them my position.  And they're telling me, 'Okay, we'll give you an advance to help you cover your stuff.'"  I says okay.  And I say, "Guys," I says, "come on, let's go."  They say, "No."  I call up Gamble and I tell him, I say, "Well, the guys don't want to come, man."  Well, he said, "Well, you come on and we'll do--we'll do you.  We'll make a record out of you."  I call the guys up and I says, "Man, look.  Man, I need this.  I got to do this for my family.  You guys need to come on and let's go."  Okay, I was going to go down by myself, but then Walter William says, "Okay, we're going to go down."  Bobby [Bobby Massey] says he's not going down, because he wants to be a producer/writer on his own, and these guys are not going to give us that break.  So, we go down and they present us with this song 'Back Stabbers.'
Speaker 2: So it's the three of you?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, just the three of us, because Bobby decides that he's not coming down and be a part of this.  But--
Speaker 2: And Billy Isles [Bill Isles] had left?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, Billy Isles had already left.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1:  	Because he had fallen in love with a girl in California.  And he told us, he said--okay, well, he took a break.  He says, "I'm going to California to visit my girlfriend.  I'll be back."  He never came back (laughter).  Okay, then we--then Bobby says, "Okay, I'm going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going to be a songwriter and producer.  I'm not going back down there."  So, I go down and I call up Walter Williams, and I said, "Man, they got this song, and they've got these songs that are really great."  They played me the 'Back Stabbers,' you are my sunshine ['Sunshine'] and all of these songs for me they played.  'Who Am I,' and they're playing these songs.  And I call them up and I say, "Man, you guys need to come on down here because they got some good stuff.  We need to be doing this stuff."  Because they would, they were going to cut me by myself.  And I talked them into coming down.  When they got there we started working on these songs, and it became, it was just phenomenal what was happening with that music.  And when I left there after we finished recording, they gave me whatever monies I needed to take care of my bills and all that.  But I knew when we left, when we left that place recording those songs, we knew that we were on our way before they even hit the street.  Because you could feel it; it was there.  All the ingredients were there, all the things that you needed.  And to get to a place like that and to know that you're going to win--you know, I mean to know that you're going to win was quite a place to be.  And it was, it was just--I sit there-- when I got back to Cleveland [Ohio], me and my friend, his name is Mark Anthony [ph.], I had this reel to reel tape recorder.  And I was, I told him to come over, and me and him sat in the middle of the floor.  He was one of my cronies who--he sang, too.  And we played that music.  And me and him, we sit there and we rocked and rocked on that music like we were in a church.  We rocked on that music all day long, all day long, just me and him sitting in my living room.  And the general consensus from the both of us was that we were on our way.  And the next time I heard this song, we were in the middle of Oklahoma, and it came on the radio in the middle of nowhere, the 'Back Stabbers.'  And I knew, I knew that we were on our way.  Then it was like, right after that, ten years of--
Speaker 2: One hit after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	--(simultaneous) back after another, right after another.
Speaker 2: One, one--
Speaker 1:  	One after another.

Speaker 1: And then, you know, then, then, then another tragedy.  William Powell, he got what they called adrena- adrenalin--in his cancer, got adrenalin [sic.].  So anytime he got excited, it would just spread all over his body.  And it finally--that was the first time I'd ever experienced cancer.  I'd never seen it what it did to people.  And you know, because he was going through changes.  And so he just automatically one day said, "I'm quitting," and went home, and we never saw him.  And then when--finally, you know, I wanted to go back and--we wanted to go back--then we heard that he was sick and that he had cancer, because he hadn't told anybody that's what was wrong.  When I went back to see him and I went to his house, he didn't--he wouldn't let us come in and see him.  He told his mom [Lenora Powell Goins] he didn't want to see us.  And I couldn't understand that.  What did we do to him to make him feel like that?  But when I finally got a chance to see what cancer does to the human body, and to him--you know, he looked like a skeleton.  He was like--I mean to me that was the most terrible-est, most awful thing I'd ever seen--somebody that I knew and loved and cared about.  And this disease had just ravaged his body, and he was down to nothing but bones.  And I couldn't believe it, you know, just unbelievable.  That to me was just unbelievable.  And losing him--and then we acquired another gentleman by the name of Mr. Sammy Strain.  And we became true superstars with Sammy Strain.  I mean the, just the level of performance, the level of presentation, and how we were able to project and do--we became a super group.  We became, we were packing in twenty thousand seats, I mean, selling millions of records.  We got to the place where they were paying us half a million dollars just to come in and record the records.  We got that money in our hands, but not really half a million, because we would have to pay for the product.  We'd probably get a quarter of a million that was in our hand, and then the other quarter of a million was spent on the product.  But not being--this is why I'm saying--still getting the education on how to get the money.  We should have always made--the deal should have been like, five hundred thousand dollars we get for that, and you pay for the product.  You know what I'm saying?  And then we, we both go from there.  But instead, you know, they said, "We're going to give you five hundred thousand, but you got to pay for the product."  Well, you're not giving me five hundred thousand when you--.  So, it's been an evolution of learning how to play on words, and how they play--how you have to structure your deal; how you have to make it be worth your while to do it and to own it.
Story_ID: 649627
Speaker 1: I want to understand.  I want to go back to this, which is really 1971 when you sign with what became known as Philly.  Was it Philly International?
Speaker 2:  	Philly International [Philadelphia International Records, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: That was what you joined when you joined?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And they had done a deal with CBS [CBS Records]?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what is this--first of all, you must have trusted Gamble [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble]?  I mean even though you were--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: You must have liked them?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I really trusted them.
Speaker 1: You must have liked them.  So, what was their vision?  What were they saying they wanted to be?
Speaker 2:  	They, they just wanted to be a record company that had super stars, and to make records and to affect the world.  All the stuff that we did with them, all the things that we did with Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Leon Huff], we became the messengers.  We became the people that was giving out the 'Love Train' message, that was giving out the 'Give the People What They Want,' the 'Survival,' the 'Unity,' the '992 Arguments,' the 'Message in our Music.'  We were, we were--see, because me and him both, he's a Jehovah's Witness too.  And we were both studying the truth, so whenever we wrote these songs we always could relate to, you know, each other as far as this is the message that needed to be put out there.  And from--once we got tired of being the messengers and we felt like we were preaching too much and beating them across the head, we started saying, "Well, the message is really, at the end of the day, it's really to love one another."  And that's when all the love songs started coming.  We started making up love songs, the love songs that say that, you know, we love each other and we should love each other.  And at the end of the day, that's the only thing that counts: love.
Story_ID: 649628
Speaker 1: I've heard a lot about Motown [Motown Records].  I've heard less about, you know, Philly International [Philadelphia International Records, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  So, I want to understand, what was the structure there?  And who was there when you got there?
Speaker 2:  	There, when we got there, Billy Paul, Phyllis Hyman, The Intruders.  Okay, let me see, The Jones Girls, Dexter Wansel.  Let me see who else.  Who else?  We had, they had a noteworthy--and at that time they were writing for everybody.  They were writing for The Jackson 5, they were writing for, they were writing for The Temps [The Temptations], and they were writing for Diana Ross.  They were, they--at that time they were really, really, really, really--and see, their music was more gospel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --orientated more so than Motown.  Motown was more of a crossover pop sound.  Ours at Philly International was more church, more gospel.
Speaker 1: I don't put Phyllis Hyman in that category.  Do you feel that?
Speaker 2:  	No, no, she was not; she was not that.
Speaker 1: She was--
Speaker 2:  	She was not that.  She was, Phyllis was like, you know, a show girl, the pop, jazz crossover; easy listening stuff, you know.  That's who Phyllis was.  And she was the only one--there was only--what's the girl--who's the girl?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  [HistoryMaker] Jean Carne.
Speaker 2:  	Jean Carne.
Speaker 1: Oh, Jean Carne, that's right.
Speaker 2:  	The same thing.
Speaker 1: That's right, the same thing.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they had that kind of sound--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --that was a little different?
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: It was definitely different from Motown.
Speaker 2:  	That's right, definitely.
Speaker 1: Definitely different, but unique voices who have--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, very, very unique voices who have their own identity of how they was going to do things, you know.
Speaker 1: So, when you are, when you--so what is the structure, though?  So, they're writing?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is this environment here?  You know, what is Philly International?
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Okay, when we come in there, you got McFadden and Whitehead [Gene McFadden and John Whitehead], who's a team within themselves.  Okay, then you got Dexter Wansel and his team of people that he writes with.  Then you got Kenny [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble] and Leon [HistoryMaker Leon Huff] who writes.  And then you got--
Speaker 1: And they write for you?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  And then you got--well, see all of these people are writing for everybody that comes through the door, the whole crew.  When The O'Jays are coming, "Who got a song for The O'Jays?"  So, all of these people are trying to present you with songs.  It's like your song.  Like 'Family Reunion' might come from three different people.  It's like the 'Back Stabbers,' that was McFadden and Whitehead who wrote that song.  But Gamble and Huff did the music for it.  You understand?  So Bunny Sigler, who wrote all the--'Let Me Make Love to You,' and you're my sunshine ['Sunshine'] all the great ballads, he was the one who did most of that writing.  And Gamble and Huff, 'She Used to be My Girl,' the 'Back Stabbers,' the 'Love Train.'  You know, those are--'Darlin' Darlin' Baby' ['Darlin' Darlin' Baby (Sweet Tender Love)'] all of those songs are them, because that's how they wrote.  Because of the way that we sing, that's why they got into more of a gospel thing.  When they got, when it came time for Teddy Pendergrass and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, they started receiving a lot of songs that we were not doing because we were the messengers.  You understand?  So they, consequently they gave them those ballads.  They gave them, you know, 'Close the Door' and all that.  I hated them for it.  I really wanted those songs for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, wait.  So, within the shop they decided who would--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --get what songs?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And would you ever compete for them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) I would never, I would never hear the song.  I would never hear the song until he had done it.  They would never play it for me, because they, they know I would want it, you know what I'm saying.  And they would never do it.  They said, "This is for you, this is for him."
Story_ID: 649629
Speaker 1: And they basically groomed the song for you.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1:  	Well, see, Teddy Pendergrass was groomed.  They groomed him to be that, you know what I'm saying.
Speaker 2: But, you came in already sort of ready made, in some respect (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: You just needed--
Speaker 1:  	Right, I just needed--
Speaker 2: They have the song?
Speaker 1:  	Right.  And they felt like that they could give us anything.  And--
Speaker 2: That would sound good?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah.  And we can--, "You guys don't, we don't need to pick a spot for you.  Just sing this, and it's going to happen for you."
Speaker 2: But you became--you were franchised with them?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: A huge franchise.
Speaker 1:  	Right, right.
Speaker 2: So how much was your franchise worth during that--your association?  How much, how much--
Speaker 1:  	How much money did I make with them (laughter)?
Speaker 2: How much money--
Speaker 1:  	(Laughter) I made a lot of money.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You won't say how much money?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, I made a lot of money.  It was a lot of money (laughter).
Speaker 2: But is the deal structured right there?
Speaker 1:  	You know, we kept changing.
Speaker 2: You kept changing?
Speaker 1:  	We kept changing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	We kept adjusting, kept adjusting.  Because--
Speaker 2: But who is managing you?  That's what--
Speaker 1:  	At this time we've always managed ourselves.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1:  	Don't you understand?  I keep--everybody that--after Eddie O'Jay, everybody that came in to manage The O'Jays, it was like, "Okay, here.  You got a good business head on yourself.  Look, here's what we're going to do.  We're going to give you 10 percent to be our mouthpiece.  We're going to tell you what to say and how we want to say it.  And this is what you got to do."  But every time we did that, these people, you know, they always felt like they were not--
Speaker 2: It wasn't quite enough (simultaneous).
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, they were worth more than what we--, "Look, you're not giving me my credit."
Speaker 2: Okay, you were cheating?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	"You're not giving me my credit."  But I'm telling you now that this is all--at the end of the day, it's always about what the artist wants to do.  No matter what the manager is saying, if the artist has a vision, it's always about what the artist wants to do.  It has nothing to do with--managers cannot--you can't sell a turd if it's a turd.  It's a turd, you understand?  But if you have something of quality and you know that you have something of quality, that's the thing. We together can make it happen.  Most people don't want to feel that way.  Managers want to feel like I took you and I made you do this.  No, no, I'm the artist, I'm the product.  You know what I'm saying?  So, I've learned this over time now.  This is not something I came in the game and knew from jump street.  No, this is what I learned, that I am the commodity and I do have a voice in what goes on.
Speaker 2: Okay, but they have to have a system of some sort so, I mean internally.  So you're your own people, sort of, internally.  You're your own franchise.  You're making a ton of money and they're making a ton of money.  But the question is, what is the touring schedule?  You know, who's deciding when you go on tours?  How often are you going on tours (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) I decide that.
Speaker 2: You do?
Speaker 1:  	This is my body.  This is what I do.  I decide when I'm going to go on tour.  They--you can suggest and say to me, "This is the time you should do it.  This is what you think."  "Okay, I agree.  Let's do it."  It took me a long time.
Story_ID: 649630
Speaker 1: But wait a minute.
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter).
Speaker 1: You are still young.  I mean, this is the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're talking about later.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: You're t- you aren't talking--are you talking about the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I'm telling you.  At that time we were--we've been running ourselves for the longest.  Do you understand?  Now, that might have been to our detriment, because you know, there is the good old boy network.  And unless you are in our network, you know, we're not going to deal with you.  So, I--you know, some of those changes had to be made in our thinking and in the way we wanted to do business.  I might have to deal with a Dan Cleary.  I might have to deal with the big time manager, the guy who feels like he's got the connections.  I might have to say, "Okay, you're going to be the man.  Go ahead, but it's still my choice."
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how often--because you're having--I mean literally you're having hit after hit.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: These songs are songs that just make black people--I mean I'm not saying that--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: But when you make a hit, you make--
Speaker 2:  	I understand what you're saying.
Speaker 1: --they make people happy.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean they are--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: They go to your, almost your soul.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, what is--so you're in the studio?  How often are you in the studio?
Speaker 2:  	At least once a year.
Speaker 1: At least once a year.
Speaker 2:  	At least once a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And then when we go in there, it's usually--we cut--.  And look, we were so good at this that we would, we could cut an album in one day, twelve songs.  But we'd be, we'd be well rehearsed.  Now, understand, when we go in there and record these things in one day, we have rehearsed for six months.  We know the songs by heart, so now all we got to do is go in there and sing and deliver them.  So, we were able to do that.  And, you know, to me that was really phenomenal.  That was a testament to hard work and dedication and rehearsing.  And there's nothing like repetition.
Story_ID: 649631
Speaker 1: And during this process, now, what really helped us to maintain the level of professionalism and the level of presentation as we presented ourselves as an act, was Charlie Atkins [Cholly Atkins].  Charlie Atkins was very much a--I attribute our success in three ways.  First of all, it was The O'Jays.  Secondly, it was [HistoryMaker] Kenny Gamble and [HistoryMaker] Leon Huff.  Third, Charlie Atkins, which gave us the strength to still be here today, to be who we are today.
Speaker 2: Now, why did you--
Speaker 1:  	This is why we're still earning money, because of that third entity.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1:  	Mr. Charlie Atkins.
Speaker 2: So, when did he come into the picture?  Because he wasn't--
Speaker 1:  	In 1972.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1:  	That's when he jumped in there, about 1972, '71 [1971], yeah.
Speaker 2: So what does he bring?  Because--
Speaker 1:  	He brought to the table--he brought the choreography, the look, the presentation.  You know, his favorite thing was, I'm going to take these chitterlings and we're going to put them under glass and put a tablecloth on them, and we're going to put the silverware around it, and it's going to be something really fresh.  He used to call us chitterlings, because we were--because everything was so primitive, so earthy, you know.  And what he gave us has made it so we're still a valuable entity today.  And he is that third ingredient that it took to make us, to make us last this long.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, because it's a shame that we couldn't have interviewed him.  Because--
Speaker 1:  	Oh, you would have loved it.
Speaker 2: Because this is the thing.  I thought he was Motown [Motown Records].
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then I learned that, you know, he was Gladys Knight and the Pips--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and he's also The O'Jays.
Speaker 1:  	Yes.
Speaker 2: So, he was like--
Speaker 1:  	He was all over the place.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1:  	All over.  He was the reason why The Spinners--he was the reason why The Temps [The Temptations]--he--
Speaker 2: So he's giving everyone their look?
Speaker 1:  	He's giving--everybody who you see from that era--Diana Ross, the Four Tops, The Spinners, The O'Jays, the Gladys Knight and the Pips--you name them, he did them.
Speaker 2: So, what-- what is a favorite Charlie Atkins story?  Can you give me one?
Speaker 1:  	(Laughter) Charlie Atkins.  Charlie Atkins have made grown men cry, you know what I'm saying.  I mean he is, he is the--Charlie Atkins.  And see, the good part of it is that he would teach you this stuff.  And he's an older man now.  He was older than all of us at this time.  He would teach you this stuff, and then he would get up and do it with you.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean every step of the way.  And then his favorite saying was: repetition is the key to all of this.  And it's so true, sweetheart.  Because now, what happens now is that we only rehearse once a year.  We might rehearse maybe for six or eight weeks and then that's it; we don't rehearse no more.  But we rehearse so much, to the point that when you hear the music, the feet automatically does what they're supposed to do.  The voice automatically is where it's supposed to be, because repetitions--over and over, the process of doing it over and over again until it becomes second nature, until it becomes something.  And see, his whole thing was you practice it the way you're going to do it.  There's no halfway practice.  You practice it how you're going to do it when you do it live for the money.  That's the way you practice it, like you're doing it for the money.  And you will always do it the correct way when you practice it that way.
Speaker 2: So he--when he--you would practice in front of a mirror, I would take it?  Right?  No?
Speaker 1:  	No, in front of him (laughter).  In front of him.  He'd put down four plastic cups--three plastic cups.  That would be your microphone.  And you had to work that way.  And he'd show you how your hands are supposed to be, how your feet are supposed to be, where your head is supposed to be, how you're supposed to be standing, how you're supposed to take the bow, how you're supposed to do the whole nine yards; how you're supposed to talk, all of that.  He teaches you all of that.  He was good for me, he was really good for me.  And you know, I'm still making a living because of what he taught me.  And anybody--and if you talk to Gladys, if you talk to any of them, they say the same thing, don't they?  Don't they say it?  They say the same identical thing, because they can't help themselves, because that's the real part of it.  He's the--he's the man.  I, you know, I used to argue with this man like, "Come on, man."  Because he'd push you; he'd push you hard, hard, hard.  "Oh, man, what's wrong with you?  Oh, man, stop it.  You're just trying to embarrass me."  (Laughter) But here I am.
Story_ID: 649632
Speaker 1:  	(Laughter) It's been ten years, and it's been just hunky dory (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, I mean you--well, I'm trying to--I mean I know 'Back Stabbers' was--
Speaker 1:  	(Laughter) You're trying to what? What are you trying?
Speaker 2: I mean it wasn't a blur, though?  Was it--
Speaker 1:  	No, not really.
Speaker 2: Okay, so talk about--
Speaker 1:  	It was like--
Speaker 2: Talk about your time on the road, or talk about your favorite songs.  Or--
Speaker 1:  	During the, during this--
Speaker 2: I want you to--
Speaker 1:  	During this period is when I ended up in a lot of trouble, you know.  That's when you got to be careful for the things that you ask for, you know.  Up until that point, up until the success of the 'Back Stabbers' and the 'Love Train,' and all of those things, I basically led a pretty sheltered life, you know what I'm saying.  I was married [to Martha Levert].  I didn't do--I didn't get out that much.  And then when 'Back Stabbers' and all those things started happening--
Speaker 2: And the women are throwing their panties up on the stage.
Speaker 1:  	Oh, oh, yeah.  Now, see, this is what you were trying to get to.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But no, but women are like--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, they're, they're coming, they're coming out of the woodwork.  And I get, you know, I get caught up in it.  I get caught in it, the drug situation (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were a lot of drugs, a lot of drugs.
Speaker 1:  	I'm, I'm--
Speaker 2: There's a lot of cocaine.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, I'm caught up in that; I'm in that mixture.  But I think the one thing that really saved me from going all the way into that, into that dark place, was the fact that I was still very much into the church and trying to do the right thing.  So, I think it saved me a lot from going all the way in, you know, putting both feet into it and doing the whole nine yards.  Yeah, I sort of destroyed my marriage during that period, because, you know, I just caught up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there were a lot of temptations.
Speaker 1:  	A lot, a lot of things going on.
Speaker 2: And a lot of money.  How much--you didn't even tell me how much money.  You have a lot of money.
Speaker 1:  	It's a lot of, it was a lot of money.
Speaker 2: So what are you doing with that?
Speaker 1:  	Having a good time.  Buying--I bought, you know, I bought this great big house and I redid the whole house and put my own pool, my own tennis court in it.  I redid the whole, the whole inside of the house.  I had a carriage house, three acres.  Now we're, I've got three acres of land in Shaker Heights [Ohio], the prime area in Cleveland [Ohio].  And I'm redoing the whole property.  I'm putting in sewers, I'm putting in the tennis court, a whole new carriage house, whole new driveways.  And I've got a Mercedes [Mercedes Benz], I've got a Rolls Royce.  You know, I'm still trying to invest my money wisely, but at this time I also get in trouble because we run into a bad accountant who takes, who steals the money and buys his mom houses, and friends--
Speaker 2: Now, what year was that, that you're talking about?
Speaker 1:  This was around--oh god, this had to be around, eighty--eighty--eighty what-- '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: The early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, or the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: The late '80s [1980s].  But your son [Gerald Levert] had started his group.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, but see, this is when all of this started happening, you know what I'm saying.  I end up--and now that, you know, he's absconded with the money, now the government says that I owe them so much money.
Speaker 2: In taxes.
Speaker 1:  	And I'm too busy having fun to pay attention to my business, and when I look around a three hundred thousand dollar debt turns into a two million debt.  And now they want the money, and I don't have it.  And now they want to take my houses and my cars.  And in the meantime, I'm still trying to work on my son and his project.
Story_ID: 649633
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your--why are you laugh- well I'm just--why don't you paint life as it was?
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) What are you talking about?
Speaker 1: You're very descriptive.
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter).
Speaker 1: You proved it in the first part of your interview.  Your memory just got erased?
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But no, describe life.
Speaker 2:  	Okay, I'm really--
Speaker 1: I mean you--
Speaker 2:  	I'm all over the place.  I'm having a great time.  I'm doing what I want to do, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're playing, you're playing to large venues?
Speaker 2:  	Big venues.
Speaker 1: Who's booking you?
Speaker 2:  	This is, now we're probably--I think William Morris [William Morris Agency; William Morris Endeavor] and, what is it?
Speaker 1: Which is a top agency.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah, William Morris.  We're freelancing a lot, too.  We're taking, we're taking whatever--
Speaker 1: Well, you left Quentin [Quentin Perry] at this time?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, we're still taking stuff from them, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	We're freelancing.  We never really signed exclusively with anyone.  We always wanted to keep it open, and whoever came up with the most money we could deal with it.  I get in a place, and I meet--I do one--from one bad thing to the next.  You know, I'm now, I'm fooling around with drugs.  And I--one of the worst mistakes I made was that I meet this woman and I start liking her.  And I decide I can't live without her.  Unbelievable.  So, I decide that I'm going to leave home.  And now I--I had no intentions of really leaving home, but I got to feeling bad, because now--you know, my wife [Levert's first wife, Martha Levert] had never done anything bad to me.  And I felt like I was a louse and, so I needed to--let her be free, because I was not going to be right.  But little did I know, the woman that I was messing around with was my son's best friend's mother.  Do you understand?  And when I find that out, it's too late.  I've done it, and now he's embarrassed, and the whole family is embarrassed.  And now I'm just, I'm just out there, you know.  And he, then that creates a rift between me and him, and a rift between me and the whole family.
Story_ID: 649634
Speaker 1: And you know, I'm, I'm--I've been also trying to get him a recording deal, because I've spent my money to record him.  I've spent all my money--I'm running around for about a year with his tapes under my arm trying to get a deal for him to make.
Speaker 2: Now he's, he's at that point in his twenties?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think, yeah.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: He's in his twenties.
Speaker 1:  	He's--
Speaker 2: How did you know he had talent?  This is Gerald [Gerald Levert] we are talking about.
Speaker 1:  	Because me and him, we had worked--we had been together, we had been--I had built something like a little stage in the basement and we had drums and a piano.  And me and him and Sean [Sean Levert], we'd get down there and play and mess around and record different things.  So, I'd been working with them for a long time because I've known--from the time he turned fourteen I started working with him and trying to do it, because we had our own studio at this time.  So we would take him in the studio and record and do his voice.  And so I spent money on recording this album on him, and so I'm running around for about a year trying to deal it off.  Now, everybody I'm trying to deal this album off to, they're telling me, "Eddie [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert], he sounds so much like you.  What's going to happen?  What are you going to do?"  Look, if my kid can knock me out of the business, then I deserve to be knocked out of the business.  See, look, he needs a break.  I am not going to sacrifice what's happening--.  Because see, Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble and HistoryMaker Leon Huff], I took it to them first, and they told me, "Well, okay, look, we're going to put him on the shelf for five years, and keep working with you and make it happen.  And then we'll pull him off later on and make it happen."
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1:  	"No."
Speaker 2: Well, because--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you were a proven entity.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.  I'm telling them, "No, you can't do that.  I'm not going to do that to my kid.  You got to put him out now."  "Well, then, what we going to do with you?"  "Well, if I am not worthy, then I need to be out.  Look, let's do this.  Let's put him out." They wouldn't do it.  So, finally I ran into Sylvia Rhone and Hank Caldwell, and we--
Speaker 2: And Sylvia is where at this point?
Speaker 1:  	She's working, she's Hank Caldwell's secretary.  She's not the person.  Hank Caldwell is the man.  She's his--
Speaker 2: And this is, Hank Caldwell is where?  He's with--?
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah, he's, he's over at Atlantic Records.  And he's, they're saying, "Okay, I'm talking to Hank to get them a deal."  Okay, he wants to sign him.  Okay, Sylvia is his right arm, that's his girl.  She's working on it.  So they're working together to make this deal.  So, we make the deal and I tell them the only way I'm going to make a deal for him is that he's got to produce half of his records and he's got to write half of it, and he's got to publish half of his music.  I was like, "I can't make the deal with you."  And they balked at first, and then I held out and they finally submitted to it.  A, look, he's going to write half of the album, no matter what.  He's going to write and he's going to produce half of it, and he's going to be able to publish it.  Because I've learned that this is where the money is, and this is how he's going to take care of his family, with this, this agreement.  So, you know, they put out that first record called 'Pop Pop Goes My Mind' ['Pop Pop Pop Goes My Mind'] which is a song that he had wrote.  And they put that out; and, and look, the rest was history.
Story_ID: 649635
Speaker 1: But see, we never got past that rift of me and him [Levert's son, Gerald Levert] and his best friend's mom, you know what I'm saying.  They, kids always think that you're the bad guy when you leave their mother, I don't care who you are.  You know, you're the bad guy (laughter).  And so, you know, we still had a great relationship, a great relationship.  Then--
Speaker 2: But it was, that was hard for him.
Speaker 1:  	Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, because boys need their fathers.
Speaker 1:  	Absolutely, absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know that.  Okay now, that was hard for him.  But at the same time, you're enjoying this--I mean--
Speaker 1:  	Yes.
Speaker 2: --this huge success.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And I'd take them on the road with me.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1:  	But see, I showed them the wrong image.  They got a chance to see me in these, in these very bad situations.  And it also affected them to the point of them thinking that, you know, this is the way it should be, and this is how I'm going to be.  And I'm going to be on the road.  I showed them the wrong way.  I showed them--I was not, I was not correct, you know what I'm saying.  And then some of this I blame on what happened to them later on, as far as them passing away and getting mixed up with so many different women and having child support and all that.  I sort of have to take--I sort of have to take the weight for that, because I was the image.  I was the, I was the guy that should have been able to direct them and make it better for them to see a better way of it, you know.  But I didn't, you know; and I think some of this rolled over and had something to do with what happened to them later.
Story_ID: 649636
Speaker 1: I want to go back still to the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s], and that's the whole thing.  You say you're learning as you're going along?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, at what point are you learning that you need to have a percentage of the writing and a percentage of the publishing?  Because you never touched upon that.  Is that, is that how--that's not the deal you come into Philly International [Philadelphia International Records, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with, is it?  Or am I--?
Speaker 2:  	At that--when we came into, when we came back to Philly International--
Speaker 1: Came back.
Speaker 2:  	For the time when they--after the Leonard Chess situation--when we came back, now I've learned that we need to write and we need to produce.  Okay, because remember I told you earlier that Bobby Massey didn't come back because he wanted to produce and write now more so.  But I learned that this was, at least this was an avenue to get back into the mix.  Let me get back in the mix, and then I can--because the first songs that we brought back to Philly International were songs that we wrote, and that me and Walter [Walter Williams] were singing the lead on.  The two of us were singing.  Before, it was just me singing the lead on a lot of the songs.  Then this time coming back, me and him had wrote this song called 'It's Too Strong,' where me and him was doing this switch lead on it, with very gospel like overtones.  And that gave Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble and HistoryMaker Leon Huff] the direction where they should go, from listening to that song.  It gave them--how to cut The O'Jays and to make it happen.  That's when we started doing double leads, on the 'Back Stabbers.'  That's when they--because we took them that demo with us doing double leads, and they started using double leads on those songs from that moment on, and became a success.  From that moment on, every time that I wrote a song, they had to give me credit on it.
Speaker 1: So, which songs are the songs you did with them?
Speaker 2:  	On that first album was a song called 'It's Too Strong.'  And then on that song where the--(singing), "Can't nobody ever break us up," I wrote that along with Leon Huff.  And that--they had to give me part of that writer's.  So, all of--from that early--from that album, from the 'Back Stabbers' on, we were getting two songs on each record that we had the writers and the publishing on.  And that, from that point on, that's when we started participating in what was going on behind the scenes.
Speaker 1: And then was the whole experience with Philly International a positive one from beginning to end?
Speaker 2:  	I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I really think so.  You know, there's been a lot of water under the bridge since then, and a lot of people have said a lot of things.  But I--you know, a lot of people feel like they should have gotten more than what they deserve.
Speaker 1: Got from it.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's hard running a record business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --sometimes.
Speaker 2:  	Yes, absolutely.  But you can't, you can't--those guys put in a lot of work, and they deserve what they got.  We didn't put in that much work, and we deserve what we got.
Speaker 1: You didn't put--you mean but you had your natural talent.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: But you're talking about the distribution (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, and the writing and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: --and the promotion and the writing.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they were writing?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, and then they would write.  That was their, that was their niche.  That was how they were going to get paid.  We were going to get--see, when you're an artist you get paid--the artists.  And if you write, you get paid--the writers.  And if you do the music, you get--producers.  And if you're a publisher, you get the publishing.  And then you get the money from personal appearances.  Five monies.  So if you're on your job, you get paid five ways.  It's like Beyonce [Beyonce Knowles].  She's getting five monies.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	As the artist, she's getting royalties.  She's writing, she's producing, she's publishing.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2:  	And she gets personal appearances.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And that's, that's why we're still in the game.  That's why we're still around, because we're getting it like that.  And maybe we're not getting it as we could have been getting it, if we had been more diligent and worked and put more into it.  You know, that's what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	You know--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	--you get what you put in.  You know, if you don't put it in, then you ain't got--you don't have anything coming.
Story_ID: 649637
Speaker 1: So, well what were some of those high points during that ten year period that you can remember?  I mean like, whether it's a performance, a specific performance, or?
Speaker 2:  	We did, we were doing everything.  We were doing, we were doing Dinah Shore ['Dinah!'].  We were doing 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'].  We were doing--you name it.  We were doing 'Midnight Special' ['The Midnight Special'].  We were doing all the, all the big TV shows, 'Shindig!', all of that, hullabaloo.  We were doing whatever it was.  They were introducing us, we were introduced to the president of the company.  We were in his office having drinks, you know what I'm saying.  They, we were that kind of commodity, that they were trying to make sure that we were happy and that we stayed--that we stayed comfortable with what we were doing.  That to me was a highlight, and a lot of--and also working from the standpoint of what we were able to do as far as the business was concerned.  You got people like Alan Haymon [Al Haymon] now who runs the boxing--really runs the boxing world.  We started him.  We put--
Speaker 1: The Al Haymon productions.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, we put him in the game.  We were his first big act that he--he begged us to let him promote some of our shows.  We put him in the game.  Quentin Perry, we put him in the game.  We were the guys who were saying, "Okay, you can be the promoter."  We were the first act to put a, to let black promoters promote a show from West Coast to the East Coast, with Lewis Gray, Quentin Perry, we--Al Haymon.  All of these people, we put them in the game.  We made them.  We--through us, they became who they are.  And then they had to do the rest of the work, but we helped them to do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because Al Haymon came out of Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2:  	That's right.
Speaker 1: That's where he was--
Speaker 2:  	That's right.  And we helped, we put--ask him, he'll tell you.  We put him there.  We made it possible for him to be who he is now.  Because we were that--we were that group.  We were those people that could pull that and say, "We are, we made it so these kids could get paid right now."  Do you understand?  We were the first act to tell them, "Okay, you cannot pay me now--you can't pay me that twenty-five thousand.  Now, what you can do, I'll take 80 percent and you get 20."
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 649638
Speaker 1: So when did you start doing that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) We started that as soon as we were able to do twenty thousand seat joints.  Every time that we went on tour, the people like the Al Haymons, the Quentin Perrys and all of the--the Lewis Grays and all those people--we had--they--you get 80, we'll take 20 [percent].  Okay, that's after expenses, you know what I'm saying.  And we ran all over the country with that.  The first time that The Commodores came out, for two years they were our opening act.  And we, we just kept--you know, there comes a time when you get too smart for your own good, when you think that you're the--we were the people's champs.  We thought we were the people's champs.  And then they came to us and they said, "Okay, guys.  We want you to take The Commodores out.  We can get The Commodores for ten thousand dollars a night.  And you guys are the headliners and it's basically your tour."  We told them okay.  We had done that for two years in a row.  We don't want to do that no more, we don't want to do that.  We want to take some unknown acts that we're producing and we want to go on the road.  And we're going to do our show and we're going to map it around The O'Jays, because we're the people's champs.  And they say, "No, we think that's a big mistake.  You should have at least one other act that is your--that is comparable, to draw the people in the place."  And we felt like we were strong enough to go out there and get this done on our own and we could have unknown acts.  Now, not thinking within ourselves that these promoters, they can't let us do that.  If we do that, we're calling our own shots and they're no longer of any value.  So, they can't let us do this.  But we're, we're determined to do it, and we're going to do it.  "We're going to do it.  You guys are not going to be a part of it.  We're running this show."  You know what they did?   Let me tell you what they did.  We booked our tour.  We spent at least five hundred thousand dollars on staging and props and everything.  We got semi-trucks, we got the whole nine yards.  We got sound lights.  We're carrying everything.  Okay, we book our show.  We start on Thursday and we go Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  We book our show on Thursday, and say like Thursday we're in New York City [New York, New York].  Okay, you know how they shut us down and made us not be able to pull it off?  On Thursday night when we get to New York, they got Earth, Wind and Fire; Parliament and the Funkadelic [Parliament-Funkadelic] and The Isley Brothers, and maybe The Commodores and three or four other people, down the street from us.  Where it's just The O'Jays and some unknown acts.  And they're charging--we're charging the same amount of money that they're charging for these acts that they got names already.  And when we get there, we ain't sold no tickets, and they sold all the tickets (laughter).  They did that at every city that we went into.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2:  	That was 1977.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2:  	A valuable lesson, a very, very--that taught us, that gave us, they taught us one valuable lesson.
Speaker 1: So, what promoters were these?  Were they--?
Speaker 2:  	It was the same ones we got started.
Speaker 1: That you got started?
Speaker 2:  	The same ones we started (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, they turned--not turned on you, but they weren't--
Speaker 2:  	No, they--
Speaker 1: They were saying--
Speaker 2:  	They were saying we cannot, we cannot let you pull this off.  If you pull this off, then you don't need us anymore.  So, now let us show you what we can do to prevent you from doing it.  Oh, yeah, it was a rude, rude--it was, it was very nasty--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you decided--
Speaker 2:  	See, this is what I'm telling you.  We were, we were in control of what we were do- we were running things.  And they, and they shut us down because we were not clever enough.  We got too smart for our own britches, where we--if we had stayed where we were and if we had used our head, I would have probably been somewhere on an island now, not having to work at all.  You know what I'm saying?  Because--but it was just one move too much.
Speaker 1: Too much.
Story_ID: 649639
Speaker 1:  	Do you understand?  One move too swift, one move just too smart for my own britches, or too smart for our own britches; and it hurt us.  And they, and then we had to fight to come back, now.  We had to fight to get back.  We had to--and you know the song that saved us, that got us back?  'She Used to be My Girl.'  Because that ended up right around the time that they were doing 'Saturday Night Fever,' and Dick Clark was doing all of that 'Saturday Night Fever' stuff.  And we'd always had a relationship with him, and we ended up on a lot of those 'Saturday Night Fever' specials.  Because we were The O'Jays and we were doing a hit song called 'She Used to be My Girl,' and Dick Clark came along and helped us to stay in the game.  He sort of helped us stay in the game, because at that point it could have been either way.  We could have been in or out, you know.  We're survivors.  We've been able to stick around, to stick around and come back from adversity and from making bad mistakes.  We made some tr- see, you finally got to some of the things you wanted (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's good, though.
Story_ID: 649640
Speaker 1: So, now what brought 'Family Reunion'?  Do you, did you--what is your feeling?  Because that song is what every family--
Speaker 2:  	That's a, that's a, that's a song for every family.  That's a song for every family that has a family and had a grandmother or--you know, it's a song that speaks for all people, not just for black people or white.  It speaks for all people and their relationship with their family.  This song--and you know, the monologue and all of that comes strictly from the Jehovah's Witness influence, of, you know, of fathers and mothers, and dad should be the leader and the mom should be caring and help the father to--all of that comes from my Jehovah's Witness teachings and readings in the Bible.  And those, that's where I got that.
Speaker 1: So, who wrote that song?
Speaker 2:  	[HistoryMaker] Kenny Gamble wrote that.  Me and him together wrote the monologue.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.  So when do things together, then you share the writer's credit?
Speaker 2:  	On that song?
Speaker 1: On that song.
Speaker 2:  	Not on that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	See, I let him get me real good.  I should have told him, "You need to pay me for my monologue."  But, you know, at that time you're just being creative.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And you're just adding something to the pot.  The song was already the song.  But all I did was add, you know, the monologue.  And you know, it's--it done good for me, you know, because I'm still, you know, I'm still around.  It still, it still serves its purpose.  I think you get what you--you get what you deserve (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 649641
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.  Where was I--
Speaker 2: I'm not going--
Speaker 1: Oh no the structure of the show?  Who decides--
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) It always--look, it starts--I'm going to be perfectly honest with you and say it always starts with me.  I'm the guy who's creating and thinking about these things.  When I see the song--you know, it's like 'Ship Ahoy.'  The first thought in my head is when I see that song I think about slaves.  And then I'll go to somebody like Charlie Atkins [Cholly Atkins], who can see the vision and also know how to bring the vision to reality.  Okay, that's when you want to do something that's visual.  Now when you want to, when you're just thinking about putting songs into position and figuring out what song goes--.  Now it's like, right now we got a--the show right now consists of--our opening number is a song called 'Unity.'  And the second song--and we do a three song medley as we open up.  The first song is called 'Unity,' the second song is called 'Survival,' and the third song is called 'Give the People What They Want.'  Okay, now the reason why I wanted to do that is because we're living in a very rough time, so we need to know that unity--we, black, white--no matter what color you are, we need to stick together because we're all in this together.  And in 'Survival,' it's talking about survival of the fittest.  That means that right now you got to think about how you're going to survive, and what you have to do to survive; to help your neighbor survive and you to survive.  That's, that's the message there.  And now we get to give the people what they want.  Now we got unity: stick together, we need to survive.  And now we give the people what they want.  I think it's a great message.  I think it's a positive message.  I think that more people need to hear positive things.  And that's why I picked those songs, because they are very relative in what they're saying in trying to build up people, and have a positive outlook on what tomorrow might bring.
Speaker 1: But isn't that--what you just said, isn't that at the beginning and end of The O'Jays in many ways, is giving people what they want?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Story_ID: 649642
Speaker 1: And you also--you know, I think--when I think of you--I mean, I know you have an international audience.  But I think a lot of--it's, it's very black focused.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: In many ways (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: It speaks to the black experience.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: In a positive way.
Speaker 2:  	Definitely, definitely.  When you get down to songs like 'Stairway to Heaven,' something that--those--that is the churchiest of church.  That is the spiritual of spiritual.  You know, that's digging in--we're going to go--we're going to climb--and all the elements is of church, all the elements.  All of the--you get to--and when you, when you think about songs like 'Loving You' ['Lovin' You'], which is truly a great ballad which talks about loving--of you loving your woman and how you love her.  And then 'Forever Mine,' that gives you the depths of--well, see, it's really the total R and B song of describing what love is about.  'Living for the Weekend' ['Livin' for the Weekend'], everybody black looks for Friday, you know what I'm saying, and we're going to party all the way until Sunday.  And then Monday, it's back on the grind.  That is something.  And then when you get down to the end of that and you go to talking about, Monday, I'm tired, dead on my feet.  Tuesday, I'm too tired to eat.  Wednesday, I'm tired, I want to, I got to go to bed.  Thursday, I dread getting up because I got to do the--. Friday is the day that's the end of the week.  I party down.  I'm going to get off, I'm gonna go to happy hour.  I'm going to take a drink, and then I go to Saturday we're going to have a fish fry.  We're going to dance a little bit.  We're going to have a wonderful time.  That's, this is all my heritage that I'm talking about.  Then on Sunday we go to church, and I try to regroup enough to get up on Monday and start all over again.  This is heritage.  This is who I am.  This is what I am.  This is my people's talk, and whoever else that can relate to it, you know what I'm saying.  If you feel it, then you're a part of it.  And--
Speaker 1: You know, I got, I was getting a little emotional there right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) (Laughter).
Story_ID: 649643
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the reason--I just have to say--I was (unclear) outside myself, but I was just thinking also that this period that we're talking about--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, I mean the music that was being made was all so positive.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And it represented hope and love and happiness and--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --then I don't know what happened.  But anyway (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	No, well--
Speaker 1: I mean not--but your songs represented that.  I mean they--you know, people--
Speaker 2:  	Well, see, because that was their environment.  That's where he comes from.  That's why his songs are going to be where they're at forever, because he--that's what he grew up in.
Speaker 1: It's a continuation.
Speaker 2:  	Now, understand where these other kids are.  They grew up in the street, and this is what they know.  This is what they've been brought up in.  This is the environment that we left them to be subject to.  And that's why they can use the B word.  That's why they use the N word like that.  And you know, remember now, we're just as guilty as they, because we use the N word when we get angry, or either when we want to say it in affection, you know.  We even say "That's my--," you know what I'm saying.  We still do that, and now we still want to say okay, we shouldn't use it anymore because it's, because the white element has used it in such a derogatory fashion that we now feel ashamed because that's what we used to call each other in affection.  Okay, now I don't know whether that's a double standard.  I don't--I think it is, I really do.  I really think that, you know--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2:  	--you know it's like they--white people will call each other crackers.
Speaker 1: Right.  But you--
Speaker 2:  	They will do that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: But you can have a positive and a negative connotation.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You're talking about--but--
Speaker 2:  	But if you're saying it in a negative way, then it's going to be negative.  But if you're saying it in a positive way, then you shouldn't get offended by it, you know, because some white people get very comfortable with you, and they'll feel like they can say the N word.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	And you--but yet and still, we as black people have a tendency to say, "Well, you can't say that, but I can say that."  That to me is bull.  That's really, that's really, that's really--I don't know.  Who are you people that you want to--you're going to sit up there and say this?  This is crazy.  This is--if you--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2:  	It should be--if you're going to--if you're not going to use it--
Speaker 1: Then nobody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	--(simultaneous) then nobody should use it.
Speaker 1: Nobody should use it.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1:  That's what I believe.
Story_ID: 649644
Speaker 1: But (clears throat) the thing is--so let's talk about the group [The O'Jays], though.  Who is--so are you in charge of the group?  Who, who is the--who--is it a--
Speaker 2:  	Me--me and Mr. Williams [Walter Williams], we run the group.
Speaker 1: Because you--
Speaker 2:  	We run the group.  But, you know, I'm the more visible part.  I'm the more, I'm the more vocal.  He, you know, he complains a lot (laughter).  He don't say a lot; he just complains a lot.  You know--
Speaker 1: But look how long you've known each other.  You're talking about over--
Speaker 2:  	Well, because, because--you know--
Speaker 1: Almost sixty--
Speaker 2:  	He knows that I'm going to be me, no matter what happens, you know.  I don't--you know--
Speaker 1: Well, what are the group dynamics though? That's what I'm trying--there're--what--
Speaker 2:  	There's three.
Speaker 1: There's three.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Three of you?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, two of you have known each other for--
Speaker 2:  	Forever.
Speaker 1: --for over--right, forever.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Almost sixty years.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  And the guy in the middle now, he's been with us now for about eighteen years.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	He's just--remember this.  He's an employee, that's what he is.  And me and Mr. Williams own--he owns 50 percent and I own the other 50 percent.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And we make the decisions.  And--
Speaker 1: But the other person, who was the person?  Oh, god--
Speaker 2:  	William Powell.
Speaker 1: No, not--William Powell left.  But then--
Speaker 2:  	William--
Speaker 1: Strain.
Speaker 2:  	William--Sammy Strain was an employee.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was?  Oh.
Speaker 2:  	He was always an employee.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	The only other person that still gets paid off of that name is William Powell and Walt Williams and [HistoryMaker] Eddie Levert.
Speaker 1: Because they own a good--
Speaker 2:  	We own the name (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 2:  	We own the name.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you--did you buy--?  Okay, so--
Speaker 2:  	We've always owned the name.
Speaker 1: You've always owned the name.
Speaker 2:  	Always.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	Always.  We, we, we might appear to be dumb, but not really (laughter).
Story_ID: 649645
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what, so what is your favorite Walt [Walter Williams] story?  Because that's like a marri- that's even--you haven't been married to anyone--
Speaker 2:  	Walt, Walt story, my favorite Walt story?  Oh, god, there's so many.
Speaker 1: Give me two or three.
Speaker 2:  	You know, the end of what really created a--I'm going to give you one that really created a rift.  Remember we talked about when his eye, he almost lost--he almost went blind in this one eye.  He was in the hospital.  He was in the hospital and I went up to see him.  And when I saw him, he had the patch all on the side and he was laying up there.  And he and I, we'd been friends since grade school [J.J. Burns School, Canton, Ohio], you know, and I'd never seen him like that.  And I was so hurt and I cried so much, because you know, I was so afraid that he was losing his eye.  And I cried, and it hurt me so bad that I never went back to the hospital.  And because I never went back, he never quite forgave me for that.  You know, we've gotten past it now, but he never quite forgave me for that, and I never quite forgave myself for that, because it was total selfishness that I was only thinking about me and how it was hurting me to go see him like that.  So I never went back to the hospital, and I never saw him until he was out of the hospital, which was a bad, bad, bad thing.
Speaker 1: And you still became--now that's very interesting.  Because you still, you still performed and went on tour, a fabulous career.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because some people--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, he--but he, but he--
Speaker 1: He held it inside.
Speaker 2:  	He held it, he held it, he held it.  But we were able to talk about it and get over it.  I was able to get to him and say, "You know, man, that was a bad thing, a bad thing."
Speaker 1: When did that come out, though?  When did that come out?
Speaker 2:  	When did it come out for us?  Back, it had to be about fifteen years ago.
Speaker 1: He held it that long?
Speaker 2:  	A long time, a long time, a long time.  We finally got to the place where we could discuss it.  I remember one time we were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we had just recorded this song called 'Lipstick Traces.'  And I hated this song, you know, and they tried to get me to sing it at first.  And I told them I couldn't sing it because I didn't feel it.  And, you know, Walter, he's got a great voice.  And so he was able to take it and make it--and we got a Top 40 record out of it.  But I swore that I would never sing the song, because I didn't like it at all.  So we get up to, we get up to Philadelphia, and he gets a toothache.  And it's, and he gets an infection in it, and this whole side of his face swells up.  Now, he can't go on.  We're doing four shows a day, because at the Uptown Theater [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] you did the shows over and over, until midnight.  So, this is after the lunch show, which started, the show started at twelve.  And after that, he couldn't do no more shows.  So now it's either we cancel out and go home, or I learn how to sing this song and have to sing it for the next, for the whole week, every show.  I hated this.  (Laughter) I had to sing this song for a whole week, five shows a day, every day until he got better.  I had to do it, I had to sing it.  And see, that's a true sign of never saying what you won't do, because you will--it will come along and you'll have to do it, you know.  And that, that was one of my--I hated that song, I really did.  But I, but I pulled it off.
Speaker 1: So was that common, five shows a day?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: It is?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: It's not still common?
Speaker 2:  	But see, but see, you only did maybe two or three songs.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2:  	You'd come out and you did--
Speaker 1: You were part of a revue (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah, of a revue.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	You came out and you did your hit record, or maybe your last--that hit record now, and the hit record you had before that, or two of them, if you had two before.  And then they'd go to the next act.  So, you know, on those shows it might have been The O'Jays, The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, and [HistoryMaker] Martha Reeves and The Vandellas [Martha and The Vandellas].  So, you had five acts that they'd go out and they'd do two or three songs, and that was it.
Story_ID: 649646
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories of you on the road, together?  Because it seems to me like the first story you told was that the whole issue may have been about you running things.
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter).
Speaker 1: Or you're not sensitive to what others need (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, they really did.  They, that's one of the big cries (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you're insulting (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	"You always trying to run something," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Something.
Speaker 2:  	No, I'm not.
Speaker 1: I know you're not, but they just said that.
Speaker 2:  	But that's what they said, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, he [Walter Williams] had harbored that for a long time.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah, they really, they really say that about me; that I try to run everything and I think I know everything (laughter).  But look, understand this.  If you're not going to step out there, if you're not going to be the guy that's going to--you can't, you can't be afraid to be wrong.  Do you understand?  Nobody is always correct, and you just can't hold your opinion and wait until the other guy makes a suggestion, and then you're going to come up and say "Well, I don't think that's right."  Well, what is your idea?  Let me have a shot at your idea.  Tell me what your idea is.  And if--look, I'm flexible, I'm open, I'm really open.  If you come up with something better than I got, I'm with you.  But if it ain't better than what I think I got, then I'm going to argue with you, and I'm going to show you where the value of my point is--where my values are, and you show me where yours.  And if it's better than mine, I'm going to be the first one to admit it.  I don't have any qualms about changing.  A lot of people don't--a lot of people have a problem with changing.  I don't have a problem with changing.  They'll say, "Well, you're wishy washy because you're able to change your mind."  But I think that's part of life.  You should be able to readjust your thinking and be able to change your thinking and say, "Well, I might be wrong here.  Let's try it your way."  I think that's a wise man, and that's who I am.  You know, I'm not, I'm not stuck on it, you know what I'm saying.  I'm not stuck on it, to think that I know all of it.  But if you're not, if you're going to just give me an opinion and you don't have an idea behind your opinion, then I have to give you this (gesture).  Go ahead on, I don't hear you.  What are you going to say?  Say something.  Tell me something.  Don't just have an opinion about mine, and you have no other recourse.  To me that's--I don't have time for that, and you don't either (laughter).
Speaker 1: How do you know that?  You heard me over here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) (Laughter) Because I'm looking at your face.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	And you're over here talking about--
Speaker 1: I'm looking (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I don't have time for all of that (laughter).  You got to--you know, I understand.  I understand I don't have to be right.  But you've got to give me something to weigh it against.  You just can't be telling me that I don't know what I'm talking about, and you're not giving me nothing to say, "Okay, you're right.  Let's try it your way."  I'm not, I'm not stuck in it.
Story_ID: 649647
Speaker 1: So now any other stories from the road, the two of you [Levert and Walter Williams]?  A funny incident with a fan?  One of the--
Speaker 2:  	There's always funny incidents with the fans.  They, you know, fans are just what they say--fanatics.  They, you know--the funny--you know, oh man, I mean you can't, you can't be in this game without fans.  And fans are, you know, they- they're the ones who make or break you.  And I, I respect my fans.  I think they're, I think they deserve your time.  They deserve that time that you take out to take a picture, the time you take out to give them an autograph.  They deserve that.  These people have bought you and made sure that you've been able to pay your rent and to--they've bought your product faithfully, and now they come and buy your tickets, and they help you to do that.  You have to respect them, and I love them.  I love my fans (laughter).  You thought you was going to get something, didn't you (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Why do you do that?  Why are you doing that at this point (laughter)?
Speaker 2:  	Some things are just for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2:  	It has nothing to do with you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  I'm not giving you--you can't get a percentage of this story (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	No, no.  (Laughter) You know--
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying, I thought you would--
Speaker 2:  	I'm, I'm, I've been open with you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, I know you have, okay.  But I'm just saying--okay, so let's go back.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Story_ID: 649648
Speaker 1: So let's go, let's go--then I guess we'll go to your--well, let me ask you.  What, is there any racial experience you're having in the business?  And I'm not talking about earlier on.  I think I'm talking about when you are, you know, at the top.  Is there any racial experience you're having?
Speaker 2:  	The--
Speaker 1: Or is success so successful that race disappears?
Speaker 2:  	No, not at all.  It's very racist at the top of the game, because of the way they play the game at the top of the game.  It's like, I think there should be more interplay between white and black acts as far as when they do concerts.  I think there should be more--you know, you'll see, you'll see the Rolling Stones.  The Rolling Stones come out and they'll do their tour, but they'll sing my song 'Love Train,' but nobody asks me to come and open up the show for them and be a part of that show.  Okay, it has to be a special, some kind of special occasion for those things to happen.  It's like you'll never see The O'Jays and--who shall I say?  What's this kid's name?  Bruce Springsteen.  You won't see them on the same act, or even to open up.  I don't know why that is.  You won't see The O'Jays and Journey.  You won't see The O'Jays and Aerosmith.  Would you say it's because it's two different kinds of music?  No, it's music, you know what I'm saying?  It's just the same.  You won't see, some things you won't see.  And I think that's because of the demographics of the music and who's being, you know, who's coming to those shows.  We just did a tour with Gladys Knight and The O'Jays.  It's been, some nights it's been 90 percent white and 10 percent black.  And some nights it's been 90 black and 10 percent white.  It all depends on where we were playing, and what the area was.  It's like in Baltimore [Maryland] we had 90 percent black and 10 percent white.  And then we got up to--where was it--Buffalo, New York, and it was 90 percent white and 10 percent black, you know what I'm saying?  Then you get to, you go down to--where was it--Charlotte [North Carolina] or Durham [North Carolina] and you get maybe a 50/50 kind of thing, you know what I'm saying?  So, I don't know whether that's race.  I don't know whether that's just preference of who they want to see, or whether they don't want to see those two mixed up together.  But, you know, we're all in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [Cleveland, Ohio] together.  I mean, you know, I'm in there with the Rolling Stones.  I'm in there with The Beatles.  I'm in there with Eric Clapton.  I'm in there with, you know, I'm in there with all the rest of them.  I'm part of that, but we do not do any kind of, any kind of mingling together as far as concerts are concerned.  I don't know what that is.  And it could be just preference of who they want to be with and who they want to play with, you know.  They love, they love black musicians, they love the music.  They will play the music, they will sing the music, but for some reason or another never the twain shall meet.
Speaker 1: And you're talking also about the audiences, too?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So that's a big thing.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: That still has not--
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --quite settled itself.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, no, you know.  No, it hasn't.  You know, and I think the--when the world becomes satisfied with itself, or when people decide that, you know, it doesn't matter what color you are--it doesn't matter, you know.  The music has no color.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So internationally, who were your, what were your best places internationally, in terms of your audiences?
Speaker 2:  	England, Holland [the Netherlands], Spain, Mexico, Germany, South Africa, Jamaica, all of those countries, you know, I've been; you know, there have been concerts.  And also Japan, the Asian countries, and even, even-- even Hawaii and all that stuff.  The music has really, really--it's taken us places that we probably would never have gone, you know.  And it's still, and it's still going places that we haven't been to as of yet--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--you know what I'm saying?
Story_ID: 649649
Speaker 1: When you look at--what, what were important things in that--like appearances?  Was--it was important that you be on 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It was important that--so what were the important things that you think were sort of critical in terms of opening things up, you know?
Speaker 2:  	I think doing, performing on the Mall [National Mall] in Washington, D.C. with Jon Stewart.  Doing the different things in Washington, D.C. with The Beach Boys, and that kind of stuff.  Doing things with Dick Clark.  All of those things opened different doors, you know.  Phil Donahue ['The Phil Donahue Show'], all of those kind of places.  David Letterman ['Late Show with David Letterman']--all of those kind of things that keeps the--you know, when he spends, when David Letterman spends a week on TV and he's doing all the lyrics every night for a week until we get on there, to 'Love Train,' and he keeps doing it every night, every night until we come on, on that Friday and sing the song--people all over the world, join in--he's just doing it every night.  I think that has a big impact on the world, and what goes on as far as our music is concerned.
Story_ID: 649650
Speaker 1: --Haven't grown.
Speaker 2: It hasn't grown (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If, if you, if you, if you're saying that--
Speaker 2: In fact, I think it will go backwards, 'cause, you know people are--
Speaker 1: Well, they're trying to go backwards.
Speaker 2: They're going backwards.
Speaker 1: They're working on backwards now (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, beca- no, because I'm telling you I just--who (unclear)--
Speaker 1: They're working on backwards now.  They're working on it real tough, I don't understand why they wanna go back there.  You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I really don't understand why they wanna go--
Speaker 2: I don't know why--
Speaker 1: --back there.
Speaker 2: --but it's going backwards.
Speaker 1: I don't know why they wanna go back there. There ain't--that's crazy.  Why do you wanna go back there, do you know how terrible that was, and what turmoil that is, do you know what--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It even goes to today. We move in a neighborhood and then you see all these signs go up, and we'll be the only black person in the neighborhood. We're still the only black people in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah we are.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, I mean--and people have moved in and moved out and, and sometimes I feel like they won't sell to a black person.
Speaker 2: Right. No. I mean it's very complicated.  And really this is honestly one of my reasons for doing this project.  I have several reasons, but we have never dealt with the issue of slavery, and there is so much that people don't know.  Like, what if people understand you as a person?  They know your music.
Speaker 1:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They'll know that.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: But a lot of our issues, it's really ignorance and lack of understanding.
Speaker 1:  	Right.
Speaker 2: And exposure.  You know--
Speaker 1:  	But see, they don't want to know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1:  	You have those fash- factors--those--
Speaker 2: Factors.
Speaker 1:  	--those factors that don't want to know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1:  	That you are what you are, and I'm not going to associate with you at all.  And I find out, and what I find out now is that most of these are poor, underprivileged people--
Speaker 2: That's right, they are.
Speaker 1:  	--who feel this way.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1:  	They have no, they're--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1:  	They have, they're just small minded individuals.  And now you are still going to be like this, and you're living in a hole in the wall yourself?  You're living, you are, you are underprivileged yourself.  So, how can you feel like you don't want this person--you're living in a trailer.  How can you feel like you don't want nobody next to you?  You're living in an apartment with roaches, and you don't--and you hate--and you hate white people or you hate black people.  You haven't stepped up your game to even be able to talk like this about somebody.  You need to upgrade yours before you can talk about people like that.  Oh, don't start me.
Speaker 2: No, you should not start, because you came from those roots, mister.
Speaker 1:  	(Laughter).
Speaker 2: You are of those roots.  Now, you can talk a good game.  But I mean it does--there are things that force, you know, those to--and it also, it historically has been that a--
Speaker 1:  	It's always these people who don't have, don't--you're not doing well yourself.  Look at you.  You have no room to talk about these people.  You're, you're in the mud.  What is wrong with you?  How can you sit and judge somebody when you don't have the right?  I think it's terrible.  I think it's really senseless, senseless to even bother.  Why would you even bother?  Like, Jesus Christ, how can you hate somebody and don't even know them?  How can you just hate this person when you can--you have a right to dislike whoever you want to dislike.  But how do you dislike them and you ain't never met them?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 649651
Speaker 1:  	That's, it's just, to me that's awful, you know. And it just--you know, that's why I told you earlier I don't go see movies like 'The Butler' because they bring up bad memories, and I don't want to stir those memories up.  Because I want to, the first thing I want to do is after I see that is--like, "You're all alike.  You'll do that to me."  That's terrible.  You know, so why would you want to keep stirring up those kinds of memories?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think--I think people are saying about 'The Butler' that it's sort of aspirational.  I don't know, maybe at the beginning.  I'm not going to say, because I haven't seen it.
Speaker 1:  	Have you seen it?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure I'm going to totally like it, but I've been hearing positive things.  I think they may have been trying to do too much, and there're some cliches.  And I'm pretty critical of anything historical, but I am going to go see it.  But the thing that I do want--I mean but the thing about you that we have not touched upon--
Speaker 1:  	It's almost like pulling a scab.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1:  	That's what that's like.
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) And you just keep scratching the scab.  It's like the Holocaust.  I think the Jews, they need to get over that.  Because you know, they're--you're running the whole world now.  You've got all the money, so what are you mad at?  Who are you mad at?  Do you now want to burn everybody else because you're up on the pole?  So now you're no better than that guy, if you're going to do that.  You're no better than the guy that did it to you.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1:  	So, you know, it's like stop scratching that sore.  You're going to get infected.
Speaker 2: Well, what we need in the black community, I'm going to take issue with that.  But I don't--but in the black community people need to, they need to be in the Jewish space a little bit more, because we have to, just what you're saying, forget.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it's not that--I don't know.  Because it's not all pain, and our story is very beautiful.  And I, that's why I went ahead right now.  When you--no matter what people would see when they looked at you, when they heard you, the world was your oyster.
Speaker 1:  	Yes.
Story_ID: 649652
Speaker 1: So what we've not talked about is your talent.  And tell me, when did you know that you--because lots of people--the others--lots of people are talented. I mean there are people out there that are talented, I won't say lots.  But when did you realize that you were talented?  And then it's the discipline.  Because talent won't take you--it'll take you down the block and back.
Speaker 2:  	Um, when did I know that?  I, I've always liked to sing, you know.  But to know that you have the tool, or the one that's going to sell, and people are going to gravitate to it and say that you're great, I--look, I admire Marvin Gaye.  I admire Ronnie Isley [Ronald Isley].  I admire Mario Lanza.  I admire Barbra Streisand.  For me to even be included in that arena is very humbling to me.  Because I don't see myself--I see myself as being good, and I take pride in what I do.  And I want to be all of that and a bag of chips, but sometimes I wonder, you know, am I--maybe I'm, I'm modest when it comes down to that.  I don't, I don't see me like that.  I just see me doing what I do; what God has given me.  And I've been blessed to hold my own, to be able to--where people spend their money and come see me.  They are, they are pleased and satisfied with what I do.  And it's for them to think that I'm great.  With me, the jury's still out as far as I'm concerned, you know.  I just--
Speaker 1: Oh, you know--
Speaker 2:  	I'm just a--
Speaker 1: But, but--
Speaker 2:  	--I'm just a guy that's trying to do the best he can.
Speaker 1: --but you also see the effect you have, and you have also bonded with your audience.
Speaker 2:  	I'm--
Speaker 1: It's that whole thing of being on stage.
Speaker 2:  	--I'm, I, I know exactly what you're saying (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a religious experience.
Speaker 2:  	And I see it.  They--see, it's something--and see, the way I explain it to people, it's--what happens from the time it comes out of my mouth to the time it gets into the microphone and it comes out the other side of the speaker--whatever God does to it in that process, has made me who I am, whatever He does in that process.  But coming from me, it's just a man that's doing something that he likes, and when he gets into the microphone and God puts it to your ears, you're hearing something that I don't hear.  And maybe you think that's being modest or being--I just, I just don't--you know, I want to think that I'm good, you know what I'm saying?  I want to think that.  I want to--but I also hear the flaws, too; I hear the mistakes.  I hear the bad notes, I hear the not breathing properly.  I hear all of that.  I hear, I hear--you know what I'm saying?  I hear the, I hear the inadequacies.  I hear the human part of it, you know what I mean.  And that keeps me from--I think it keeps me grounded.  I think it keeps me in a place where I'm forever reaching, trying to get out of that--trying to find whatever it is you all are hearing so that I can believe it myself.  And I all get from it is I pray that God stays with me and let me keep fooling you (laughter).  Keep fooling them (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) He's got such a--such a nice smile, you do (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) what, don't say that.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) but he has a beautiful--he has a beautiful smile, he does.

Speaker 1: Now (clears throat) I want to ask--so we were talking about your, your sons, both Gerald [Gerald Levert] and Sean [Sean Levert].
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how they saw bad habits in you, but you also saw their talent--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --young, and that you cultivated that talent, young.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But when--I had read--were you supportive of Sean when he said he wanted to--
Speaker 2:  	Gerald?
Speaker 1: I mean Gerald.  I'm sorry, Gerald.  I'm sorry, Gerald.  And then the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) No, no, not really, no.  Because I wanted him to go to school.  I wanted him to get an education.  I wanted him to have all of these other things to fall back on in case this didn't work, because there was no guarantee that he was going to be successful.  This is a hard game, and some people it takes a long time to get there.  And there's so many talented people all over the world that never got their chance to do this.  And I mean very, very talented people.  I mean people that are unbelievably good, you know, but they never got their chance.  And the only reason why I say that the reason why some of them didn't get their chance is because there was something wrong with them as people; that they were not able to be all of that, and make that a positive.  Maybe they talked too much, maybe they thought that they were too much, or thought they were better than they really were.  You know, maybe they were just--didn't--you know how some people can talk themselves into it, and then talk themselves out?  And that's the way some artists are.  They can talk themselves in and then talk themselves out, because they--you're not--there's a flaw.  And sometimes that flaw will not let you get to where you're supposed to be, because of that flaw.  And, you know, I've wondered why, this is such a great, talented person.  How come they didn't make it?  Because they stood in their own way, maybe.
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes opportunity doesn't present itself.
Story_ID: 649654
Speaker 1: When Gerald [Gerald Levert] came--was it Gerald and Sean [Sean Levert] who both came to you and said, "We want to do this"?
Speaker 2:  	No, it was always Gerald.
Speaker 1: It was always Gerald?
Speaker 2:  	Always, always Gerald, always Gerald.
Speaker 1: So he's just like you in that way?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: He's a leader?
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah, that's him, that's him.  That's what he does.  That's who he is.
Speaker 1: So he said, "We want to do this, and we're calling it the LeVerts [sic.]"?
Speaker 2:  	Well, see, really he stole my name.  Because see, what I was going to do, I'd always hoped that I would eventually start my own band and I would just--this was side energy.  I would start a band and I was going to call it LeVert, and I told him this.  And when he started his group he says, "I'm going to call it LeVert."  I said, "Man, you're stealing my name," (laughter).  You know, but it was all right.  But it was him, so he could do that.  And he stole my name, really.  And I, and I'd tell him.  And people don't believe me.  And see, people don't believe that when I tell them he wanted to sing.  And when he started singing, I sort of--when he started singing, I sort of toned myself down.  I didn't--I said, okay, now he's running all over the stage, he's falling all down on his knees.  He's rolling around all on the floor.  These are the things that I used to do.  He's, he's getting all the big women to love him, and they're calling him Teddy.  These are all of my moves.  These are, this is what I--this is what I started out doing.  So I said to myself, now this is not going to make sense, his daddy and him both running around rolling on the floor.  Somebody got to stand up (laughter) and don't be rolling around on the floor.  So I started backing back on my antics, you know, because now, look, I got to--he's a young man.  He's got, he's got more legs than me.  I'll let him do that, and I'll just calm myself down and I'll be the straight man to his acting.  A lot of people don't believe that I was able to do that.  That's because that's who I am, and that's the showman in me that says there's not room for the two of us to do this.  So let's, let's just let one be the one, and I'll be the straight man to his acting, you know.  I'm, I'm going to sing straight.  I'm not going to be as gospel as I have been, because now he's doing all of that.  He's doing the woo, woo, woos, and the ahs, and he's rolling on the floor and grabbing the girls and putting them, sitting them in his lap and kissing them and all of that good stuff.  I'm going to back, back, and I'm going to pull back and let that be him, and it won't be me now.
Story_ID: 649655
Speaker 1: You're saying this when he got started, but you were helpful--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --with getting, you know what he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes, I'm giving him the ideas.  These are the things that you should do.  This is what you should do if you--look, remember all the girls, all the big girls are going to really love--they never get the attention, so you give them your attention and they'll bring all the rest of the girls with them.  Do you understand?  Because they got, they got the beautiful friends, and they're going to make their beautiful friends now come and see you, because they're going to say, "He's a big teddy bear, and we love him."  So, this is, this is the same premise that I used in my career.  This is how I got to be [HistoryMaker] Eddie Levert.  Do you understand?  And most people don't understand that there's a formula, and it works, and it worked for him.  And it worked for him, and he became the Teddy Bear.  But this is--we talked our way through these things.  Me and him talked about everything.  We talked about, we talked about whoever's going to pass first--who's going to--and what they have to do to pick up the reins to keep the family going.  Who's going to stand up and be the man?  If it was me, you know what your job is, Gerald [Levert's son, Gerald Levert].  It's on you to make that work.  If it's you, then I have to stand up and I have to continue to be all I can be.  If you pass away, or if you--this is not just about you.  This is about our family, this is about our heritage.  This is about what we want to do as a people, as a family together, what we're going to do.  And if you fall short here, then I have to stand up and I have to do what I have to do.  If it's you that goes first or me that goes first, your job is that you can't fall down on the job.  You've got to stand up and be all that you can be.   That's why I was able to--when I lost both of them I was able to brush myself off and pick myself up, because we had talked about all of this, and what had to be done, and who had to do what.  And I can't lay down.  I can't lay down now, because we've talked about this.  This is something that I have to do now.  I am, I am it, you know what I'm saying?  I didn't think I was going to be it, but I am it.  So, now I have to go back to being the guy that's singing to the fat girls and hugging all the babies.  I have to be now the guy with all the moves.  Now I have to, I have to go now and work out and do the aerobics and make sure the body's in shape.
Story_ID: 649656
Speaker 1: Were you surprised by your son's success, by Gerald's [Gerald Levert] success?
Speaker 2:  	No, never (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because it's--never?
Speaker 2:  	Never.
Speaker 1: So but when it--because he was a modern day version--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of you.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2:  	I was never surprised.  See, they don't really believe me when I say I pulled back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 2:  	--to let that happen, to let that be.
Speaker 1: Oh, I--
Speaker 2:  	Because I didn't think it was room enough for both of us rolling around on the floor and grabbing, you know, the women, and both of us doing the (makes sounds).  No, somebody had to calm down.  Somebody had to be a little bit--see in all relationships I always, I always tell--in everything, somebody has to be the grownup and somebody has to be the child.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you--so with--which of his songs--before I get to that--which of his songs did you like the best?
Speaker 2:  	I liked, I liked that song that he did in a falsetto.  What is it, that one song?  'Closure,' I really loved that.  I really liked, I liked that song where, "You be the teacher, and I'll be the--," (singing), "I'll do your homework, baby, because I'm ready for school" ['School Me'].  I loved the lyrics, I loved the bluesy-ness of it.  To me, he was one of the greatest really prolific writers of his era, of when he--the songs that he'd write, the songs that he wrote will be around forever.  Because they are heartfelt, they are true, they are songs that have a lot of meaning, and can last.  They are timeless, because you'll always be able to find something in those songs that you can relate to.
Speaker 1: So where, where did you see yourself?  How did you, how did you manifest in Gerald?
Speaker 2:  	How did I manifest?
Speaker 1: Your voice.
Speaker 2:  	No, just his whole, his whole delivery; his whole demeanor, his whole--the way that he was able to greet people; the way that he was able to be himself and make people love him.  That's how I manifest myself in him, because that was something that we both were able to do because we loved people; because we loved, we loved life.  And me and this kid would be on the phone and we would just laugh and laugh and laugh for hours and hours, and joke and talk about things.  We could talk about anything and find the humor in it.  And he would always say to me at the end of the conversation, "Dad, you're crazy.  You're out of your mind, dad.  You're just out of your mind."  And I would say the same thing to him, "You're crazy.  You're out of your mind."  It was always with love.  And then remember, now we didn't always see eye to eye.  We had our arguments, we had our disagreements.  Because he always felt like--he would--his favorite line to me was, "Dad, I am not a little kid anymore.  You cannot beat me," (laughter).  "You cannot--you can't."  Because you know, I beat him.  I used to beat him.  You know, when I say beat him, you know, it's just whippings.  We, he always felt like I was--he was one of those people that felt like--that I felt like I was always right, and you got to listen to me.  And no matter what you're saying, I'm the one that's right and you can't, you can't override me.  And he said, "Dad, you can't talk to me like that anymore.  I'm not the baby.  I have my own opinion."  And I--you know, I didn't--you know, look, I always took the high road with them, no matter what it was, you know.  It was like if we're arguing and we're in a place where it might even go--looked like it might be even fisticuffs.  But I am the grownup here.  I am going to be the grownup here, and I'm going to take the grownup approach.  I am not going to go down to that level with you.  So, what do you want to do?  Do you want to beat me up?  You know, will that make you feel better?  But I'm still going to love you anyway.  Unh-uh, then he couldn't take it.
Story_ID: 649657
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, because he [Gerald Levert] really wanted your approval honestly?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, right.  But he wouldn't, he couldn't take it, you know.
Speaker 1: That would make him more upset.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, absolutely (laughter).  Abso- absolutely.
Speaker 1: So when--okay, so when--you're father and son show?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Because that was, it such a beautiful--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  And that was, that was one of the, that was the real testy part in our relationship.  Because he wanted to do, he wanted to do, he wanted to do a real big production.  And he wanted to spend, he wanted to spend a lot of money on production and the presentation.  And he could never get the record company nor the promoters to see his vision.  So, anything that we'd done, we would have to spend the money ourselves to make it happen.  And at that time I was trying to tell him, you know, "Hey, don't get upset man, we can get through this, and we can make it happen by rehearsing it and practicing and doing our stuff on a positive level."  He never thought that we were given an opportunity to present it at the level that it should have been presented.  And I agreed with him, because it should have been really seen by--it should have been seen on a bigger, a much bigger scale.  And because, you got to remember, when we did 'Wind Beneath My Wings,' which was at a period that the fathers and sons, that was really a big issue, and families were not in a positive light.  And so when we did 'Wind Beneath My Wings,' and he's talking about, "Daddy, daddy," and all of that, and, "We're talking about you.  Daddy, I love you," and all that stuff, that was unheard of.  And that was, we caught them at a moment.  And at that point, we didn't really know that it was going to be like that, but it turned out to be something that was very positive.  So when we finally decided that we were going do the father and son show, we never, never quite thought that we got it to go over on the level that we thought it should have been.  It should have been on a much bigger, bigger level.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Because it was more, it was not just black.  It was also black and white.
Story_ID: 649658
Speaker 1: He [Levert's son, Gerald Levert] has his own following.  He has people that live for his music, and still do.  I've always known that he was talented though, and I've always known that he was a great writer.  And he ju- they just--it's a shame that they're just now getting to the place that they realize who he was, and the position he held in R and B music and in rhythm and blues.  It's like there will never be anyone to come along and do what's he's done, because they're not--they don't have the pipes, they don't have the soul, they don't have that aura, that energy level.  You know, he was the last of a dying--he was part of that Otis Redding--you know what I'm saying, that earthy part.  You're born with that.  There's no one that has been born with that.  All this other is prefab [prefabricated].
Speaker 2: That's right.  And that's why when you go to weddings now, they're not playing modern day mu- they don't have dance--so they're playing--
Speaker 1:  	No, no, no, no.
Speaker 2: I've been at two weddings and they said, "You see what music they're playing," (laughter)?
Speaker 1:  	(Laughter).
Speaker 2: 'Cause they don't--they can't dance to hip hop--
Story_ID: 649659
Speaker 1: Now when Sean--Sean decides to launch a solo career too?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But he's trying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well, it's--
Speaker 1: It's his foll- he's following his--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, he--look, he's doing something he don't want to do, you understand?  He just wants to sing with his brother [Gerald Levert] and be Sean Levert.  He's never--that was not--he didn't aspire to be a singer.  He had great pipes, great pipes, but he never spent the time--he never spent the time that his brother spent at it, or that his father spent at it.  This was like something I'll do--they're putting--they're making me do this.  It's like after his brother passed away, I tried to tell him, "Okay, Sean, get two other guys and start the other group LeVert--another group."  "No, I don't want to do it, because my brother's here.  I don't want to do it with anybody but my brother."  And that's where he was.  This was, all of these things were forced on him.  He had no desire to do these things, and me and his brother basically made him do that; made him do that.  That's why he wasn't a success, because his heart wasn't really in that.  He just, he was doing it for money.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2:  	That's what he was doing.
Speaker 1: So now, when you--because I saw your--I actually was with your son.  Because [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes had her twenty-fifth anniversary celebration.  And then the next thing Jeffrey, Jeffrey [Jeffrey Osborne], right?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, they were there doing some things.  And then he was, he passed away soon after that.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm, um-hm, that was after him and Jeff--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	--did that song about--I can't think of the name of the song.  And I had to go--and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In fact, they were--
Speaker 2:  	--him and Cathy did a few shows together, and I had to come and sing that part with him on a few of those shows.
Speaker 1: Right.  Because he--they were in Jeffrey's studio the whole time--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --while the party was sort of going on.
Speaker 2:  	Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: But I want to say, like very soon after.  So--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, yeah, it was only probably a few weeks--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	--after that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, that's what I was going to say, only a few weeks.
Speaker 2:  	And then Jeff called me after that and asked me to come and do the song with him at a couple of places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I was never too--after he passed away, you know, and we did the big celebration in Cleveland [Ohio], all these people wanted to do these different honorary things honoring him and all of that.  We had talked about this.  And we had talked about it to the point that we had decided that we weren't going to do a lot of that stuff, that we thought that a lot of that stuff was over the top.  And I still think a lot of that stuff was over the top.  And there's still people who want to do things to honor him.  I think, you know, I think we've done enough.  And I think, you know, he's--you know, I think we're good with it.  I know I am.  I know his mom [Levert's first wife, Martha Levert] is good with it.  And his sisters, his sisters, they're good with it.  We're all good with it.  We, we loved him and he was, he was special to us.  And we, we--he will forever be in our hearts, and that's never going to change.  And I've had some of the, some of the greatest moments of my career was with this kid.  I--we, you know, they called me dad, but whenever we was on the road together they would call me Levert [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert].  They would call me Big Levert, and I would--he would be Little Levert, and Sean would be just Sean.  And we--those are, those are--some of my greatest moments in my career was with this kid.
Story_ID: 649660
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I, some of--look, some of my greatest moments.  We, we went to South Africa, we were over there.  We got a chance to go and sit with Nelson Mandela.  We sat with Nelson.  We were with him for about two or three hours.  We sat and we talked and we talked and we talked.  And he [Gerald Levert], he's a great man.  I had a wonderful time.  And right after, soon--when we got back in the limo, we were headed back to the hotel and he says to me, he says, "Dad," he says, "I've met Nelson Mandela now."  He says, he says, "I can die now, and I'll be all right."  And it wasn't, and it wasn't long after that, maybe a couple of months that he passed away after that.  And at the time he said that, I told him, "Don't say that, man.  It's all right.  It was good, but it wasn't that good," (laughter).  You know, but it wasn't long after that that he passed away.  So, that was one great moment.  And then another great moment was when we--when Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] asked me and him to come and sing for Stedman's [Stedman Graham] birthday party.  And she, she was a big fan of his.  Moments like that.  And moments like when we went to Cabo, Mexico [Cabo San Lucas, Mexico] for--whose birthday was it?  It was John Travolta's fiftieth birthday.  Me and him, we go down to Cabo and we're singing for John's birthday party.  And I get a chance--and I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise--and I get a chance to meet Tom Cruise.  And I find out that Tom Cruise is one of the nicest men you would ever want to meet in your whole life.  He's such a, just a nice man.  He gets such a bad rap.  I don't know why they rap on him so bad, but here's a guy that I didn't even know him.  And there were some kids that was at the function, and they were so in awe of him.  And they were talking about, "That's Tom Cruise, I would love to meet him."  I says, "Go over and say hello to him, he's a nice guy."  And they say, "Oh, no, I can't do it."  So I grab them by the hand and I took them over there and I said, "Tom, this kid really wants to meet you."  He was so great to that kid and his whole family.  You know, I am a fan of his, and I will be until the day I die.  I think he's a great man, and he just proves what a real star is to me.  And that was another incident that me and my son was a part of, because of what we did as father and son, you know what I'm saying?  Those are the kind of doors that that song and that adventure opened up for us.  It put me in a place that I've--places where I thought I would never be, and meet some of the people that I never thought I would meet, and to have them call me up on my phone and say "Thank you for being there, Eddie [HistoryMaker Eddie Levert]."  You know what I'm saying?  That's the kind of things that I've had with this kid.  You know, and still even after, even after his death, you know, a lot of these people that felt like they owed him something, they have come and embraced me because of their relationship with him, because of what they thought of him, and how they loved him.  He's got a lot of his friends--he's got a lot of  his friends that come and they're looking over me, like he appointed them, "Y'all gotta watch out for my dad," like Johnny Gill.
Speaker 1: And Keith Sweat.
Speaker 2:  	Keith Sweat, Tom Joyner, Steve Harvey, all of these people--Al Haymon and all these people have embraced me because of their relationship with him.  And some of them have just disappeared.  But, you know, they were who they were anyway, you know what I'm saying.  So it's been, it's been, it's, it's wonderful.
Story_ID: 649661
Speaker 1: You know my, my rela- this kid--look, I get checks now from songs that I know I had nothing to do with it, but he [Gerald Levert] put my name on these songs (laughter), he did.  I mean, you know, he used to always say, "Dad, I got you."  You know, because I would do things with him, you know, where there was no cost factor.  You know, we just did it, I just did it.  "It's you--it's for you, son.  Here I am, I'm going to do it for you."  And we'd do it and I'd get checks.  And I be looking at this song and say, "I never wrote this song."  But I know what it is.  I know he put my name on it anyway.  And that's his way of taking care of me.  I still, I still get all of these things.
Speaker 2: It's the ultimate tribute in many ways.
Speaker 1:  	Absolutely.  Yeah, I can't--I've been truly blessed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1:  	I can't tell you no other kind of way.
Speaker 2: You can't.
Speaker 1:  	To tell you that, you know.
Speaker 2: Even with hardship because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to lose both of your sons so close--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And your other--
Speaker 1:  	Now that, to me that is the--that's the part that really hurts me and breaks my heart, that they, they had to suffer whatever--why did they have to suffer?  Why did Sean [Sean Levert] have to be incarcerated and yearn for his mom [Levert's first wife, Martha Levert] in jail, and they were restraining him?  Why did my son have to die in his sleep and not wake up?  What kind of pain, what kind of suffering was in that?  You know what I'm saying?  And those are the things that I ask myself all the time, and those are the things that disturbs me the most; that I just hope that it wasn't that painful for them.  I wish that if anything I could have did-- I could have took away the misery or the pain that was in that, that they didn't deserve that, whatever.  And maybe it's because of my, you know, doings that happened to them.  And I just hope it's not--I just hope they didn't suffer very much, you know what I'm saying.  Because that to me is the thing that swells in my head the most--is how much did they suffer, and why did they have to, if they did?  You know what I'm saying?  They were not those kind of people.  They were not that kind of people; that they needed to suffer.  They were not that kind of persons--they were not those people that needed to feel pain and suffer like that for no reason at all.
Speaker 2: But out of your--you know, out of Sean's death came at least that law [Ohio HB 249].
Speaker 1:  	Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Because that's happening a lot.
Speaker 1:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 2: You know, that law came out of that.
Speaker 1:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And then, but I mean, because there was a clip--on that clip of him--
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, crying out.
Speaker 1:  	See, that, that to me--and you know--and that's all I can see is when I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did that clip come into being?
Speaker 1:  	Well, they filmed it and then somebody got ahold to it and ran it through to YouTube and Facebook and all of that.  Look, to me that was the most hurting part, to think that he suffered, you know what I'm saying.  And that, he didn't deserve.  And I don't know why that was, that it had to be, but if there was anything I could have done I would have changed that if I could've.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.
Story_ID: 649662
Speaker 1: But you know, I--in--okay so in listening--in listening--the thing is, in some respects--I mean you talk--as I hear you, you know, about a difficult growing up.  It wasn't easy for you.
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: And so, I don't know.  Maybe, maybe you--some people are stronger in some respects.  But you talk about--you gifted them [Levert's sons, Gerald Levert and Sean Levert] with your talents.  But, you know, but you're here now and--
Speaker 2:  	I understand.
Speaker 1: And it's the--
Speaker 2:  	I get my strength I believe, I truly believe in God.  I truly believe, I truly believe that through Him is my strength.  Through Him is--and it's not because I've been that correct, you understand?  It's just that I truly believe that if I do the right things that I can be saved, and maybe in my doing the right things I can maybe save somebody else.  And my job here is to spread the message, that's all that I'm here to do.  And every day that I get a chance, I will profess it and spread that message.  That's why I've been able to--God gave me strength to do whatever I got to do, and to realize this one thing: that I cannot change nothing.  I have no power over nothing.  All I can do is just take care of me and mine, and that's it.  And at the end of the day if He sees fit to end that, then that's what He does.  And I just, I'm just a part of what's going on.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2:  	That's it.
Story_ID: 649663
Speaker 1: Let's talk about where you are.  Because one of the things--Raquel [Levert's second wife, Raquel Capelton] is here.  And you got married to her, and there was a large age gap.
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that was even controversial--
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm, YES (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the family, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, absolutely (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you've been married for a while.  So, I guess you're keeping her and she's keeping you.
Speaker 2:  	She's keeping me.
Speaker 1: That was controversial.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  They all, you know--but see, what I told my kids is like, "Look, you didn't ask me who you should marry.  You didn't ask me if it was all right if you married this bum that's not with you now.  You didn't ask me what girl you were going to date.  So, why do you feel like I have to ask you and get your approval of who I'm going to marry?"  The reason why I married this girl is, look, I--we started off just dating and having a good time, going from place to place, doing this and that.  And, and, dating her, I found out she's a good person, okay.  Now we're, we--she wants to, she wants to be a cosmetologist.  She wants to go to school.  I want to help you do that.  I want to help you to be all you can be.  Let me do whatever I can.  Okay, then we come, we start coming out here to Las Vegas [Nevada], just hanging out.  And so she said she wants to go into cosmetology.  Well, why don't you go out here?  You like it out here, the weather is good.  Okay, let's go out and let's get an apartment.  We get an apartment.  Okay, now she's out here all the time.  I'm only out here when I get out here, you know.  She's, she's, we got a--we done rented an apartment and it's costing us, what, about two thousand dollars a month (laughter)?  We're paying that, and I'm still in Cleveland [Ohio].  She's out here and she's going to cosmetology school.  And so now when I come out here, I say, okay, we're still rolling along pretty good.  Okay, so now maybe we should get a house, you know what I'm saying?  Find a house you like, and we'll see if we can buy it.  So now she starts looking for a house and then she decides, well, okay, I don't want to--we don't need to be paying all this rent, so I'll go and live in the Budget Suites [Budget Suites of America] until we find a house.  So she ends up staying in the Budget Suites for about three or four months, for about two or three months, right.  And she stays in the Budget Suites, and I'm coming back out every now and then, but we're staying in the Budget Suites with a kitchenette in it.  So, finally she finds a place and we buy the place.  And now we're able to bring out her kids and my ki- and my daughter, Eurie [ph.].
Story_ID: 649664
Speaker 1: So we're all staying at the house; and so we're getting ready to go on tour this one year.  And so we're, we're having a cookout.  And so, I'm playing with the kids around the pool.  And so, I'm chasing Eurie [ph.] around the pool and I slip and I break my foot.  And I break all the ligaments in my foot, and so now I'm laid up now for about a year.  And they tell me I won't be able to dance on this foot, and that my career with dancing and choreography is over with, you know what I'm saying.  So, you're not going to make it back from this because you done tore your foot up.  This is it for you.  So, now I'm laid up for a year.  I got this--my foot, I can't get out the bed.  I can't go to the bathroom.  Now she's [Levert's second wife, Raquel Capelton] taking my waste and cleaning it.  She's putting me in the tub and washing my butt, because I can't do none of this.  She's doing this for about a year.  She's cooking, she's making sure--I'm stuck in the bed now.  Now, at the same time I got another woman back east, and she's pregnant with Ryan [Ryan Levert], you know, so she's helping me with all of--.  And remember, I've been staying back east with another woman.  And so now I'm out here, and I'm laid up in the bed and can't get out.  So, she's taking--she's literally taking care of me, washing my butt and everything.  So, I had no intentions of getting married.  You know, but the more she kept doing this, the more, the deeper and deeper I fell, you know what I'm saying?  Because I'm saying, "I'm an old guy, and this young girl is doing all of this for me.  You want to get married?"  She says, "Not if you don't want to."  That's her attitude.  She said, "Don't, we don't have to do this."  So, we decided we're going to get married.
Story_ID: 649665
Speaker 1: And so I get married and everybody's in a turmoil about it, because she's so, she's younger, much younger than me.  And they don't, they don't really know her.  And so now I go about trying to make sure that they get a chance to know her.  She is, she's very special.  They all love her.  My grown daughters and, you know, my grandkids, they--you know, me and her traveled around.  I take my grandkids with me every summer.  And I took them on the road with me, and she'd go and we'd take them to the Bahamas.  We'd take them up to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  We'd take them all over the place, because I want them now to see the finer things in life so they'll know what they got to work for, to achieve in life.  These are the things you need to have.  Okay, I'm trying to show them the world, and all of that.  All Gerald's [Gerald Levert] kids, Sean's [Sean Levert] kids, all of them, I'm taking--what do we have, twelve or thirteen kids--on the road.  We take them to the Bahamas, we stay down there Junkanoo and for Christmas.  And we got a condo [condominium], and we're in the condo and we're having--we're just--I'm getting a chance to give them life experiences the way that I should have done with my kids when I was wilding out.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  There's all this--and I'm trying to make this happen.  And so they get a chance to meet her, and they get a chance to see the kind of person she is and who she is.  And now, you know, they all call her Nana [Levert's second wife, Raquel Capelton].  And she's as young as some of them, you know what I'm saying, and they're calling her Nana.  And they, they come and they stay with us for Christmas and New Year's.  I have, we have a houseful of people.  Because see, we've got another house other than this one [in Henderson, Nevada], so we make people live in the other one, and they come over here and live here.  So we, we make it work.  And this was one of the best things that I did, one of--I--I'm with her.  I'm down with her.  I'm--this is it.  I'm not going to--there's nothing else in the world that I want other than this, and she is it.  And I think it's one of the best moves I ever made, one of the--if I, if I ever did anything right this is one of the most, rightest thing I've ever done.
Story_ID: 649666
Speaker 1: So where are you at now in your life?
Speaker 2:  	I'm a happy man.  I just wish now that, I hope that I have a little bit more time to spend with my daughter Ryan [Ryan Levert], because I want to see her at least reach the age of eighteen.  I would love to see her get married.  But, you know, I'm taking it as I can get it.  I got, I got, I got a--my other, my other daughter, Eurie [ph.], she just moved into her own place. (Looks off camera) The person, let me see who this is.  This is probably another one of them.  It might be my grandson and his mom. They, they come, they come by every day.  They, you know, and she--we, we're--I'm at a place that I'm just happy, you know what I'm saying.  And if I can make it happen for them--and I'm trying to make sure that everybody else--. If I got--all I want now is more money, to make it easier for everybody (laughter).  That's what, that's all I want now.  Because I can't have any more, I don't know how much more fun I can have.  I'm getting a kick out of just watching them do what they do.  I'm watching them be all they can be, and trying to help them to be all they can be.  That's why I'm, I'm just a, I'm a happy man.  I'm really a happy man.  I've never been able to say that, but I'm a happy man.
Story_ID: 649667
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about--because what you were just speaking to was family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the African American community.  Well, let's talk about American music, and where black music fits within that, and what the contributions are.  And then can you speak specifically to the time period your music came out of?
Speaker 2:  	Now, now, now, when we talk about our music and the time period that it was in, we were living in a time where the, the (laughter)--. She [Julieanna Richardson], she's gonna kick me in the chin (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I just want--
Speaker 2: --when you know, we were living in a time where, you know, I think our music had just became very important to the American experience.  When I say that, you know, where tunes like 'Love Train' had meaning; where tunes like the 'Back Stabbers' and disco music was just beginning to filter into, and clubs was happening and people were dancing.  'Soul Train' was really--television had just become a part of our heritage, and we were now part of that Dick Clark era where they played soul music and we had our own, we had our own television show like 'Soul Train' to show our music.  I think that was such a great time that we were also able--we were--they were also watching how we dressed.  And we were also trying to make inroads in politics, like the Jesse Jacksons [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and the Martin Luther Kings [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And we were trying to fight for equality and trying to be--to let them know that we were somebody, and that our music and what we were doing--and at that particular time, black people, for one reason or another, we got to the place where we wanted to be, we wanted to be in the mall.  We wanted to be next to Neiman Marcus where we, where I think that was a big mistake.  I think we should have just cultivated our own area with our stores, and kept our places that where we could buy black commodities and all of that stuff.  I think that when we said, okay, we'll go to Neiman Marcus, we'll go to Dillard's, we'll go to Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue]--in the interim we lost a lot of our culture by doing that.  And I think at the time we thought that we were elevating ourselves, and I think we were doing ourselves a disservice.  We should have kept our own little stores, our own little part of the--and built that, you know, built on that instead of selling out and giving it to someone else and letting them build on it.  I think the music and disco helped us to find ourselves, to know who we are.  We were--because remember, we were making songs like the 'Back Stabbers,' 'Love Train,' 'Give the People What They Want,' the 'Family Reunion,' 'Living for the Weekend.'  And they were playing these songs, and this was part of our heritage.  And we--Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, all of these people were playing a part of our community and the uplifting of our community--him saying that he was not going to Vietnam [Vietnam War] and fight.  That was a part of our community where we were--and that was giving us a voice.  We were being able to stand up and say that we are somebody.  I think the music had a lot to do with that, and the way that we were dressing, the way that we were addressing things and doing things.  I think this was a time that we were uplifting one another.  We were closer as a people at that moment, you know what I'm saying?  For some reason or other we, we've drifted, drifted away.
Story_ID: 649668
Speaker 1: The music now--(pause) look, okay, now you see a lot of--you see a lot of white kids doing a lot of black music.  Okay, now remember this.  And when I tell you this--this was all by design.  Now remember, every black producer that ever produced any music--the thing that we used to sit around and say, "Okay, if we can ever find a white boy or a white girl or a white group that can sing black music like a black person, do you know how much money we can make?"  Along comes Boyz II Men, and then we get these other boys. What is that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't remember.
Speaker 1:  	The Backstreet Boys.
Speaker 2: The Backstreet Boys.
Speaker 1:  	And New Kids on the Block, and they give them the sound of Boyz II Men, and they start making these records and they start selling a lot of records.  Now it progresses on down to Justin Bieber.  And now it comes on down to Justin Timberlake, then it comes down to Robin Thicke.  They finally were able to find some white talent that could sing R and B music the way that they wanted, and look at how much money they're making.  Now, who is in back of these people?  Who does Robin Thicke's music?  Black people.  Who does Justin Timberlake's music?  Black people.  Think about it now.  J-Lo [Jennifer Lopez]?  Black people.  So, this has all been a plan to make money, and this all started back when I was starting.  So, that is why it is what it is.  That's why there's no crime.  They want to say, "Well, they're taking our black music."  No, they're not taking it.  They're giving it to them.  They've been able to do it.  They've been able--they finally found some people that can do it and make it work, and now they're making money on it; the Jay-Zs, the Pharrells [Pharrell Williams], look at them.  Look who they are.  They're in the videos, you see them--Timbaland.  I, I don't know whether that's bad or good.  And maybe--you know, everybody's talking about, "Well, they're taking our music."  No, that's not the case.  This is all designed to make money.
Story_ID: 649669
Speaker 1: But see, then I'm ask you--because you know, I had--my, part of my question was the legacy of black people to American music.  And so if we--I'm asking this next question.  So, what are your hopes and concerns?  Because it--
Speaker 2:  	My, my, my concerns is, I have no concerns.  Because rhythm and blues is a feeling.  It's a raw--it's not, it's not, it's not refined.  This is what rhythm and blues is.  R and B is what Justin Timberlake and Robin Thicke is doing.  That's, that's refined, that's polished.  That's made, they do it exactly to the numbers.  Rhythm and blues is the music that I do.  It's from the heart, from the gut, it's raw, it's bitter.  There's no, there's no, there's no--
Speaker 1: Filter.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No filter.
Speaker 2:  	Right.  You can't, you can't filter this music.  You can't get that way.  When you think about, when you think about people like [HistoryMaker] Jerry Butler; when you think about people like Curtis Mayfield; when you think about those kind of people.  When you think about that kind of music--Marvin Gaye--raw, no filter, bad notes and all.  But it's guts, it's feelings, it's what's happening.  That's what rhythm and blues is.  And R and B is just the music that I told you that they take and they put people on it, and they make it happen.  It's what it is, you know what I'm saying?  They can, you can do that.  You can find anybody, and if you can do that with Justin Bieber, you know what I'm saying, it'll make him big.  That's what you can do with R and B music.  But rhythm and blues is raw, it's hard, no refinery.  It's just rough, and gruff, and bluesy, and hard core, and from the heart, and from the gut.  You know, that's what my music is.  That's what, that's what I do, and there's no--and they won't be able to--have you heard any of them try to do any of my music?  You won't, because they can't do it, because it takes guts, it takes heart, it takes feeling.  Now maybe you might hear, you might hear Eric Clapton, you might hear him do it.  You might hear Billy Joel, you might hear Elton John.  You might hear them, they might can try it.  Michael McDonald, you might hear it.  But this is, this is gritty.  They won't be able to do this.  They won't be able to come over here.  If they come over here, they got trouble (laughter).  They can't do it, because I know they can't do it, because I heard Robin Thicke try to do 'Let's Stay Together' by Al Green.  It was an atrocity, an atrocity, because it takes pipes, it takes living, it takes guts, it takes being in the trenches to do that.  They can't teach you that.
Speaker 1: That's true.  So, I don't know, because I'm just saying, a hundred years from now I hope you're not white (laughter).  But let's go on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh no, no, well, look, look.  There's always, there's always something--there's always somebody to come along.  Remember--
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: --I named Michael McDonald.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2:  	He's good at it.
Speaker 1: He's good.
Story_ID: 649670
Speaker 1: Then what is this kid, what's his name?  The, what's his name--that sang all the ballads?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1:  	White boy, sA\angs all the ballads.  What's his name?  Oh, god.
Speaker 2: Michael McDonald?
Speaker 1:  	No, no.  But I'm talking about the other kid that sung all of these songs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know who sings the ballads.
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't think of his name.  He's got long hair.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  In the '80s [1980s] or the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 1:  Yeah what era?
Speaker 2: Please. Yeah, I can't think of his name.  But I know who he is, if I can think of his name.  Oh, god.  Well, anyway.
Speaker 1: Was it now or before?
Speaker 2:  	Before now.
Speaker 1: Before now, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't know who that was.
Speaker 2:  	He's been good at it in the '80s [1980s].  He's good.
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2:  	He sung a lot of ballads.  Oh god, I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: But, but, but--
Speaker 2:  	I can see his face.
Speaker 1: Let's--so, which of your--you have a--I notice you have a lot of gold--where's your records?
Speaker 2:  	They're, they're all around the place.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	She's [Levert's wife, Raquel Capelton] got them up on the wall and--
Speaker 1: Do you have a lot of gold records?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, platinum and stuff.
Speaker 1: Platinum, and--
Speaker 2:  	I can't pawn 'em.
Speaker 1: So, what do those represent for you?
Speaker 2:  	Something that I did.  I wish, I wish they were real so I could maybe pawn them (laughter).  They represent something that I did.  They represent achievements.  But I found out one thing.  You can't live off of yesterday's achievements.  You got to keep, you got to keep coming up; you got to come into today.  And for them to really recognize you and feel like you're doing something, is to come back and do it again.  And that's what I'm, that's what I'm hoping to do, is to do one more great record, so they'll know that it just wasn't just for that period.  There's something still left in the tank.
Speaker 1: So that's what your--that's what your hope is for--?
Speaker 2:  	That's what I'm aspiring to do now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what you're aspiring for now?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right now.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Story_ID: 649671
Speaker 1: And so I have I think just one last--what, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2:  	That I was one of the best, and I never shortchanged.  That I was, I was good to be considered to be one of the best.  And that I was always, always, always trying to be better than the last time.  Maybe just one of the best.  Maybe just that I held my own; that I, I did, I held my own.  You know, I'm not the greatest, but I'm one of the best; one of the best, one of the--until the end, until the end, gave it all I had.  I gave it, believed it, lived it, wanted it.  And then in the end, it wasn't just for me.  It was for my whole family.  I was--to represent my whole family.  That's what I did, and I represented them well.  And I stood up and kept my integrity and represented my family well.  I did nothing to embarrass them, nothing to make them ashamed of me.  They say that I got a squeaky clean, I've had a squeaky clean career.  But they just don't know.  Nobody ever knew (laughter).  Nobody ever knew.  But I, yeah, yeah, I just hope I didn't embarrass my family.  Let's just hope I didn't make them ashamed of me.  Because this is not just about me.  It's about everybody that I love.  And really all I wanted to do was to be able to take care of my family, to take care of all of them if I could have, to make it easier for them, you know, to make it easy for them to get to where they wanted to go, you know what I'm saying.  And all of it is just for that; to open doors for the next one to be able to make it easier.  I can open the door for you, but once you get inside the door, you got to deliver.  You know, I just want to be that guy that could open the door.
