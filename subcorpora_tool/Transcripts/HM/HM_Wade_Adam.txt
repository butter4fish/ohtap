Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Patrick Henry Wade, W-A-D as in David, E as in Edward. My stage name is [HistoryMaker] Adam Wade.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind why you chose, well, is there a story behind Patrick Henry first (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was born on St. Patrick's Day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, they named me Patrick. And, my father's name is Henry [Henry Wade, Jr.]. So, that's why I was named Patrick Henry Wade. Then, years later when I got into show business, the people who eventually managed me were taking me around to introduce me to people in New York [New York]. And, and every time they would take me somewhere, they would say, "Oh, you have another Pat." Because at the time, recording wise there was Pat Boone, Pat Suzuki, Pat Board [ph.], and so, they say, "Oh, you got another Pat." So, we went back to the office and Marvin Kane who was my manager, his wife Georgia [ph.] said, "So, why don't you use the name Adam Wade because you have a name that starts in the beginning of the alphabet and goes all the way to the end of the alphabet." And, each letter has four, I mean, each name has four letters in it.
Speaker 1: That kind of a balance, I guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's how we came up with the name Adam. Of course, my [paternal] grandmother [Helen Jones Wade] never called me Adam. Said, "You'll be Pat as long (laughter) as I walk this earth." So, but, it's cool. And, usually, even today as I go around somebody'll say, "Hey, Pat," and I know that they are from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. And so--
Speaker 2: But, that's how the name got started.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is March 17, 1935.
Speaker 1: And, where were you born?
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, sir, what's your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation right now is, I'm an actor in cast of 'The Color Purple.'
Speaker 1: Okay. But, you are an actor, a singer--
Speaker 2: An actor, a singer and a writer. I director. And, after forty years, I went back to college and got two degrees. So, now I'm also an adjunct professor of speech and theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is April the 27th.
Speaker 1: All right. And, 2000 and--
Speaker 2: Two thousand and seven [2007].
Speaker 1: And, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At the present time we are at the Oakwood Worldwide apartments [west77] on Huron Street between Dearborn [Street] and Clark [Street]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Chicago, Illinois.

Story_ID: 412222
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Henry Wade, Jr.] side. But, we'll start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her full name is Pauline Simpson [Pauline Nelson Simpson].
Speaker 1: Okay. And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you give us a--
Speaker 2: I have not seen my mother since I was three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She ran off and I never saw her again.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, do you have a sense of how old she was when you were born, maybe?
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifteen, sixteen.
Speaker 1: So, maybe was born, maybe 1916, or '17 [1917], or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventeen [1917], maybe?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or, 1918? Yeah. Now is there, so what, what do you know about your mother's side of the family at all?
Speaker 2: That her father [George Nelson] was a tailor. He had a tailor shop on Wylie Avenue in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]. (Pause) Her mother [Lurnia Nelson] was a housewife. She had two sisters [Isabella Nelson and Alice Nelson Hudson], and unfortunately her only other living sister, Alice, just recently died. So, that means from her side of the family there's no one I could talk to, to get any information or any connections or anything.
Speaker 1: Well, what's, what, you said she left shortly after you were born?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, were your--was she married to your father?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No. Okay.
Speaker 2: They weren't married. And, I was put in a foster home. And, I guess, four years later my [paternal] grandparents [Helen Jones Wade and Henry Wade, Sr.] came and took me and they raised me.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, these are your grandparents on--
Speaker 2: On my father's side.
Speaker 1: Your father's side?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So, she never, you never had any other contact with her at all?
Speaker 2: When I was working in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, I was opening for Joey Bishop. And, my father called me and said that he had a telephone number for Pauline. So, I called her and invited her to the show. And, told her if she didn't have a way to get there, I would send a car for her. And, invited her and her husband to the show and they never came. And, I tried the number the next day and the number was no long valid. So, that was that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you never, never saw her. Do you have any--so her father was a tailor--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the same neighborhood that you--
Speaker 2: No. He was in the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and I was basically in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, any, anything else about that side of the family that you can tell us? Did they interact with you at all when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Pauline sisters, one of, Pauline's sister [Alice Nelson Hudson] had a, had a son, Donnie Hudson [HistoryMaker Donald Hudson], who was a football player at Westinghouse High School [Westinghouse Academy] in Pittsburgh. And, he was a quarterback. He was the first black quarterback I ever met. And, we stayed friends throughout the years. And, he, right now, and his family, they live in Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did he know that you were cousins?
Speaker 2: Yeah. But, it wasn't a very cohesive relationship. I mean, it was like that he was on this side of the family and I was on the other side of the family, or something. But, we just didn't, you know, even though we, we knew each other and we were aware of each other, we didn't sit down and talk, we didn't go out together, you know, things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, can you give us your--as far as you know now, your mother, she, you know, you don't know if she's alive or dead?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 412223
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Henry Oliver Wade, Jr. [Henry Wade, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And, he was born when--he was sixteen when I was born, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, 1918?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighteen [1918], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, Henry O. Wade, Sr. [Henry Wade, Sr.], was married to Helen Jones [Helen Jones Wade], Helen Marie Jones; that was my grandmother. And, they had a son, which was my father. And, then they had another son who was William Allen Wade [William Wade]. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you were, you were telling me before we started, you had some roots in West Virginia, going all the way back to, well, to Nashville [Tennessee] on your father's side, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. My, when I, when my father died in California, I moved him from Pittsburgh to California. He was having some trouble, some liver problems. So, when he got there, he had a healthier lifestyle. So, I thought it added years to his live. But, I--when he died I found the marriage certificate between my grandfather and my grandmother that took place in West Virginia. And, prior to that I had never--any idea or inkling that they had ever been to West Virginia. So, I had to try to figure out how that was possible. And, I was writing, I went, I was in Santa Monica community college [Santa Monica College, Santa Monica, California] studying creative writing with a guy Bernard Mack [Bernard Burnell Mack] who wrote the episode of 'The Jeffersons' that I did. And, I started writing so I had to really create a background history for why they were married in West Virginia, which I did. (Pause) And, it worked out pretty good. You know, it's a, it's a novella that I worked on called 'A Ballad for Pauline' [ph.]. So, that's what came out of it.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, what is the story though? What--
Speaker 2: Basically, for the, the both--
Speaker 1: Not, not the novella so much but his the history really of your, of your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Of my, my grandfather was, his father was married to a German woman and they lived in Nashville, Tennessee. But, the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] gave them such a rough time that they had to leave Nashville and go back to the islands. They left my grandfather in Nashville with a family friend who was a mechanic. And, he taught my grandfather all about cars and all about the mechanics of an automobile. My grandfather finally made his way to Pittsburgh and he got a job being a chauffeur for the Mellon family in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, he became one of the first black chauffeurs in the State of Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any, any stories that your grandfather would tell about the Mellons? That should've been an interesting job, I guess.
Speaker 2: No, not really. He never really talked about it. The thing that was for me outstanding about my grandfather was that he never missed a day's work, ever. He went to the hospital once, no, he went to the dentist. He got sixteen teeth pulled and got up out of the dentist chair and went to work. I never forgot that. And, it, it stays with me today. It's sort of like my, my mantra, if you hire me that I'll be good to go everyday (laughter). It's time to go to work, I'll be there (laughter). If you put my name up on the marquee, I'll be there. And, I'm pretty proud of that. I guess, in the forty-seven years I've been in show business, I only missed two shows. One I had an impacted wisdom tooth, and the other I had kidney stones. But, other than that, I was always there on time, ready to go. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So, that's quite a legacy from your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: They didn't have any stories about the Mellons at all?
Speaker 2: No. He never really go into that with us. Or, I never heard him talk about it with my grandmother, you know. He was a, my grandfather was a fun loving man. He had fun with life. He enjoyed people. He loved kids. He could fix any kind of car without a problem. He just knew what to do.
Story_ID: 412224
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your [paternal] grandmother.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother had what they call healing hands. So, she would, whenever we would go anywhere, she would go out in the backyard and stake a piece of the backyard to be her magic garden. And, she would grow things there that anytime anybody in the family got sick or didn't feel good or something, she would go out in the backyard and dig up some of her things and make a poultice or a paste and cure people. For instance, I had scarlet fever when I was young. And, the doctor came, and in those days when someone in the family had scarlet fever, they put up a sign and quarantine the whole house. No one could go in and no one could come out. So, they put that up on our house and my grandmother ran the doctor off. You know, 'cause the doctor told her that I, that I had a bad case of scarlet fever. I was gonna pockmarked like Mr. Simmons [ph.] down the, down the corner, and she said, "No, he's not." So, she made, she went out in the backyard and start digging up things. She brought 'em in the house. She rinsed 'em out, cut 'em up, put 'em in a pot, cooked them. She got a pair of white gloves, put on my hands, and she tied my hands so I couldn't scratch. And, she put this (unclear), and it smelled awful. It was, just smelled just terrible. But, I wasn't pockmarked and I come out of the scarlet fever with no anything.
Speaker 1: Now, people were dying of scarlet fever--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], yeah.
Speaker 2: And, the thing about my grandmother is that the dogs that we had, all of the dogs would go and--to my grandmother's magic garden, but they wouldn't go in it. They would sit there and they would look at it. And, you know how dogs do if they, they look at you and they don't really understand something, they turn their heads. And, it was almost as if something in the garden was speaking to her. But, it was like, she had magic hands. And, some of the people in the neighborhood were afraid of her. 'Cause they're afraid if you do something to Miss Wade [Helen Jones Wade] (laughter), she'll put a juju on you boy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now, where was, was she--where were her people from?
Speaker 2: From West Virginia.
Speaker 1: West Virginia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So, and she had, when she was thirty-five years old, her hair turned silver. And, and it was a, it was so strange because one day she laid down with black hair and the next day she had a hair full--a head full of silver hair.
Speaker 1: Now, that's what they, that's what told you when--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Takes off hat).
Speaker 1: Just like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, well--
Speaker 2: Like she had a cap on or something, you know.
Speaker 1: So, that's the family story. Now, you weren't around to see that, right 'cause your--
Speaker 2: No. I wasn't around to see that. But, that was something that my grandfather [Henry Wade, Sr.] told me, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: They used to say if you were scared by a bear or something--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no. But, that was her, that was her thing. And, she, she, she had, she did that--and three times that we moved, each time she went in the backyard and created her little magic garden, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, did she call it her magic garden?
Speaker 2: No. That's what other people called it, her magic garden, you know. But, it, it was just amazing to me how that the dogs would not go, they would not enter her garden, you know. When, when she was out there working in it, they would sit and watch her. But, they would never, you know, go in the magic garden. And, I was the one who was designated to take care of the dog. I fed 'em, I cleaned up after 'em, I washed them. And, you know, 'cause a couple of the dogs, they wouldn't let anybody give them a bath but me, you know, so.
Speaker 1: What were your dogs' names?
Speaker 2: There was Rex [ph.]. In fact, we had two dog, two dogs name Rex. There was Houdini [ph.]. Houdini was an Irish Setter, red. And, my grandfather when he worked for another family, they had this large land and they had these dogs that were fenced in. But, this one dog, every time my grandfather would drive out there, he would be on the outside of the gate. And, no one know how--knew how he got outside. So, that's what (laughter) my grandfather called him, Houdini. And, so, the guy ga- and so, the guy was so tired of the dog being outside, he gave the dog to my grandfather. So, my grandfather brought him home.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). And, they we had a Water Spaniel name, Tam [ph.]. That was the meanest little dog (laughter), I've ever seen in my life (laughter). That dog would bite anybody (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, those were the days when a lot of dog just roamed around the neighborhood--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, they knew the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had to know the dogs as well as the people.
Speaker 2: As the people, yeah. And, the dogs were an extension of the family, you know. And, then we had the German Shepherds, they were Rexes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 412225
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about, about your father. I, I know your [paternal] grandparents [Helen Jones Wade and Henry Wade, Sr.] raised you, but what was your father like and what did he do after you were born? He was just a teenager, right?
Speaker 2: He was a teenager, and he went to Westinghouse High School [Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. And, my uncle [William Wade] went to Westinghouse High School, and years later, I went to Westinghouse High School. And, I would see that their, and when I went through their memorabilia, I found picture of my, my uncle and my father. And, I found out that both of them were medal winners and record holders at Westinghouse High School.
Speaker 1: In what sport (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In--my father ran the 220 [220-yard dash] and the 440 [440-yard dash]. And, my uncle ran the 800 [800 metres].
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so, he set the record in the 220 and the 440--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, then later, years later when I went there, we won the city basketball championship three years in a row.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, I'm gonna get to that. But, now, did your father--now, how did you see your father growing up? Did you kind of see him as a big brother or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or, as a father?
Speaker 2: Yeah. More so than a father because that never really came up, you know. I just assumed my grandfather was my father, and my grandmother was gra- was my mother. In fact, they had a couple fights because people would say, "How come your, your mother's so old?" You know, and it was like, in those days when I was growing up, you don't say anything about somebody's mother (laugher), so. That, that was an instant fight, you know. So, but, yeah, it was like, it was a long time before I actually called my dad, dad. I think I was, I had children of my own before that took place.
Speaker 1: So, what did you call him? Just--
Speaker 2: Henry [Henry Wade, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: And, no one made any other, you know, said, "Well, wait a minute. This is not Henry, this is your dad," so. So, that's how it went, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you called your grandparents dad and mom?
Speaker 2: And, mom. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: All right. Now, what did, any stories about your father's growing up? Did he ever talk about, you know, having, having you so early, and--
Speaker 2: No. No he didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, he could dance though. He could dance, and he, he was sharp. Yeah, he liked clothes and he wore them well, and he was sharp. And, he had a nickname. They used to call him, Pip [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay. So, his nickname was Pip?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did he, so, what did he do after Westinghouse? Did he--
Speaker 2: He went to work for Westinghouse United States Steel [sic. United States Steel Corporation].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, he was also a bartender at a speakeasy.
Speaker 1: Okay. And he's a bartender, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. My father always had two or three jobs, all the time. He liked clothes. He liked women. He liked money. And, he had two or three jobs all the time. He never minded working. So, he was, he was on it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he worked at United State- he must've worked United States Steel for twenty-five, thirty years.
Speaker 1: Now, did he live with your grandparents, all that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so did my uncle.
Speaker 1: All right. So, the household consisted of your, your father, your uncle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father, my uncle, and their parents, which was my grandfather and grandmother, and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: And, a dog or two.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That some colorful dogs (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right. We had a cat one time. I saw a picture of myself as a young boy, and we had a cat. But, I don't remember the cat. I don't remember whose cat it was. Was it ours? What its name was, or anything, you know. But, I have a cat today who looks just like the cat in the picture.
Speaker 1: Maybe it's him, come back (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah, this--my cat's called Simba. That's her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which means lion, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 412226
Speaker 1: So, tell me this, when you think back on what people have told you, I guess, about your parents [Pauline Nelson Simpson and Henry Wade, Jr.] and reflect on your [paternal] grandparents [Helen Jones Wade and Henry Wade, Sr.], who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my grandfather in a, in a lot of instances. My approach to work. My approach to business. My grandfather, he believed in independence. And, when I was eleven, he said, "I'm gonna show you what independence is." He said, "And, freedom in America, helps you become independent. But, you can only become independent if you can earn money." So, he said, "Starting now, this is what you gonna do." So, I got a paper route. I was able to shine shoes. I took groceries home for people. In the summertime, he taught me how to shape hedges, how to paint, how to change tires, change the oil in a car. And, it was just one, one thing right after another. But, I was twelve or thirteen years old, I always had money. And, when I went away to college [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], it was just so much fun for me because right away I lined up people's cars that I would wash. I would babysit. I could wax the floors, wash the windows. I could sew on buttons. I could iron. You know, so, all these little things, my grandfather taught me along the way, you know, so I always made money, you know.
Story_ID: 412227
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Probably driving with my [paternal] grandfather [Henry Wade, Sr.]. He let me sit in his lap, and drive the car. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We used to go down to Washington Boulevard and at those days, the swimming pools were segregated. So, we'd go down to what they call the Inkwell [One Hundred Acre Pool, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. And, there was driving range [South Park Golf Course, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] right near there where people, when they wanted to get their drivers licenses, they had to drive on this particular range. So, he would take me down, when the range was closed, and we would drive through it, and drive around. And, he be sitting in the car driving, I'd be sitting in his lap. That was probably one of my earliest, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's illegal to do that now, right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, I remember the same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's interesting how things have changed so much.
Speaker 2: I think my [paternal] grandmother [Helen Jones Wade] told me once, when I, when I had scarlet fever that time, she said that she knew I was sick because she was holding me in her lap and I was pulling the buttons off of her sweater, you know. So, that's how she knew that I was, I was sick.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, I remem- I do remember a lot about the, the white gloves and tying my hands up so I couldn't scratch.
Story_ID: 412228
Speaker 1: Now, what neighborhood did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: I grew up in three neighborhoods actually, East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], that's where I went to elementary school, Morrow Elementary School [John Morrow Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. And, I grew up in Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], that's where I went to Westinghouse High School [Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and that's where my father [Henry Wade, Jr.] and his first wife lived, and I used to go and spend time with them in Homewood. And, then as a young man, when I got married, I lived in the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay. So, this was as, as a young adult, I guess. Okay. Well, tell me what were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Probably, the outdoor, in the, in the summertime, you'd walk around in our neighborhood in East Liberty was a mixed neighborhood. So, you had Italian family living across the street. You had a Greek family living on this side of the street further down. So, you had the, the smells of the different cooking from Greek, and Italian and black. And, there was also the music that was coming from people's houses. And, in tho- in the summertime all the doors were opened, the windows were opened. So, one type of music was coming from this side of the street, another from the other side of the street. And, it made a nice, nice blend of things, you know. And, even though Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] was segregated the people in the neighborhoods got along fine, you know. So, there wasn't a problem with that.
Story_ID: 412229
Speaker 1: And the, the problem racially didn't really come up until girls were entered into the occasion--into the equation. Then that's when the problem raised its head.
Speaker 2: Okay. Can you--do have a story about, about that?
Speaker 1: Yeah. We, we had segregated proms. There was a prom for the black kids, a prom for the white kids. And, one of the football players, Montez Trapp [ph.], he took an Italian girl to the prom. So, we almost had a riot in the school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] because of that.
Speaker 2: Did he take her to the black prom, was that--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, it upset the, upset the Italians, I guess?
Speaker 1: Yes. A lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1: But, it didn't upset Rosie [ph.] (laughter). And, she, she probably was one of the first young women that I met and knew that really had her own code of who she was and what she was gonna do. And, no one could stop her. She was just, you know--I had often wondered later in life what happened with her. Did she had a family, or you know, because in--at tho- at those particular time, we're talking about 1949, 1950, to have a women stand up to a whole family of men and say, "This is who I am. This is what I'm gonna do."
Speaker 2: Yeah, no that's, that does take some courage (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Italian families are male-oriented--
Speaker 1: Oriented. Yes.
Speaker 2: Or dominate, yeah. Well, like a lot of 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A lot of families are, so.
Speaker 1: But, it was like some kind of movie or something, 'cause we were lined up on opposite sides of the street, you know. All the black kids and Rosie were lined up on this side. And, all the white kids was lined up on the other side, you know.
Speaker 2: So, it actually came down to an actual street (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Across the street confrontation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. But, what happened? Did--was it--what quelled it?
Speaker 1: Well, it's, it seems like a lot of things happened. The football coach, actually Coach Fisher [Bill Fisher] ac- Coach, I'm having a senior moment (laughter). The football coach came and he was talking to people. And, he called the quarterback over and called--so, and they talked. And, then they went back to their respective sidewalks and talked to the people and then they just kind of drifted away and other people went in, you know, so, that kind of quelled it.
Story_ID: 412230
Speaker 1: And, also, at the swimming pool which was the Highland Park swimming pool [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which is where the white kids swam. The following week after the prom, all the black kids went to Highland Park. And, so, the guy of course said, "You not gonna swim here. I'll close the park before I left you swim." And, that's exactly what happened. Because we said, "If we can't swim here, nobody's gonna swim here. So, we're not letting anybody in. And, anybody in is not getting out. So, you can decide what you wanna do." And, so, they closed the pool and nobody swam in it, you know. And, later it became a roller skating rink.
Speaker 2: So, they closed the, perm- permanently?
Speaker 1: Permanently, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, so, was it--
Speaker 1: And, that was the first time that I was involved with a community that came together that said, "This is wrong. And, we gonna show up to make it right." And, the whole community was involved.
Speaker 2: How was it organized? Was it organized by the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Or, a church, or--
Speaker 1: At that time, I, I didn't even know there was an NAACP. It was the people in the community. Mostly, it was the athletes in the community; football, basketball teams, track team, swim team. Those guys were there and so then their families joined in. And, that's basically how it started.
Speaker 2: Now, this is in the 1949, 1950?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950], yeah, 1950. And, in fact--
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, this is like before the civil rights, the formal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Civil Rights Movement and before, you know, the media always says that the first sit-in was in 1960, and the first this and that, but I found that a lot things happened--
Speaker 1: Happened in different places, sure. And, they were isolated then, and didn't, we didn't have the news coverage that we have today, you know, to point these things out, you know. But, I believe that also that all over the country, you know, 'cause I know in 1952 when I went to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], that was the first time I had ever seen signs, "For Colored Only," "Whites Only," those kinds of things. And, stop on the road and have to go around to the back door to get a sandwich to eat. And, we couldn't eat there, had to take it back to the car and eat it while we drove, you know. And, I started, well, my dad [Henry Wade, Jr.] let me out to say, "No, I don't wanna go, I wanna go back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]," you know, and I stayed there. And, I'm glad I did. But, we did things there, for instances, in the, in Petersburg [Virginia], the motion picture theater house, blacks could only sit upstairs. So, we wouldn't go. And, we boycotted it, and we wouldn't let anybody else go either (laughter). And, then there was a bus that took us from the college campus into downtown Petersburg. And, so, we forbid anybody to ride on the bus because the black students had to ride in the back of the bus. So, we would all walk the three and a half miles from the campus to Petersburg. And, if we saw anybody, any student on the bus, we would ostracize 'em.
Story_ID: 412231
Speaker 1: Let me get back to your younger years, and we'll pick that up a little later. Now, what did you like to do when you were a little kid? Did you, now, you were the only little kid in the household, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so--
Speaker 2: I would, I would go down in the cellar and I would play in the dark. And, I'd create all of these things in the dark. And, the things that go bump in the night were not my enemies, or I wasn't, I had to fear of them. They were my playmates. Of course, my uncle [William Wade], he told everybody that I was crazy (laughter), 'cause I would go downstairs and I'd play in the dark, and I wouldn't turn the light on. But, being down there in the dark was just very soothing and satisfying for me, you know. And, and like I say, I was able to create all of these different entities and things and I was able to conquer the world and, you know, fix things that were, were, were bad for my family and things like that. I was able to do that.
Speaker 1: That is unusual. You said, you would go--how long would you stay in the dark? I mean, in absolute dark, where you couldn't see anything?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you know. But, it, there's, there wasn't absolute dark because there's, there's things where light would come through where the coal shoot was, or things like that, you know. And, the cellar had two, two areas. One was cement on one side and on the other side where it slanted down and went out into the backyard, had a dirt floor, you know. And, then there was the washer and the dryer in there and you could, we had a light bulb with a little cord on it, you pull it it'll come on, you know. And, then we had the two big sinks, you know, things like that. And, we had this big long table. And, we had this train set that my [paternal] grandfather [Henry Wade, Sr.] had had for years and it was on this table. And, it, it was terrific. It as a miniature train set and--
Speaker 1: Did he have the landscaping?
Speaker 2: It had landscaping. It had stations, it had all kinds of things. All kinds of oil cars and the cars that would take pro- produce and all kinds of things. It had lights and whistles and smoke (laughter) and, and for years I had gone down, I would go into the basement and play with those, you know. But, things I would conjure up because I had, I had like, I had my enemies, you know, which were guys across the street, Fathead [ph.], B-eye [ph.] and Tootie [ph.]. They were my enemies (laughter). And, I would fight them all the time, you know. Because they would, they would mess with me, you know, for some reason, you know. And, I guess, because we all came from the same place, 'cause they were also in the foster home that I was in.
Story_ID: 412232
Speaker 1: Were you in the foster home long before you were--
Speaker 2: I was there, I guess, maybe three years or four years.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you actually, you know, remember the foster home (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Miss Tillman [ph.], you know. And, I was fortunate because in the foster home she was a wonderful person. She, she, she beat us once 'cause we were fighting in the house and we broke some of her stuff. And, so, she said, "I don't allow no fighting in my house." And, so, after she lit us up (laughter), we didn't fight in her house anymore, you know. It's funny because to think of that now, and she lit us up because we deserved it, and went right on. But, today if a parent or guardian or something would light one of their kids up 'cause they deserve it, the kids would call the police on 'em and they would have a child abuse case, you know. But, yeah, they, they were jealous too, I think. And, so, we would fight all the time, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, your parents actually, I mean, well, your [paternal] grandparents [Helen Jones Wade and Henry Wade, Sr.] actually, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They came to the foster home--
Speaker 1: Got you out of there when you--
Speaker 2: And took me with them.
Speaker 1: --were about four?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were about four.
Speaker 2: And, we went to live in Garfield Hill [Garfield, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know--did they visit you before then? Or, did--how did they, did you know anything about 'em?
Speaker 2: I don't remember them visiting me except I remember sitting with them at church. It was St. James A.M.E. Church [St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. It was on the corner of Euclid Avenue. And, I remember sitting with them in the church.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is this the family church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, I remember Ms. Crawley [ph.] was there in the church also. And, she's a church lady--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Miss Crawley, yeah. So, yeah, those, those--so, I would conjure up and do battle with the B- B-eye [ph.] and Fathead [ph.] and Tootie [ph.], down in the dark (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you would--you had come up with imaginary battle with them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we, we fight in the field, we go to the field and we rip our shirts off and we'd get to it, you know, (laughter). So--
Speaker 1: That's, that's something though.
Speaker 2: The one day--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The three of them had me hemmed up in an alley and Van Drummond [ph.] who I had a fight with two days earlier came walking into the alley and he saw the three of them had me jacked up in the alley. So, he came over and he stood beside me and he said, "No, he's with us. So, you all gotta go," you know. So--
Speaker 1: Now, is this in real life or in the--?
Speaker 2: No, that's in real life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Van Drummond. They had the Drummond [ph.] family that lived in; the Drummond family, the Heflin [ph.] family, Seymour Ware. They all lived down the, down the alley from where I lived.
Story_ID: 412233
Speaker 1: Now was, was radio and music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes. In fact, Miss Tillman [ph.], she would have on her radio, 'Your Hit Parade,' and the 'Kraft Music Hall,' and radio shows like that. And, she would sit me on a tool in the kitchen while she was cooking and have me sing along with the radio. Which his another thing that Fathead [ph.], B-eye [ph.], and Tootie [ph.] was jealous about (laughter), 'cause I was able to sit in the kitchen and do that, you know. But, yeah, I remember Miss Tillman for doing that. And, she would make little, little cakes and stuff with icing on us it for, for us, you know. She was a fabulous cook. Her food was, it was just, when she would cook, it would just like light up the whole neighborhood, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, you were one of her favorites, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. And, plus, I didn't mind, I would go in, in her garden and I would weed the garden; take out the weeds and stuff. And, I was diligent about that. So, she appreciated that, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite radio program?
Speaker 2: No, not really. You know, I, if anything it would be the 'Kraft Music Hall,' maybe. Or, the 'Hit Parade,' 'cause those were the shows that, those were the radio shows that we listened to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, later on as I grew older, I would listen to Bill Powell [William Powell] and Sir Walter Raleigh, and--
Speaker 1: Now, now did you like the movies? Did you go to the movie?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I love, love films. In those days, of course, you would go to the movies and you would take your lunch because you would see two features, plus two serials, plus a cartoon, plus the coming attractions, you know. And, we'd stay in the movies, we'd go like eleven o'clock and stay in the movie 'til like six o'clock.

Speaker 1: Where did you start school? You started grade school at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started at Larimer Ave- Larimer Avenue Elementary School [Larimer School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. And--
Speaker 2: That was East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah. Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you have favorite subject or favorite activity?
Speaker 2: Not really. Well, I, I liked history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of all. I was not good in math. I struggled. Math reminded me of, a little later on in life when I became an actor, of Shakespeare [William Shakespeare]. It's, when you do Shakespeare it comes down to you or the language. It's either you master it, or it masters you. There's no two ways (unclear). August Wilson is like that. His plays are, they have a lot words, very wordy. And, it's either you master the language or it masters you. There's no two ways about it, you know. So, that, that's what my dilemma was with math when I was young (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, were you, were you good at making presentations in school, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about it. What did you, what's the first thing you did--
Speaker 2: In the school plays and stuff, I was always a participant. And, in giving reports, I was always good at getting up, giving my reports in a natural way, without fumbling or phumphering [ph.], you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a, did you get a chance to do that in church [St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] too?
Speaker 2: Yes. Which even today, I, I like bible study more so than the service. I guess, that makes me strange, but for some reason bible study seemed real, and church was different, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you ever have thoughts of becoming a minister?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right. So, 'cause you got all the tools, you can sing, you can--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Stand up in front of people, you know.
Story_ID: 412235
Speaker 1: And, we used to do plays of the, the neighbor that we had in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], across the street, she would gather all the kids together and do impromptu plays with us. And, I, I remember, I don't remember what the play was about, but I remember the title of a play she was doing, it was called 'I Won't Dance' [ph.]. And, I can't for the life of me remember what it was about. But, I remember we did it in her backyard.
Speaker 2: Okay. The neigh- the neighborhood came out to see it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you have a favorite actors or, in the movies, or favorite movies?
Speaker 1: Not at that time. Probably Herb Jeffries, yeah; the singing cowboy.
Speaker 2: Herb Jeffries is not--was that the black cowboy?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Harlem, was it 'Harlem on the Range' [sic. 'Harlem Rides the Range'], or something, or?
Speaker 1: Har- yeah, 'Harlem on the Range,' yeah. 'Cause he had, he had two pearl handle guns, and he, he was good. He could--and he had good voice. He could sing, you know. And--
Speaker 2: So, that was something. It made a big impression on you 'cause I, I guess, you know, there were very few black people in the movies in those days, I guess.
Speaker 1: In those days, yes.
Speaker 2: But, I know he was created like to kind of fill that need that black kids have, had to see a black cowboy.
Speaker 1: And, there was another actor who later became emcee at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York]. His name escapes me; light skinned fellow, straight black hair. Oh, man, name just escapes me now. But, he was the first black gangster. And, he was like Edward G. Robinson type, you know. But, he and Herb Jeffries, I guess, were my, my favorites.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, did you, your family read the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier]?
Speaker 1: Of course, yes. That, that was the paper. Yeah, and later as I said, I got to play basketball with Bill Nunn's YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] team.
Speaker 2: And, Bill Nunn was the--
Speaker 1: He was the sponsor of our team.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But, what--
Speaker 1: You know, Mervin Austin [ph.] was the coach.
Speaker 2: I mean, in relationship to the Courier, he was?
Speaker 1: Oh, he was the sports writer for the Pittsburgh Courier.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But, his son, of course, now is an actor; Bill Nunn, Jr. [sic. Bill Nunn III], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's famous for playing Radio Raheem--
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In (laughter) 'Do the Right Thing.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 412236
Speaker 1: So, you went to high school at Westinghouse?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Westinghouse High School [Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. That's in a different neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It's in Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. Yes.
Speaker 1: So, the family moved to Homewood?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did. We'll actually, no, we didn't. We were still in East Liberty [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], but I was on the line to go to Westinghouse or to go to Peabody. And, I chose to go to Westinghouse--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Instead of Peabody High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now, tell me this. I didn't ask you this, but was baseball a big deal growing up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]? 'Cause I know you had two Negro League teams, as well as the Pittsburgh Pirates. Was that a big, was it a big deal?
Speaker 2: Yes. My [paternal] grandfather [Henry Wade, Sr.] would take me to see the Homestead Grays and to see Josh Gibson. And, who else did I see, Satchel Paige, Panama Red [ph.]. Those guys were amazing at the feats that they could do with a baseball. And, I love it because they showed off all the time (laughter), you know. They showed out, you know, they, the first baseman would scoop that ball in the glove, toss it, (makes noise) (laughter), and do the double play backwards to go to first, then go to second. Things like that was, that was, that was thrilling.
Speaker 1: So, it was, is that like a major difference between black baseball and white baseball?
Speaker 2: Yeah. The, the white baseball was kind of sort of right down the line, you know, of this is a formula of the way we do it, so and so and so and so.
Speaker 1: But, the black baseball was more show business like?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just showing off. I, I used to love that (laughter), to see those guys in there.
Speaker 1: So, you had another team, the Pittsburgh Crawfords too. Did you ever see them play?
Speaker 2: Yes. I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, Crawford was a name that had some history also because they had the Pittsburgh Crawfords. Then they had Crawford Grill, which was a fine jazz establishment in the Hill District in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: So, the Crawford family owned a lot of--
Speaker 2: Owned a lot of, yes. The Crawfords and the Robinson family.
Story_ID: 412237
Speaker 1: Tell us about high school. Now, did you, were you a pre- pretty good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, at that time, my father [Henry Wade, Jr.] wanted me to become the first black Olympic swimmer 'cause I was on the swimming team. And, so, I used to, he used to take me around the different pools in the summer. And, I would race his friends. Of course, I could kill those guys (laughter). They were out drinking on the weekend and I was, at that time, I was in tiptop shape. I could wipe them out. But, two things were, they, they, they weren't good on the dives. Nor, were they good at hitting the turn on the wall. So, even if someone was ahead of me, when they hit the wall, they had trouble making the turn, kick back and go out, and I didn't. I hit the wall and I was gone, you know. So, that's where I would catch them all that were ahead of me, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, then I got turned on to basketball. And, then I was dried off and I was out of--no longer a fish. I got out of the pool, and from that point on, basketball was my game.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so, what did you play?
Speaker 2: I played guard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you, did they have a point guard then? Or, was it--
Speaker 2: They didn't have a point guard then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, that was the position that I, you know, that I played.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By definition, I would bring the ball up and distribute it, and those kind of things. And, in the beginning, the coach had some problems with me 'cause I always remembered the Homestead Grays and how the guys showed off playing baseball. And, I tried to put that into my game playing basketball, you know, and they would play his own defense and try to bust us on, go in, and fall down to my knees and dribble on my knees and stuff (laughter). Coach say, "Wade [HistoryMaker Adam Wade], this is not a circus. What are you doing?" (Laughter) But that was a lot of fun for me.
Speaker 1: Now, you said, the team won some championships.
Speaker 2: Yeah. We won the city championship three years in a row.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we lost the state championship two years in a row to the same team; to Farrell High School [Farrell, Pennsylvania]. And, the year before me was a wonderful year because on the team was Maurice Stokes who became an All-American and All-Pro.
Speaker 1: Now, he, he was your team?
Speaker 2: He was the year before me.
Speaker 1: The year before you, okay.
Speaker 2: Ed Fleming--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maurice Stokes--we should stop here for a second. Now, he was considered probably the best basketball player in the U.S. when he was playing.
Speaker 2: If he hadn't contracted encephalitis, he probably would've become the best basketball player the NBA [National Basketball Association] had ever seen.
Speaker 1: I know he was drafted by Cincinnati Royals [Sacramento Kings] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By the Cincinnati Royals, yes.
Speaker 1: And, he came down with the disease shortly thereafter, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, he had, he had all the tools. He was big. He was fast. He was good with either hand. He played great defense. He was a terrific passer, and rebounder. He had all the tools and it was no, no, no doubt that he would've surpassed everybody.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sort of tragic story.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But, he, being from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], the first black basketball professional player was also from Pittsburgh was Chuck Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, he played for the Boston Celtics. Of all teams to play for (laughter). He played for the Boston Celtics because Boston (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he a Westinghouse [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] pro- product too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 420658
Speaker 1: So, we were tal- talking about Chuck Cooper, who many consider the first, he was the first in, black NBA [National Basketball Association] player drafted by a team. He was drafted by the Celtics [Boston Celtics], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: You said, his father [sic.] was a song and dance man?
Speaker 2: Cornell Cooper was a song and dance man. He played a lot of big nightclubs, the Twin Coaches in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 1: It's such a--song and dance man. All right. Now, now, what were your favorite subjects in high school? Did you--
Speaker 2: Same as, as elementary school [Larimer School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]; history basically. I like to study religions. So, I was, I was good, and I was good in geography.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, math and I wrestled (laughter). Take math down in the dark, in the cellar (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, were you on the honor roll or anything?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, did you get any special honors when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Out of three hundred and something, I was twenty-third.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now Westinghouse [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was it an all-black school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, what was the percentage of black students?
Speaker 2: Probably fifty-fifty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you had, like I say, the year before me in the class with Maurice Stokes, you had Dakota Staton, you had Ahmad Jamal, you had Grover Mitchell who played and conducted the Basie band [Count Basie Orchestra]. You had Albert Aarons [Al Aarons] the trumpet player in the Basie band, Frank Calimondo [ph.]; they were all in that class.
Speaker 1: That's quite a cla- that's the class just ahead of you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so, you had some big shoes to fill (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess, you kind of felt as the seniors were that talented.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, and that team lost to Farrell High School [Farrell, Pennsylvania] by one point in the champion, in the state championship game. And, the following year our team lost to Farrell High School in the state championship game by one point.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't in the same class with Maurice Stokes, by you did play ball with him, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. Yeah. That's something.
Speaker 2: And, he had Jack Twyman who took over looking after him. And, Jack Twyman was also a pro basketball player from the Cincinnati Royals [Sacramento Kings]--
Speaker 1: Was Twyman from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: From Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, Twyman; I saw him play as a kid.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: With [HistoryMaker] Oscar Robertson. Yeah, so, Twyman knew Maurice from high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay.
Speaker 2: And, playing in the different tournaments and stuff in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Yeah. There's a TV movie ['Maurie'] they made about that relationship, and I can think of the name of it right now.
Speaker 2: Yes. I recall.
Speaker 1: But there was one.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think they--you know, similar to 'Brian's Song' in some way. But, there is a movie they made of that relationship between Jack Twyman and Maurice Stokes. Twyman was an all-star in his own right.
Speaker 2: Yes. Right. In his own right. Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was quite a basketball team I would guess.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter). Yeah, the Cincinnati Royals, that--they had a good, they had a terrific team. And, if Maurice had stayed, you know, well throughout the season, I'm sure they would've taken the title.
Speaker 1: But, well, was--did Twyman play for Westinghouse, too?
Speaker 2: No. He did not.
Speaker 1: He didn't, okay. Oh, okay. All right.
Speaker 2: He played for one of the Catholic high schools [Central Catholic High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay. But, they were friends there in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we had there every summer there was a park, Mellon Park [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and would have tournaments there and that's where all of the ballplayers would meet up. Ellsworth Morgan, who went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], played basketball there.
Story_ID: 420659
Speaker 1: Now di- you went to one of these separate proms too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: In fact, I have a picture that I saw not too long ago with my first wife, Kay [Kay Wade] and myself, and my teammate, Rip Nixon [Lemuel O. Nixon], and Charlie Heflin [Charles Heflin] went to, we were all spiffed out (laughter) in our tuxes and, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, now--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite teacher in high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], or was there someone that made a real big impact on you?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, unless it was football coach, Pete Dimperio. He was a driven man. And, he instituted things like, if we miss layups then our name went on the list and we had to run or we had to wrestle the football lineman. And, because they wanted to toughen us up because in Pennsylvania the league was a tough league.
Speaker 1: Basketball?
Speaker 2: Basketball, yeah. So, he wanted to toughen us up, you know. He thought that the basketball players were a little soft, so he instituted that with us to, to get us to be a little more hard, you know.
Speaker 1: You'd have to wrestle with the football lineman?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. There was (laughter), that wasn't fun either (laughter).
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] does have a reputation as a tough town sometimes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And, that's--
Speaker 2: That's about as blue collar as you can get (laughter). But, he instituted things like that and hitting the tree. Like you'd be down in the four point stand and he's hollering, "Go." And, then you have to go for it and hit the tree, except it didn't move back and you do it again (laughter). He'd make you do it over and over and over and over again, you know, things like that.
Speaker 1: So, did you play football too?
Speaker 2: No. I played football but not for high school. I played for an independent team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I play wide receiver. And, I enjoyed that a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay. While, while you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I had good hands. I--you throw it, I'll catch it, you know, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was fun.
Story_ID: 420660
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduation [from Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], how did you chose a college? Or, was it certain that you were going to college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, it wasn't certain at first, but my [paternal] grandfather [Henry Wade, Sr.], he said, "He's going to college and that's that." Because it was whether I was gonna take a job, whether I was gonna go join the [U.S.] Army. Because even then in those times, some families looked at the Army as a way to go because it was discipline and it was--it did pay money and those kinds of things. And, you could go off and see the world. So, that was my grandfather's idea that I go to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]. And, I don't know how he came up with Virginia State. It's just--next thing I know we were sitting in the car driving down pass Richmond, Virginia and on to Petersburg [Virginia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, were you the first, first person in your family to attend college?
Speaker 2: To go to college; yes. And, that's why it was so important for me after forty years to go back and get my B.A. degree, and get my master's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you--this was 1953?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952], yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifty-two [1952]. Okay. So, you graduated at seventeen?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Nineteen fifty-two [1952], Virginia State University in historic Petersburg.
Speaker 2: Petersburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's where the--
Speaker 2: High above the Appomattox [Appomattox River].
Speaker 1: Yeah, right--the last battle [Battle of Appomattox Court House] of the Civil War was fought.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, how did you like Virginia State?
Speaker 2: I loved it. It was terrific. I met my, my best friend there. We're still best friends. A guy name Gene Hudgins from Atlantic City, New Jersey. I met him there and we became friends and we stayed friends all these years. In fact, he'll be here in Chicago [Illinois], I guess, in a couple weeks, coming to see 'The Color Purple.'
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did, did you join a fraternity there or anything?
Speaker 2: I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my fraternity was basketball (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you played ball there?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah. Coach Matthews. In fact, I named my first son [Ramel Wade] after him. Coach Matthews unfortunately was killed in an automobile accident; Shelton Matthews.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, so, did you have an athletic scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's probably a good reason to go there (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They offered you a scholarship.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I, I had thought about going to Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], too, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A friend--
Speaker 1: So, well, how did the team do?
Speaker 2: We did good. We did good. We won, we won the Christmas tournament down at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]. And, we went to the tournament for the NAIA [National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]. Black schools [HBCUs] at that time didn't go to the NCAAs [National Collegiate Athletic Association]. And, lost in, I think we lost in the second round.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you still, you were the point guard on the team?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any players that we would, whose names we would know now that played?
Speaker 2: Other than Hudgins, Hudgins is in the hall of fame. He played with the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters] for thirteen years, I guess.
Speaker 1: Is this your friend that--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He played--he was also in the Eastern League [Eastern Basketball Association; Continental Basketball Association] hall of fame, the Globetrotter's hall of fame. They used to call him Forty-point Hudge [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay. I guess, we can tell why.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess he must've scored--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he could knock it down. He had, he had one of the pretties jump shots I've ever seen. Hal Greer was another one that had that of jump shot. It's funny I was just on the other corner the other day and a guy asked me, he said, "Say, man, are, are you--" what was his name? Point guard for Chicago Bulls--
Speaker 1: Van Lier [HistoryMaker Norm Van Lier].
Speaker 2: Van Lier. Yeah, he said--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do sort of look--
Speaker 2: "You Norm Van Lier?" I said, "No, man I'm not," you know.
Speaker 1: There's a slight--I can see why he might say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. If you never met, you know, Van Lier in person.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They might think that you--
Speaker 2: Oh, Okay.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: But, I thought that was funny 'cause that used to be one of the people I even rooted for, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Norm Van Lier. Now, Van Lier is not, is he from, he's from--
Speaker 2: I don't know. I never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never met him, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, I did know where he was from too. I can't think of it. But, okay, so, Forty-point Hudge. So, you all have a good team. Now, what was your major in college?
Speaker 2: My major at the beginning was physical education and later it changed to, to health education.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Did you have--were there any individuals other than the coach and staff that were influential?
Speaker 2: Yes. Dr. Brewer [James Brewer]. He as a, he had a brother. Both of them went to Virginia State and both of them played football. They were lineman. Dr. Brewer went to Westinghouse [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and he knew my father [Henry Wade, Jr.]. So, he said, "I'm changing your major from physical education to health education."
Speaker 1: Okay. So, Dr. Brewer kind of look out for you?
Speaker 2: Yes. And, he was one of the people I took care of his car, washed it, and gassed it up, changed the oil, change the transmission fluid.
Story_ID: 420661
Speaker 1: Now, you had all the, I mean, we reflect back on this. I mean, there was an era where to, to be a man, you had to learn a lot of different things. I mean, people expected a man to be able to change oil (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely, yes.
Speaker 1: Fix a car.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To be able to do things that, that today are not necessarily expected of youth.
Speaker 2: Right. It surprised me how many people, many guys in college couldn't sew. It's--that's a simple thing to do, you know; couldn't sew on buttons. Or, they'd send their shirts to the laundry. And, when they got 'em back, the laundry put so much starch in it, that when they opened it up, the strings would pop and all the buttons would come off (laughter). So, I would charge 'em twenty-five, fifty cents a shirt and I'd sew the buttons back on.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Speaker 2: You know, it was like--
Speaker 1: I can't imagine people paying, you know, but, I guess if they need it, that's something they need.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Somebody's gotta do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, you know, but, I would wax floors and do kitchens, you know, polish silverware. I mean, just household things that you could do right in the house, all that somebody would want, but wouldn't have the time necessarily to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: I remember I babysitted for the, one of the science professor's kids, and he had these two bad little boys. They would run around, you'd be trying to clean the house and they'd be running around knocking over things. And, so, I took 'em and I tied them up in the chair (laughter). And, I was waxing his floor and he came home early and the kids were tied up in the chair (laughter). And, he, "Get out of my house. Get out of my house. Don't you dare come in my house again." Those two little boys followed me everywhere on the campus [of Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and they thought that was the greatest thing in the world that I tied 'em up. They loved it. They followed me everywhere on the campus. I'd go in class and look around and there they'd be. And, I'd come out and they'd be sitting there. That, that was funny (laughter).
Story_ID: 420662
Speaker 1: Now, so, you were, you were in school [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] for three years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What happened? Why didn't you finish?
Speaker 2: I got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went home, got married.
Speaker 1: Now, you married the young lady you took to the prom?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know. Okay. So you were high school sweethearts?
Speaker 2: Mary Kay [Kay Wade]. Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right. Well, I mean, I've heard of people getting married and still finishing school, and staying in school. But, what was the--
Speaker 2: Well, when you got a wife and a baby and you gotta provide for money, it's not about school then. It's, it's the real life taps you on the shoulders, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you had a baby coming?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that what, that's what happened. So, I went to work. And, with three years of college, I couldn't, I didn't have a lot of options opened to me. So, I ended up doing, the same as my dad [Henry Wade, Jr.], doing two jobs or three jobs. 'Cause I worked in the Tic-Toc shop in Kaufmann's department store [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] washing pots and pans. And, then I worked at the post office. And, then, of course, I did all the little side jobs that I could do. And, I ended up working as a sandhog underneath the river and building sewage tunnels. Which was probably one of the most scary jobs I ever had. People tossing around dynamite (laughter). And, you know, you had your hard hat on and you had to keep that on. Because anything drop out of the ceiling, hit you in the head, and just bust your head wide open, you know. So, then they had guys from all over the world down there in that hole, you know, mucking and raking and setting the headings with dynamite, and blow it up. And, somebody's upstairs sitting on the desk making calculations. And, you down there hoping that they don't make a mistake and you get blown to kingdom come, you know. And, then after that, I--Rudy Riley stopped me and told me about the, the opening they had Salk Hall [Jonas Salk Hall, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] with Dr. Jonas Salk's polio research team.
Speaker 1: So, this 1950 what?
Speaker 2: This was probably 1956, I guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], '57 [1957].
Story_ID: 420663
Speaker 1: So, Dr. Jonas Salk was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]. He's the famous (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Salk Hall [Jonas Salk Hall, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They named a hall after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. See, he discovered the polio vaccine.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Now, he's, that--is that about the time that he discovered it? I mean, what--
Speaker 2: He had discovered it prior to that.
Speaker 1: Prior to that. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And, when I went to work for him, the primary goal was to try to find a substitute for the monkey kidney cell that was the stable--staple for the polio virus. And, politics played a part in it because they got the rhesus monkeys [rhesus macaque] that they used from India. And, the United States and India had a falling out. So, there was a race to see if they could find something else to take its place. And, also, there was another camp which was Dr. Sabin [Albert Sabin] in Cincinnati [Ohio] who was using the live virus in the vaccine.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, Dr. Salk camp was against using a live virus because he's, he felt that there was no way to control the virus once it entered the body. And, the person could actually come down with polio because of the virus.
Speaker 1: Now, which one of 'em was oral? I remember one of them was taken orally.
Speaker 2: That was Dr. Sabin.
Speaker 1: Sabin. Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, they experimented on us in school with it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Experimented on a lot of people (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, how long did you work for Dr. Jonas Salk?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, so, it takes us to about 1958. Now, how was Jonas Salk to work for? Was he--?
Speaker 2: He was terrific.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was terrific. When the opportunity came for me to, to sing, he encouraged me to go and do that. He said, "You can always, if it doesn't work out for you, you'll always have a job here." I mean, that was kind of cool to, you know, for someone to lay that on you and you're getting ready to go and, excuse me, you're getting ready to go and find out about a, you know, a, a singing career and someone say, "Well, you go and go after it and if it doesn't work out, you got a job here." So, that was, that was pretty nice.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a sense of the time of the historical importance of Dr. Salk, or?
Speaker 2: Somewhat. But, not as much as I, as I have today, you know. I didn't realize that. Although, one of the guys on the swimming team had polio and one leg was shrunken much more than the other. But, he, and I used to go and watch him swim. He was a long distance swimmer. And, I used to go and just sit there and watch him, you know, when he was practicing in the pool. It was just amazing what this guy could do in the water.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, it was a common disease in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Now, eradicated, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But, I, I think that Dr. Jonas Salk had the idea that once he discovered this vaccine, he could go to the government and say, "This is it. This is the formula. Make enough to give everybody in the world a shot and then it's gone." But, it didn't work that way, unfortunately. So, polio still resides in a lot of countries and stuff where it could just be eradicated.
Speaker 1: Did he ever reflect with you about the, his disappointment with that?
Speaker 2: Not really, no. France recognized what he did. And, the country of France sent him a Citroen automobile. That's the first time I'd ever heard or seen, you know, that kind of--
Speaker 1: That's the car with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Car.
Speaker 1: The, I think the back wheel base is shorter than the--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, it--
Speaker 1: I mean, the, they--
Speaker 2: Zoom--it was like the old Packards. It drops down and then it rises up and--
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the axel smaller in the back, right, then it is--
Speaker 2: Than it is in the front, yeah.
Speaker 1: In the front of the Citroen? It's a--it's has an odd kind of shape.
Speaker 2: So, but, but he wanted to be able to do that. And, I think, it hurt him somewhat that the government just didn't pick it up. Go on and eliminate it. Okay, what's next? Cancer? Okay, let's go and do that. And--'cause I think he ended up in San Diego [California] working on a cure for cancer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. Did you kind of still keep in contact with him over the years?
Speaker 2: I spoke to him several times, you know. We had a big laugh because the, the, the public relations people from the record company were trying to insinuate that I was one of the discoverers along with Dr. Jonas Salk on the polio vaccine, (laughter) you know, they trying to paint another picture on it, you know. And, so, he and I got a, had a big laugh over that, you know. And, he was saying that, "Yeah. They should come here." He said, "Because the real story is more exciting than that," you know. Said, "Here you were underneath the river blasting with dynamite and stuff (laughter), and then you come and work for me and then boom, you get a singing career, you know, with a guy that's just down the alley from you." He said, "It's, it's terrific," you know. So, we got a big laugh out of that.
Story_ID: 420664
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, who did you start singing? How did this happen?
Speaker 2: I used to sing all the time because it came from when I would go down in the cellar in the dark. I would sing to amuse myself. You know, plus, I like to feel that, if I heard a song one time, then I could sing it. So, with that facility, I'd always be showing off. Singing, you know, tunes that I heard just yesterday, you know. So, that's how I got started. And, then I would sing going through the neighborhood and stuff and I remember, Victor Martinelli [ph.] was a guy that lived down the street from me, his mother would always be at the gate when I passed on the way to school. She'd say, "Sing me a song. Sing me a song." And, I would sing a song for her, you know. And, Richard Baugh who was a friend of mine, lived down the alley from me. And, I used to go to his house, and we would take a fake book and we would start at A and go through the whole fake book all the way to Z.
Speaker 1: A fake book (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just sing the song. A fake book is a musician's book. Like you go on a gig, let's say a wedding or something, you had this fake book with you so that, you know, it listed the songs, the lyrics and the cords. So, that you could do the gig and you could answer requests, you know. So, we, that's, that's what we would do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we went to, we would do that all the time and his mom would fix food for us and she would encourage us, you know. And, then we would go out and we would work a couple gigs. Once time, we did a gig in downtown Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]. And, after the gig the guy said to us, "Do you have contract?" We said, "No. We don't have a contract. You just told us you want us to sing here, so we came and sing." He said, "Well, I'm not paying you." And, he didn't pay us, you know. So, we went outside, but karma is something 'cause a year later that place burned down to the ground (laughter). So, Rich and I got a big laugh out of that one, (laughter). But--
Speaker 1: So, so, you were doing this in--from high school [Westinghouse High School; Westinghouse Academy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah. In high school, I sang at the high school talent contest and stuff, you know. Never won, but, I had a good time so it didn't matter, you know. Then, we went to see Jesse Belvin. Jesse Belvin was a singer that was killed in an automobile accident, and he had a hit record called 'Guess Who.' (Singing) "Someone really loves you, guess who, guess who." And, Jesse--we went in and we sat and we talked to him after the show was over. And, the next day he drove out to Richard's house. And, he sat down with us and spent the whole day talking to us about show business and what you should do, who, where you should go, who you should see. And, it was just thrilling that a person of his ilk would take the time to do that for us, you know. And, that's was great, so, that's what encouraged us. And, Richard wrote thirty songs, which he taught me. And, he said, "I wanna go to New York [New York] and I wanna have you sing the songs to the publishers for me so I can get them published." And, basically, that's what we did. I had never been to New York. And, so, off we went. And, we stayed in New York for, I guess, three weeks or a little more. We stayed, Clarence Bennett [ph.] was a football player at Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], we stayed at his house in his basement for a week. Then, we moved out of there and we slept on the subway trains. In those days, you could do that. We took the E train, rode all the way out to the end of the line, got off, got back on, slept all the way back in to Manhattan [New York], changed to the F train, rode out to the end of the line, got off, got back on, slept all the way back. And, that's how we, that's how we survived, you know. 'Cause it was cold when we went there. It was in October, you know. We shared hot dogs and stuff. That was it. And, it took us almost three weeks to find one publisher that would listen to Richard's songs. And, finally, we went up to this place called Paxton Music [Coed Records, Inc.], and this lady named Frances [ph.] who was from Pennsylvania said, "I'll make sure they listen to your songs." And, she got up and went in the office and they were talking about the New York Giants football team. And, she said, "I want you to listen to these young men." And, they came out and we did the songs for them. And, then they start calling tunes. And, because Richard and I had gone through the fake book so much, they called a tune, no big thing, 'Green Dolphin Street' ['On Green Dolphin Street'], (singing) "Da da doo dada, da da doo dada," we'd just hit it right at, (singing) "I remember April," you know, we, we were knocking them off, and they were very impressed, you know, 'cause, you know, we had a big repertoire.
Story_ID: 420496
Speaker 1: So, this 1958 or '59 [1959]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you went to New York [New York] Richard Bong?
Speaker 2: Richard Baugh.
Speaker 1: Oh, is it B-A--
Speaker 2: B-A-U-G-H.
Speaker 1: Oh, Baugh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. B-A-U-G-H. Okay, Richard Baugh. All right. So, one publisher did like the songs, and--
Speaker 2: He didn't like Richard's songs. But, he like the way we were able to do all of the different standards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we came in with such a repertoire of songs. So, and, as it ended up, they wanted me to come back and record but, they didn't want to do Richard's songs.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, they liked your songs styling's I guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So, so, you had appointment to go back?
Speaker 2: And, it's kind of funny because--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I guess, I was trying to imitate Nat King Cole, and ended up sounding like Johnny Mathis (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, can you do a little bit of that for us, so we can hear--
Speaker 2: Not now, I, I used to but--
Speaker 1: How did you, how did you--can you give us, I mean, kind of--
Speaker 2: I, I had, there, there was something that always lingered and bothered me. I said, Adam [HistoryMaker Adam Wade], I mean, you know, here you are, you know, (singing) "I used to walk with you, along the avenue. Our hearts were carefree and gay." And, then you'd come out sounding like Johnny Mathis. How did that happen man (laughter)? I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, so you were consciously trying to sound like Nat King Cole?
Speaker 2: Like Nat, yeah. And, trying to maybe move a little away from him so it wouldn't be like, 'cause he, well, "I see what he's doing, he's copying Nat King Cole." And, that was so strange (laughter). But, they liked it. I guess, they was trying to capitalize off of Johnny Mathis popularity, I don't know. But--
Speaker 1: And, he was, he was extremely popular, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know. But, you know, and for a while there, I resented the fact that people say, "Oh, he sounds like Johnny Mathis." But, then when I looked at where things were and how I was living. Okay. If I was a second Johnny Mathis, the living was good, you know (laughter), so, okay. If that's where you are. That's fine with me, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so. So, how did Richard Baugh take this; that you were going back?
Speaker 2: We stayed friends but, I don't think he ever go over the hurt. Personally, I--he never mentioned it. And, I would always talk about him. I'd always write or call him, write him, go back to see him. But, to this day, I think it still, still hurt him. But, there was really nothing I could do about it because I wasn't in the power seat at that point.
Speaker 1: So, so, was Dr. Salk [Jonas Salk] that told you to just go ahead and go?
Speaker 2: When, when the three weeks were up, I went back to Pitts- we went back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] together. About a week later, they called and said they wanted me to come back to New York [New York], and they wanted me to make a record, then they wanted me to record. And, I said, "Well, man, look, I don't have the money to pay for making a rec--." They said, "No, don't worry about that. We'll take care of that," you know. So, they sent me an airplane ticket and it was the first time I ever was on an airplane, you know. And, they talked with my [paternal] grandfather [Henry Wade, Sr.], and then I went and I asked Dr. Salk if I could meet with him, and we did. And, I explained to him the situation and he told me that I should, "By all means, pursue this. Because this opportunity may never come again and if you don't pursue it, you'll always wonder what would've happened." He said, "So, you go for it. And, if you, if it doesn't work out, you will always have a job here." So, that's the way it--
Speaker 1: So, what company was this?
Speaker 2: It was called Coed Records [Coed Records, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, Coed Records was a branch of Paxton Music. And, the president was George Paxton, and the vice president was Marvin Cane.
Story_ID: 420497
Speaker 1: What happened? What did you--did they have some songs that they, for you already that they wanted you to--?
Speaker 2: They didn't know exactly what they had, they were looking for songs and they had the, their people and their arrangers looking for songs. And, once I got there, I was looking for songs. And, they found a song in a drawer that had, excuse me, never been recorded as a vocal. It was called 'Tell Her For Me.' And, that's the song that they, one of the songs they recorded. On the other one, is, was, 'Forgive Me, I Adore You' [ph.]. And, then they did, 'Too Far,' and one other song I can't remember. And, out of the session they chose, 'Tell Her For Me,' was, so, when the song came out, it didn't do anything. It just came out and it lied there and died there. A month later, the disc jockeys in Chicago [Illinois], three of them called the record company [Coed Records, Inc.] and asked the record company to send me to Chicago because they all were on the record, 'Tell Her For Me.' So, they wanted me to go to the different record hops and those kinds of things. So, the record company sent me here to Chicago. And, with me was Jerry Moss, who was the a, was the, oh, what do they call this guy; it's his title, can't remember. But, Jerry Moss who later became the president of A&M Records was the record guy they would send out with the acts, you know. So, he came here with me and we did a lot of record hops. And, then all of a sudden a guy in Colorado he used, 'Tell Her For Me' for the opening and closing of his show, and that's the way it went around the country and that--then it made some noise. So, then I got a chance to make another record.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what, what was the next one you made?
Speaker 2: The next record was 'Ruby Gentry' [sic.]. The song was called 'Ruby.' It was written by Michael Parish [sic. Mitchell Parish] and Hoagy Carmichael [sic. Heinz Roemheld].
Speaker 1: Hoagy Carmichael is very--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I was in a nightclub called The Living Room, in New York City [New York, New York] on the east side, 49th Street and 2nd Avenue. And, it was what they call a cheaters room. Where the lights were low and men came in with women who were not their wives. And, wives came in with men who were not their husbands (laughter). This night, someone requested the song 'Ruby.' And, in the club was a disc jockey named Pete Myers whose, whose nickname or moniker was, the curly headed kid in the third row. They requested 'Ruby,' and I sang it. And, the disc jockey went to the phone and called my manager, Marvin Cane, and said, "You ought to have Adam [HistoryMaker Adam Wade] record this song because no one has recorded it was a vocal." And, it was already a million seller when it was the theme song from the motion picture, 'Ruby Gentry.' So, Marvin called me, had me call the, the arranger. I sang it for him over the phone. He wrote and arranged it that night 'cause we were doing the session the next day. Came to the session, we did all the other material, we had ten minutes left, he said, "Bring out the 'Ruby' chart." Brought it over, he said, "Adam, I'm going to run it down one time and you do it. You got one time at it. That's it." So, he ran the song down and I went into to the booth, ran it down again, I did it. And, then that's the song that they chose out of the session. And, the song got--was a hit for me.
Speaker 1: Now, there were lyrics for it already, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, nobody had never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, nobody had ever sang it as a--
Speaker 1: Recorded the lyrics?
Speaker 2: As a vocal, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then of course, what, seven, eight, years later, Ray Charles recorded it again. And, it was a hit for him.
Speaker 1: Now, how does that go? You did it for me when I first came in.
Speaker 2: (Singing) "They say Ruby you're like a dream. Not always what you seem. And though my heart may break, when I awake, let it be so, I only know, Ruby, it's you."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that became the--my signature song. And paid the rent for many, many, many months (laughter).
Story_ID: 420498
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So now, how was your, how was it being away from your family so, so much?
Speaker 2: It was all I knew, you know. So, it, it--I took them on the road with me when I could, you know. But, I was learning and working. So, that's basically how I felt about it, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the kids were fine, they were cool.
Speaker 1: Okay, now by this time how many did you have?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, actually, yeah, 'Ruby,' yeah, when we got 'Ruby,' I had three children, sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, well, so, during the early '60s [1960s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, you were basically a singer then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. That's correct.
Speaker 1: And, when did you--
Speaker 2: Who wanted to be basketball player (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right. Well, a decent basket- a decent athlete--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You become a singer. And, when did you get a chance to act professionally for the first time?
Speaker 2: At that time, I wasn't acting at all. It was just only singing, you know. It wasn't 'til in the late '60s [1960s], and the early '70s [1970s] when disco was coming in, a lot of the rooms that I worked as a standup singer did not want standup singers anymore. They wanted a disco group who had their own sound package, light package, their own musicians all in one. So, a lot of the song, a lot of the clubs that hired standup singers were closing up. So, I ran into a guy and he told me that, "Adam [HistoryMaker Adam Wade], you got a pretty nice voice, you speak well, you should go and investigate commercials," which I did. And, I also signed up for acting classes. And, I finally wound up studying with the Al Fann Theatrical Ensemble which was in Harlem [New York, New York] at St. Philips Church [St. Philip's Episcopal Church, New York, New York] on 133rd Street [sic. 134th Street], in the basement, the B level, for five years.
Speaker 1: So, you were basically living in New York [New York] then?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And--
Speaker 2: I was living in Harlem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 145th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, but, be--prior to that, that time, you had like some, 'Ruby' was your biggest hit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that your biggest hit? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was living in Brooklyn [New York] then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I later moved to Manhattan [New York].
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 420499
Speaker 1: And so, I worked all around the country and all over the world, you know. And, learning, and then I started studying acting, and then I got into commercials. With the commercials, at first, it was kind of redundantly bad, if that's an expression I can use. Because everywhere I went they would say, "Aren't you [HistoryMaker] Adam Wade the singer?" I would say, "Yes." They say, "Well, we're not looking for singers today." They would throw that in my face, you know (laughter). And, I thought, "Let me drag this guy down to the basement in the dark and see if I can dust him up or something (laughter)." But, finally, 'cause I was gonna qui- I was gonna, I was gonna quite, "That's it, I'm going to give this up." But, Vernee Watson [Vernee Watson-Johnson] who played the mother of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Will Smith, she was also studying with the Al Fann Theatrical Ensemble and she encouraged me to go. She said, "Just try one more week, and if nothing happens," and she said, "But, you should--don't give up today." And, I didn't. And, two days later I got my first commercial for Getty gasoline [Getty Oil].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was terrific, and the commercial was in the car in Central Park [New York, New York], late at night, kissing this girl in the backseat of the car. I said, "Man, this is wonderful, (laughter)."
Speaker 2: You got paid for it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You guy, you guys gonna pay me for this, you know. And, it was Laura Greene who is beautiful anyway (laughter). It was like, "Oh, my, my, my (laughter)."
Speaker 2: So, what year is this, is this--?
Speaker 1: That was in nineteen- I guess, '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970]. So, you get paid to kiss Laura Greene in the back of a car.
Speaker 1: In the backseat of a convertible for Getty gasoline, my, my, my (laughter), life is grand. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, this--did the rest, did more work follow?
Speaker 1: Yes. Actually, it's like anything else, once the door opens, you know, you step across the threshold and you're in the game, you know.
Story_ID: 420500
Speaker 1: Then I started to--and then that's when I re-met Adolph Caesar who became my mentor. Adolph--
Speaker 2: Adolph Caesar.
Speaker 1: Was doing promos for films. And, he was just knocking 'em out, you know. And, he was doing voiceovers. He was the king.
Speaker 2: Adolph Caesar had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was the king.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had an unmistakable voice.
Speaker 1: Voice. Yes.
Speaker 2: (Imitates Adolph Caesar) Adolph Caesar--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Like that (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, he took me under his wing and I would go around with him and I would sit and watch him work. And, then we would go back to his apartment and he would say, "Okay," he would take the copy and we would sit there and he say, "Okay, on this particular copy, I made this decision because following this is a laundry list. So, in order to keep with the time I had to deliver it, I had to get the laundry list in quick," and things like that. He was saying it's like, "In this one I needed to go fifty-eight seconds, I needed to go fifty-six seconds but I went fifty-eight. So, I know I had to pick up two seconds. So, I had to find a place to pick it up. And, so, what I did was, I went through the punctuation and I used the punctuation to pick up the two seconds. 'Cause on this one it was a short sentence--it was a long sentence followed by a short sentence. So, instead of taking a breath, I'll do both of them together. So, that would pick up some time." So, it was those kinds of things that he taught me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those are the real tricks of the trade. Now--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: How did Caesar, now he's no longer with us, but how did he get started? Was he a radio--
Speaker 1: No, he wasn't.
Speaker 2: Person? Okay.
Speaker 1: He--when I met him, when I first came back from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to New York [New York], I stayed--they put me up at the Embassy Hotel [New York, New York]. And, he was staying there, and that's when we met. And, we remained friends through the years until this time in 1970 where we really got back together again, you know. And--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, he was a--when I came across him, he was doing voiceovers.
Speaker 2: Right. He's--a lot of people will remember him from 'A Soldier's Story.'
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He played the sergeant [Vernon Waters]. And, he also narrated 'I Remember Harlem,' the film by William Miles--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Qu- quite a few other things, but he's quite a, a--
Story_ID: 420501
Speaker 1: You decided at some point to take acting very seriously and really study.
Speaker 2: Yes. And, the Al Fann Theatrical Ensemble was a place where, that fostered those feelings in me because they were so positive about everything. In that class was, as I said, Vernee Watson [Vernee Watson-Johnson], Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs was doing 'Welcome Back, Kotter,' Tim Pelt and Will Pelt [William Pelt], Dee [Danielle Spencer] from 'What's Happening!!,' the little girl; she was in that class. [HistoryMaker] Kim Fields was in that class along with her mother, Chip Fields. So, I mean, there were a lot of heavyweight people came out of that Al Fann Theatrical Ensemble. And, in fact, that's where my favorite saying came, came from, from the Al Fan Theatrical Ensemble--
Speaker 1: Okay. About the--
Speaker 2: Making money is a habit and there's nothing I can do about it.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did you, what was your first play, I guess, that you got involved in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In, in the Al Fann Theatrical Ensemble, we did a play called 'King Heroin' [Al Fann]. And, we would go around to the different schools and do the play. And, we went down to Washington [D.C.] and did the play for some congressmen and senators.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the essences of 'King Heroin'?
Speaker 2: That, there was a young girl and she fell in with the wrong crowd. And, before she knew it, she was hooked on heroin. And, the people in the community were up in arms. And, so they decided that they would invest themselves in helping to get her out of that lifestyle. Which they did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, this is 1970. This is like in New York City [New York, New York] and there's a lot of, a lot of poetry, a lot of music, a lot of dance groups were--National Endowment for the Arts and they were starting to fund black groups for the first time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, there was lot of activity in the, in the--
Speaker 2: In going on? Yes. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, we were right in the middle of it 'cause we were at 133rd Street and 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Boulevard], you know, and on B level (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So, you're right down the street from the Schomburg Center [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, yeah. Now, did you do, you did some work with the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC] too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And, I learned a lot and I worked for a lot of good actors, and--
Speaker 1: Okay. What, what play did you did the, the NEC?
Speaker 2: We did, let's see, for Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward], I did the 'We' series, Charles Fuller, he wrote this 'We' series. It's five [sic. four] different plays, but they're all connected.
Speaker 1: Okay. What, what were some of those plays? Do you remember? Was this Charles Fuller the, the same one that wrote the, 'Soldier Story' [sic. 'A Soldier's Play,' Charles Fuller]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes. Okay. Once--one was 'Prince' [Charles Fuller], one was 'Jonquil' [Charles Fuller], can't think of the others ['Sally' and 'Burner's Frolic,' Charles Fuller].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then we did 'Lifestyles on the Street' [ph.]. We did 'The War Party' [Leslie Lee]. And, Douglas Turner Ward directed all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But, there I met Ed Wheeler, Charlie Weldon [HistoryMaker Charles Weldon], O.L. Duke.
Story_ID: 420502
Speaker 1: Around this, this period of time, this is like early '70s [1970s], right? You got involved with movies too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were, now what was your first movie role?
Speaker 2: I think the first film I did was, not 'Kiss Me Goodbye,' oh, it was 'Phantom of the Fillmore' [sic. 'Phantom of the Paradise']. That's right, that right, 'cause I remember I was an extra on this film, 'Phantom of the Fillmore.' And, we shot all night out on 56th Street in front of Town Hall [sic.].
Speaker 1: 'Phantom of the Fillmore.'
Speaker 2: 'Phantom of the Fillmore.' And, the movie never came out under that name. It came out under some other name. I can't remember what, what it was. Let me see--
Speaker 1: So, you were, you were an extra in that? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And, I was also an extra in the Shirley MacLaine movie where we were ice skating. And, they asked who could ice skate and I raised my hand. I couldn't ice skate at all. I was awful. And, I skated, and I went home, and I--my ankles hurt so bad. But, the next day, I wrapped my ankles before I went and that--we got, it got better. But, I'd never forget that, that expression that they would say, "Okay, skaters on the ice." (Laughter) I dreaded that. I dreaded it.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, a lot of the movies you were in, in the '70s [1970s], people would call now the blaxploitation movies and such, you know. But, did you have to, did you make those in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] or in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Most of the films I did, I did in, in New York.
Speaker 1: Yeah. 'Cause, you know, I guess, the most famous would be 'Shaft,' I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Shaft,' and then I did 'Gordon's War' for [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis. And, I was so, so proud because we did, he said, "Okay, do the scene for me." So, we did the scene for him and he came to me and he said, "I don't like it. Fix it. I'll be back in twenty minutes (laughter)." So, I got a pen and paper and sat down and re-wrote it. And, he came back and we did it. He said, "I like it. Let's shoot it." Okay. And--
Speaker 1: Gordon, 'Gordon's War' starred [HistoryMaker] Bernie Casey, I believe.
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that it? That was not, not--
Speaker 2: That was Paul, it was Paul--
Speaker 1: Paul Winfield. Okay.
Speaker 2: Winfield. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Paul Winfield. Okay.
Speaker 2: David Downing, yeah. I, and I was so proud of that, that moment when he came back and said, "I like it. Let's shoot it."
Speaker 1: Do you remember what the scene was about?
Speaker 2: It's about David Downing and they were, they were trying to find out these guys who were dealing stolen merchandise. And, this guy happened to be a con man who was selling the stolen merchandise or trying to sell it one-on-one. And, he was selling it, trying to sell it to these two guys, you know. So, it was just terrific.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I, I got killed in the scene and of course, that was not so good 'cause we had to lay out there in the water (laughter), while they change the camera angles and the lights and--but, it was--nothing could've brought me down after that (laughter). So, that was wonderful and I, I always remi- whenever I saw him, I always reminded him of that. And, we had a good laugh on that one.
Story_ID: 420503
Speaker 1: You're in quite a few of the popular mo- movies in those days, 'Shaft' being one. We already mentioned that. 'Claudine,' was a big hit, I remember.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, with [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones, and Diahann, [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll.
Speaker 1: 'Education of Sonny Carson' ['The Education of Sonny Carson'] is like a classic now that people--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Watch that quite a bit. What role did you play in--
Speaker 2: I was one of his relatives. And, I had to be--when he got out of jail, and they had the big party.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Rony Clanton played Sonny Carson, and he did a terrific job. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And, that's a classic. 'Come Back, Charleston Blue'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was also based on the Chester Himes' novel ['The Heat's On'].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think that launched the careers of Godfrey Cambridge and Raymond St. Jacques.
Speaker 2: Raymond St. Jacques, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was, I was hired on that film as a stunt double, a photo double, (laughter). I mean, that was, that was a good film for me because I made a lot of money on that film (laughter). And--
Speaker 1: Who were the stunt double for (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The stunt driver for, for Raymond St. Jacques (laughter) and they also hired me on the staff. Okay, so, Raymond St. Jacques and Godfrey; they didn't, neither one of them wanted to be the first one on the set. They wanted to be the last one on the set, make people wait for them, you know. So, they were having a terrible time getting these guys to come out of their trailers (laughter), to get on the set, you know. So, I would go in to talk to them to try to find ways to get them out, you know. So, what I did was, I went into Godfrey's trailer and I went into Raymond's trailer and I said, "I understand that the first one of you guys to get to the set today, will get off tomorrow because they gonna scratch the shot that they're gonna--and shoot another shot. So, if you could hurry up and get to the set and be first on the set, you can get off tomorrow," (laughter) which wasn't true (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did they fall for it?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did (laughter). But, that, that was a funny film. I, I had a lot of good times doing the stunt driving, driving the hearse and those kinds of things. That was nice.
Speaker 1: Now, who directed that? Was that directed by--
Speaker 2: By Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. [sic. Mark Warren]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay. Now, that was, one of them was directed by [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis wasn't it? I just don't remember now.
Speaker 2: No. There was 'Cotton Comes to Harlem' first and then 'Come Back, Charleston Blue.'
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 420504
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite role from those days doing the movies?
Speaker 2: Proba- not from, from movies, probably from television I do. And, that was Frank Scott [sic. Frank Mason] from when I did 'Good Times.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This character was a self-made millionaire, he traveled the world building buildings, bridges. He was going to marry Willona [Willona Woods], and adopt Penny [Millicent "Penny" Woods] and take her to see the world.
Speaker 1: And, of course, it didn't happen, right?
Speaker 2: Of course. Reason being, they felt that, the writers felt that Penny would get a better education living in the ghetto (laughter) as opposed to going to see the world. And, secondly, they approached Ja'net DuBois who--and myself about doing spinoff from this. But, then they decided they already had one black millionaire in George Jefferson, they didn't need another one. But, that character was, was terrific. It was, it was good to play the character and also to play with Ja'net. And, Janet Jackson, she was about this, this tall at that, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right, she, yeah, she, she was a little girl (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. She was Penny, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right. Okay. Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, that, that was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed that. And, just enjoyed being around the family, Michael Carter [sic. Ralph Carter] of 'Good Times,' because everybody was so nice, so friendly, and it was good atmosphere, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to work in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would've been--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Stan Lathan [sic.], he was directing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. The setting from that is right around the corner from where we are now. Believe it or not--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah.
Speaker 1: We're not far away, you know. They've been torn down pretty much, the Cabrini-Green projects [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois]. Now, any other--now, that's your absolute favorite role, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. I had a lot of fun doing that. And, theatre wise most of the roles I played, I enjoyed, you know. I did some work for the Harlem, the Classical Theatre of Harlem. I did 'Hamlet' [William Shakespeare], where I play Hamlet father's ghost. That was really fun. Yeah, that was probably later, that was probably one of the most fun times I had with a role. 'Cause as a ghost, it was, it had to live and come out of my own imagination, you know. And, there were no perimeters that I had to follow. So, it was fun. I would, I would get there early and get my costume on and I would find a wall. And, I would just stand up against the wall as they open the play and everything, until it was my time to enter and my entrance would come right out of the wall (unclear), and I had, I had a lot of fun doing that, you know. And, the reviewer said that I was scary even when I didn't have anything else to say (laughter). So, I said, "Okay, good, I like that."
Speaker 1: You did the job, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that would help.
Story_ID: 420505
Speaker 1: Tell us about 'Musical Chairs.' Now, what--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick's husband, ex-husband, Bill Elliott [William Elliott] was a drummer, and he, excuse me, he--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --doing some announcement for, announcing for  Don Kirshner. But, on this particular occasion he was ill and he couldn't do it. So, he recommended me to do it. I did it. I met Don Kirshner. He said, "I like your work." I have--
Speaker 1: Don Kirshner just for those--he was the producer of the one of the concert shows on 'Saturday Night Live.'
Speaker 2: Yes. Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Don Kirshner's Rock Concert,' right?
Speaker 2: 'Rock Concert,' yes. That was Express or something or Midnight something?
Speaker 1: They may have had another name but eventually they called it 'Don Kirshner's Rock Concert.'
Speaker 2: 'Rock Concert,' okay. He said, "I like your work. I have something in mind for you. I'll get in touch with you." He met with Bill Chastain [Bill W. Chastain, Jr.] and Jeremy Schnur [sic. Jerome Schnur]. And, they met with Bud Grant who was the head of CBS. And, told him that they were gonna do this game show. But, they wanted to see a black man to host it. And, Bud Grant said, "If he does--he can do the job, it's fine with me." So, that's how we all got started with 'Musical Chairs.' And, I met them several times and met with Don Kirshner. I met with Bill Chastain, and Jeremy Schnur. I met with Bud Grant and everything was fine. And, this was all before I auditioned. Then when I auditioned, I just said, I just--in the audition I want one thing. And, they said, "Well, what is it that you want?" "I wanna go first." I said, "That's all I want." So, I went out and I bought a brand new suit, shirt, tie, shoes, socks, underwear, like I already had the job. And, I hired a piano player and there were four books that you needed to complete the audition, to complete the show. I took all four books and made them into one book. So, that when, when I started, all I had to do is flip the pages and go all the way through to the end. Everybody else had to consult this book and then they had to consult that book, and that book, which made their performance uneven. So, that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Now, when you do a show like that, do you have like a teleprompter or something for your--all the lines that are coming up? You usually, or how do you do it?
Speaker 2: No, you know, when you do the show, yes. You have some things that are up, some cards that come up for you, and you have some things on your podium that follow along with where you are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, mostly what you have to do is, you have to play the game two steps ahead of the contestants. So, you have to know if this contestant gets the right answer, and these contestants get the wrong answer, what happens. Because they're different levels--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and stages of the game. And, then you switch that over, if these three get the right answer and this person doesn't, then what happens. So, you have to know all eventualities, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, here comes the math again that I was not good at (laughter). And, then so, you have to play along with the game. Plus you have to participate. You have to sing and be a part of the game. Plus you have to be able to read the scores out and know where there're going. And, keep the excitement in the game, "Oh, you almost got this right, so and so and so and so. But, this is not a right answer so," and, and what happens when a person is eliminated. So, it's all these things that you have to keep track of. And, I thought it was a fun game, you know, fun game to do.
Speaker 1: Now, was there any suspense about whether you were gonna be selected as the host or not?
Speaker 2: Not in my mind. 'Cause when I went to the audition, there were guys there in t-shirts, overalls, jeans, sneakers, and plus they had all these books (laughter), they had to bring in there to deal with. No, they didn't have a chance.
Speaker 1: And, the books have the rules of the game--
Speaker 2: Yes, you're right. And, so, I spent the time memorizing the rules of the game, what happens, so that I had a good knowledge of starting at the beginning. And, what I approached it as, as like an acting assignment. So, I did my research and I was able to go through the audition smoothly. And, so, I knew that they didn't have a chance.

Speaker 1: Now, 'Musical Chairs' came on the air--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975] or '6 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a bicentennial year, so that would make it what--
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976]. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-six [1976], yes [sic. 1975].
Speaker 1: Okay. It's a bicentennial year. So, you were pretty busy in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Movies--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Musical Chairs'--
Speaker 2: Knock, knock, knock. I was very fortunate.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The one guy Melvin [Melvin Franklin], from The Temps [The Temptations], he said, when I was living in Los Angeles [California], he said, "Somebody up there likes you, Adam [HistoryMaker Adam Wade] (laughter)." I said, "Melvin, I think you're right, man (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Okay. But, a lot of this is having, I guess, one reason that you were chosen was because of your personality. What you project, I guess, as a personality.
Speaker 2: Yes. And, and, and thoroughness, you know, I must say that when I, when I took on these different types of jobs, I was thorough. I did my homework. I was confident. And, a lot of it came from the training that I got from different places and, like the Al Fann Theatrical Ensemble, and Adolph [Adolph Caesar], and you know, just to approach it as a simple job and just do the work. And, once you do the work, you're ready to go.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, is your background typically of the, typical game host? I mean, the guys that we see that are game host--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: We--
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not at all. The singing part of it was easy because I was a singer, you know, the acting part, you know. The rest of it was like putting all these things together, these ideas together, and memorizing the rules of the game so I would know what would happen, you know. And, know where to look, which camera's on, which camera's off, all those things, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, did you have any role models for being a game show host? Like--
Speaker 2: Not really. I went to talk with Tony Brown. And, Tony was doing the 'Tony Brown's Journal,' you know. And, we sat and talked for a while. And I, and I, I have to thank him because he took the time to sit down with me. And, we talked about how to approach this. What, you know, would, would happen, how there would be some who would try to advance the proposition that if this thing fail, I would be letting down the, the black race for years to come (laughter). So (laughter), I mean, it, it sounds crazy. But, I mean, I guess, there are people that, that feel and think that way, you know. But, we went, we went through everything and we, we talked. And, I, I do, I do to this day thank him for taking the time to sit and talk with me because I didn't have anybody else to go and talk to.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And speaking with him, reassured me somewhat, you know.
Story_ID: 420507
Speaker 1: What was the premise of the show ['Musical Chairs']? Now, the show was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The premise--
Speaker 1: --that the guest--
Speaker 2: --was the old game musical chairs, where you go around and around and the music stops. And, then there's on--there's five people and only four chairs. So, somebody's gonna be left out. And, the person that's left out on our show, their chair was on a track and it went backward and the thing closed and left them on the (unclear). And, I had always wanted them to add some sound effects when the door close, (growling) (laughter). But, they said, "No, no, no, that's too graphic (laughter)." But, I always thought that would've been fun, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you come from the old--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Globetrotter [Harlem Globetrotters] tradition or the Negro League tradition where you wanna see, wanna see more.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You know, push that envelope, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did they have to answer questions or something to--
Speaker 2: Yes. They would, they would say like, (singing) "Every honey bee, filled with jealousy, when they take you--." "Is the next line A, by my side, or B, out with me, or C, something else?" And they'd have to choose the correct answer.
Speaker 1: Well, here you are, you had already had this amazing repertoire of songs that you already knew from--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: The fake books or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That all--and all of--
Speaker 1: So, you knew their songs?
Speaker 2: All of that helped. Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. All this helps out.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, how long was this show on the air?
Speaker 2: One season. And, I think that it projected my career through the years because being on television five days a week for a year, that's instant recognition. And, that's something that money can't buy, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, the show was broadcasted in the morning, I take it, or?
Speaker 2: At different places. I think in New York [New York] it was on at one o'clock. In Miami [Florida] it's on one o'clock sometimes. Some parts of the country it came on at four o'clock. Unfortunately, in Atlanta [Georgia] they had a black mayor [Maynard Jackson], but the, the owned and operated CBS station, they wouldn't show it.
Speaker 1: That's, that's incredible.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But, hey, you know, what are you gonna do, you do your (unclear). And, you know, it's, it's like I got some hate mail, you know, some people would say that, "I don't want my wife watching this guy while I'm at work." So, those kind of stupid things, you know. But--
Speaker 1: Well, this is era when [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron was breaking a homerun (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --record around the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --same time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think he got lots of hate mail. I mean, it was still, the country was still going through some changes.
Speaker 2: Changes at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Not that it's finished now, but it's, it's not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's not that bad.
Speaker 2: But, through it all I tried to do a couple things and that is, what can I do to keep my dignity. If I uphold myself than I can uphold the race, you know. A lot of, a lot of these things, I can't change people's minds about, but I'll just do the best job I can do.
Story_ID: 420508
Speaker 1: Did you ever, did, were you ever involved in something where, where you were criticized by black leadership or just, or anybody for not being dignified, well, how could you do that, or?
Speaker 2: Not really. The only, the only thing we that I was a little hurt by or disappointed by was I did, Cleavon Little and I did a pilot. It was a pilot on 'Uptown Saturday Night.' And, they never released it because it was gonna be the pilot for a weekly TV show. And, they never released it because they said that it was Uncle Tom-ish.
Speaker 1: Now, who said this?
Speaker 2: That's the word that we got from the company that we filmed it for, you know. It was First Artists [First Artists Production Company Ltd.] that, that made the, that made the pilot. I thought it was, I thought it was funny and I thought it was fun. But, apparently some didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: This isn't from the black community? This is from the--First Artists, was First Artists a black company, or?
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, this is from white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --producer--
Speaker 2: Right, you know.
Speaker 1: --that said it was Uncle Tom-ish.
Speaker 2: Tom-ish, yeah, you know, so. Well, we, a little disappointed in that, you know, because even the guy, he wrote me a note saying that he thought that I did a wonderful job because I, I took the character and made him courageous. I made him fun. I, you know, so, you know, what are you gonna do.
Speaker 1: So, what character did you play in--
Speaker 2: I was the, the second lead [Monroe Hoover] in the, in the pilot and I was, what was Cleavon's character's name [Wardell Washington], I was his best friend and his best buddy. And, he'd get into all of these difficult situations and he'd drag me in with him (laughter), you know, into these situations. And, we found our self in a pool with the head gangster (laughter), things like that. And, it was--
Speaker 1: Similar to the movie ['Uptown Saturday Night'], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: Where I guess Sidney Poitier would be the friend, the analogist to the person that you played.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who's drugged into these schemes that Bill Cosby puts together.
Speaker 2: Put together, yeah. So, that was, it was, it was fun I thought, you know. And, Starletta, Starletta DuPois played my wife [sic.], you know. And, Starletta is wonderful, so, as always. So, that was fun too.
Story_ID: 420509
Speaker 1: So, well, let's, take us through, I guess, the '80s [1980s], you know. What happened as you approached the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: It was basically the same pattern of things that, work that I did; commercials, voiceovers, industrials, stage productions. So, basically, I was on an even keel. I was just rolling, rolling right along, you know, at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Getting older, and I decided I wasn't gonna dye my hair anymore, you know, 'cause an audition coming up, oh you have to go drugstore, get some dye, and dye your head, dye all that gray out of your hair. And, so, I, I went to the agent and said, "I'm not going there anymore," you know. "It is what it is, I am who I am. If they want me, they're hire me. If they don't, they won't, you know. But, I'm gonna dye my hair anymore."
Speaker 1: That's a, yeah, that's, well, just in everyday life people feel compelled to dye their hair all the time, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, you know.
Speaker 1: But, but for you in show business, that's, that's quite a decision you don't see a lot of actor make, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, it just some courage to do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll, that's what she told me. She said, "You got a lot of courage (laughter), not to dye your hair anymore," you know. But, it just, I don't know, something in me just said, "Hey, man, it's time to just be you now," you know, "So be you," and you know, "don't worry about it. You know what to do. You've been in this game all this time, you know you're not gonna starve," you know, so.
Speaker 1: Do, do you have any favorite stories from all your show business years?
Speaker 2: One of them was my wife Jeree [Jeree P. Wade], is a, is a singer. And, she was the opening act for Bill Cosby for quite some. He used to take her out, and take her around, you know.  And, so, I went on an audition and I, I didn't really know Bill, I met him a couple times, you know, but I don't really know him. And, I went on an audition that he recommended me for. It was called something about this House, 'This Old House' [sic. 'American Playhouse'], and eventually [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones got the role. They auditioned me for it. And, I went to the audition. Now, I had just gone on an audition for something else a day earlier where, they said, "Next," okay, "[HistoryMaker] Adam Wade, next." Okay, go in. And, today the, this audition for Bill--for 'This Old House' that Bill Cosby had recommended before was, "Oh, Mr. Wade. Oh, it's so nice to see you. Would you come in? We have coffee here. Would you like regular, decaf?" (Laughter) It was that kind of treatment all through the audition, and to me that was like hysterical (laughter). Because there is a whole different way to approach you, to address you, if you're recommended by, you know, a big star.
Speaker 1: So, otherwise, it's just, "Next (laughter)."
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter). And, I haven't seen him to thank him for that, you know, but I appreciate it, you know. Because, basically, it put me in a very good position, you know, to audition for something that, that they were looking at James Earl Jones for, and it was--and then recently, you know, I, well, yeah, so, that was one of the stories. The other story was the thing about the 'Musical Chairs,' where I wanted to go first. I was proud of that--
Story_ID: 420510
Speaker 1: Then of course the thing that I'm most proud of is that after forty years, I went back to school and I got my degrees. And, I didn't stop with one. I, I got my master's degree.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us about how that happened. Now, you had three years of college, and?
Speaker 1: And, so, I went to do a play called 'Looking Back' [Shauneille Perry], which was a celebration of [HistoryMaker] Micki Grant's music. Micki Grant wrote 'Your Arms Too Short to Box with God' [Vinnette Carroll] and 'Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope.' So, Professor Rider [ph.] put together this show called 'Looking Back,' which celebrated all Micki Grant's music. We did it on the campus of Lehman College [Bronx, New York]. So, while I was there I was talking with her and she suggested, "While you're here, why don't you speak to the continued education department to see if you can get your degree." And, I did. And, he showed me, his, the head of the department, his wife was a musician. She had just gone through the process and got her degree because she had to stop twelve years ago 'cause they had children, and so and so and so. So, he knew what to do to get me started. So, he laid out this whole program for me. And, I follow- I went through the program and before you know it, I graduated. And, then I wanted to get--
Speaker 2: How long did it take?
Speaker 1: Took me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To finish that degree?
Speaker 1: --a year and a half.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because all of the credits that I had taken at Virginia State College [Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] were accepted. Because I had credits in biology, zoology, anatomy, I had those kinds of credits, and, you know, like the credit they don't accept like woodshop and (laughter). So, I was able to go through it just like that. I got my degree and then I decided that since I did it, I would continue on the get my master's degree. So, then I went to Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] because Lehman didn't offer a master's degree in what I wanted. So, I went to Brooklyn College and got my master's degree in theatre history and criticism.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, I, I was very proud of that, you know--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: My wife [Jeree P. Wade] and I sat down with a pencil and a piece of paper and we pretended it was ten years later. And, here we were ten years later, we put down on the paper what we, where we wanted to live, what we wanted to drive, how much money we wanted, how much money we needed, and those are the kind of things that we started out with. So, we decided after we looked at what we had gone through that in ten years we would be in a much better position to have control of our lives if we both went back to college and got our master's degrees. And, that's what started it and that's how we, that's how we did it.
Speaker 2: So, how old were you when you went back?
Speaker 1: I was older than all my professors (laughter). I was in my sixties.
Speaker 2: That's something. Did it take a lot of courage to go back?
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was always kind of like right there because I, I had promised--I was the first one in my family to go to college. And, I didn't finish. How could I leave that undone, you know. So--
Speaker 2: Did you march?
Speaker 1: Yes. And, in--Spike Lee gave the graduation address. So, that was cool.
Speaker 2: So, Lehman College is L-E-H-M-A-N, right?
Speaker 1: Yes. L-E-H-M-A--
Speaker 2: In New York? It's in--is it in Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 1: Lehman College is in the Bronx [New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the Bronx. Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: So, I'll be forever grateful to Professor Rider because she really led me to the right path in order to get that done.
Story_ID: 420511
Speaker 1: I take it you do as you've always done, you do a variety of different things, and now you're, you're in Chicago [Illinois] now doing 'The Color Purple.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Stage play in one of the big theater's downtown here.
Speaker 2: At the Cadillac Palace Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Cadillac, okay.
Speaker 2: And, I play Old Mister.
Speaker 1: Okay. The mentor to Mister (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter). And, it's ironic because the actor that played Old Mister in movie ['The Color Purple'], Adolph Caesar, was my mentor for many, many years.
Speaker 1: This is true. That is right.
Speaker 2: And, that's what I think of when I'm getting dressed and getting ready to go do the play; I think of Adolph, you know, and the many times we sent together and all of the help that he gave me over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, do you sing in the production?
Speaker 2: Yes. I sing in the opening song ["Mysterious Ways"]. I sing in the closing song ["The Color Purple (Reprise)"]. And, there is some wonderful talent in this production. I mean, there are, these young people are just terrific. And, it's been a pleasure to watch the, the process. Gary Griffin has worked us hard (laughter). And, we've been added for like seven weeks. And, now it's getting to the point where we're getting ready to open, and the production is just wonderful. And, Jeanette [Jeannette Bayardelle], we saw her do the lead role Celie in New York [New York], and then it went through the process of the seven weeks here. Now, it's like she's five, six, seven times better than she was even in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just terrific.
Story_ID: 420512
Speaker 1: You were saying off camera here that this production of 'The Color Purple' was sort of a celebration of Chicago [Illinois] because of all the talent, Chicago talent that's in it.
Speaker 2: Yes. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, who were some of the people?
Speaker 2: Felicia Fields who plays Sofia is from Chicago. Michelle Williams plays Shug [Shug Avery]; she's from Rockford [Illinois] and she's also from Destiny's Child. And, Gary Griffin, the director is from Rockford. So, it's a whole celebration here of Chicago people coming back to Chicago to participate in 'The Color Purple.' 'Cause Sofia, Felicia, she was Sofia in New York [New York] and was outstanding. And, Jeannette [Jeannette Bayardelle] was wonderful. We saw her in New York and then to go through the process of seven weeks of rehearsal with her ear, is just incredible. And, people are gonna be so surprised when they come and they see Jeannette do this role of Celie because she has given it so much more than it was before. It's just incredible; just incredible. And, the process has been stimulating and thrilling and even though it was hard at first because it was so cold and I wasn't used to the cold and then riding the Red Line transferring to the Blue Line (laughter), out to Racine [Racine Avenue station] and waiting there for it to come back again. But--
Speaker 1: So, you rehearsed in a--
Speaker 2: At a dance studio [Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Out in Racine [Avenue] and Jackson [Boulevard]. We did like four weeks, five weeks there. We did another week at the Lyric Opera house [Civic Opera House, Chicago, Illinois] and then we moved into the theater [Cadillac Palace Theatre, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, will you tell us now something about the inside of how these get produced but, I mean, are put together? Most people don't know that it takes that--well, how many weeks have you been working on this?
Speaker 2: We've been working this here in Chicago for, this is our eighth week now. And, we're still working. And, even though we're doing previews every night, we still rehearse during the day. And, probably after opening night, they may came in--come in to fix something, tweak something and, and it helps because when you want to get a laugh or a reactions or set something up, maybe it, it just requires an act of moving from one side of the stage to the other. Or, moving upstage as opposed to down stage. And, it's those little things that they can, they can tweak while we're, you know, in the early stages of the run. But, it takes a lot of work, a lot of eyes looking, and a lot of cooperation. And, this cast is just wonderful. It's one, one big family and everybody works well together and gets along. And, that's unusual 'cause sometimes you get different personalities together in one group, one personality will try to take over, you know. But, that's not the case here.
Story_ID: 420513
Speaker 1: I know pe- people are waiting all over the Midwest to come to Chicago [Illinois] to see it, so.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. There's, I mean, these, these, these people in here, LaToya London is a special case because, she's probably one of the first people I ever saw do a role where she didn't have to do anything. It's like the role just slipped her hand in the glove and, not like O.J. Simpson (laughter), "If it don't fit, you must acquit," she put her hand and the role just fits her just like a glove. It fits her perfectly; her voice, her mannerisms. It was just uncanny when I saw her do it from day one in the first rehearsal, just uncanny. And, it's, and there's so many talented people in here. The hardest role I think in 'Color Purple' ['The Color Purple'] is probably Mister, because he plays a character that people are not gonna like. And, to me that's, 'cause we all wanna be liked, you know. But, his character is not liked. And, so, it's, he's got, and he, in order to make the play work, he has to maintain that throughout the, throughout the play and I think that's what makes his role so difficult. But, you have a guy that plays Harpo, Stu, Stu James, he's, he's gonna be a superstar, this guy. He's a physical actor. He works out. He's in shape. He's got the body for it, you know, and he's, he's gonna be a superstar, this young guy. He's really terrific. And, it goes on, you got so many people in here. The church ladies, Bridgette Bentley. And, the dancers, the ensemble, Brian Brooks [Brian H. Brooks], and Renee Brown [Renee Monique Brown], Tiffany Daniels, Quentin Earl Darrington, Lesley Terrell [Lesley Terrell Donald], Aliyah [Aliyah D. Flowers], Andre [Andre Garner], Dameka [Dameka Hayes], LaTonya Holmes, Jenna Ford [Jenna Ford Jackson], Trent [Trent Armand Kendall], Grasan Kingsberry, Keith Kirk [Keith Byron Kirk], Rhett George, Corrine McFarlane, Sumayah McRae, Kristopher Thompson-Bolden, Anthony Wayne, Diamond White, who was a little girl about this high, and she is just (laughter) wonderful; Anthony Williams II, A.J. [ph.], who plays my grandson in the play. And, Mariama Whyte, and it just, the list goes on and on and on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now--so, this show, I mean, is projected to run for--
Speaker 2: Six months here.
Speaker 1: Yeah, six months?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then go on the road for six more months to a year.
Speaker 1: Okay. Staying about how long in each place, do you think?
Speaker 2: The different contracts for each place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In some places like, when it lose- leaves here after six months, it goes to San Francisco [California] for I think, seven weeks, eight weeks. Then it goes to Los Angeles [California] for like ten weeks. It opens Christmas--New--Christmas Eve in Los Angeles. Then, it goes to Tempe, Arizona, then comes back east to Cleveland [Ohio], St. Louis [Missouri], and possibility they could have a sit-down company that stays like 'Wicked' ['Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz,' Winnie Holzman] that stays here in Chicago. And, then have another company that travels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, they could put together another company that could travel internationally to London [England], France, South Africa.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have like a lot of discretion in terms of whether you stay here or travel or I mean, how do you, I guess, depends on how you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I signed a contract for a year. Probably my con- I probably I would stay for a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, is there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause the show is going to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]. You know I wanna go to Pittsburgh with it (laughter).
Story_ID: 420514
Speaker 1: Do you have a project that you really would like to do? I mean, like a dream project that you would like to work on? That you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: Yes. I would like to finish my books. I have three books that I'm working on. I'm not a writer so I don't have a deadline (laughter), that a real good thing. And, I work on them when I can. But, I wrote the book, the novella, 'A Ballad for Pauline' [ph.]. I also wrote a science fiction book called 'Elsim' [ph.]. And, I'm writing, I wanna write about the Roberts Show Lounge, here in Chicago [Illinois], 63rd [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Now, we discussed that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --before we, the interview, but Herman Roberts Show Lounge and I think here in Chicago was a place where black entertainers, the big time entertainers, could perform for the black community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because in the, not that long ago, I guess in the '60s [1960s], as late as the '60s [1960s], if Sammy Davis, Jr. came to Chicago, you couldn't go downtown to see him (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Go to see him, right.
Speaker 1: You had to see him at Roberts.
Speaker 2: At Roberts. Correct. That's the first place I ever met Dinah Washington; Roberts Show Lounge. So, I, that's, I'd like to be able to, to work, do my research on it. And, because even Mr. Roberts [HistoryMaker Herman Roberts] himself, the story could eventually turn to be about him 'cause he's had a, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah. It is quite a story, you know.
Speaker 2: An interesting life.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Putting all of that together.
Speaker 1: So, you may be interested and maybe he'll share with you his interview with HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers].
Speaker 2: Yes. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: 'Cause his life story is compelling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And, fascinating. He's really one tough customer, yeah, true entrepreneur (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, he is.
Speaker 1: I'll tell anybody. I mean, it's not a--another entrepreneur I've met that's got as much--
Speaker 2: I'll tell you--
Speaker 1: Vitality as he does.
Speaker 2: What's surprising though when I first came, got to Chicago, I asked everybody about Robert Show Lounge, and no one ever heard of it. I'm saying, "How could you forget something like that, that quickly," you know. I mean, that, Robert Show Lounge was big. I mean, it was, it was tremendous, man. I don't mean in size so much but big in terms of its importance to the black community, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. There, there have been quite a few, well, a lot of researching and a few theatrical works created around the Regal Theater in Chicago, too, was another big venue (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played the Regal Theater here in Chicago. In fact, this was the first theater I played when I went on the road with Redd Foxx, and Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett]. I came to the Regal Theater first, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Many years ago (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right. Well, that's, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, the Regal Theater you have now is not the Regal Theater that they had. This a new Regal Theater. And, it's been refurbished, or being refurbished?
Speaker 1: Well, there was a, it's now closed. But, it was an old movie house [New Regal Theater; Avalon Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] on 79th Street that was refurbished by Ed Gardner [HistoryMaker Edward Gardner] of Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.], you know. And, they tried to revive the old Regal spirit in there and it, for some reason it did not, you know, they wasn't able, it wasn't able to sustain it. But, there's another theater now created by Alderman Dorothy Tillman [HistoryMaker Dorothy Tillman] over in the 3rd Ward which is another attempt to, I guess, do something like the Regal. But, it's the day, you know, there're a lot of factors that made the Regal what it was. I don't know if they can all be reassembled.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Basically, the--to teach empathy for each other. We, we're kind of--(pause) jump on each other in terms of how we feel for each. For--I notice, like I play basketball so I go around a lot of basketball courts, and I noticed a lot of the young kids, their speech patterns towards each other are not friendly. Are not encouraging, are not, you know. Sure, you're gonna tease each other and so, but calling each other out of your name and about your parents and your--you know, we're afraid to say, "Hey, man that was a good shot. That was a nice move, man, you know. Well, brother, why don't you show me that move," you know. Instead it's something else you know. And, I hope that that's the only way it's gonna change if the younger generations will have empathy for each other, you know. Like that, that's not a, "Who is that so and so walking that so and so," you know. "Look how big she is. Look how big he," you know, "He's all fat in the butt and so and so." Why do we go there, you know? If we can teach our kids not to go there. To go some other way and to have empathy for each other, I think that, that'll help us. If we don't we'll still be here, you know, doing the same things, calling each other names, out of our name, and still have all these haters walking around here rather than people saying, "Yeah, man, I love my, my teammates. I love my roommates, the guys who hang on the corner with me. I love these guys," you know. So, that's one of my big concerns.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have thirteen grandchildren, so you know I'm concerned (laughter).
Speaker 1: Thirteen grandchildren--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, congratulations, that's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah. All my kids' televisions broke at the same time (laughter).

Speaker 1: Tell me this, when you look back at everything you've done to this point is there any major thing now that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Some things. Maybe there're, there are people that I came in contact with along the way who I didn't treat fairly because for some reason or the other. Or, maybe I wasn't having a good day, and I took that out on somebody else and it wasn't really necessary. Things like that. But, basically, you know, the things that I did or things that happened, I wouldn't change them, you know. Just like I think about Richard Baugh and myself, if I could go back to that musical publisher's office, would I tell them, "No," that if Richard doesn't do this, I'm not doing it ether. I don't know whether I could do that, you know. I felt bad for not doing it, but I thought that was the only choice that I had at the time, you know, so. I don't beat myself up over it, you know, but it's something I think about.
Speaker 1: It's something that probably doesn't feel good in some ways. But, then again, I mean, you were, I mean, it was your talent that got you--yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Look where it took me. I mean, the path that it took me, you know. And, like, like you say if you change, go back and change one thing, the end will not come out the same, you know. So.
Speaker 1: And, you went back and finished school.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's, that's still one of my proudest moments, you know.
Story_ID: 420517
Speaker 1: Now, we ask this question too, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, at this junction in your life, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: That through it all, I kept my dignity. And, the roles I chose to play and the roles that came to me, I never played a charter who lost his dignity or gave it up. I stayed pretty much true to my fellow man.
Story_ID: 420518
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your family. Now, you, now, I guess you've been married a couple times--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I guess, at least. Okay. All right. So.
Speaker 2: Second time around, I got it. First time, I was new to the game (laughter). Second time around I was a much better husband, you know. I've been married twice. My first wife [Kay Wade] I married, we stayed married for fifteen years. Then the second time I got married, my wife, Jeree [Jeree P. Wade], we've been married for twenty-two years. And, we'll stay married 'til the end, you know. I'm fortunate. She's a wonderful companion and we have made a pact to take care of each other through the end. So, I'm real happy about that. And, I'm happy and satisfied where I am. And, I love my wife. And, my children are grown. My oldest son [Ramel Wade] is fifty years old. My daughter [Patrice Wade Johnson] is forty-seven, and my youngest son [Jamel Wade] is forty-five. And, I have thirteen grandchildren. The oldest is twenty-seven, and he's gonna get married in a couple months. So, that way things, things are good. I, I have my health, I, I feel good. In Montclair [New Jersey] where we live, they have a wonderful program. When you reach seventy years of age, they put you in a program where you have to act as if you have diabetes even though you don't have it. So, therefore, then you start to be concerned with what you eat, how you eat, and you are what you eat. And, you're able to, they have a meter where you have to take your blood sugar everyday so you get to see when you eat certain things, you get a spike in it, and things of that nature. And, they--you go to a lab and they test your blood every three months, and it's a, it's a wonderful program and a great preventive. So, that's something that I've gone through, and like I say, I feel good.
Speaker 1: So, this is Montclair, Ne- New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 420519
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to co- cover before I ask my last questions?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. No, I think we've been pretty concise about everything.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different. Sir, how would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered? Probably as someone, probably, I did my homework. And, I was never late. CPT [colored people's time] time is not in my vocabulary (laughter), yeah. Yeah. In forty-seven years, I only missed two shows. One, I had an impacted wisdom tooth and the other, I had kidney stones. So, if you put my name up on the marquee, you can bet I'll be there. And, I'll be there on time, and I'll be ready to go to work.

Speaker 1: This is a picture, these two people in the picture are myself, [HistoryMaker] Adam Wade, and my wife Jeree Wade [Jeree P. Wade]. And, we--I had a picture session taken for my composite card, and this was one of the pictures from that session and we liked it so we put it together and this is the picture we send out for our Christmas cards.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Okay, buddy. Go head.
Speaker 1: This is a composite card, and this is the front picture of the composite card. The other side of it has four pictures on it. And, when you go out for print work these are what you have to present. As opposed to going on an audition for a play where you present a headshot or film where you present a headshot.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: You wanna turn it over?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. All right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, this is the other side of the composite card which has your agent's logo, their name, their telephone number and your vital statistics; how tall you are, how much you weigh, your eye color, hair color, et cetera, et cetera.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Ready.
Speaker 2: Yes. This is the headshot that I use when I'm submitting pictures for plays or films. If you notice there is no smile. When you present a picture for films or for plays, they need to see some kind of depth from you as opposed to a commercial shot where you have to show eyes and teeth.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Next one. Okay.
Speaker 2: And, this is a headshot I present when I go and audition for commercials. As you notice there are teeth and there are eyes. So, those are two more important factors that you need in your headshot. Because if you'll notice most of the commercials, the people in them are warm, friendly, and helpful. 'Cause that's they're theme.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Next.
Speaker 2: This is also a picture that I present for commercial. And, once again, they're eyes and teeth. And, that's what they're looking for.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, next.
Speaker 2: 'Adam and Evening.'
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right, sir.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So, this is the album cover to Coed [Coed Records, Inc.] album called, 'Adam and Evening,' and this was done in 1961. And, one of the cast members found a copy of it while we were rehearsing at the Hubbard dance studio [Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and had everybody sign it. And, then they presented it to me on my birthday, which was March the 17th.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): That's great. Okay. Ready?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Tell us what we're looking at.
Speaker 1: Yes. This is a series of different television shows and films. On the upper right hand corner is a shot from 'Police Woman.' Right next to it on the top left is a take from 'Kojak.' Below it with the gray hair is a take from 'Lou, Pat and Joe D,' which was a film. And, right next to it in the bottom right hand corner is a take from 'Law and Order.'
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Okay. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay. In the top left hand side is my wife Jeree and I. It's a commercial for a bank. The right hand, the top right hand is an industrial. The bottom right hand picture--the bottom left hand picture is a documentary about dropping out of school. And, the bottom right is doing the 'Tony Brown Journal' show ['Tony Brown's Journal'].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Go ahead, tell us about--
Speaker 1: This is an album cover for an album called, 'In Pursuit of Happiness.' No, it is not the Will Smith picture ['The Pursuit of Happyness'], or film.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Laughter) Okay. Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: There is Tony Brown on the right. And, on the left is a take from the pilot that I did called 'Uptown Saturday Night.'
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay. On the top left is a take from "Shirley's Cookies" of 'What's Happening!!' On the--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Top right.
Speaker 1: The top right is 'Sanford and Son,' with George Foreman. And, on the left below is a take from 'Good Times,' and on the right is a take from 'Good Times,' with Janet Jackson and Michael Carter [sic. Ralph Carter].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay. Next. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a cover of an album for some movie themes that were done. One is 'The God of War.' One is 'The Art of War.' The other is 'Masquerade,' et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
