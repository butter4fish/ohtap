 Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Also with me today is Tanya Finchum. Today is May 3, 2011.  We   re in Delaware County, Oklahoma, interviewing David and Gayla  Holcombe, part of the Holcombe farm. This is an oral history interview,  part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral History Project.  Thank you for joining us today.  Appreciate having you here.  Well, we want to begin by learning a little bit more about your family.  How did your family come to Oklahoma?  Why don   t you start that?  They came on the Trail of Tears in 1836 or 1837. The original Johnson  Thompson only lived like two years, and he was already married and  had children. That   s how the property came into being, through that  lineage.  Do you know how he chose this land?  No, I do not. There was a rather large group of brothers that came  together and one of his brothers, they have a centennial farm adjoining  ours. So it was a family enterprise. They all came together.  When he first came, do you know the original acreage?  We   re assuming from everything we can tell, based on Indian allotments  and the Trail of Tears information, probably it was in the neighborhood  5  Finchum  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  of sixty acres to begin with.  And where did they come from?  Georgia, somewhere in Georgia.  Johnson Thompson is your great-great-great-grandfather?  Grandfather, yes.  So then, who came next? The farm was passed down to whom?  To his son, James Franklin Thompson. He also fought in the Civil War  and then he came back home after the war with his wife and helped his  mother farm. He was not there very long; he was killed in an accident on  the farm. So from there, it passed down to his daughter and it   s been the  daughter lineage ever since, until him. (Laughs)  That   s a very interesting take.  Yes, it is.  Well on those early days of the farm, any stories of early crops/livestock  that they were raising?  What I can remember, dating clear back to childhood days, everything  was extremely diversified. Momma had her little house of chickens that  had twenty-five to fifty laying hens in it. Of course, outside there was a  hog lot that you had your butcher hogs in, and you had four or five milk  cows that we milked and used that for home use and anything that was  excess, you   d take it to town and trade it for feed or edible products for  the home. On the farming side of it, here again, small acreages of wheat,  oats, barley, had some corn crops, had a few beef cows. Like I said, it  was just an extremely diversified farming operation. It took that to  sustain the family.  And then early structures?  There was an older house there before I was born, but then the house  that my mother lived in and was raised in, they built when she was in her  teenage years. There were two older structures. Most people would look  at them as barns. We called one of them a granary, one of them was  called a barn. Her, her brother and her sister, and her mother and dad  lived in the loft of one of the barns while they were building the house  that she continued to live in. Then, of course, after she got married, her  and my dad lived in this particular house and that   s where I was born  6  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  and raised. These two barns are still on the place today.  Do you have memories of your great-grandmother or grandmother?  I don   t have any memories of Grandmother, she was already gone. But  my granddad passed away when I was six years old. I have fond  memories of him.  Was he a farmer? Did he always work on the farm?  Yes. He was a full-time farmer. He was raised right there on the farm,  and that   s all I ever knew him doing was farming. Of course, handing it  down to my uncle and mother, and of course they had a sister, but she  wasn   t in the picture. She had moved to Perkins, Oklahoma.  Okay. So as a little boy, you   re growing up on the farm. What   s life like  on the farm for you?  Oh, I was free to roam. (Laughter)  Did you have chores?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. It was my chore to milk the cows and feed the hogs.  Momma always took care of the chickens. Part of the time she   d send  me to the hen house to gather eggs. I   ll never forget one of those  occasions out there in the middle of the summer. Reached in there to  gather eggs and it wasn   t what it was supposed to be in there. There was  a big old black snake curled up underneath that hen. That was the end of  my egg gathering. That was Momma   s chore from then on. (Laughter)  We all had our chores to do and you know, we didn   t even realize it was  work back then. That was just the style of life. You got up, you fed your  cows, you did your milking, you did your chores, you come back in, you  eat breakfast, and then you got ready and went to school.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I had one sister. She was two-and-a-half years younger than me.  Okay. So tell me about the farmhouse. Describe it for me.  Oh, the farmhouse. It had a back porch on it, a kitchen, a dining room  and a fancy living room, or I thought it was fancy back in those days.  Three bedrooms and when they built it, they even built a bathroom in it.  But naturally, there was no indoor plumbing, there was no electricity.  Everything was still done at the little Johnny house out back. You had a  well that you got your water from. I think I was about six, maybe seven  7  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  years old. Somewhere along that age when electricity came in. Gosh, I  thought that was really neat. You go in there and flip the switch and  there was light that came on. Of course, they plumbed the house and we  had water in the house. Gosh, you got ready to go to bed at night, you  didn   t have to go down the trail to the outhouse. Everything was there in  the house. So I felt like I was in a little mansion. But looking back at it  today, it was pretty modest.  Back then I thought I was in tall cotton because we had everything that  we needed, had a big old wood stove in the living room, and in the  wintertime, everybody stayed warm. You brought your wood in, built a  big fire, got ready to go to bed. I know this doesn   t sound very good, but  you   d shuck your clothes right behind the stove and made a beeline for  the bed, and you jumped in and you never wiggled. Stayed right there  until the next morning. You   d hear Momma get up and get the fire  going, you   d jump out of bed and run and retrieve your clothes, because  they were warm, then. (Laughter)  What part of the house was your bedroom in?  Well, our three bedrooms were on the east side of the house. My  bedroom was what would have been the southeast corner of the house,  down the hall away from the kitchen. Of course, there was a bathroom  between the kitchen and my bedroom, and you walked into the next  room, was the living room, that   s where the stove was. That was kind of  the center of activity in the wintertime. Summertime, naturally, the  kitchen was the center of activity. That   s where we spent most of our  time if we were in the house.  So where would you take your bath?  On the back porch in the washing machine when Momma got through  washing. (Laughter) I can remember many times, my sister and  I   you   d bring the water in and you had your wash tubs and an old  wringer washing machine. When she got through washing the clothes,  she   d throw Carol and I in the tub and we   d play. We thought we were  in tall cotton, because we had free water, and we just played and played  and played. That was the Saturday night bath, right there.  So you guys went in at the same time. You didn   t go last because you  were the boy?  Oh, that didn   t make any difference. No.  There wasn   t a pecking order.  8  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  No, no. (Laughter) There never was a pecking order between her and I.  We did everything together.  Well, tell me about meal time. What was meal time like?  Well, what was meal time like?  What was dinnertime like? What would Momma cook?  Gosh, I don   t remember. That   s a long time ago.  I know what it was like after we got married and what Sunday dinners  were like at her house. Those were really special because she   d go in the  backyard and wring the neck of a chicken and bring it in and dress it,  and you   d have fried chicken after church. There   s just nothing any  better than just fresh, fresh, fresh stuff.  It was cooked in a black skillet, too.  Yeah, it was cooked in a black skillet. (Laughs)  That   s what made fried chicken good.  Everybody seems to have their own technique when it comes to  slaughtering a chicken. Did she have a technique?  Oh, she   d grab him by the neck and wring him about four or five times,  and the neck separated from the body, and when it quit flopping, she   d  pick the chicken up and stick him in hot water, pluck the feathers off  and     She wouldn   t make you pluck anything?  No, Momma did all of that. She didn   t have time to fool with us. She  was too quick. We were too slow. She wanted things done, and she   d  take care of it. Of course, she   d take the entrails out of the chicken and  clean it and take it to the house, cut it up and like my wife said, got the  skillet out and fried that chicken. What Momma was really famous for  was those angel food cakes.  Yes.  She could take a dozen eggs and whip up the best angel food cake you  have ever eaten in your life. They just don   t make them anymore. You  can   t find one like she used to cook. Of course, everybody probably  thinks that about their Momma.  9  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Did she have a big garden?  Oh, yeah.  So lots of canning.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, Momma had a huge garden. Of course, we all worked  in the garden. We enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun. But yeah, she would can  and can and can and freeze stuff later on in life, but earlier, she canned  everything. Of course, we had a cellar in the backyard. She stored all of  her canned goods in the cellar and the next winter, we   d make a heyday  on them.  Growing up early on without electricity, did you have an ice box, an ice  man come by?  I was so young, I don   t even remember. They had an ice house in  Maysville. I do remember we   d go up there once in awhile and get  chunks of ice, but my recollection of most of that   they probably did  have ice for the ice box, I   m sure that   s right. But my recollection of the  ice was bringing it home in a gunny sack and beating it up with a ball-peen  hammer or sledgehammer and then having homemade ice cream.  So that   s what sunk in my mind. (Laughter) Trip to the ice house meant  homemade ice cream.  Would you have to churn it?  Oh, you bet. It was fun. (Laughter) I knew what the end result was going  to be. Didn   t mind that at all.  My arm would get tired I think.  Oh, yeah. But still, you knew the end result. It was going to be good.  Momma was real good at breakfast. She loved to fix a hot breakfast for  you. She thought that was the meal of the day. It was always fried eggs  and bacon and homemade biscuits, and they were homemade. There was  none of this town bought stuff. I remember her making coffee, of course  I wasn   t quite old enough to drink coffee at that time. When instant  coffee came around, that was just,    Katy bar the door     That was the  worst thing that had ever been invented. It was nasty. It is just not like  homemade coffee. Of course, she had the old percolator type coffee pot  back then, and if you were late getting to the coffee, I can remember the  older guys getting grinds and complaining about, you know, didn   t get  there quick enough to get the original good coffee.  10  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  How early did your dad start working on any given day?  My dad never did work on the farm much.  Really?  No, he was a carpenter, and he worked away from the farm. My uncle  pretty well did the farm work until after I got out of college. Of course, I  helped him a lot. But yeah, Dad always worked out various places  around the area doing carpentry work, painting and hanging wallpaper,  construction type like that. He just never did have much interest in the  farm.  Okay.  His job would keep him away from home. He would go and stay for a  week, because you couldn   t afford to drive back and forth. That wasn   t  an option. So when he had jobs like in Grove or Miami or something  like that, he would go and stay. So he really wasn   t there a lot.  Okay. So your uncle probably passed down a lot of tips and tricks when  it comes to farm work?  Oh, sure. Yeah. I just idolized him. I was small and impressionable, and  he was the man role that was around the house most of the time. Of  course, he was out doing the farm work, and that   s what I enjoyed was  the animals and following the team of mules and picking corn and doing  the things on the farm. I mean, that was just the golden life for a young  boy. Traipsed after him, well, until he passed away. I learned a lot from  him.  What was his name?  Garland. Garland F. Baird.  Okay.  What were the mules    names?  I don   t have any idea. (Laughter) Sometimes it wasn   t nice, whether they  were obeying him or not.  Now where did you go to school growing up?  I went to four years right up here, a little country school called Yergen.  That was my first four years. And because Mother was a schoolteacher,  11  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  also, she had a job in Jay teaching grade school there. So we transferred,  my sister and I, transferred into Jay and we spent the rest of our years  there until we graduated from high school. Yergen was like two miles  from our home.  How would you get there?  Most of the time we walked. Once in awhile, the neighbor would come  by and I   d get to ride his bicycle with him. But then in the wintertime,  we   d hitch a ride on the school bus. Jay ran a school bus for the high  school kids, because this was just the grade school from one through  eight. So they ran a bus out here, and they let us get on the bus and ride  to Yergen, and they   d dump us off and pick us up that afternoon and  bring us back home. But if it was warm weather or nice weather, we  either walked or rode our bicycles.  And what would you bring for lunch?  We were fortunate. We had a cook shack at school and had a lady that  prepared the lunches for us, and of course, when we   d come in every  morning you could smell that homemade bread. I can still smell it. They  prepared lunches for us. We didn   t have to carry our own.  Okay, and then when you started going to school in Jay, how would you  get there?  Since Mother was teaching, she drove. So we rode with her every day.  Once in awhile, she had to stay for a teacher   s meeting, and we thought  it was an absolute treat to get to ride the school bus home. No other kid  thought that. I mean,    I   ve got to ride the school bus.    They hated it. My  sister and I thought it was fantastic, because it was something new,  something we hadn   t got to do very often. But yeah, we normally rode  back and forth with our mother.  You probably had to be good in school.  I won   t say that. (Laughs) But I   ll say one thing, she found out about it  faster than anybody   it wasn   t humanly possible for her to know what  we did, but she did. Teachers    kids, they get ratted on instantly.  Same thing happened to our children whenever he taught. (Laughs) So  what goes around comes around.  Yeah, I was no angel in school.  You got into mischief? Come on.  12  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  My share. (Laughter)  What would you do? You don   t want to tell me. (Laughter)  Anything but study. Studying wasn   t my game.  Now your mother was born on the homestead?  Yes. Not the house that   s there today, but in the original house that was  on the homestead, she was born there.  Okay and where did she go to school?  Her grade school work was here at Emmanuel. Then she went to  Southwest City and finished high school. She did her high school work  at Southwest City, where y   all went awhile ago. (Laughs)  Then she went to college for awhile up in Missouri, didn   t she?  Yes, for a short period of time.  For a short period of time and then she finished up her teaching  credentials at Tahlequah, didn   t she? Yeah.  She also went to the Indian Seminary there in Tahlequah for a little  while.  Did she?  Yes. For a short time.  So I guess education was important to her?  Oh, yeah. Very important. She got her, I couldn   t tell you what year, she  graduated from high school and then she went ahead and got her four  year college degree, bachelor   s degree. And then while she was  teaching, drove back and forth in the summertime to Tahlequah, from  here, to get her master   s degree. But she only devoted forty-two years to  teaching. Yeah, she was very dedicated to education. Sure was.  His grandmother, the lady that   s in that picture right over there, she went  to a Cherokee seminary in Tahlequah also. So it comes from a long line  of teachers and in the bibles and stuff that we   ve found after his mother  passed and we started cleaning things away, there was like four or five  generations worth of bibles. A lot of the bibles said Sunday School  13  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Teacher   s Edition, so I   m thinking that there was a lot of Sunday school  taught by the relatives, also. So it is just something that is in the genes.  Just like the Emmanuel Baptist Church up here, Granddad was one of  the original ones that helped build that church with lumber from right  here in the area.  Charter members.  And like she said, was a charter member, and Mom was a secretary of  the church, as far as I know, from the day she was born until the day she  died. (Laughter) Seemed like forever.  When you were going to the one room school     Uh huh, Yergen.  You probably had school programs, Christmas programs? What were  those like?  Yes. We had pie suppers and Christmas programs, and we   d have a  valentine party once a year. We   d have a pie auction and a pie supper to  raise funds for the Christmas party. Then the Christmas party, of course  naturally, Santa Claus had to show up. But because we were grades one  through eight, the older kids would put on a little play. The younger  kids, we kind of got to sit back and watch everything. But we really  didn   t care, because we knew we   d have a good pie supper and Santa  Claus was going to bring us a toy. Of course, if we got a toy, we were  tickled to death. It wasn   t that you were going to get Nintendo games  and TV games and Power Ranger games   you got one toy and you were  tickled to death. Yeah, Christmas program was big.  What was it like when you saw Santa Claus come through that door?  Oh   it was a highlight of the day. Say, oh  We get our toy now   You   ve heard some stories as the kids get older, they realize they know  who Santa Claus is and it kind of spoils it for them like,    Hey wait a  second. That looks familiar.     (Laughter) Yeah, you bet.  So your mother was Alliene?  Alliene Holcombe.  14  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Okay. And your grandmother was Carrie B. Freeman-Baird. And then  your great-grandmother was Lula Freeman?  Yes.  Okay. Just wanted to make sure we got that down.  You   ve probably got it down better than I do. (Laughter)  It   s interesting that both of your parents worked outside of the farm,  other jobs, and still had the land. Was that tough on your mom to  juggle?  Like I said, the majority of the heavy farm work was done by my uncle.  My mother stayed home at the home place, and what really got this  rolling to start with was while my granddad was still alive, there at the  end, he got to be pretty invalid and naturally, had to have somebody to  take care of him. Momma felt like it was her responsibility. So she  stayed in that home and she took care of him at the same time that she  was married to my dad and of course, raising Carol and I. Our uncle  moved up the road, oh it   s about a mile, to another house. But he went  ahead and took care of the farm work. Then I got to help him do the  farm part of it. So Momma had the chickens, and she   d help some with  the milk cows and some of the chores, but her primary job was school  teaching and gardening and cooking and the homemaking type stuff. But  as far as going out and doing the field work, she never did help us with  that a lot.  Okay. Well as you were growing up, did the crops and livestock pretty  much stay the same or did it change as you started getting older?  Oh, from as early as I was involved with it, until at least after high  school, the type of farming operation probably didn   t change much. It  started out, like I said, there was a couple of mules and the team and  everything was pretty well done by hand and then by the time. I was  trying to think   I must have been probably ten, eleven years old, my  uncle bought a tractor. A WD-45 Alice. Boy, life changed. (Laughter)  We thought we were in tall cotton for sure. You didn   t have to walk  behind that team. You didn   t have to go harness up that team.  Everything was done with the tractor and it was two-row farming. Gosh,  I mean, we thought we were getting along fantastic. Compared to today,  it would be antique-ish. Of course, once I graduated from high school, I  went off to college and I didn   t come back and help much except during  the summertime, and I   d help a little on the weekends, but didn   t do too  much.  15  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  Do you remember the first time you rode a tractor?  You bet.  What was that like?  Oh, it was nice.  How old were you?  Oh, ten or eleven. But yeah, I laid a hand on that tractor in a hurry,  because it was a lot more fun on that tractor than it was behind those  mules.  The original allotment was seventy acres, and at that time     Sixty.  Sixty acres   at that time, how many acres did the family have? Still the  sixty?  Yes.  Okay. And at any time, did they expand?  Yes. My uncle bought additional land, I   m trying to think of what year. I  might have been fourteen or fifteen when he bought an additional,  roughly 120-25 acres probably, expanded a little bit.  Still the same livestock, crops?  Yes. Same type of practice.  Okay. Now on the land, any conservation efforts? Terracing? Ponds  built?  Back then, about the only conservation practice that was ever adhered to  was construction of ponds. Because of the lay of our land, being flat,  terracing wasn   t an option, or wasn   t needed. So really, about the only  thing he ever participated in was the construction of ponds. He did do  four or five of those. But now that has changed drastically over the  years.  And so today, how many ponds are on the property? Is that too many to  count?  16  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  We   ve got a bunch of ponds, but we don   t use many of them. We have  completely, well not completely, we still have access to our ponds, but  we have changed our watering systems and fenced our ponds off and put  in off-site watering systems, mirror founts. It   s got its pluses and it   s got  its negatives, but it   s a lot better system than going to the ponds. The  ponds, you   ve got cattle wading in there and they   re causing erosion,  and you get runoff. The next thing you know, your ponds get built up  with silt, and you have to clean them out every four or five years. Of  course, when your ponds go dry, it   s always during the middle of the  summer when you don   t have water anyway. So it   s causing trouble, and  then in the wintertime, your ponds ice over and you get cattle out on the  pond, and if you don   t got enough holes cut, the next thing you know,  they fall through the ice. So we have tried to fence most of our ponds off  and put it on the offsite watering systems. Works great unless electricity  goes off. You better have a generator to back you up. Modern  technology has changed the operation.  Interesting. We   re going to get to the farm today in a second, but as  you   re growing up and you   re going through high school, are you  thinking you want to work on a farm or do something else?  I think, well, you alluded to this, but because my mother and dad  divorced when I was in the fourth grade, they went their separate ways  and I ended up having to live with him in the summertime in Grove, well  my sister and I both. That   s a city environment. We were country folks. I  guess that probably was the first thing that really got against me, that,     No, I   m going back to the farm. I   m not going to be a city boy.    I didn   t  like neighbors right next to me. You couldn   t go out in the backyard and  do your chores or your deeds. (Laughs) I just like the rural life. So we  eventually got to come back and stay here on the farm all the time, but  no, I mean there was nothing about the farm life but what I enjoyed. I  enjoyed every bit of it. I   d get up and have my little   of course, once we  got in FFA and 4-H, we had our show projects. We had a pig and a cow.  Little heifer was named Suzy. Of course, she got nicknamed Suzy by her  folks, so we had quite a deal there when we first got married. (Laughter)  Suzy died when we were in about the third year of college. It was like  the death of a family member. It was not pretty for a few days, because  she had been such a good cow. She would raise her calf and usually  another two or three besides, and then provide milk for the home and  cream and butter. Alliene would make butter and she would even have  extra, and she   d take her cream to town and take her butter to town and  trade it in for probably chicken feed for the chickens. So, Suzy, it was a  big deal when she passed. A big deal. (Laughs)  Well, I was in seventh grade, my 4-H agent bought her for me and of  17  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  course, I showed her. Then when she had her first calf, she gave, being a  Holstein, she gave way too much milk for home use. So I   d go out and  buy little baby calves at the sale barn. Back then you could buy them for  five dollars, so that tells you how old it was. She   d raise three to four at  a time. They   d get up to baby beef and we   d take them to town and sell  them, and I   d go get me four more to put on her. She   d raise them and  we   d do that two or three times through that cycle. Like I say, she was  very well attached to our family. Everybody just thought the world of  her, and of course at some point in time, you   ve got to go on. (Laughter)  She did her deal. But no, our daily life on the farm was a pleasure.  Loved every moment of it. Never did desire to do anything different.  When you would go to town, I   m assuming Jay?  Southwest City.  Southwest City, okay. Southwest City. So if you   re taking crops  someplace or you   re taking something someplace, Southwest City     That was our main center of attraction. That   s where the feed store was  and like my wife said, that   s where Momma took the excess eggs and  butter, milk, sold them there at the feed store, exchanged them for feed.  Our bank was in Southwest City. So that   s where they did all their  banking business and trading. Of course, there was two general stores up  there. So that   s naturally where they bought their groceries. That was  done once a week, I mean, you never went to town except on Saturday.  That was a big event to get to go to town on Saturday. Everything that  was needed was there in Southwest City. There was even an automobile  dealership there, and that   s where my uncle bought his pickup and he   d  trade trucks. He   d always trade there in Southwest City. But you   d go up  there, and of course, we   d make an afternoon of it. Mom and them  would go do their chores, and they had a park out there and the kids,  we   d all go do our thing and play.  Of course, back then, they had a big building up there and they   d have a  drawing every Saturday afternoon at two o   clock. Probably everybody in  the community was there, and they   d get up on top of this building.  They   d holler out,    Oh, I   ve got ticket number so and so. This is so and  so and you win this prize.    When that was over with, the town was  vacant because everybody went home. (Laughter) Then along about  Thanksgiving or Christmas, they   d always have a turkey drawing. I  know this is going to sound real cruel today. You wouldn   t get away  with it, but they threw live turkeys off the top of this building and people  would catch them. If they caught them, they got to take them home.  Sometimes, there   d be a scuffle over who caught which turkey. Part of it  went that way and part of it went that way. One drumstick made it that  18  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Finchum  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  way and one drumstick. (Laughter) Get my gist? Yeah, happy memories.  Happy moments. It was a lot of fun.  Well, you   re in a unique place from a geography standpoint. I mean,  you   re so close to Arkansas, you   re close to Missouri and your property  is in Oklahoma. So you have several options when it comes to going to  town.  It can make life miserable for a lot of folks because our mail is delivered  to us out of a little town of Maysfield, Arkansas. Our address would be  Maysfield, Arkansas, but like you say, we lived in Oklahoma, so our  driver   s license was out of Oklahoma. We did all of our banking and  business in Missouri. Shortly after we got married, we had moved out to  this location here, she got stopped by the friendly highway patrolman.  He had her so thoroughly confused,    Which state do you live in? Where  is your driver   s license from? Your business is where? You do banking  where? Your address is?    And finally he said,    Ma   am, I don   t care  what you do, just get them all the same.    (Laughter)  I was still driving with my Arkansas driver   s license even though we  lived out here for quite some time, because I had such a fear of taking  the test again. I didn   t do well on it whenever I was sixteen taking it in  Arkansas, so I thought I   m just going to push the envelope as far as I  can. I think we probably had Oklahoma tags on the car. I was driving  with an Arkansas driver   s license, and he just couldn   t understand why  things didn   t match. There was a reason for it. (Laughs)  Yeah, you   re in a very unique area from a geography standpoint.  Then after I graduated from high school, of course, I wanted to go to  college at Miami   NEO A M Junior College. Of course, I had a Jay  transcript from Jay Public Schools, so they knew I was a resident of  Oklahoma. But my address at that time was still Maysfield, Arkansas.  And oh, we had a terrible time at the dean   s office trying to get that  taken care of, that I was not out-of-state, that I was an in-state student. I  didn   t want to pay out-of-state tuition. He finally decided, you know, I  guess this is a legit deal.  What year did you graduate from high school?     65.  At that time, did you plan on majoring in an agricultural related area?  Yeah, I finally maybe matured enough to realize that I wasn   t going to  be able to make a living on the farm immediately, because of the other  19  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  involvements that were already on the farm. I knew I loved agriculture.  I knew I loved education so I chose Ag Ed, to become an Ag teacher.  Went to school at Miami for two years. Then normal progression from  Miami was to go to Stillwater, but that   s three, three and a half hours  from here. I needed to be on the farm with my mother, because at that  time, my uncle was getting pretty aged and had emphysema and health  was a big problem. We had gotten married, and it was just going to be a  lot more convenient to go to the University of Arkansas, which is 45  minutes from here. So we made that transition, and we   d go over there  and go to school and then come back home on the weekends and help on  the farm and kind of get things set up for the next week and then go back  to school. If we had to come home during the middle of the week, we  could. So anyhow, I got my bachelor   s degree over there in    69 and  started teaching.  Back in this area?  Well, we thought we knew it all. About    69, we were really smart. We  just graduated from college, we had all the answers. We had a little boy,  and we decided we just wanted to get completely away from everybody.  We were weaned.  Yeah, we were weaned. (Laughter) We took a job in southern Arkansas.  A little town called Blevins. It didn   t take us long to want to come home.  (Laughter) It was quite an experience.  It was the first year of integration. That   ll tell you a lot. The ratio that the  superintendent had presented to him about the white and black was  misrepresented a little bit. So we got down there and it was a challenge  for him, because he was smaller and younger looking than a lot of these  big high school boys that were still going to school that were probably  old enough to be out, but were still going to school. It was quite a  challenge, it really was.  Back that up just a little bit. When I got ready to go do my student  teaching from the University of Arkansas, we had to draw names out of  a hat as to which school we went to, because that   s the only fair way of  doing it. The name I drew was down in southern Arkansas. Well, here  we are, we didn   t have a dime to speak of. Little nine month old baby  and one vehicle, so I told my adviser,    I   m going to have to drop out of  school for a semester because I can   t do this. There   s no way it will  work. I just need a school right here close to home where we can drive  back and forth.    He said,    No, you   re not going to drop out of school.     Well, one of my buddies had drawn the school at Marianna, Arkansas,  which is just as far east as you can go. It   s clear across the blooming  20  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  state. There was a white school and a black school in that town, Lee  County High School. He said,    If you want to go with your buddy, you  can go up to the black school and he   ll be at the white school.     I had had no association with blacks other than had one or two at the  college in Miami that played basketball. They were fantastic. I thought,  yeah, no problem. I   ll do that. So we loaded up and that   s where we  went to do our student teaching. Like I say, I   m the little white boy in  the black school. I had one of the best instructors to work with that I   ve  ever been around. That nine weeks I spent over there was nothing but  just perfect. Those black kids were no different than the white kids.  They had their same little problems. They   d pick on each other, they   d  do their own little things. I mean, it was great. So when I was offered  this job down at Blevins and he was telling us what the ratio was,     That   s no big deal. I   ve been to a black school. This is great.    Mixed  them up, that first year, it wasn   t great.  I   m sure there was tension.  Oh, big tension. Big tension.  Turf wars.  This group over here, this group over here and this group down here and  of course, I was a little bitty tiny small kid and it wasn   t a good  environment. Then I had the opportunity to come back over here to  Decatur, which is just twelve miles east of us. So that   s what I did. I  came back the next year and that made me really close to home and it  was a good environment, good situation. I stayed there until they offered  me this job over here at Jay, and I didn   t want to go back and do it  because that was my home school. Had too many teachers that were still  teaching there that had me in class. (Laughter) I   m not really ready to go  back and face this music yet. But I did.  How long did you teach at Jay?  Ten years. Until I retired in, I guess it was    89.    88.  I want to back up for a second and find out how you met your wife.  (Laughs)  That was a different story.  At the creek.  21  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Well, no. (Laughter) No, at Lovell   s house.  Well, that was kind of the same deal.  My sister had married his next door neighbor. She ran off and got  married, eloped. So my mother and dad, they   d been married maybe a  couple of months or something, decided it was time to come out and  meet this other guy   s folks. So we came out to meet her in-laws and had  Sunday lunch with them. Well, David and his sister come up to play  basketball with the girl that lived there, Sondra, she was about your age.  That   s how we met. You were a sophomore and I was a freshman, in  high school. So we were kind of sweet on each other for like one  summer, and then he sent me a Dear John letter. It was too far for him to  drive over there where I was at. He had just gotten his driver   s license  and just got a car. I probably wasn   t that interesting anyways. (Laughs)  We just didn   t have any more communication until I graduated high  school in 1966, and I sent him a graduation announcement. We started     Tell her the reason that you sent it.  I figured that he thought that I wouldn   t have been able to make it  through, so I went ahead and said,    I   m just going to show you.    So I  sent him the graduation announcement, and then from there on out, we  dated probably for another four or five months after I graduated high  school and then got married that same year in    66.  All because of a graduation announcement.  She showed you. (Laughter)  Here we are, almost forty-five years later. Still under the same roof.  That   s quite a deal for most people these days.  After your uncle passed on, what   s going on with the farm, then?  Even back before he passed away, like I said he had emphysema, and we  were still living in Decatur and moved out here shortly thereafter. I had  pretty well taken over the daily operation of the farm, and was kind of  changing it from the type of operation it was then to what was fitting  with what we were trying to do here. We converted everything into row  crops and basically at one time had no cattle except during the winter.  We grazed stockers on wheat pasture, but we had everything converted  over to green beans, butter beans, purple hull peas, wheat, milo,  soybeans. Did a lot of double cropping with those commodities. Then  like I say, in the fall, we   d plant as much as we could to wheat and bring  stockers in and run stockers on the wheat pasture through the winter, sell  22  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  them. We did that for probably what, twenty years, maybe twenty-two,  somewhere along in there. Anyhow, while the kids, especially the two  boys, now the girl, she didn   t get too involved in the equipment. Matter  of fact, she didn   t get too involved in the work.  Who was harvesting the crops?  I did.  Okay. Did you have any outside help or it was just the family?  No, we just did it ourselves. Once in a while, like I said, the butter beans  and the purple hull peas, a lot of times Stillwell Food, the company that  we contracted with, if they happened to be close by, they   d come by  with their combines and assist us to get it out quick. Now the green  beans, they were contracted with Allen Canning Company and they have  their own pickers and they   d come by and do all the picking for the  green beans. That was a sixty day crop. You planted, normally, the 20th  of April. End of June, the crop was picked and you could go back and  double crop with soybeans or milo, if that   s what you wanted to do. Like  I say, we did that for probably twenty years. Then the boys graduated  from high school and started on to college and met their little  sweethearts and there went my labor force. So we slowly worked our  way out of row crops back into strictly cow/calf operation, today.  And how many head do you have today?  There   s approximately 200 head of momma cows. We do a spring  calving and a fall calving.  Who   s pulling?  Who   s what?  Pulling calves.  I hope nobody.  Oh yeah?  We haven   t pulled a one this year. We   ve been lucky. We haven   t had a  one, so far. They   ve all been by themselves. We   ve spent an awful lot of  time selecting low birth weight bulls where     Because that can be kind of tough     23  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Finchum  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  We   ve had our share of not good experiences.  Every once in a while, we   ll have a hiccup. It   s really interesting now  since we kind of do it together and we   re older, getting that cow to go  down the chute and I get to hold the tail while he   s doing his business  and sometimes it   s not real pleasant. (Laughs) But we usually manage.  We don   t have to do that very often. Just once in a great while does that  happen.  Matter of fact, we did pull one last fall. The very last one. That last  heifer.  Yeah, we did. Just one.  We had one. It wasn   t bad, I mean, she would have probably had it if I   d  have left her alone, but we had other business we wanted to attend to and  she   d been in labor long enough and   so we just, she was handy. Of  course, we keep all our stuff close to the corrals and it was easy to put  her in, got the calf and it was alive, we went on about our business and  momma went on about her business.  Ever have any twins?  Oh, yes. Every once in awhile. I despise twins. I say that, last   I guess it  was last fall, I had three sets of twins in this pasture right out here in  front of the house. I loaded one of them up every time and took them to  the sale barn. I just do not like a cow raising twins. You get two knot  heads and it takes a lot of work for the cow and she   ll go down in  production and next thing you know, she won   t cycle on time and next  year, you   ve got a calf that   s two or three months late from the rest of  them. As valuable as calves are today, I just sell the baby calf, let her  raise one and go on. It   s a lot easier on her.  When you   re going to the sale barn, where   s it at today? Where are you  going?  Here the last three or four years, I   ve taken most of my cattle to Decatur.  They   ve got a really good sale over there. They   ve got some good  buyers. They   ve got two owners that are just fantastic gentlemen. They  work their sales hard, and they   re out there to help the customers. They  keep the order buyers in, and we get as good a price there as anywhere  else. It   s close. They come haul them for me, don   t charge me to haul  them, so we   ve got a good relationship.  Tell me about the structures on the property that have evolved. Any new  structures? Barns?  24  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Okay, from the old home place, when I left it in high school and after  college   of course, Mom passed away in    92, we made the decision not  to rent the house. We did not want anybody in her house. She had  probably three generations of history     Five or six.  (Laughs) This house has a big upstairs and it had all kinds of history in  it.  Books, photographs, letters.  Mom was big into history.  She never threw anything away.  I could just slap myself for not listening to her. She helped author the  Delaware County Historical Society   s book of Delaware County. We   d  kid her and pop off,    Oh, there goes that meeting of the hysterical  society.    You know, and boy I look back and I just wish I would have  listened and paid attention to some of the stories that she could tell. Like  she was talking about awhile ago, working on the centennial committee.  Man, we   re the old timers and we don   t remember nothing. That history  is gone. But yeah, that house when I left and like I say when mom  passed away, we elected not to rent it out. So it sat there vacant. Grant  you, I   m there, three or four times a day, doing chores, farm work or  whatever. Invariably, somebody is going to think that there   s something  in there that they need. We had the house broken into once. There was  nothing there, my sister and I had already removed the valuables     furniture, precious items, something that meant something to us   there  was just a lot of papers and stuff. Thieves finally realized there was  nothing there. So the house was sitting vacant. Sat vacant for five or six  years, maybe longer?  From 1992-2005.  Oh, gosh. Thirteen years. Anyhow, in the mean time, our daughter had  gotten married. They lived out west of Jay. They had an opportunity to  sell their place and of course, she   s the home-ec teacher down here in  Siloam Springs. Well, they decided they wanted to move closer, and  they had the opportunity to buy sixty acres right here west of us. Of  course, he   s kind of a history nut himself, her husband, and they wanted  to move into Mom   s old house. Oh, fantastic. That would just tickle  Mom to death. So they remodeled it, added on to it. Of course, the  original structure is still there, but we revamped the inside of it and kind  25  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  of changed the living room, dining room, and kitchen area around. They  added on a master bedroom and master bath and enlarged the kitchen  and added on the garage. So that structure, I mean, it   s still there, but it   s  been modernized to kind of fit their needs.  The original two barns, the granary and the barn, are both still there.  They   re needing some repair. We added some grain bins back when we  were in row crop production. I built a Quonset barn for storage and built  another hay barn over there, a large hay barn. We   ve done an awful lot  of conservation work as far as heavy use areas and cross fencing and  watering structures and that type of stuff. It   s kind of changed the  appearance of the place. Built some corrals on it. Modernized it to kind  of fit our needs today. But the original place is still there.  Any interaction with county agents?  We don   t want to go there.  What are your thoughts about county agents?  County agents are great, if you have one.  He deals with Benton County  Arkansas  more than Delaware County.  Really?  He   s in the hay and forage program through Benton County, the  Bermuda grass, they have a big contest every year about who   s got the  best hay and it just   it encourages people to come together and share  ideas and be good at what they do. High quality hay, that kind of thing.  Arkansas has just always been the place that he   s done a lot of that stuff  with, even though we   re in Delaware County.  Might go back and say our grassroots actually started in Decatur because  that   s where we started when we first got married. That was kind of one  of our first places to settle. She went to work at the poultry company,  Peterson   s. I was teaching there, got associated with all the county folks  and interactivity with everything that was going on there. It seemed like  a lot of their farming practices and a lot of their university bulletins,  studies, and research is more conductive to this area, more relevant to  the type of practices we have here. Here in Delaware County, of course  it seems like we just get brand new agents, we don   t get anybody that   s  experienced. All they know is what they get from an OSU fact sheet.  Most of those are from the red country or the sand country or  somewhere that   s not relevant to what we do here. Therefore, we   re just  not able to interact with them very much. Like I said, we just do most of  26  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  our work with the University of Arkansas.  Yeah, again, you   re in a very different geographic region. Oklahoma is  very diverse geographically, so it seems to make sense that you would  have more interaction with other states at this point than just Oklahoma.  Then on the same token, and I   ve served on the Delaware County  Conservation Board for a number of years, implementing conservation  practices for the watershed and for the area that we   re in, and as you   re  probably well aware of because of this being such a poultry side of the  state. City of Tulsa had their lawsuit against our poultry companies back  in    91 or 2, somewhere along in there. All this legislation started coming  down about how we have to operate our farms and litter management  plans and waste management plans. As an EPA project and I guess  through the Oklahoma Conservation Commission, they decided to set up  a study program called the Educational Demonstration Project, called  the Beta Creek Water Project. This was a project between Delaware  County, Oklahoma, Denton County, Arkansas and the EPA Region 6 out  of Dallas and Fort Worth area. I chaired that thing for five years. That   s  where we ended up putting a lot of those conservation practices into  place. Not only on our farm, but on practically every farm within the two  counties that was in the Beta Creek Watershed. So we had a lot of  involvement with Delaware County, but just not necessarily the  extension agent.  Right, that   s interesting because not every farmer, rancher likes the  extension agent for various reasons   it could be many things, so it   s  interesting to hear your take on it.  I don   t have anything against our agent. We   ve had four different county  agents since I   ve been heavily involved in farming. Not any of them  have information that is relevant to what we   re doing here. But I   ve  spent an awful lot of time on the phone and visiting with the Arkansas  agent. He is so relevant to what we   re doing and so knowledgeable about  the programs that we   re running, and the type of things that we   re doing  coincides with what the U of A is doing. So that   s where we share our  information.  And you also have poultry on this farm, too, right?  Oh, yes.  Tell me about that operation. How long have you had poultry on the  farm?  We built our first two and we raise pullets. We built our first two houses  27  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  in    85 for Peterson Farms out in Decatur. Liked it so well that it was an  opportunity for both of us to get to stay home. The chicken deal has  really been a blessing to us, even though it has had some headaches as  we go along through laws, rules, regulations, but it   s that way with any  job. Then it was in    91 when we built two more houses on a 110 acre  farm that we had purchased a few years back. We tried to run all four  houses by ourselves, plus we had built two hog houses, confinement hog  houses, in    78. That, with the diversified farming of the cattle and the  hay and we pretty well had our hands full. We don   t use hired help, this  is strictly the family farming operation.  Well, our oldest son by now has graduated college, and he has gone to  work for Peterson   s as a breeder manager in the poultry department. Our  youngest son had gotten married. He and his wife were going to school  also at the University of Arkansas, and they had decided that,    We want  to branch out a little bit.    They wanted to buy part of the farm. So we  leased them the two houses on that 110 acres that we had purchased a  few years earlier, and they just fell in love with it. So they ended up  buying it. So now, they have two of the houses on that 110 acres and the  wife stays home with the kids, and she raises the pullets and our son runs  the bank at the Bank of Siloam Springs, which is a branch of the Decatur  State Bank. So we   ve still got it all right here in the family.  Yeah, this is definitely a very poultry heavy part of Oklahoma.  Yes.  Very much so. And we   ve only done, I guess this is the third farm in this  kind of region and two of the three have poultry operations and of  course it   s different in the central part of Oklahoma.  Oh, sure. You just don   t find any.  No, no.  Yeah, they   re begging for our litter and that   s about it. But yeah, the  Eastern quadrant, eastern quarter of Oklahoma is heavily, heavily  poultry. The further south you get, the more concentrated it gets.  I was going to say something about the continuing of education within  the family because when our daughter was in high school, she was  thinking about going into, I think, physical therapy or something and I  don   t know why, but anyway, we got to talking and I said,    Do you  realize there have been like five generations of teachers in your daddy   s  family?    Then of course, his sister, she had already had her children  grown by then and neither one of them were teachers. Randy taught for  28  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Finchum  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Finchum  D. Holcombe  like one year and then he became a doctor, and her daughter is in the  funeral home and crematory business. I said,    Tamera, the teaching  lineage is going to die out if somebody doesn   t teach within this family  unit.       Oh, okay.    So she thought about it and when she went to  university, she decided she was going to be   they call it family and  consumer sciences now, a teacher. So that   s what she does over in  Siloam Springs. So we   ve got a continuation there, and I don   t know if it  will continue that way or not, but that   s kind of, you know, that many  years of people teaching within a family and it continuing on is an  unusual thing. Usually that doesn   t happen.  Oh yeah. When your mother was teaching, it was hard times in  Oklahoma, the Depression. Did she ever have trouble cashing her  paycheck, her warrant?  No, not that I   m aware of. But she started out teaching up here in   well  actually, she was in high school when she first started teaching at the  little rural schools. And then she taught up here at Yergen.  Did she teach some at Ward, also? She   s taught at several schools.  Yes. A few years.  What was her topic? What subject did she teach?  Elementary education, but of course, in the little one room schools, you  taught everything. You taught math, history, science, language, a lot of  reading and writing back then.  Was she ever a member of a home-ec club?  Delta Kappa Gamma.  Sorority, teacher   s sorority.  Sorority and 4-H, she was in   4-H later was her passion. She loved to  write speeches and demonstrations and timely topics and dress reviews.  I got so sick and tired of them dress reviews, because I had to put on  slacks and black shoes and polish them, and black socks, and I thought if  I ever get out of the dress reviews, I   m doing something different.  (Laughter) Mom was big in that.  Did she belong to a homemaker club?  Yes. Home extension agent. Yeah, she was pretty active in that type of  activity. That and her church. She was extremely active in her church.  29  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  Did she sew or quilt?  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  She sewed. Yes.  Tremendous amount of sewing.  She made Carol   s wedding dress and the bridesmaids    dresses for her  daughter   s wedding. She made all of that, on top of all her teaching and  everything, because you couldn   t afford to take off, so you just did it all.  Tremendous amount of crocheting. We used to laugh at her. She   d take  bread wrappers   she grew up through the Depression, so she   d take  bread wrappers and crochet rugs.  Made rag rugs out of the plastic.  Plastic rugs out of the plastic bread wrappers. Of course, their flour  sacks, they saved their flour sacks and made their shirts, and when they  got through making shirts, she   d make something else out of them.  (Laughs)  Quilts out of them. Whenever she passed away, I found, and I   ve got it  in the other room, a round wooden box full of quilt pieces that had  already been started, the Dresden plate, there   s enough there for two  quilt tops and this fabric must be from the    10s,    20s,    30s. It   s the real  old ugly, yucky looking fabric, but they were already all hand sewn  together, these plates were. So I just took them out and washed them  very carefully by hand and laid them out and let them dry. So I   m  putting those on muslin and someday I   m going to have two quilt tops  done out of this stuff that was left. A lot of history is there. We don   t  know for sure if she   s the one that put them together or maybe if her  mother put them together. We don   t really know. Because her mother  died, probably in the    30s. She was just 50-something when she passed.  Really don   t know what her ailment was, but she was very young when  she passed away.  This one, believe it or not, she   s carried it on. She   s made a quilt for  every kid and every grandchild. They   ve got their own special quilt  that     Yeah, and I   ve got a room full of fabric upstairs, and I told some of my  quilting buddies, I said,    You know, whenever I die, you might want to  get to the house before David sees what   s upstairs and go ahead and do  30  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  something with all that.    He   s going to wonder,    What in the world is  she thinking?    (Laughter) It   s an addiction. It really is. You find this  fabric,    Oh, I think I can make something out of this, so I think I better  buy some.    So you buy some and you   ve got it   My daughter felt so bad for me last summer, she said,    Dad if you   ll  back the truck up to the window while Mom is gone       We hauled two  loads of stuff off and she never missed it.  (Laughter) Oh, well. But his mother had accumulated a whole room. The  whole bedroom was full of fabric. She had put them by fabric types and  colors. So she had it on her mind whenever she retired, when she got too  old to do anything else, which she never did because she kept having  gardens and chickens right up to the very end. She was going to make  quilts. You could tell that   s what her intent was with all that fabric. So  whenever we went into the house in 2004 and 2005, we decided it   s time  we did something with this. I sorted through a lot of that fabric, and I  kept a lot of it. A lot of it I didn   t keep and I felt bad about it ever since.  You just don   t ever throw anything away, but I threw some of that fabric  away thinking, it   s not something I would probably ever use. I could go  ahead and keep it, then whenever I die, my kids can throw it away. A lot  of things we have kept. We know that   s what   s going to happen to it  because this bookcase over here came from over there and it   s full of  family bibles and textbooks, stuff they used to teach with and all that  kind of thing. They said,    What are you going to do with all that stuff?     I said,    Well, that   s your problem. Whenever we die, you can do  something with it. I don   t know.     Even in the upstairs, we found a little diary that I guess my dad had kept.  Every day, he put a journal entry in there as to what he had done.    I  went to work. I spent ten cents on        Wallpaper paste.  Detailed, for like two years.  I was going to ask you about record keeping, how records were kept.  They kept everything in a notebook and it was very, very detailed.  We   ve got a lot of them here.  We   ve got a lot of ledgers where they wrote down everything they did.  Where they spent their money and at one point in time, it would have  been, I don   t know if it was her or her mother   it was her mother   no  maybe it was her. Anyway, she was like executor over her brother  because the mother had already passed. She had to put down everything  31  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  that she spent on him for his living or his schooling or his clothing or  whatever, and I guess make an accounting of it to somebody, and we  have those kinds of books and records. We even found one paper that  whenever they built the barn, how much it cost to build the barn over  there. So they were savers and keepers. Never threw cancelled checks  away, never threw check stubs away     IRS would never have an issue with them because they had everything  documented to the last penny. Spent a penny on nails and I spent two  cents on milk or whatever. I mean, everything was documented.  Today, are you using a computer to keep track of everything with the  farm or   ?  Yeah, she does all the computer work.  Yeah, I keep up our stuff on QuickBooks.  Okay. So gone are the days of writing it down in the ledger book.  Yeah. (Laughs)  Only thing I have to remember is that debit card receipt had better come  home.  Yeah, so we can write it down in the checkbook so I can go ahead and  do what I need to do.  We write very few checks.  Is it hard to sustain a living just being farmers today?  Oh, I don   t think it   s hard. Of course, we   re kind of fortunate that we   ve  been out of debt for a number of years, but yeah, if I was heavily  leveraged with equipment debt or poultry house debt or vehicle  debt   commodity prices on the farm today, as everybody well knows, is  fairly good. Cattle prices are good, wheat prices are good, corn prices  are good, but when you turn around and look at your expendable  expenses, fuel is twice what it was last year, fertilizer is three times as  high as it was last year, equipment is absolutely out the ceiling. So if you  were heavily leveraged, I think you   d have a very difficult time making  it today. We are not bragging, we just feel very fortunate that we   re debt  free, and we   re trying not to stumble anywhere.  We try to keep our eggs in a whole bunch of different baskets so if  something happened with the chickens or something happened with the  32  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  hogs or something happened with the cattle, you   ve got something else  to bank on. We have slowed down, believe it or not. Our kids have  finally admitted that I   ve slowed down. (Laughs) We enjoy running  around and playing a little bit. We   ll take off for an hour or two in an  afternoon and jump on the trike and go down here and come back over  there. So, yeah, we   ve slowed down our lifestyle, but it   s good.  For years, we both worked off the farm and always had that other  income so that we didn   t have to take everything from the farm, we  could put stuff back in the farm. That   s the only way it ever would be  where it is today, because people have started out young trying to live  off the farm and make their payments and their living and raise their  kids   I don   t see how they could do it. I really don   t. Because things are  not constant enough or consistent and you never know when a  disaster   his mother was always a big believer in insurance and we  always,    She   s got insurance on everything for everything and  everybody.    We   re the same way. We   ve always maintained that if  you   ve got it, you need to have it insured. If you have a disaster, you can  recoup. A lot of people don   t operate like that. They just leave it up to  chance and chance, sometimes, isn   t very favorable. So just taking life  simple and easy and doing what you can do and let the rest of it slide.  Just like on the other side of it. We   re fortunate, two of our three  children are still living right here close to us. They all have outside jobs,  but they   re wanting to be in the farming area too. Like I say, one of them  has got sixty acres and one of them has got 110 acres with the two pullet  houses. And we   re fortunate in that we can be here during the day that if  they need assistance, it   s not a problem. Go do it. That   s going to get  them afoot where they can be here someday, because if they just had to  walk out there and buy, cold turkey, go in debt, the margin is not there.  Sadly to say.  How have the neighbors changed through the years?  Oh, that has really changed a lot. Used to, you didn   t have hardly any  neighbors. If a vehicle would drive by, you didn   t even look to see who  it was, you could tell by the sound of the vehicle which neighbor it was.  Farms have sold. They   ve divided. You   ve gotten quite a few new  neighbors that have moved in from different areas. Not necessarily are  they wanting to farm, they just want a ten acre ranchette or a twenty acre  ranchette. Both the husband and the wife work out, kids are home by  themselves. On the poultry side of the deal, about six years ago the  Laotian community just absolutely sucked up the chicken houses. A lot  of the farmers that were leveraged a little bit, and maybe some banks  realized this. Maybe some real estate agents realized it. Saw an  opportunity to sell these farms, and we have a tremendous number of  33  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Laotian neighbors now. They   re their own community. They   ve got their  own environment. They   ve got their own, as they call it, rules and  regulations that they live by. They   ve got their own little communities  and naturally, they don   t intermingle with us much. We   ve got two or  three right here close to us that we can visit with on occasion, but it   s not  like it used to be.  Not the same.  Different community.  I   m sure you have regulations that you have to deal with. Do you have  any governmental challenges that make it hard to continue doing what  you do?  Oh, yeah. That   s kind of what we referred to a while ago with the City of  Tulsa lawsuit. Because of that Senate Bill 1170, I guess it was, that was  actually passed in whatever it was,    93 maybe. That   s a set of rules and  regulations that we have to live by in the poultry industry. Basically,  they want us to get our education, which that   s fine. Nobody   s got a  problem with that. But their main deal is the application of poultry litter.  When and where and the timing and how you can do it and when you  can do it   so to make this thing, I guess, from the government if you  want to say that or from the court system, we have a team. There   s two  in Oklahoma and two in Arkansas, they come out and do our soil testing  for us in every field.  If we want to apply poultry litter, whether it be our own litter or litter  that we want to purchase, that litter sample has to be correlated with our  soil sample. They   ve got a computer generated program where they can  tell you,    Okay, you can put on one ton per acre or you can put on two  tons per acre.    Telling us just exactly what we can put on at what time of  the year. They   ve got two or three different times of the year that will  change the rate of application due to water, temperature and that has  caused a lot of unrest, I guess, for the area because people was not  accustomed to being told when and how they can clean out and as to  how much litter they can apply to this particular field. This caused a lot  of issues, but now people have kind of gotten adjusted to that and it   s  kind of worked out to where you just know that that   s the rule. If you   re  going to be in the game, well, that   s the rule that you play by. That   s  probably been one of our biggest challenges.  Has there ever been a time where the farm has really struggled that you  can recall?  Our personal farm? Oh, you bet. Yeah. There   s been a lot of times where  34  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  this thing was just sitting there teeter tottering. We were wondering if  there was going to be enough to pay Peter or Paul. Which one is going to  get hungry today? Are the kids going to go hungry or are we going to  make our payment? (Laughter) Sure, we   ve had our rough times. You  bet.  Can you attribute it to anything like the economy or what was going on  during that period?  Main thing was input costs were high and crop values were low. Markets  were just not where they needed to be. I know you hear that constantly,  but wheat was less than two dollars a bushel. Today it   s pushing nine or  ten. Of course, production costs have gone up today compared to then,  but that   s still the thing that was affecting us so drastically was the  commodity prices were pretty low and our expenses were hard to  control. Some of those expenses   and of course, like she related to, I  worked two jobs a lot of the time. She had an outside job and a home  job, so she had two jobs. But we did that to do what we wanted to do, to  have a lifestyle that we wanted. It   s paid off. It worked. We   re doing it  today.  Weather has played an issue a lot, too.  A time or two.  You get those really hot, dry times, especially whenever we were trying  to grow green beans or something like that because there   s such a small  window of time when they   re at their peak and if they don   t get them  picked   and of course, you   re not in control of when they pick them.  You   re not in control of when you plant   so those variables are taken  out for you and you put seed in the ground and you take care of it and  the harvest is there and it   s ready, but they   re not here. Then you get a  hot blowing dry wind the last of June or the first of July and the beans  just shrivel up. All the weight, the quality and everything is gone. So  those kind of issues, you know, you   re hands are tied. There   s nothing  you can do about it. You can call and say hey you need to get over here,  but your turn is not here yet. They work an area. They plant different  times, different   where it gets warmer down south quicker. They   ll  plant down there and come this way so when it comes time to pick,  they   ll go down there and come this way. If you happen to be sitting  there on a crop that you think is going to be unbelievable and the  weather throws you a curve, you maybe lost it.  The thing about the weather issue, I   ll never forget one Christmas. We  had a milo crop and had a bunch of acres of milo out. Then in the fall,  when it was time, October, November, when it was time to start  35  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  combining, it started raining. The fields got muddy, the fields got  muddier, the fields got muddier and the sun would shine for a day or two  and you think,    Oh  I might get to       and then it   d rain again. Then it  got to the point that you knew you weren   t going to get a combine on the  field until the ground froze. Needless to say, the ground froze the day  before Christmas. So you know where we spent Christmas. The boys  was in the trucks hauling the grain to the bin and I was in the combine  combining, and they were not real satisfied that Santa Claus was not in  their truck. (Laughter) But you do what you   ve got to do on the schedule  that you   ve got to do it. Of course, it thawed out, and if we hadn   t gotten  it at the time, we   d have lost that crop. We had to have that crop. It was  very important, but they had their Christmas. (Laughter) Just a couple  days late. That   s a twenty-four hour a day job, right there.  You   re at the mercy of Mother Nature.  Yes.  Got to do what you got to do to make it work. It seems that the farm is  very important in your family, it   s always played a big role in your lives.  Why stay on the farm? Why is it important for you?  Why would you want to do anything else?  We   ve discussed this at length. We could sell everything we   ve got.  And be happy for ten minutes.  Buy a beautiful house on the lake and just take life easy. He said,    I   d be  bored in fifteen minutes.    He said,    I couldn   t stand it. Got to have  something to do.    (Laughs)  We can take the pontoon boat and go to the lake on Sunday afternoon  and drive around and look at them big old houses on the lake and she   ll  say,    Wouldn   t that be nice?    Yeah, you bet. For about fifteen minutes. I  would absolutely be sick of that. She would too. She could make it better  than I could, but no. I will be right here when I die.  How early did you get up today?  Oh, what was it? 4 o   clock this morning?  Four or 4:30 is usually when we wake up and start watching the news  and weather and drink some coffee.  Drink a cup of coffee and roll back over and well, let   s watch a little bit  36  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  of news and weather, let   s snooze for   (Laughter) No, we   re on the  ground by 5:30 for sure.  What do you see happening to the farm and the land in the next 100  years?  I   d be a millionaire if I knew that answer. Technology, we probably  won   t even recognize the way we do things today. I think technology is  just probably hasn   t even touched the surface. I   ll give you a good  example of that. My son, when he bought the other two chicken houses  from us, they did what   s called an update program. The company offers  an update. If you want to do a different type deal, they   ll pay you a  certain amount of money and blah, blah, blah to do it. Of course, we   re  old. We   re retired. I   m not going to go in debt for a chicken house or to  do an update or any of this stuff. We   re going to stay on the system and  our houses are computerized, but he elected to do the update program.  Wow. I thought ours was modern. They   ve got such a computer  generated program over there. It tells exactly when to feed, how much to  feed, when the lights come on, when the water comes on, what the  temperature is going to be, which fan runs first, which fan runs second,  which fan needs to be in cycle with the next fan so you   ve got even  ware, uniform heat, uniform coolness throughout the house   that thing  is as modern as you can ever imagine. A six year old could run that  operation, as long as the computer works. (Laughs)  That   s right.  As long as the computer works.  What happens when the power goes out?  We   ve got a generator for our backup. That   s not always the answer  either. I   ll give you an example. 9-11, I was out doing chores, I heard it  on the radio. Airplanes hitting the Twin Towers. I come flying back to  the house and I told her turn the TV on, I can   t believe what I   m hearing  is true. Sure enough, there   s the airplanes flying into the Towers and  we   re sitting here just glued to the TV. I   ve got alarm systems on these  two houses and my son   s two houses and it comes back through an  answering machine. We   re sitting there watching that stuff and all the  sudden, the lights go out in our house, the TV goes off. I just instantly  froze, I thought,    They bombed the dam over here at Disney because  that   s our power source for our RAC Electric Company.    About that  time, the alarms went off. The phone dialer went off. They were out of  power. So I jumped in the pickup. I told the wife, I said,    You run over  and watch these two houses, and I   m going to go over and check with  Aaron and Tammy and make sure things are okay.     37  Finchum  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Well, when I turned the corner, my generator had fired, I could hear it  running. Got over to her place and their generator was running, her fans  were running, everything was going just perfect. I sat there and visited  with them for a few minutes and I thought, well I might need to get back  to the house. Come back over here and she   s over here dropping our  curtains, letting them down. Generators running but don   t have a fan  running. The motor was running, but the generator didn   t transfer the  little switch. There   s a five dollar motor that makes the electrical transfer  from the motor to the generator to make the house hot with electricity.  So I had to take the manual crank and crank it over. Everything went to  working perfect. Just because you   ve got a generator doesn   t mean it   s  always going to work.  Sounds like you have to be mechanically minded, too.  Oh, a little bit. I   m not just really mechanically inclined, but electricity  isn   t bad. Flip the switch, it better work. (Laughs) But yeah, got to have  a backup.  Always. So do you hope in the future that the land and the farms will  continue on in the family?  Oh, you bet. That   s often a goal and not so much what we have  accumulated ourselves, but I   ve told the kids, I said,    I really don   t care  what you do with my stuff once I   m gone. Y   all do whatever you feel  comfortable doing, but some way, somehow, try to preserve the original  home place.    I   d like to see it go   the kids that are there right now, the  grandkids, that   s the eighth generation. I know there   s one, if not two,  that   s going to be extremely interested in staying there. He   s only eight  years old.  It   s already in his blood.  It   s in his blood, big time. Some of the others, they   ve kind of gone their  separate ways and done their separate things. We   ve got one getting  ready to go to Afghanistan in June. He   ll never want to be a farmer.  He   ll never want to come back to the land. Trent, the next one, you  never know about him.  He could possibly     Some day, he could possibly. He   s not lived right here close as he was  growing up, but he likes what goes on here. But you know, I   m not  going to tell them what to do, but they know our wishes. (Laughter)  38  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Well, that   s good. Do you have anything else that you   d like to tell us  that we haven   t asked you about today? (Laughter)  Any home remedies?  Not really.  You   ve got one.  What?  The trike.  Oh, yes. Yes. We   re enjoying our retirement. We take little mini  vacations, an hour or two hours at a time. (Laughs) We   ll go jump on the  Honda Gold Wing trike that we got like two years ago. That   s really  been a blessing to us because the way we   re tied down here, it is hard to  hire anybody to come in that knows how to do the things the way you  want them done, to take care of the chickens and the cattle. There   s two  times a year, they   re calving, you can   t go off and leave them then. You  don   t want to go off and leave your birds and stuff while it   s really,  really hot. You don   t want to go do anything when it   s really, really  cold. So it   s just select times when you can actually go take off and take  a vacation. We   ve been on a couple cruises back in the    90s and they   re  great, but by the time we   ve been away from home for two or three days,  we   re ready to come home anyway. So being able to get away for a few  minutes and that   s how we spend our leisure time. Of course, church  activities and stuff like that and we started square dancing again. We did  that thirty years ago and gave it up and then take it up again within the  last two years. We   re in a club and we go square dance and stay active.  That way, we have something to do besides fall asleep in front of the TV  every night.  I think the trike has probably been the biggest thing that we have really  enjoyed.  Yeah, it is.  Everybody that knows us, there   s not a one of them that can believe it.  When we first bought that,    You would be the last person in the world  that I ever thought would be on a trike.    But we just love it. We just  absolutely love it. Late in the afternoon, especially in the summertime  when it   s hot, but late in the afternoon after we know that the curtains  are okay on the chickens, the fans are running, we   ve got our backups in  place, we   ll jump on it and maybe run to Siloam and get an ice cream  cone or run to Grove and eat a quick supper and come back. We have  39  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  really enjoyed that. It   s kind of been a relaxation and slowed down a  little bit.  Everything looks different, the countryside looks different when you   re  on the back of a bike. Everything is greener and prettier. (Laughs)  She falls asleep on it.  Yes, I do.  Do you really?  Yes, I do. Yes.  I pulled up to a stop sign over here one day and I said,    Hey are we  supposed to turn left or right?    I felt her kind of shake, she was asleep.  (Laughter)  Asleep at the switch?  Yes  Good thing she   s not driving, huh?  I was about to say that. That   s how you know she   s relaxed.  Yeah. I got tickled at her here, I believe it was last Thursday, I was over  painting the fence over at the cemetery and trying to get it finished up  and the wind was blowing, so I quit. It got a little bit cool, too, and of  course the spray paint was getting all over, so it was a good time to quit.  Come back in the house and she was sitting there and says,    Boy, I sure  would like to go mow, but it is just too cold to be out there on that lawn  mower.    Hmm. Because I had a bright idea, I wanted to go to Tahlequah  and go up and down the Illinois River and see what the flood had done. I  said,    I think I   m going to take the trike and go to Tahlequah.    That little  lady jumped up off that couch, grabbed her leathers before I could even  get turned around. (Laughter)    You mean it   s not too cold to ride, but  it   s too cold to mow?       Yeah, it just won   t be a problem.    (Laughter)  I actually wanted to ask you about the cemetery. Your family is all  buried in the same cemetery close by? Is that right?  Yes. It   s just right over here, it   s the Ward Cemetery and there   s  probably six generations in there now, six or seven.  Unfortunately.  Yeah, we lost a two-year-old granddaughter last summer. That   s when  40  Nykolaiszyn  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  we really started taking an interest in getting the cemetery back up to a  good thing because no one had really taken an interest and done that  much. So they came in and have done some new fencing and cleared up  a bunch of old brush and stuff, so we   re trying to make it better than  what it was.  Well, that   s good.  Yeah, his   all the way back to Johnson Thompson, I don   t know where  he is buried, but the James Franklin on down, they   re all over there. So  it   s quite a deal to be able to go and look at those tombstones with all  those people   s names and stuff on them.  Here again, that was another one of Mother   s activities. She somehow  got elected to the secretary of the Cemetery Association. Quote unquote,  whatever that was, because there was no such thing. It was just, she got  elected to do it. So you know who got to mow it in the summertime.  You did.  Well, I had a neighbor. He and I and, of course, back then, you didn   t  have lawn mowers that amounted to anything and we   d mow it like  twice a year. My gosh, it might get up there three and a half, four foot  tall. Take those old brush cutters and push and it would take us three or  four days to get it mowed. It   s not a very big cemetery. Of course, today,  you can mow it in a couple hours with riding lawnmowers like we have.  Yeah, through the years, for some reason, it has just kind of fallen on our  family to take care of it and it looks like it   s really getting ready to now.  A storm blew through there in probably    71 or    72.  Oh, I forgot all about that.  They had big beautiful cedar trees.  Huge cedar trees.  Just phenomenal. And a storm blew through, like a little twister, tornado  type thing. Tore a bunch of those trees up, tore a bunch of the  tombstones up, you know, laid them over to where you couldn   t even  tell where they were supposed to be. So him and his uncle went in and  cleaned those trees up, cut them up, made lumber out of it and we just  kind of sat on that lumber for years and years and years. He had built a  couple cedar chests and a toy chest and stuff and a gun cabinet, things  for us here personally. When they got ready to re-do the house over  there, he took that cedar lumber and made their kitchen cabinets out of  41  D. Holcombe  G. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  D. Holcombe  Nykolaiszyn  it. So you know, we try not to waste anything and there was a big walnut  tree in the front yard that blew over.  Wind blew it over.  And so they   ve taken a lot of the lumber from that walnut tree and made  furniture and stuff and it   s there in the house. A lot of the stuff that we  took out of the house, originally, to keep people from stealing it, we   ve  taken it back and put it in the house now. So she   s got a lot of the  original things that really belong in the house. She has them over there,  using them. So trying to keep things where they need to be. Keep it all  together. Everything   s got a history to it.  Well, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day to meet with  us.  It   s been neat.  We appreciate it so much.  -------  -------
