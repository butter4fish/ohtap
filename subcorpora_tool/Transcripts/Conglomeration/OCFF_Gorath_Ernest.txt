 Finchum  Gorath  Today is March 8, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum and I am here  along with my colleague Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We are with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we are in Perry, Oklahoma to  speak with Ernest Gorath as part of our Oklahoma Centennial Farm  Families Oral History Project. So, thank you for having us today. Let   s  start by having you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you were  born, and then we will work our way forward.  I was born in that room right there, and my dad was born in this house in  1900, so we   re not much for nomads.  What year were you born?  In    42.  And where did you go to high school?  Perry High School.  And graduated when?  1960.  Brothers and sisters?  I   ve got one younger sister and one older sister. The older sister passed  away this past summer.  Once you graduated from high school, did you still stay on this land or  did you move away for a while?  No, I stayed here except for when I went on the harvest. In the fall when  5  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  I got my farming work done here, I went up to Nebraska. Then from  there, I was too young to go to work at Ditch Witch or something  because I wasn   t eighteen until fall. Then I came back and went into  seismographing locally here, a temporary job. Then, I went and worked  in an oil field in well servicing and had a good boss. If he needed me he  would just come out and get me and tell me whenever he had time. I was  single so I usually ended up driving the pulling units headed home. They  were so large. Thirty-five miles per hour was their top speed. Then,  Uncle Sam says,    Come here.    When I got done there I went to Charles  Machine Works and visited with Mr. Malzahn. He said,    When can you  go to work?    I said,    I was making forty-two dollars a month, so in the  morning would be fine.    He said,    Okay.    That was a Saturday morning,  and I spent about thirty-five years working for Ditch Witch.  So, you went into the service? Is that why you said Uncle Sam called?  Right.  What were your years of service?  I couldn   t tell you. (Laughs)  Which branch, then?  It was National Guard. And I spent six years there.  Okay, we can roughly figure that out. What was your job at Ditch  Witch?  Twenty-seven years in the sheer and punch department as a lead man,  there. Then later, because of health reasons, I went to different areas.  With my back, arthritis, and hands, the shakes in my hands, it was hard  to do a lot of jobs. The doctor told me that I could stay there and grab  my wheelchair or I could walk out now. So, I went one more year and  left it there.  During all those years you were at Ditch Witch, were you also farming?  Yes.  Let   s back up then and talk a little bit about how this land came to be in  your family to begin with.  There were four sisters that moved down here, and their dad bought  four-quarters together here. How that came about was one of the sisters  married a real estate agent here, in Perry, and was able to locate the  6  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  property. Two years ago, we went up and located where Holyrood,  Kansas was, and located their farm and happened to stop at the church to  start with. They had their hundred-something anniversary brochure, and  it had all the weddings, births, and deaths all in that brochure, so that  was very interesting. As we were eating dinner at a small filling station  and eating place, asking around, they told us where the farm was. We  went there, and we went and visited with somebody that was coming in.  We asked about it, and they said,    Well, where I worked that day is from  the Stoltenberg family.    She gave us another person that was older, and  then they sent us to the county seat and the historical society. So, that  was a very interesting background of where we came from, where our  ancestors came from.  A very fruitful trip.  Right.  So, of these four sisters, was one an aunt or grandmother, from your  lineage?  It would be my great-aunt.  Great-aunt, okay. So, how did you come to have it?  That was my life. (Laughs)  How did you take ownership? What was the path to you having it?  Oh, okay. Granddad got it in 1900, and then my dad bought it in    40, and  I bought it in    76. We were living in town there, but I was out here every  morning and night. My dad, we traded places there. He had never been  off this place much so he went to the house in town. I had just doubled it  and Mom decided that she was going to be there, that she was going to  tell him how it was going to be, and where it was going to be. So, that  worked well but then Daddy, every day he came out here to the farm to  put in time he would fix dinner for them out here. In    80-something, he  finally decided that was enough because the more he worked at  something, the more he would tear up. (Laughter) He finally gave up  there.  Were your siblings not interested in having it?  No, one was in Midwest City and the other in Watonga, but they won   t  turn loose of all the property. I   ve been trying to buy it and give it to my  kids so it would be there. Both sets said,    Nope, we   re going to keep it  in our families.    It   s hard to rent with multiple owners of the same  7  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  property. So, I   ve been cash renting it from them, and the house in town  that we still have. So, just another job to take care of for renters.  Well, when your granddad had it, what kinds of crops did he have? Do  you know?  He raised basically cotton, corn, oats, and everything was basically what  they needed for their milk cows, the chickens, and the geese. The geese  were there because you needed the downing feathers for their bedding,  for your pillows. It is a real nice thing to crawl under a good downing  blanket to keep warm. My grandmother was still living here when we  were kids. I had my bed under the west window upstairs, my sisters had  the east upstairs room, and my folks were in the same room I was. You  could lie in bed and count the stars because it was an unfinished attic.  Later on, when I put a different roof on the south side, I put felt paper in  there so you didn   t have to look at the stars.  Got pretty cold in the wintertime, then?  Yes, it didn   t take you long to get dressed in the mornings. (Laughter)  We never kept fires in the house at night.  At all?  No. But you   d drain your  cistern . We had the porch over here, the east  porch has a cistern under it, and you   d always pull your plug so it  wouldn   t freeze. You would eject your water and prime it again.  Otherwise, you   d be outside and use your cistern to get your fresh water.  You couldn   t keep the water in the house because it would freeze.  Do you remember when you got electricity?  I think it was in    49 or    50, in that area. We started out with coal for a  heating element and then the folks had a carbide gas plant across the  driveway, and it piped in. There were carbide lights in the house. It was  in three-quarter-inch pipe. I took it up whenever we put siding up and  stuff like that, and paneled the upstairs and put carpet up there. I took the  pipes up then. Then we went to kerosene, to kerosene lamps and  kerosene to cook. I   ve still got the oven that would sit on the woodstove.  I   ve still got it. When you get up early in the morning and milk and then  whenever   had the cream separator on our porch. Then you   d have to  separate the cream and the calves, they got the milk, and the cream went  down in the cellar. Mostly now we use wood. For a few years we had a  well on the hill and had natural gas. I had natural gas in the barn for the  kids    hogs, and we are still using wood in the house. Somebody didn   t  like it, but finally we got gas in the house.  8  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Well, back in the early days, I guess you had an outhouse?  We still have it, yes. It   s a three-holer. Everybody says,    A three-holer?      It was a family deal; we had get-togethers, the women all went  there at the same time. But those were fun days, too. Halloween, the kids  had fun going around and moving people   s outhouses. So, Daddy and I  one day, we just slid the outhouse back a few feet. That ended our  neighbors playing with our outhouse. (Laughter)  The problem we always had was tornadoes. This has been hit several  times. We were hit in March and then May 5, and then December 2.  That one year we had the ice storm large OG E lines went down, and  they used our field out here to replace twelve miles of wiring and used a  helicopter. On top of the hill, the ground was wet then, and put the  electric pole together with a helicopter. It was so heavy they   d take the  fuel out, just what they needed, and a man sat underneath there with an  air compressor. He put a couple bolts in, they would go down and get  another part, and it was interesting to watch.  It was entertaining, too. Did you help move some of these outhouses  yourself?  No, I was in the wrong age of that group. The neighborhood was always  really close and still is. We have the four neighbors here. Usually on  Friday nights, a lot of times we would go from house to house playing  dominoes and pitch. It   s always been a real close-knit neighborhood.  When we were kids, we went to the Lutheran school, and one time we  had one neighbor in the Catholic school, so we had a car full of young  kids. Some of the older ones in high school would be our escort to  school. But roads were nothing then. If it was wet, they   d wench the  school bus up some of these hills, a little bit at a time, and if we got to  school by eleven o   clock, we thought we were at school early.  Really? How long would you stay, then?  Like everybody else, we would go home when the buses were released.  How far was the elementary school from here?  The Lutheran school   s at the north end of Perry. We went to Perry  School. Then there is a high school. My sister went in junior high, so the  whole family and neighborhood, we all switched to Perry School, then.  Once your father took over the farm, what would he grow and produce?  9  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  They just started with tractors, then. We still had our horses there, and  the milo was cut by hand, and we threw it into a wagon. The horses  would stand there and you can see on this picture here, where the board  they threw it up against would fall so you wouldn   t throw it over and  have to go to the other side and pick it up. You were trying to get as  much feed cut as you could in a day. Most of the feed there (milo) was  long heads. We   d take it for the hens and take hog wire and make little  pens for them so the chickens would just eat out of the milo out of the  wire.  Later on, they went into selling and hatching eggs. That was a lot of  work because we had a couple of brooder houses by the house here.  When they got a certain size we would put them in a rain shelter to keep  them away from the older hens and roosters. They had to be tested quite  a bit. Then whenever we   d get a new batch in August, we would sell the  old hens and bring the young ones in and clean and sterilize all the  chicken barns. In the    50s, they doubled the size of the chicken barn. It  started out with five hundred chicks, basically. The roosters, a high  percent was sold as broilers at three pounds to people in town. That was  a good Saturday.  The job was hauling manure out of the chicken house, the strong  ammonium. Then every night, cleaning the barn out, the manure there. I  did the feeding, my little sister took care of the chickens, and my older  sister did the milking. We had a milk machine that was gas operated  until we got electricity, and then that was the easiest job or best job  because it was inside, out of the cold. The cow   s heat was nice to work  with.  That   s a lot of chickens. Did you have to kill them yourself?  Yes.  Did you have a method?  We called it    The Chain Gang.    It was, you   d get six at a time, and I  usually got the job of chopping their heads off. The night before you   d  put them in little cages and then as needed, you   d boil them, or dip them  in hot water. My mom and sisters would be pulling the feathers, and then  water time. So, I had time in between that, I   d be putting them on the  stove and rotating them to burn their pin feathers out.  Singe them.  And then we   d get another bunch together.  10  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  An all-day deal?  It was an all-day deal between milking and chores and feeding. To have  water out there, we made a sled and put fifty-five gallon drums on it,  then pumped it by hand into the fifty-five gallon drums. Then they had  the floats on the bottom with a pan with a rock so if they stepped on it,  they wouldn   t dump it. But the problem was coyotes, they liked chickens  too. They would run where the milk cows were because they didn   t  bother them. So, they would have the chicken over their shoulders and  go to the milk cows, and then they would stop and eat their chickens.  That was our biggest hang up of having them out there in the fields.  Did you do eggs too, then?  Yes, that was during the season for hatching them. We got a little scale  and you had sand paper on a sponge. You would clean them all up and  weigh them. Each egg case would have different size eggs on them,  thirty dozen eggs to a case. That was the deal there. The problem with  those was we had White Rock chickens and roosters. They ate about as  much as a big turkey because they were a large variety of chickens. A lot  of the neighbors just had Leghorns. They were a little bigger than a  pigeon and didn   t eat near as much. But our demand for our boilers was  where we made our money at, cash flow. So, that is why we had the  White Rocks, for people to buy the boilers from town.  From Perry?  Yes.  Your dad did that. And then when it became yours, what was your  product?  Anything and everything that was different. (Laughter) I always liked  hogs. We had a Milking Shorthorn, which is a dual purpose milk cow  and beef. When Simmental cattle came along, I went into AI   ing   artificial insemination  Simmentals and ended up with a lot of good  show cattle. In performance in four years, I either had the champion or  the reserve champion performance steer in the Oklahoma City spring  stock show. I had quite a few grand champion reserves in different  counties. I thought I was doing good, but the good Lord took my pride  away and I ended up with brucellosis and had to sell about everything  we had. So, I never got started back into the Simmentals but started with  Angus.  Now, I try to get the high indexing bulls, and there are people that do the  weight gain. I   ve tried to get bulls that are close to 1400 pound yearling  11  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  weights and fourteen inch rib eye   thirteen, fourteen inch rib eye. I  wanted the weaning weight to be that because I keep them in the calves  back usually for a while, try to give them forty-five to sixty days  because Oklahoma quality beef that they have out there, you give them  so many shots and different timing, and need to be weaned at a  minimum of forty-five days. So, that way when the people buy them,  they know they have their black leg shots and respiratory shots so that  when they got them the calves will take out and grow, instead of run  around the pens and bawl, stir up dust, and get pneumonia. They are  willing to pay extra to buy the quality calves.  A lot of record-keeping then, it sounds like.  Yes.  Keeping up with dates and     They had the county agent or somebody ask them to come and verify,  take your numbers off your medicine containers.  Do you do all that by hand or on computer these days?  I don   t have a computer.  So, by hand. How many head are we talking about?  My daughter and I work together. They   ve got their own property and  they rent some too. But right at a hundred pair is what we work with.  When you were showing your cattle would you start with the county  fair?  Yes. When I was a kid we only went to  country shows . In fact, my dad,  I don   t think he has ever watched me show.  You were in 4-H it looks like, or FFA  Future Farmers of America ?  I was in 4-H and then in FFA. I showed grain, chickens, hogs, and  usually six or seven Milking Shorthorns. It depends on the age groups  because you could show them in one class, and then you can show them  produce a dam, which means two calves from the same cow. You could  get a sire, so you could show three animals in a class or get a sire. That  was big money back then.  Were your kids involved in 4-H?  12  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Yes, but the problem was Daddy pushed too much on them and then  later on, they had twenty-some sows. So, washing the crates down every  night when they were in there, the barn would only hold about twelve  sows at a time. We would rotate because when we sell show pigs, they  have different breeds, and I   d AI mostly myself. There were jackpot  shows, so people always wanted different ages of pigs and it worked out  good. I took the stanchions out of the barn and put crates with tender  foot. We had cameras and I would monitor off the kitchen sink.  Grandma, she got the job of going down and delivering because she  didn   t have a job and the kids were going to school and I was at Ditch  Witch, so that was her job.  Farming is a family affair isn   t it?  Right.  Do what needs to be done, as it comes down the pike.  But after awhile, it was an advantage. She had a large gas heater in the  barn where it was controlled heat. We just had wood to burn in the  house. I   d have to get up and throw it in the woodstove in between. The  kids did good. In high school, I wouldn   t let them show during the week.  They had the breeding stock of hogs in the first weekend at Tulsa. Then  the second weekend was the Simmentals, the breeding stock there. So,  they got two weekends but that was a lot of working. I think four years  in that area I think, my son showed at American Royal in Kansas City.  That   s pretty good.  That was quite a trip because that was the same time we were having  baby pigs. We were making sure they had all their automatic waterers  going and stuff like that.  Did they go to Roundup at OSU at any point?  My daughter did. I don   t remember if my son did or not. But what was  interesting, my daughter she was in 4-H. She won the 4-H part and then  she was a high individual for the whole county. That was just her daddy  teaching her, and beat her brother that had the Ag teacher. Then a few  years ago, her older son did the same thing. She was the livestock trainer  for the 4-H kids here in Perry. The oldest son, he won 4-H in high for  the whole county. She was really tickled about that, too.  Farming is in the blood. Good instruction, too.  Yes, when she moved away, that took me. I said,    Well, what   s the  13  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  matter with you?    I said,    Someone took my right hand off.    They  moved up there. She is running a feed lot in Phillipsburg, Kansas. Her  husband works for a co-op spraying, and things like that. I told them that  either I have to sell out or you come home and take care of your daddy,  and she did that. So, you can   t knock that. That was a blessing, but  Monday she went back to work at Ditch Witch and her husband works at  Whitworth Construction as a mechanic. He never knows where he   s  going to be at, it might be Arkansas, Texas, Kansas, or Oklahoma.  Whenever a crane, or scraper, or a cat   s broke down he gets a phone call  or radioed and that   s where he goes. It   s a challenge for her to take care  of the boys, farming, take care of Daddy. She does my baling mechanic  work because I can   t turn my body and ride that way. My little grandson  I guess   I think he   s fourteen now   he   s going to get to learn to do that.  He worked for a guy last summer and got a lot of experience.  Wanting to drive a tractor, he won   t complain too much, will he?  Oh, he   s been on tractors since he was eight or nine years old. He   s the  one that was using the old two-lunger  two-cylinder  John Deere to stack  bales. He was a lot neater at it than I was. I   m hit and go and he had to  have his rows straight. But it was helpful to have somebody there to  stack bales. It sure saved me a lot of other hires.  Sure.  And it   s easier on equipment when you go slow instead of going boom,  boom, boom.  So, in total, how many of the acres do you and your daughter farm?  I   ve got around 700 and she   s got a 180, I think.  That   s a lot.  And then we do some baling on shares to boot. One year, I had rented  two other places, there. She said,    No more, Daddy.    The boys were in  baseball and she would stop to watch the ballgame. She didn   t clean up  or anything and get off to the baler, go in, watch it, then go back go to  baling. She didn   t have but the one big tractor so I would swath in the  mornings and she would bale it at night because she was a night person,  and I am a morning person. That worked out pretty good for us, there.  Now, we just keep her tractor hooked up to the baler all the time; one for  raking and one for swathing.  I noticed when we were pulling in, those aren   t cows that we saw. You  want to talk a little bit about the other critters?  14  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Well, that is an interesting deal, there. Mrs. Malzahn that owns the Ditch  Witch Charles Machine Works, and has the Charolais, she loves  animals. She called me one day up at the shop and said,    Ernie, I   m  going to Germany in the morning and I just hatched out some baby  emus.    I said,    Some what?    She said,    Some baby emus.    I said,    I  don   t have any place for them right now.    She said,    Well, they   re under  my kitchen sink. Get the farm manager as soon as you can and get them  out.    So, I bought emus and got into the emu business.  Then I bought some ostriches and the doctor told me to get rid of them  after a few years because you don   t have working chutes for them. You  just bear hug them and the ostriches, they love to be under a sprinkler  system and this red clay gets to their wings and hangs down. So, you   ve  got to wrap the large birds around with duct tape to keep their wings up.  It   s a good challenge job. My neighbors    dogs took care of those. They  just ran them back and forth against the metal fences until they beat  themselves to death. We got out of that business before they crashed, so  the doctor made a good comment that particular time.  Now, when I got rid of them, I bought some European red deer. I was up  in northern Missouri and my wife said,    What are you doing?    I said,     I   m buying elk.       You   re doing what?    So, the operator up there, I  talked him into buying my red deer and they delivered my elk down  here. That was the starting of a new game again. They can be  challenging too, but I take them out to the field. When I had a lot of  extra rye, I wouldn   t have to buy feed for them. I put them out there two  hours and I   m always singing. So, as I was going out there to another  field, I would be singing and have thirty elk cows following me out  there. Then I would go out and bring them back, but they   re like milk  cows, you go over there and hit them on the butt, then go over there and  get that. Unless one of them would be cycling, then you leave the bull  elk and cow alone and they would come in. I had one time with either  me or the grandkids left the gate open and I had to go to a town five  miles away to bring my cows home, so that   s a lot of singing. (Laughter)  And what would you sing?  Oh, all my life we never had a radio much, and so unless it was a  Saturday night with the wind charger here and the battery   that was our  radio system, basically, until later years. Anyway, the veterinarian at the  Y  on 64 Highway  called,    Are you missing an elk?    I said,    Yes, one  cow.    I tried to find somebody with a tranquilizer and the one the  dogcatcher said he just had one for dogs. I said,    No.    So, I just got a  bucket of feed and the guy has a sale barn. It happened to be a sale  day   he was a friend of ours   so I just went up there and rattled the  15  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  bucket, put it in a pen, and here come some guys from the city, and there  goes my elk. So I asked them to leave. I caught her, went home and got  the stock trailer, put her in it, and brought her home.  The reason I didn   t want the tranquilizer is because I had the neighbor  lady   she   s a veterinarian   and she AI   ed several for me at different  times. I used most of my neighbor ladies, and they are seventy and  above, and they   re quiet. Her brother, the game ranger, helps sometimes  and her dad, he   s large so he uses a gate to swing it in. The first time we  did it, I didn   t have my latch on my chute designed right and the cow,  when she kicked the deal, it broke my leg. I went ahead and   I don   t let  anybody in with my elk   so, I went ahead and finished it because we  already synchronized them twice and that was the time to AI them. At  the price of the semen, I get the best bull I could get from the United  States and Canada on their test, on the size of their racks. So, I wasn   t  going to stop.  So, there are challenges in life but so far, I only had to pull one baby  calf. Did you ever try to get a mamma elk cow up when she has her  problem? (Laughter) That   s the same way whenever I sell bulls. They  say,    Do you ever tranquilize them?    I say,    No, I   ll just get a bucket  and I   ll bring them in a quarter of a mile.    As you   re walking along with  the bucket, you   ve got ten bulls running back and forth trying to get into  the bucket. The old bull, he   s still in control, so he gets to go into the  first gate. Then, the others go in the lot.  There   s a pecking order?  There is a pecking order, right. Most of my cows, if they don   t eat out of  my hands, they don   t stay. I like things that are gentle and big. It   s  something I really enjoy, but I had up to seventy head. About two years  ago, we had to buy hay, buy feed, and buy water so I had to sell some  bovine and some elk. I   m just starting back up again. Everything I   ve  got, except one old bull here, I   ve raised.  How many elk do you have today?  I think there are thirty right now, counting the younger ones.  Where do you take those for market?  Sell them here at the house. The elk and deer   they have this Oklahoma  Livestock and whenever you register your animals, they come up and  get your license and the state veterinary comes down and checks your  facilities, and your fences, water gaps, and things like that, and your  gates need to be locked. I was in the  chronic  wasting disease program  16  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  to make sure they test every year, and then they changed the tags to little  bitty brucellosis metal tags, and I wasn   t going to have anybody trying to  clean them off to where you can read them with the bulls with the large  racks because they can just wipe anybody out. That is the reason I  dropped being in that program. Two weeks ago, the gentleman, the state  veterinarian was out here and through it, did all the paperwork  necessary.  Then when you sell them, the person comes here to get it or     Yes. It   s an interesting game. Sometimes you get somebody you don   t  want to because like I said, they   re all pets and they don   t treat them like  I do. So, I   m unhappy sometimes, with who gets them and probably go  out there, stick them with some black jacks and let somebody shoot  them. When they leave their area, they go back to their wild nature  pretty fast. So, I guess that   s what their struggle for life is, their instincts.  When I feed them, if I change to a different jacket in the wintertime,  they stay back. It   s unbelievable the instincts that they have on colors  and stuff like that. They   ve got the oil well up there, they just go right  between the people there, and they don   t care. Whenever they were  changing the OG E line out here, they were in the same field and they  were right in that equipment. It didn   t bother them a bit because they  were used to machinery when they were young. I   d put them in the yard  so they would get used to different machinery and sights and sounds and  things like that. That way, they   re not so jumpy when you need to   but  when you get them in a tight, they will fight. (Laughs)  And you sing to them.  Well, you   re going to have to sing for us.  No. (Laughter)  Just a little bit?  I spent years  singing at the nursing home  and I still do it now, down  there somewhere, where they called it    Ernie and Friends.    I started, I  don   t know, when Mom was in a nursing home with some other people  and then I started out with older people and I sang with them. Like  Ashley Alexander that used to be the entertainment director for OSU,  and now his wife does on Fridays during her noon hour, she plays there  for about an hour. There are twelve to fifteen people that come and join  in. A lot of it was when their parents were in the nursing home,    Can we  sing with you? Can we sing with you?    So, those people are a lot more  dependable, older people are. I enjoy it. I used to sing at Billings  Fairchild Center, it   s for people that are slower. But I   ve got to have my  17  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  music in front of me and those people there, they know all the songs by  memory. It makes you feel like a fool there, that I   m outside and they  are inside. They really enjoy that and appreciate that. The song you got  to sing every time,    I Fly Away,    they   re out there flopping their wings,  going around in circles there.  Will you sing that one for us?  I   ll pass on that. (Laughter) My daughter asked me to sing solo for her  wedding and that was challenging enough.  All right. You mentioned county agents earlier. Did they come to the  farm when you were in high school, or do you remember the first time  that you had any interaction with a county agent?  Yes, that was basically to buy baby pigs then, because my dad didn   t  know anything about it. He had his game   there was a generation  difference between us. I had my ideas and he had his ideas, so that was  always a challenge. One of our county agents at the fairgrounds this  spring stock show we honored   we call it, recognized him, dedicated  the show to him this spring. Jay Hesser, and he lived south of Stillwater,  but I think he   s down in Edmond right now. His kids came and received  the dedication for that.  We had two Ag teachers all the time, so that was helpful in the  afternoons. My senior year, I had my classes in the morning and after  dinner was Ag, then I had study hall and then gym. So, I always got my  Ag teacher to let me go all afternoon in the Ag building and do welding  or build feeders and things like that there. That   s why I said that   s just  my livelihood. Flowers, animals, anything different.  I used to have a large garden but with my back and hands I had to quit  that. But I   ve got to have my lettuce, leaf lettuce, and my tomatoes. My  stomach is not supposed to have it. I had a large blackberry patch. I  would pick them, and she would call somebody to come by and pick  them up every day. Strawberries were the same way, I think, with seeds  a no-no. My favorite thing is Snickers  candy bar . Snickers killed me;  that   s the reason I have to wear overalls. I can   t have anything tight on  my tummy. Whatever I raise is always a no-no is seems like.  Well, each time you started something new, like with your emus and  your ostriches, how did you learn how to take care of them and all of  that?  Yes, we had an association of different people from northern Oklahoma  and southern Kansas. They would just get speakers each time and two  18  girls   I think they were up from Blackwell   they wrote the Emu  Journal. So, they went around the country getting information. There  was a veterinarian in Perkins and he would give seminars on, and the  main thing, like ostriches and emus, there was iodine. Iodine, if your  hands aren   t red, you   re not taking care of your birds and eggs right  because disinfecting is the main thing. If you try to hatch them out, like  the emus, every night at around six o   clock they lay their eggs and cover  them up and it looks like a bunny rabbit   s little nest. That is basically the  way they would do theirs.  Each emu had their particular time that you could go pick up their eggs.  You had to have a special incubator for each one because the pores of  the egg were different, so how many hens you had, that   s how many  incubators you had to have. Then I had a large incubator that I put in an  old hen house and I put my ostrich eggs in there, ducks and stuff like  that and that there. But my daughter, she says,    Daddy, I want to have  something nicer.    I went around and bought paneling that was good  paneling, but the corner was cracked or something like that there, so it   s  all different colors. I got a commode, hot water tank, heater, air  conditioner, sink, and everything in that part of the hen house.  My daughter, for my birthday, made me a deal, a sign with cloth around  the outside and it had a picture of the ostrich she made with the head  sticking out of the ground and it says,    Daddy   s        .    Anyway, it  was something about daddy   s birds. Later on, she put a sign on the porch  out there that says,    Welcome to the funny farm.    (Laughter) That was  the cat, Garfield the cat and that stayed there for years and years until  finally, it wore out. She was the one to always have to help me load up  the ostriches or emus, and work with the elk. She says,    Daddy, can   t  you buy anything that   s not dangerous?    (Laughter) Now, it   s her family  that gets to help.  When you   re giving shots to the elk, they can turn their head around 360  degrees in a squeeze. I made a large one that has holes in it, where you  can open the side and work on their legs. I went to the hospital and got  those egg-looking cushions for beds, and put on the sides of it. A  tornado tore a brand new trampoline up, so I took it and wrapped it with  it, and then put it on the sides. They don   t look out because it   s dark. But  that was too bulky for AI   ing and stuff on the cows, so I ended up with a  small one that you squeeze. That opened on each end, so if you have to  pull a baby, no matter which way the cows go in, you just lift that out  and it   s insulated well, so if they kick they don   t hurt anybody or  themselves. I   ve got a hole in it where I can   I bear hug the neck and  then let the son-in-law or somebody else that   s fast give them their shots  and tags in their ears, things like that.  19  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  And you designed this yourself?  Yes. It took a few changes from what I had but it works great. The  neighbor lady (the mother of the veterinarian that does my AI   ing) she  would get everything lined up and I would hand it to her, so it wouldn   t  take very long to AI, with the facilities made right. We   ve got a lane and  you just start swinging gates behind because when you   re loading that  bull you don   t want him to get a very fast run because he   s going to hit  something on the other end. So, I made deals that are solid metal so they  can   t see through. Then we   ve got the green sunshades on some of the  gates that are just strips so they can   t see through it. Anyway, metal and  welding, that   s what I   ve done all my life, anything.  Sound like it has come in handy.  Yes. My house in town, the rafters and ceiling and everything was metal  and channel iron. We built a large garage in town   a large double  garage   and it was basically all metal. My machine shed out here is all  Ditch Witch metal. My large eighty-four by seventy-two square bale  shed, it   s all metal. I built an eighty by eighty shed a few years ago and  it   s all Ditch Witch metal, except the posts, and it   s drilling stem   drill  stem, real heavy. I   ve always got to have everything inside. My folks     car just had 14,000 miles on it, the garage, I was working on it, so I put  it in my round bale shed. I should have better judgment, but during the  rain, the catalytic converter set on fire and our telephone is hooked to  electricity so, I had to go to the neighbors to call the fire department. I  called four fire departments to be here because with the heat and the  wind changed or something like that there.  I worked with the Noble County First Responders and we have a  meeting at the first Thursday of every month. So, everybody works  together on fires and stuff like that there. It cost me more to rebuild the  center of it because it burned for over a week because of the hay being  compact with no air. I was taking the front end loader, taking the hay,  and putting it in water holes and terraces there to try and get it down as  soon as I can because I didn   t want the wind to set the rest of the place  on fire. But the good Lord takes care of me.  That   s a lot to think about, isn   t it? Just the whole day-to-day, probably  no day is the same?  No day is the same, hardly. Except my daughter bought some acreage  across here so, we don   t have to go to Red Rock for her to feed her cows  in the wintertime there. That   s been a blessing there. We just hauled the  hay across the road here. If she was busy, I would take one of the  tractors there and take hay to them. I built a fence all out of bois d   arc.  20  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  The person that had it before, since    70, he had never been on the  backside of the place. So, as the trees grew up, the bois d   arcs  bodark   grew straight. Bois d   arc is usually real crooked and so all the fence I put  in is out of bois d   arc and it   ll be there a long time. My neighbor lady  says that it looks like an Arkansawyer lives here with all the crooked  posts. (Laughter) But I said,    It   ll outlast the others.    I started out with  cedar trees because I had a place with a lot of cedar trees that needed to  be cleaned up. My doctors both   I have two   both of them say,    When  are you going to quit? Your body can   t take this anymore.    But I said,     Well, when they throw dirt on my face, I guess I   ll have to quit then.     I   m wound too tight for that.  How many ponds are there on the property?  Just three here. But one, we fixed it in    52. Daddy traded out when the  neighbors went together   the five of them   and bought a silage cutter,  because most of it was milking. We did the plowing for the guy and he  built the pond. We put a pipe in the bottom of it and shot the level of the  water to where it was supposed to be to the porch here, so it flows down.  When I was working at Ditch Witch there, I got one of the engineers that  just came up with the first backhoe to come out because some of that  rock is hard. We tore it up pretty good and he said,    That   s what we   re  out here for, is just to write down what broke and what kind of pressure  is on, and stuff like that.    We ran it all in one solid deal.  There is a sediment basement, then there is a filtering system, then there  is a six by six place that holds the water, and then we put a filtering   it   s  the chemical, Clorox   in a large crock with a deal. The water goes by so  much, and the Clorox mixes with the water when it goes through. Then  later on, the neighbors wanted the water system to come here but it  needed so many to bring it this far. We used it for the livestock and the  flowers and stuff like that. The drinking water is from the Moore Water  System, I guess they changed the name to Noble County No. 2.  Do you know if they did any terracing?  Yes, Daddy has a picture here somewhere. In    26, they took a picture  behind a hill. We have a terracing machine, a horse operated terracing  machine. I   ve still got it. We used it on the tractor after awhile. It has a  picture of him terracing that long ago because the ground is so steep in  that field. Sixteen foot header you had on both sides, and you   re not  cutting in the channel, so I think that   s what is pretty steep ground.  That   s the reason I put everything to Marshall rye. I quit the wheat and  put everything to Marshall rye, disk it in and on most years you can  work it in smooth to bale it. It comes in if it   s on its own and I fertilize it  and I   m pasturing it now. At the end of March, I   ll be putting some more  21  Finchum  Gorath  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  fertilizer on it for the hay part of it. The main purpose was I used to bale  on shares everywhere and then you spent all winter hauling hay home.  Then I made a bale wagon and it holds twelve bales, so it   s easier now  moving bales with a front end loader.  And you made it, too?  Sure. Hammer, mill, grinder, mixer.  Can you tell us a little bit about the structures that you remember on the  property as a little boy growing up, versus what you have on the  property now?  Almost everything has been changed except the granary, and we put tin  on it so I would have to quit painting. The barn was the same way there,  that painted it off a ladder and that lasted about three or four years to  keep the wood in good shape. The last time we used hydraulic  scaffolding that Ditch Witch made (it   s called Sky Witch). Mom would  sit there and hold the button and my wife would mix the paint and use an  airless gun, and just up one side and down. We painted the barn, the  house, and the granary in one day. That   s a lot of work all the time, so I  decided to put tin on it when the kids had the hogs. I put insulation  inside, six inch insulation in the barn and put plywood over that. I   ve got  hot water tanks with your white enamel on it and nailed it on so you can  wash it down easy. It gives strength to the barn and helps maintain the  barn. It   s been knocked off its foundation a couple times. We had to jack  it up and put cables crisscrossed in there to hold it up.  The other day when the state veterinarian was here, he was looking at it  and there are no knots on the sills that run twenty-four feet across there.  They are two by tens and he said,    What would it cost today?    I said,     Well, you couldn   t even buy wood that doesn   t have knots today on  two by tens.    The quality material and whenever   on the foundation   it  was sand rock out of the pasture over there, but whatever was on top of  the ground, it was at least twice that much under the ground because  there was erosion and things like that there. Every once in a while, we  take the dirt and haul it back against the foundation to make sure that  they don   t fold out on us.  I had an experience several years ago, my little grandson we were taking  care of and I had a truck backed up with a ladder leaning up there. I took  some ropes and a string and threw it over the top of the barn and tied the  lariat to the back of the pickup. I was up there working on the vent,  changing the wood out and putting aluminum rise material vents, bolting  it up there. I turned around and that three-year-old grandson went up the  ladder and got hold of that rope. He was standing behind me. You can  22  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  see that point, it   s pretty tall. The good Lord and I, we have to work  pretty close there. (Laughter) It says,    Don   t tempt the Lord,    but I use a  lot of angels to take care of me.  Where would they have gotten the lumber, if it was that high of a  quality? Where would they have had to go to get it?  Off the rail. It would have to be off the rail.  I forget that Perry had a good railroad system, didn   t it?  And it was right next to the cotton gin, so the cotton gin had a large  platform to unload the machinery. In    55 or    56, when it was so dry and  we were milking, the neighbors went together and Farmer   s Union  bought several carloads of alfalfa from Minnesota. It wasn   t all that  good, but it was something for the cows to eat. It was an experience  getting in there and hauling hay and storing it back here, but to see what  kind of quality of feed somebody across the country would send you.  That was the thing, we got to see. I think there are seventeen trains a day  that go through Perry. You   ve got the Santa Fe and the Frisco, so we   ve  got from Tulsa going west and from Ponca City, south. Highway 64 gets  shutdown considerably so, when you plan on going to town, you   ve got  to give it a little time.  As a kid, how often would you go to town?  When you went to school, when you went to church, and the youth  group on a Sunday night, and that was it. I think, when I was in harvest,  the first time I got a haircut commercially, and the only time I ever  remember being in a restaurant was the Comeback on the north side.  Eddie Parker, that started it, the kids on the stock show, he gave us a free  ticket. So, we walked from the fairgrounds up there to the north side.  That was the first time I ever ate in a restaurant.  Did you visit the Carnegie Library very often?  Maybe twice. (Laughs)  We always have to ask, as librarians. It   s a pretty building.  I think there are only two Carnegies left in Oklahoma.  There   s not very many.  But the school, they had their library. And the Lutheran school had their  library. So, that was all we needed then.  23  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  We need to talk a little bit about your part in county fairs over the years.  Well, I missed one since I was nine years old, in the spring stock show,  and that   s when I was with Uncle Sam. I missed the stock show then.  Most every year I went because I had sold show pigs or calves, heifers,  and then when the kids participated, and now the grandkids. I was vice  president or president for twenty-some years when I finally gave up. I  ended up before it was over with, all of a sudden my back hurt and it  was the shingles. I was popping pills, popping pills, and I decided that  was enough.  What would the president of a fair have to do? Organize it, or be the  problem solver for the day, or what?  Any time something was wrong, if there was electric or problems here,  there, yonder, women   s building, or just making sure that the judges  were there on time, which a lot of times they weren   t because they   d  forget about the Oklahoma City shows open at the same time. We had  one night it was like nine or ten o   clock, the judge was up in Kay  County and thought it was going to be short. Then the kids    animals  were so restless and we weighed them, the top three, and then that  caused a ruckus because some of them gave them a drink in between and  got weighed out. It was just daily walking through from the poultry barn,  the rabbits, the sheep, and I fought for years at keeping the goats out,  and especially in the premium sale. At that time, it didn   t take very much  money to buy or feed a goat in comparison with somebody that had a  steer or a heifer. The price they had to pay there and the amount of feed,  and that was my biggest objection there, where they would get pretty  close to the same as the large animals and the training isn   t near as it is  breaking steers and heifers.  One thing I started was   the kids didn   t want to show heifers, they  wanted to show steers. I said,    No, we just don   t have that kind of time  to have to put in and go to other shows trying to justify the feed and  buying the animals.    So, I got with different breeders and we started our  heifer show. Now, it   s basically a heifer show. Several years ago, Mrs.  Malzahn   we   d been really good friends   and she wanted a heifer and  steer show. She handed me a check and said,    This is to get your  literature out and your judge, and whatever you need to get it going.  Whatever you need after that let me know.    She said,    You can use the  equipment around here,    the large dump trucks, the big Caterpillar  frontend loaders, and then the smaller trenchers that have buckets on  them to clean up the straw and stuff afterwards, there. So, I think three  years that I was FFA Alumni President we had it. When I dropped off of  that, then it dropped. But being an Alumni President, we had speech  24  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  contests and things like that for the kids and had all the kids participate  that were in FFA. That way, the ones that wanted to go on to other  speech contests they would have to practice in front of the person being  judged so, that was a help then.  Everett Chafin was real strong on parliamentary procedure and speeches.  So, that was a good way to get the kids, all the kids, involved a little bit.  They dropped that too, and several things that I started that they dropped  after that. There are a lot of things in life that I learned, and so that   s the  reason I thought they would be good things to have there.  They   ll be recruiting you to go back.  They are in a whole different ballpark now. They   ve got a whole  different generation, completely. (Laughs)  You just go around putting out fires, basically then, during the fair time.  Yes, basically. Well, the last couple years, the manager we had   he was  the president before   and we were trying to get our tax money for our  fairgrounds because one year, the county didn   t have any money and  they wouldn   t give us any. So, we just unloaded animals, and showed  them, and loaded them back up. So, we got our heads together and went  and got us a quarter-cent tax for the Extension office in the fairgrounds  and divided that. Then three years later, we went back and changed the  balance of the money because they didn   t need it as much as what we  needed to maintain and to put buildings back in shape like they needed  to be. It was going down to nothing so, a few years ago we had the  property that if we didn   t have a show, it went back to the owner. So, I  didn   t have enough money saved up in our account and I went and  visited with the person. I told him I just needed a couple thousand  dollars and he said,    You   re doing a good job down there. So, when  you   re ready, I   ll get the check and write it to you.    The county clerk, he  then purchased the land for us. Now we can do what we want to but we  only had the top eighteen inches.  At that particular time, when I was up there, there were the different fire  departments, eight of them in a county. They had to pressure test their  trucks. Instead of going out to the lake or something like that there, I  was going to make a reservoir there and a water hydrant so they could  test their trucks there all at one time. The people in charge were there to  check it out and that   s why I started looking around and finding out that  we didn   t have the right to do anything eighteen inches under the  ground. It was just another thing that   now, we   ve got the fire   in the     50s, the fairgrounds had burnt down. When Carlisle had that pony farm,  out southwest of town we had our spring stock show, out there. When  25  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  they built a new building, they donated a show arena area, the family  did. So, we are really fortunate so have a lot of jackpot shows and stuff  like that.  So, FHA and FFA are still quite popular in this county then?  FHA, I   m not that sure of. But they   ve got so many other sports and  band is really strong here. The contest they go to there. So, that takes a  lot of man hours, too. That   s like my little grandson, his kids there, he  wanted to show a heifer and a steer, and be on the wrestling team.  Monday was Cub Scouts, Tuesday was 4-H, Wednesday was church  instructions, and then you go to a wrestling tournament on the weekends,  and trying to keep your weight down, and the hours of practice there. So,  kids are challenged nowadays. We didn   t have that when I was coming  up.  When do you have time for fun, I guess? (Laughs) That   s what we should  ask, too. When you were growing up, what did you do for fun? If you  worked from sunup to sundown, what did you do for fun?  That is a good question. (Laughs) Not a whole lot of things I know of for  entertainment unless it was just family get-togethers. I had a couple of  cousins there that were pretty close to my age, and two sisters to torment  and give a hard time to.  Well, did you swim in the ponds or   ?  Well, that was the bathtub, whenever you get off the combine, you go up  to the pond. That was the daily bathing deal.  Not a number three washtub?  Well, that was the wintertime there. Didn   t want to pump that water  there and then get it heated. When I went on a harvest, in Perryton they  had these tanks up above. That was the warm water. You could take a  shower in that when you got done combining. We didn   t have that  luxury here. We carried the water from the barn to the house to warm it  for washing clothes and stuff like that. The cistern water was just used  for household use, and that was it. You had your filtering system, so you  would turn it off until after it rained a little bit and then you would turn it  back on so it would go to the filtering system. Each spring, I was skinny  so I could take the top off, go down to the bottom, and clean it all off,  take a broom and lye soap water and wash the walls down and clean it  all out. Daddy, he would pull the buckets of water and sand and stuff  like that there out, the little froggies that would find their way down  there.  26  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Nykolaiszyn  Things you don   t think about nowadays.  No, you turn the tap and that   s it.  Would you go into town to the movies or anything like that?  I think I seen Francis the Mule about three times. That   s the only one     oh, Mom and Pa Kettle, maybe twice. We didn   t have TV or anything  until after I was out of high school. Mom made the deal that she would  buy the TV if I would buy the antennae. It happened to be that she had  an uncle that got remarried and they had one for a couple dollars. So, she  came up with the good deal. I don   t watch it much now, except the RFD   Rural Free Delivery  station. I   m glad they   ve got that rural station on  now. It   s antique shows, and they   ve got those European shows of their  horses, their tractors, and stuff they have there. Of course, they   ve got  music, they   ve got polka, they   ve got gathers, they   ve got quality-type  music, Hee-Haw. Everything down my line is what you can find on that  station.  Growing up what were holidays like?  For me or my kids?  For you.  We had family get-togethers completely and then after we got married  probably dinner, in our family, would be at my dad   s sister   s and theirs.  Then we   d go to Tonkawa to her grandparents at Tonkawa. That was  basically it, but I always had the kids working. I was a slave driver.  (Laughter) Somebody said,    Hell, do your kids still talk to you, after all  those years?    I said,    Yes.     Well, then, how did you meet your wife? Now I   m going to put you on  the spot   The Lutherans had a group for single people. We had a Lutheran school  in Perry and in Ponca City. The group there, she was from Blackwell, so  that   s where we met.  And got married when? (Laughter)  In September. It   s two days from my birthday. My birthday is the tenth,  so in that area. (Laughter) Forty-three years.  There we go.  27  Finchum  Gorath  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  There you go.  Got one of them right. (Laughter)  It   s hard to ask that question when she   s sitting right next to you because  you   ve got to get it right or else, you know, afterwards    (Laughs)  Yes, but that   s a no-no. I don   t buy gifts.  And you have two children. The oldest is a son.  Right.  And then the daughter.  We got both of them from the Lutheran Social Service in Wichita. They  were both born on Sunday, and we picked them up on Thursday. You  can   t get a better deal than that. You just write down what you want,  they call you up, and say,    Here you go.    We did, when they were in  college, anticipate getting some harder to place children that needed  some help there. The two they had lined up for us from Kansas, they had  burnt down some buildings and I said,    No, thank you,    because we are  all hay. That   s our livelihood here, so we decided that   s what the Lord  said no for us. But we did have some right around Christmastime one  time. He brought a young man here that was out of high school and he  was sleeping in his pickup, didn   t have anything to eat. So, he stayed  here for several months. Then there was a young gal that was renting our  house with other kids from St. Louis, our rent house in town. She was  going to Langston and she called late one night and said,    I need a place  to stay.    So, she stayed here quite awhile and she worked in town. When  I went to work, I   d take her to where she worked at. She had two jobs so  that really   she was very aggressive.  When your dad was farming did he have to hire help  He was real small. Right before he passed away, I think he got up to  about 112 pounds.  A tiny man   So, he tried the oil field, but he wasn   t big enough for that. So, he  worked on the elevators when they built that co-op and the good Lord  took care of him there. When they had a cave-in, the next door neighbor,  he got killed and one on the other side got killed, but he was light  enough that it threw him up high enough to where he didn   t get  28  Finchum  suffocated. A neighbor over here, a Negro man, he was the first one  down there to dig Daddy out. But we had our chores done, and Daddy  wasn   t home, Mom wasn   t home, and we heard it on the radio. So, we  were thankful with that but then later on in his years he drove a school  bus. But milking then, that didn   t help any because getting milking done,  that was my job because he had to be in there early. In the evenings, he  didn   t get home until the chores were done. Otherwise, he always had to  be involved and in on it.  When the tornado took the top of that house off here and we changed the  angle on it, he had to be up there. I went and took a lariat and tied it to  the chimney, let him up there   you know, safely. Then we got done  with the roof and for the siding, we filled in the gap, walked across the  porch, he fell down and broke his leg. So, if it   s going to be, it   s going to  be. We had another neighbor that was on the roof then and he missed the  bottom step and hurt himself. That   s why we were really concerned  about his safety because he was about seventy-eight or eighty about that  time, maybe a little older.  I was a momma   s boy. (Laughter) Kids, sisters, they always knew it. I  was a momma   s boy. Daddy never was around. But mechanic work, like  my daughter there, any mechanic work, or veterinary work, or whatever,  she was the one that I was with. She would help do the extra plowing  and things like that. But that   s one of the things that the college was a  blessing and that   s when they got rid of the screwworm epidemic. The  calves born in the fall, their navels would get screwworms and you  would have to sit there and dig those stinking things out and put tar and  dope in those wiggly little things to get them out, night after night. If a  cow or a bull   a lot of them had horns then   they   d scratch each other  or something, then you   d have to   we didn   t have working chutes and  stuff   then you   d have to dope them and get the screwworms out. If you  de-horned one, a screwworm would get in there, in the cavities.  I had an experience one time up north of town. One of them, she went  berserk and she went about a mile. The neighbors were helping us and I  heard my neighbor. I had the lariat between a mile of road and I was  throwing the lariat and I heard the neighbor scream. That   s the last thing  I remember. She hit me in the chest and I was out. (Laughs) She didn   t  go very far. She laid down and died but it was just one of those things.  They give their last little burst of energy. But that was one of the biggest  blessings we had though over all the years there because summertime,  and then you had your heel flies. Then getting rid of the magnus  brucellosis and things like that where our state got that cleared up, too.  That was a very big help.  You have to worry about the weather, plus insects, plus a lot of other  29  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  things.  Well, like wheat, you anticipate losing it eight times there because of the  green bugs or getting it up, have to take a rotary hoe and run over it  because the clay crusted it over and it   s too cold, too dry, something  failed. So it   s fun and games  It takes dedication and a lot of hard work.  Well, the first year, we got married in September, and I said,    We do not  have more money,    and I was paying on two farms at that particular  time. And then in April, hail cleaned us out completely. I had a place up  north of town there, I   ve got enough to get the seed wheat off of it. But I  went up there and custom cut to get a little money in between there. In  the summertime, I let mine go work and haul hay with other kids to get  enough money to put another crop in to pay for the gas and keep enough  cash to pay for the farm payments and to have the Caterpillar build me a  new pond, cleanup gullies and stuff like that. They were good to me and  let me ride there for a year for payment.  The farmers worked together, and you was asking earlier, on hiring  people. We didn   t hire nobody, basically. It was three neighbors. One  lived across the road and Daddy   s cousin, over here, and we had the  equipment together, tumble bug, which is a scraper. One would have the  manure spreader, and he   d have a front-end loader to pick up manure  piles and put on your ground with your spreaders. They did their  butchering together, would take tires and fifty-five gallon drums and put  them in the granary and run them up and down the scalding hot water  and then scrape the hogs, just scrape it all off. Then everybody had fresh  meat for a day or two. And it all went to town to a locker plant, an ice  plant, and they had the lockers there. So, your chickens that we  butchered and the hogs and the beef was all stored in town.  By locker plant, I   m not sure what you mean.  It was just a square container with a lock on it.  Refrigerated, I   m assuming?  Yes, at the ice plant, yes. I   ve still got our icebox, where the guy would  come back with a pickup with chunks of ice. You   d tell him what size,  how many pounds of ice. He would take it and put it in the icebox, and  then you had a pan on the bottom where it was evaporated. You have  your cool water there. But anything else like that, it was stored in there.  Canning everything, was your bread and butter pickles and dills and all  was in large thirty-gallon crocks on down to smaller sizes. We didn   t  30  Finchum  Gorath  have running water almost until we quit canning quite a bit. We could  buy things at the store, had the cash flow to do that there. But all the  years there, been nice to have had  running water  to water your gardens  and things like that there.  One fun thing was I had a large garden, and I was planting taters and  onions. And I had the male ostrich, and he stood nine-foot tall when he   d  stretch out. You   d put the taters in there and he   d walk along, pick them  up, and throw them up into the air, and catch them, following you  around. And the onions was the same way. He knew exactly what you  put down there.  I always made a pet out of everything. I had a female ostrich, called  Marie, and I let her out in the yard to follow me around. But the problem  was you couldn   t lay a wrench down. If you was working on anything,  she would pick it up, throw it up, and eat it   and your cap and anything  like that, up in the air. People would come with cameras, the shiny   in.   Imitates ostrich  (Laugher) But one time me and the Lord had a talking  to and that was when the cows chased her over in the neighbor   s pen.  You don   t have a halter. You get behind, take the fence down, get  behind her and try to shove her across the creek and try to shove her  across the fence and put the fence back up and talk to her all the way  home. But she followed me around, and that   s the reason I always left  her out.  One year we had some German exchange students for Perry and we kept  one girl. She   s about the same age as my Kathy was. Anyway, when she  went back to Germany, she wanted the trampoline and Braum   s ice  cream. (Laughter) She was used to our eating because it was basic  German food, tater, meat, vegetable, and homemade bread for every  meal. The other ones had whatever you could get downtown, junk food,  and they got homesick. My daughter didn   t hit too many classes that  year because she   d go with the German classes, while she was taking  German. They   d go to the courthouses, to Oklahoma City to the  Legislature and things like that. Then she   d be in a speech contest or  band contest, track contest. I said,    Don   t you ever go to a class?     (Laughs) My son, he had to study for his, and she didn   t. When she got  to college she didn   t know how to study, and it was easy for him. I made  a deal with him that I would pay the first semester   s deal if  he made  good grades  so, he was on the honor roll for a semester. So it wasn   t  beer drinking and running around, it was serious. So that worked out  pretty good.  And where did they go, to college?  The money and the kids went to OSU. My daughter stopped one  31  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  Gorath  semester, went to  Northern Oklahoma College in  Tonkawa, and then  back to OSU.  Is there anything else you want to say before I ask my last question?  I believe, no. I don   t know. (Laughs)  Well, we usually ask people what they see for the farm for the next 100  years. What do you see happening with it?  How about the next five to ten years? With our present debt that we have  right now and EPA, farming is going to be  harder . Milk, they say that   s  a oral product, so they got to dock around their milk containers for the  dairies. And hogs, the other day they hadn   t cut their needle teeth, you  cut them so they don   t cut a sow   s utters. You cut the tails, dock them,  so they don   t chew on them. They said you can   t do that. And you can   t  castrate the boars, and you can   t eat meat from a boar. It   s just too  rancid. The odor is so strong.  When we used to have our boars, we would have kids from Ag class,  and we would come in and castrate it. We   d call it stag it, stag the boars.  And you   d need to put a wire around his nose, tie him to a post while  he   s backing up, then flip him. One time, I was sitting there holding a  front foot up and he relieved in my back pocket. When I went back to  class, my fifth and sixth hours, nobody sat by me. But now, they want  you to have your handles treated and no cruelness to the animals and not  be caged and things like that there.  And the dust and the chemicals and the paperwork. It   s just like right  now on the elk, they   d have somebody come out and count them, check  your fence, see what kind of lots and everything that you have. The more  the government gets involved right now and they   re complaining about  farmers getting some money back. Well, if they would look at the  percent of Ag expense from the government, it all goes to small  communities. Right now it   s electronics to small communities, housing,  so there   s enough kids to go to school, to keep up a school open. Right  now, the people that   s getting misplaced, where they losing they homes  and stuff like that there, that   s all agriculture money going. And people  say,    Hey, look at what the agriculture expense is,    but the man on the  farm is getting very little.  And the combine, quarter of a million dollars, tractor, quarter of a  million dollars. You   ve got a salvage cutter, them guys have to go  custom work because an individual farmer can   t afford that type of  money. People are buying the land away from the farmers for recreation.  And you take school land, right here, the price that they run them up, it   s  32  Nykolaiszyn  Gorath  just for hunting. And if you   re lucky enough that you can talk the guy  into letting you rent the pasture or something, they don   t want it cleaned  up because they want the brush out there for their entertainment, and it   s  just competition.  There are so few farmers, and they   re trying to get younger people  involved. They   re trying to come up with different programs. EPA and  things like that there and no dust and the chemicals. Just like your  fertilizers right now, Urea is basically just like it was last year. And now,  we have competition between China and India. So     It   s tough.  18-46  fertilizer  right now is 157 percent higher than it was a year ago.  And a couple years ago I put 1846 on and paid over twelve hundred  dollars a ton, and you just don   t put very much on this type of old clay  here. You can   t put a crop out without fertilizing twice a year. You   ve  got to have a starter fertilizer, which is basically 1846 phosphate. Pot  ash, used to pay sixty dollars a ton and now, it   s one of the highest parts.  So it don   t look very good.  Your cattle market, this is the first time I know anything about it that  grain and cattle both went up. Usually, your grain goes up and the cattle  goes down and vice versa, in the feedlot. Right now, it   s the only time  I   ve ever read that you can have both of them going up at the same time.  With the price of fuel, how many hundreds of dollars? We   re talking  about almost a thousand dollars in the morning to fill two or three  tractors up with diesel, and that   s just for one day on this large  equipment. I don   t think they   re very good, but if government would get  out of it and let farmers farm, I think there   s a good future there because  there   s less farmland, and there   s a lot of people coming, being born all  the time. But that   s my view.  We need Uncle Sam out of our stuff. How do you run a combine in dry  weather, trying to knock the chaff off and not make dust? So just items  like that there, if they come up, you work ground and that   s dirt. If  you   re going to stir it, you drive down the roads here. It   s just like coal.  We   re sending our highest sulfur coal from Eastern Oklahoma over to  Japan, and we   re getting ours out of Wyoming and areas like that. And  look what the cost is for it, where we have it just within a few miles.  Look at Muskogee, there   s a generator there and coal fields just a few  miles from there. It   s just if you can get that sulfur out of it, how much  less the cost of energy would be.  And that   s the other thing, is electricity is going to be the other item  there for farmers because everything is getting automated. And you need  33  Finchum  Gorath  Finchum  electricity for all your equipment that you run, your welders, to move  grain, and anything like that, it has to have electricity. So energy is  going to be the other problem that   s going to be a challenge, between the  fertilizer and energy, and then EPA.  A lot of pieces to the puzzle. Well, what do you expect to happen to the  land?  I   m giving it to my kids now because I   m getting to where I can   t get  around. And that way, it   s in the family as much as I can.  Well, that   s it, unless you want to say something else. Thank you for  having us today. It was a pleasure.  -------  -------
