Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family background.  I want you to tell me as much as  you know about your family origins, you know, like if you know where your family  came from or if you know what they were doing in the nineteenth century or during  Reconstruction, you know, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: My, most of my relatives are from Alabama.  We've had one of our relatives to trace our  family back to Dominican Republic and then in that area and Sullivan Island outside of,  of South Carolina.  It seemed that the -- on my mother's [Patsy Pesant] side, the family moved  from the, the Caribbean, up the East Coast from Alabama to somewhere in the  Washington [D. C.] area.  There are different spellings of the name, but we think that all these  people are related.  My father's [Paul Adams, Jr.] side of the family came out of Georgia.  And we don't  have too much -- at least I don't know a lot about their particular family.  Most of the  people have resided in Ala, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.
Story_ID: 2229
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories, you know, from the -- that are passed along about your  ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that my, my, my grandparents' parents were, were slaves.  I do believe, I  do believe that my, my, my grandmother [Georgia Mills] was a, came from -- the, the word is passed  down that her family were Cherokee in that part of the country and it's just a, there're a  lot of mixed stories.  The strange thing about the history of that time, my mother [Patsy Pesant], when  you asked a lot of questions, she was, you were told it was none of your, none of your  business.  In fact, it was not until my mother passed away that I found out that her father [Joseph Pesant]  had a second family.  I found that quite interesting, that it took sixty years -- well she  passed when she was about sixty -- that I didn't find out until the funeral, her funeral, that  there was another family that she had.
Story_ID: 2230
Speaker 1: So she, she [mother, Patsy Peasant] just wasn't forthcoming with all the history?
Speaker 2: There -- and then -- and, and still the family is not forthcoming.  I mean we, we're kind of, kind of  pulling it out of them, but we have since that time met the second family and, you know,  everything is okay now.  But it would have been, I think interesting from my standpoint  of view, that I had met them earlier because most of them are getting quite old.  And I  think we would have gotten a better history of, of the family had I known it at a early age.
Speaker 1: Did adults tell you when you were younger not to ask questions about that?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, none of your business (laughter) tend to your business.  I specifically would  ask my mother about the complexions in the family because the complexions in her  family went from extremely light to extremely dark.  And genetically speaking, my  grandfather [Joseph Pesant] was a, in, in color was a real, really black man.  And, of course, my  grandmother [Georgia Mills] looked as if she was white.  They claimed that she was Cherokee, but that's  what I was told, probably was white, if you ask me.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Unclear) all of these -- it's not unusual --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -- in a black family that you find that kind of --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -- it makes it hard to really trace (simultaneous) the --
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I, I have looked back and the in research I've done, can't find any Indians.  But I do find a white family that, that she, that her mother came from.  So my  assumption is that it probably was white and not the tale that was passed down to me that  she was Cherokee.
Story_ID: 2231
Speaker 1: Did they have any, any stories or anything or songs or any incidents that they passed around, a  story or, or something that happened to someone then, back, back in the nineteenth century or  earlier on this century?
Speaker 2: No, like I said, it -- I can't recall much.  I, I -- there are two tragedies that have been and I've  never been clear about it.  On my mother's [Patsy Pesant] side there was a, a older brother that was  killed when he was a, very, very young.  And on my father's [Paul Adams, Jr.] side there's supposedly a  sister that was, that was burned in a, in a home fire.  So on both sides there were  tragedies, but I, I've never been able to clearly understand whether this happened or it  didn't happen or it's a figment of someone's imagination, but there's just been, not very  much said about family.  If you don't dig for it, in my case, for the last fifteen, twenty years,  I've been digging trying to find out whose related to, to whom.  And I've been fairly  successful, but I haven't found any folk tales.
Story_ID: 2232
Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us about your mother.  Can you give, give us her name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Patsy Pesant.  P-E-S-A-N-T, Patsy, P-A-T-S-Y.  School teacher.  Family believed, the  family believed strongly in, in education and so her parents pushed all of their eight children  to go to school.
Speaker 1: Now, when was she born approximately (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Around 1916.  Yeah, somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Pesant, now, that's, is that a French name or?
Speaker 2: I don't know. It, it, it might be -- the, the, the information that I have is, is that it, that,  that name, (unclear) some French connection, but most of it was, was Caribbean.  It's  strange that within the same family, because of the pronunciation of it, I think that the --  if you look at it, the word would be, the word would be peasant and because some of the  family members did not like that pronunciation, they spelled it differently, P-E-Z-A-N-T,  or P-Z-A-N-T or P-A-Z-A-N-T.  So within our family there are several different spellings  of the word.  And what we're trying to do now is connect each one of the spelling as to  how to connect it.  But within the same family, I know of at least my mother, I looked at  her marriage certificate and she spelled her name different.  And one of her younger  brothers spelled his name different.  So.  Variety is the spice of life.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, what was your mother like and what did she do.  She, she, she was a school  teacher?
Speaker 2: She was a school teacher.  My father [Joseph Adams, Jr.] died when I was very young.  My father died when I  was eight and there were four children.  The responsibility of raising the children was on her  shoulder.  She worked very, very hard to make sure that her children got a decent  education.  She was a worrier.  She just, always worried about the welfare of her children  and how they were doing and I think she died an early death just cause she was just so  worried about things.  But she did a good job of raising her children.
Story_ID: 2233
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: There were two sisters [Patricia Adams Crittenden, Priscilla Adams Cleveland] and one younger brother [Presley Reid Adams].  And all finished high school, all went to  some form of college.  Two of us have advanced degrees and so I think for a single lady,  during that time, she did a fairly good job.
Story_ID: 2234
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father, what you know about him.  What, what was  his name and how --
Speaker 2: Paul.  P-A-U-L.  Paul Adams was a butcher, worked for Swift [and Company].  He was a, killed hogs as I  remember and cows and slaughter, at the slaughterhouse.  I remember him vaguely as  somebody coming in and out of the house.  And at the time, when he, when he, when he passed  away, I, I was in his hospital room the night of his demise.  And I remember going and  telling my mother that Daddy's going to die tonight.  And sure enough, the next day he,  he had passed away from high blood pressure.  At the time, they didn't have the controls  of, of that in those days.  But I was only eight so I don't, I don't remember a lot about him.  I  know he liked a lot of cars, and I can remember going to the circus with him, but I don't,  don't remember a lot of, a lot about him.  So when he passed away, my grandfather [Paul Adams, Sr.] kind  of stepped in and became my father.
Speaker 1: Is this your mother's father?
Speaker 2: This my, my father's father.  Um-hum.
Story_ID: 2235
Speaker 1: So when you were, when you were growing up, who -- what did you household consist of  in terms of -- who did your household consist of in terms of --
Speaker 2: It was, it was the immed, the immediate family but because my mother [Patsy Pesant] was a teacher and  she would, sometimes she would not be teaching in Montgomery [Alabama] or she was in another  state, children were kind of parceled out to, to different relatives.  I was with my  grandfather [Paul Adams, Sr.].  My sisters [Patricia Adams Crittenden, Priscilla Adams Cleveland] sometimes were with, with my aunt, and my younger  brother [Presley Reid Adams] was with, with -- traveled with my mother.  But if my mother was in town,  it was just the, the immediate family, my mother, my sisters and my brother, one brother.
Speaker 1: So she, she took various assignments as a teacher and --
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: -- in the surrounding areas?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Especially during her latter years, she was not able to get employment in  Alabama.  And she ended up in Mississippi, and I think at one time she ended up in  Georgia and traveling, you know, in those days was a little more difficult than now.  So  she might come home, home on the weekends.  And as I got older, we were sent off to  boarding school.  Three of us went off to boarding, went off to the same boarding school.  So that gave her some, some security that she knew that her children were being taken  care of.
Story_ID: 2236
Speaker 1: I want you to reflect back and give us some sense of some of the sights  and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Humm, well, I, I did a lot of work for my uncle who was in the food business.  So I can  remember making camp stew.  I can remember my, one of my first jobs at age ten, I did  landscaping so I can, I could, you know -- it was always wonderful that, that spring and  summer would come around because I would get a chance to make some money.  And  you could smell the green grass.  We had a garden and I can literally smell the okra and  little peach tree and the fig tree and it was a certain time, you had to go to pick peaches  because if you picked peaches in the sun, all the fuzz got over you.  So we, you'd go out  early in the morning and pick, pick peaches and figs.  And tomatoes, too, sometimes.  So those are, those are the things that I, that I smell -- it's the earth, great cooking.  Those are  the ones that strongly stick out for me.
Story_ID: 2237
Speaker 1: Now, did you all live in, live in town in Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: We lived in town.  We lived three blocks from the University, Alabama State [University, Montgomery].  So we  were in kind of the college area of the city.  A lot of professional people around.  Teachers, the president of the University -- at that time it was called a college, lived  across the street from me and Dr. [Martin Luther] King's secretary.  And the Sculpturer, Dr. Isaac  Hathaway, who designed the half dollar for Booker T. Washington -- so I was in -- didn't  know at the time, but I was in good company.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that community's been written about quite a bit since the Civil Rights  Movement and the churches there who, you know, Dexter Avenue [Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I think the stability in the black community at that time was outstanding  because your role models were there.  You, you kind of, as you grew up, you knew the  role that fathers did.  You knew what mothers did, you know.  It was a, it was surrounded  with the, the fact that you, you'd have to go to school to do well.  It was a kind of  unspoken in that era, one was going to school, (unclear) trying to, trying to advance.  People were in business.  I, I didn't know, I can't remember anybody being unemployed  unless they wanted to be.  So that's the kind of community that I grew up in.  I'm very  thankful for that too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's been written that the community was dominated by educators basically.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Teachers from Alabama State and --
Speaker 2: Teachers from Alabama State and to kind of branch off from that, you know, insurance  people.  There were a lot of black businesses at the time.  So we catered, of course,  because of segregation, we catered to, to the black business.  So that black business  communities flourished.  And one of the things I kind of often disagreed with is that the  end result of the Civil Rights Movement was that integration became a one-way street.  And I always think that we should have been talking about, rather than physical  integration living next to somebody, that we didn't talk about economic integration.
Speaker 1: So you're, you're suggesting that, you're saying that black peo, people took their  business to white people, but it didn't come back --
Speaker 2: That's, absolutely.  And so if we had a stopped worrying about physically where you  lived because you, you decide where you live in your mind, you know, you, you make the  changes there (unclear).  If we had a focused on economics, things would be much  different, you know, from my standpoint, at least.  I've always believed that.
Story_ID: 2238
Speaker 1: Tell me what kind of a little boy were you?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I, I, you know, I got in -- I had my, my days of trouble.  My mother [Patsy Pesant] used to beat my tale quite often.  And I thank her for that.  My, I remember my first job at  age six was going to town to buy some thread for Mary Dee Johnson next door.  And going  to school, working during the summers, starting a landscaping business at age ten,  having a paper route, working for people in the neighborhood, washing windows.  I had a  car washing business on Sunday that my mother just gave me all kind of sand about cause the  water was running under the house.  But I've always worked.  I've always had an extra  job.  My mother supplied the, the basics.  If you wanted spending money, you wanted to  buy something extra, that was your responsibility.  So I grew up there and thought that  was quite normal.  You know, I didn't see anything wrong with that.  If you want to spend money on whatever you, whatever we bought in those days, going to the movie,  buying ice cream, you went out and made it yourself.  She, she supplied, you know, the  roof over your house and, and food and if you wanted extra, you went out and do -- so  I've been, I've been working since I was six.  And I never stopped -- twelve months a year.  Part-time job, find a job, find something to do if you have a particular -- you  particularly want something, then you go out and work for it.
Story_ID: 2239
Speaker 1: Now who were some of your mentors in high school (unclear) you know, --
Speaker 2: Dr. [Martin Luther] King.
Speaker 1: Well, in, in school period, not, not just in high school, but who, who were some of your  mentors and --
Speaker 2: Well, I, I told you all about the neighborhood I grew up -- and, and my neighborhood  were my mentors.  I mean the people who were in business, the University [Alabama State University, Montgomery] teachers and, and professors because I grew up during the Civil Rights Movement, you know, and there was Dr.  King and there was Dr. Ralph Abernathy and there were black attorneys and, and so  forth.  So I was just surrounded with heroes from my standpoint of view.  And I, I think  that the experiences of those years is responsible for what I ended up doing later on in  life.
Story_ID: 2240
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to a lot of them (laughter) cause I moved around.  I'm trying to -- I went to,  trying to think.  I went to Booker T. Washington.  I have to think real here.  I went to  Booker T. Washington Elementary School.
Speaker 1: That's in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's in Montgomery [Alabama].  I went St. John Catholic School.  I went to Alabama State [University, Montgomery] Lab School and then I went to Alabama State High School and I went out to Southern Normal where I graduated at the end of 1957.  And I skipped one.  I went to Hales which, when I lived with my grandfather [Paul Adams, Sr.], in elementary school.  So I had a, a  number of schools because we, we moved around or my mother [Patsy Pesant] moved around.  So it meant that we were constantly changing schools.
Speaker 1: So what high school did you go to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I went to two.  I went to Alabama State Lab School and I went to -- I got my, but my  diploma is from Southern Normal which was a boarding school in Brewton, Alabama.
Speaker 1: This is Brewton, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: B-R-?
Speaker 2: B-R-E-W-T-O-N.  [Dr.] Manford Byrd [Jr.] is, was a graduate of that school.
Story_ID: 2241
Speaker 1: Well, give me a sense of what, what you were doing in high school.  Did you get  involved in sports or camp (unclear) --
Speaker 2: Tried to play a little, tried to play a little football and a little basketball, but for some  reason, I was very, very small in high school and didn't grow until I was about a junior in  college.  So I got knocked around and bounced around like a, like a ping-pong ball.  I  don't think I was that, I don't think I was very good in it at all.  So -- but I tried.  I'm  trying to think in high school, during the boarding years I was a superintendent of Sunday  School, my, my senior year.  And I was in charge of the building.  At Southern Normal [School, Brewton, Alabama] everyone had a duty.  I mean you had to do work after, after school.  And I was in charge,  in charge of the building to make sure it was clean.  And I was, I was in charge of that for  two years.  So, like I said, I've always been working, doing something with my hands or  my mind.  I just constantly feel that I have to be doing something.  I, I don't like being  bored.
Story_ID: 2242
Speaker 1: Now, what church did you attend?
Speaker 2: Hall Street Baptist Church in Montgomery [Alabama].  And when I was with my father, my  grandfather, I attended a church called Weeping Willow Baptist Church [Montgomery, Alabama].  And after  finishing high school, I haven't been much of a church going person.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, why not?  I mean you (unclear) --
Speaker 2: Well, my, my experience, the Civil Rights Movement kind of -- I don't know whether  you could call it turned me on or turned me off.  I, I just thought the whole, whole  religious process was just hypocritical.  I mean, you know, here's one (unclear) save one  soul, and we're all brothers.  And the most segregated time is the Sunday at eleven o'clock.  And  I, I remember distinctly listening to the radio on Sunday morning.  And, of course, it was  the white churches that were on the radio in those days, and saying, you know, about my, my brothers and how we should help people.  But no black people was on there.  I did  not, I didn't understand that.  And the, the whole process of the Civil Right Movement is,  you know, people assume that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] kind of came in and took over leadership, but  Dr. King was pushed into that, pushed into that leadership position because the black  ministers who were there did not want to rock the boat.  So why don't we push this, this  young fellow who just come to town.  And I'm so glad they pushed him now.  I mean he  turned, turned the world around.  But religion has been hypocritical.  It's, it's, there's a  lot of discrimination, racism in religion.  And we live here in the 21st Century and we  about to blow, we about to blow up the world because of religion.  I think, I think religion  is how you live each day.  And that's my religion.
Story_ID: 2243
Speaker 1: Now, you were in high school during the, the beginning I guess of a big civil rights push  in the United States and Montgomery [Alabama], your home town, as the focus of that --
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: -- was on T.V. every day.
Speaker 2: Every day.
Speaker 1: The Montgomery Bus Boycott and how, can, can you tell us what you were doing?  I  mean how did you hear about it or get involved in it, you know, when you were in high  school?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we, you know, it's strange the boycott happened about a hundred days after  Emmett Till was found in the Tallahatchie River which really kind of galvanized the Civil  Right, Rights Movement because I always felt that when they found Emmett Till, that that  could have been me.  And for some reason I, I don't know why at the age of, I guess I  was eleven or twelve, I -- that stuck in my mind.  And it was that year that I went off to -- I wasn't eleven -- I went off to boarding school so that would have been in '54 [1954].  So I would have been,  actually, I would have been twelve that year when he, when he was found.  Then I -- the  Montgomery Boycotts started and it was, it was if everybody in unison saying, "This is  what we must do."  And it was -- I don't, I can't recall when, that people were  disgruntled about it at all.  Rosa Parks sat down at the right time, and it was not planned.  She was just tired.  But she had the right credentials.  I was thinking about that the other  night, that she was a seamstress at the Montgomery Fair which was a big department  store there.  She was, I think she was a secretary at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And I do recall in  earlier years, the NAAC -- NAACP was outlawed in the State of Alabama because I used  to go around with my grandfather from different houses clandestinely to, to attend the  meetings.  But the, the Montgomery Boycott brought clarity to the movement.  That  proved people can, can make things happen.  And we decided that we would walk and  not ride.  And I think the whole world was watching, and, and it was, it was one of the  pivotal points of the Civil Rights Movement.
Story_ID: 2244
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Mr. E.D. Nixon?
Speaker 2: I've seen Mr. Nixon, Mr. [Edward D.] Nixon who is the one who, who had been -- the Pullman  Porter who had championed, the, championed the cause of integration in, in Montgomery [Alabama].  There was a, there was a book written about him some years ago.  And I really think that  Mr. Nixon has not really been not given enough credit for, for all that he, for all that he  did in Montgomery.  But, yes, I am, I am aware of Mr. Nixon.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was head of the Montgomery NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 2: Right, absolutely.
Story_ID: 2245
Speaker 1: The boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956, Alabama] wasn't completely accidental in the sense that --.
Speaker 2: No.  No, Nixon had been looking for, for lack of a better word, for the right candidate and  Rosa Parks was the right candidate because of her, I guess, she -- which she had, I guess  you have good profiles and you have bad profiles.  I think hers was good because of her  dealing with the NAACP, (unclear) she had a decent job, didn't have a record.  She had a  stable home, husband --
Speaker 1: She was married with no kids.
Speaker 2: Married, I think she was married, no, no children, yeah.  Um-hum.
Story_ID: 2246
Speaker 1: Now, were, were you actually in town or were you at boarding school when, when  (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, the boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956, Alabama] started I think, like, December 5 [1955] or something like that.  And I think I  was in boarding school or I was on my way back home from the Christmas break.  But I  can, I, I, can remember distinctly, you know, the times that I was there, the imaginary  tickets and we had a little bus, carpool and, you know, I'd get in the carpool.  And if I had  a car, I always picked up someone.  Everybody just picked up somebody going  somewhere.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the imaginary ticket?  What's that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean you, you, you would turn, you'd be turning left and the police would pull  you over and give you a ticket for turning right.  You knew it was, you know, you just  kind of looked at them.  You know, and say, "What else you want?"
Speaker 1: So, they, they gave black people tickets (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: -- because they were using their cars to pool each other?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  You know, "Your light is not working."  You know, it was the, it was the, the  reverse economic thing.  You know, "We give these, give these black folks enough tickets,  you know, they'll st -- they'll cut this boycott out."  That -- that boycott had  what you call "spirit" in it.  And, and people knew that if, if they could do this, then the  rest of the country -- i don't think they literally thought that -- but it was going to be an example of what could be done.  By the  way, that company was owned by a company here in Chicago [Illinois], the bus company.  Absolutely, and our great CTA [Chicago Transit Authority].  Just found that out recently.
Story_ID: 2247
Speaker 1: You know, most people would suspect that, you know, I  mean there was always, there's always the dialogue that people in the North didn't know  what was going on in the South.  And if they had known, you know, they wouldn't have - -
Speaker 2: Well, I think Emmett Till started it all.  They, you know, I mean, you know, they found  out, you know.  Here's a black kid from Chicago [Illinois].  He goes down in Mississippi to visit  his uncle and he ends up in a pine box.  And then, along, you know, so I guess after that  hundred days later, the Montgomery [Bus] Boycott [1955-1956, Alabama] starts and, and then there's television was coming into it's own.  And you could hear the prolific speaker Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was, you know,  extolling, to the extolling the, the, all of the sins of segregation.  And these poor people  walking and marching and sacrificing.  It was, it was a great story.  And the abuses of the  police department.
Story_ID: 2248
Speaker 1: Tell me about the first time you heard Dr. [Martin Luther] King speak or, or the first  time you met Dr. King?  I think you met him before he even got involved.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met, I met Dr. King in, in the spring of '54 [1954] at Alabama State [University, Montgomery] Lab High [School] during a  career conference.  And I think the only reason that I went to see him because he was the  newest minister in town.  We wanted to know who was the new minister at Dexter  Avenue [Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Small town?
Speaker 2: Small town.
Speaker 1: People want to know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: People want to know.  And we go up there, and here's this young, twenty-six, twenty-six-year old young  man, Ph. D.  He was the first young Ph. D. that I'd ever met.  And I was, I was impressed, you  know, at that age, you know, that he had his Ph. D.  And, you know, and all that kind of  stuff.  It was just inspiring as a young person, sitting there, seeing such a young person --  plus, there were a lot of Ph. D.'s on the, on the campus, but they seemed to me at the time,  they were all old people.  And here was this young man with this Ph. D. and, and as history  tells now, you know, he ended up becoming the leader of the, of the boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956, Alabama] and, and turned the world around and hopefully, we're much better off.  Although, I think Dr.  King would be kind of sad with some of the things that black people haven't done with those  victories.
Speaker 1: Now, when you met him initially, did you think that -- you, you were impressed with his  Ph -- his credentials, did you, did you have the sense that he was going to be a, a great  leader for us or, you know?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think I had that sense.  I just, I just, I guess I was just impressed with his  credentials.  I mean, he's, he's a sharp dresser, you know, and he was, as the brothers say, "he was  down."
Speaker 1: When did you first hear him speak and address these issues?
Speaker 2: I think it was during the boycott.  I think it was during what you call mass meetings.  I  think mass meetings were held on Mondays.
Story_ID: 2249
Speaker 1: Can you remember your first mass meeting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think the first mass meeting was at Hutchinson Street Baptist Church [Montgomery, Alabama] on my side  of town.  And it was just people would come out for information purposes.  And they were,  you know, the people would come on and speak and Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] would usually be the one  that really bring the message.  And when he came on, it, it was like, it was like electricity  going through the place.  I mean he had the place all powered up, and we were ready to  go out for another week and not ride those buses.  And it, it was an update.  And, of  course, the spies were there, you know, to, to get -- tell the white people what's going on.  But we didn't care.  I mean, you know, you can tell them that we're going -- not going to  ride these buses.  If that's, if that's what you want to know, and it's true.  But those  meetings were electrifying.  I mean he, Dr. King had such a, an ability to get you engaged  in the process.  And it still effects me today, to this very day I, I can hear him speaking  and saying that this is what we should do.  And we're going to do this; we're going to do  that.  We can do this, you know.  We have the power, you know, and, and it's each  individual responsibility to do certain things.  His philosophy is, to this day, has been the  guiding force in my life.
Story_ID: 2250
Speaker 1: It was, it was a chill Friday morning, early, the first day that the buses were going to be integrated.  And my mother [Patsy Pesant]  and I caught the bus.  We put our little money into the, to the fare box.  And I tried to get  as close to the bus driver as I could physically could.  I was right behind him, next to him.  I was, I was almost able to drive the bus, and my mother said, "Boy, you're the craziest  son I ever had in my life," you know.  And I remember going downtown because it was so  much excitement.  But I don't remember coming back.  But I do, I could tell you, I could  tell you exactly where I got on that bus, at the corner of Hall and Tow (ph), the first morning  that the buses were integrated.  At the time, I just thought that was, it was, it was a great,  it was a great, great victory.  Some of the things that I've heard that people were subject  to, I, it didn't happen to me.  But I do remember the little sign that was like a sliding,  according to what side of town the bus was on, you know, it would be up, if you was  more in the black area, it would way back in the white area.  I never had to get up  because the area that I lived in was the beginning of the route is probably the reason that I  was not end up jail because I probably would not been so nice if someone that I was  sitting down, they told me to get up.
Speaker 2: Were they telling -- after the boycott was over, they were still trying to --
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.  After the boycott was over, but I do remember the sign, you know, and it  was, you know, the "colored section" is on the little, like a little sl -- like a little gauge, not  a gauge, a little track.  So it could be easily be pushed from one, one section of the bus to  other.  So there would be times that people would be standing, say, in the white section,  but you couldn't sit down.  It was incredible that all that, all of that happened, but it  actually happened.  And you tell people, they say, "you kidding?"  No, I'm not kidding you.  This actually happened.  I remember it.  I was there.
Speaker 2: It does seem incredible.
Speaker 1: It does.  Absolutely, when you think about it.  But that history, that period of history has  made me who I am today.  I, I have no doubts about that.  So I tell people I was born in  the right place at the right time.
Story_ID: 2251
Speaker 1: Did it [Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956, Alabama] give a sense that things can change if you --
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  I think, I think, as I, as I think about Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], I, you know, you  say well did I feel anything?  I guess the excitement I felt the first time I met Dr. King,  is that I can do what he did.  I can, I can get a Ph. D.  Didn't get one, but that was -- I felt  then that, you know, if he had it, I can get one, you know.  If you hear someone, a young  person had gone out and, you know, been to (unclear) then to Boston and, you know, and then  later on as I read his background, I thought about here's a young man that made a  sacrifice he didn't have to make.  I mean his parents were well situated in Atlanta [Georgia].  His  father was on the board, the bank of the board, on, on the board at the bank there.  And  Ebenezer [Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and his mother, family were religious leader in the Atlanta area.  I mean he  didn't have to come this little isolated Montgomery, Alabama.  But a Mr. [Robert] Nesbitt, as I  remember, who lived on Tuscaloosa Street [Montgomery, Alabama], and he's still alive, convinced him to come to  Dexter [Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama].  Robert Nesbit.
Story_ID: 2252
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit more about Mr. [Robert] Nesbitt.  I mean --
Speaker 2: He was kind of the, because I was not a member of Dexter [Avenue Baptist Church], but I do, but I knew he lived  on Tuscaloosa Street, across from the, across from the college and I was in the school  with one of his sons.  I, I remember he was, was a focal, kind of the, of the leadership that  got Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and was the, the guiding financial, spiritual force behind that church for a  very long, long time.  And I remember seeing him in a documentary not a few years ago,  and I got a chance to see him.  But I haven't seen him, I haven't seen him in person since  I left Montgomery [Alabama], whew, 1962.
Story_ID: 2253
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were in high school, with all this excitement going on now, what,  what were your favorite subjects and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I guess my favorite subject in high school was history.  At the time -- I always tell  young people now, you know, we were so busy strategizing the next movement in the  Civil Rights Movement, we didn't have time to get in trouble.  I mean it was -- and I  think people don't realize that the Civil Rights Movement was basically young people,  children in many cases.  And I'm so, you know, I, I get kind of worried about the young  people today that they're, they're not involved in activities that can make changes.  I  mean we're isolated.  We're kind of do, do I, do my thing, you know, I take care of me.  You worry about yourself.  But the, the movement, the environment of the time was that  we were in, we were in a struggle.  After the, after the boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956, Alabama] was over, there, there were  other movements that were, you know, there were the Freedom Rides [1961] and there was the,  the sit-ins and, you know, we were just constantly busy.  So from 1954 from my  standpoint of view, maybe even earlier because of the, the outlaw of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in  Alabama, I was kind of in that movement.  I, I knew that we would move around for a  reason, that if they caught us, we would end up going to jail.  And, and then the incident  with Emmitt Till [1955] and then into the boycott and into the sit-ins and so forth and so on,  young people at that time, many of the young people.  You know, a lot of young people  stayed away from it because their parents said, "You know, you shouldn't do it or you're  going to get in trouble."  My mother [Patsy Pesant] told me that I shouldn't do it.  Someone else should  do.  I said, "I am someone else."  That was my, that was my particular attitude.  But my  point is that our mindset was trying to strategize to make the next movement.  What  would we do or not do in order to keep, keep things going, staying out of jail or being  from, from being killed.  I mean you had to be -- you had to know where to be and when  to be and when not to be.  And, frankly, I'm happy that I got through that period without  sustaining any injuries.
Story_ID: 2254
Speaker 1: When you were, I guess, on the verge of graduation from high school, what were  your plans?  What were --
Speaker 2: The plans was to go to college.  There was not a lot of encouragement, you know; small class,  I guess about thirty-six.  I guess I was just mot -- I knew I was going to college.  I mean, I mean,  I mean --
Speaker 1: Were you a real good student?
Speaker 2: I was a fairly good student, yeah, you know, a B student.  I had been offered a, a  scholarship by Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] to go to school in San Diego [California] because I had been arrested during  the -- I'm kind of getting ahead of myself.  I shouldn't -- back up a little bit.  When I left  high school, I knew I was going to go to college.  And somewhere in, in the ensuing  period, I was -- after I had left Southern Normal -- I went to Alabama State [University, Montgomery] which is in my  hometown, I was arrested during a sit, sit-in, whatever we were doing on campus and was  put out of school.  And Dr. King offered me a schl -- offered everybody who had been  arrested, who had been put of school, to go to school in San Diego.  And, of course, I  refused it because I didn't think my mother [Patsy Pesant] could -- even with a scholarship, I didn't  think we could, we could, we could afford it.  I think I'm answering your question.  Am I  answering your question?  I maybe, think I lost you a little bit.
Speaker 1: Well, I, I guess we, we skipped how you got into Alabama State, you know, and --
Speaker 2: Well, when I left high school, you said, you know, what was I going to do?  I knew I was going to  college.
Speaker 1: So you knew you were going to Alabama State?
Speaker 2: I knew I was going to Alabama State because it, that's just about all we could afford.  I  would be at home.  I was three blocks from the, three blocks from the college and, you  know, we could, we couldn't afford to go off to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] at the time or to  Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama], just couldn't afford a Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] which was forty-six miles from us.  But Alabama  State was right there.  And so we took advantage or at least I took advantage of that  opportunity.  My sisters [Patricia Adams Crittenden, Priscilla Adams Cleveland] took advantage of that opportunity.
Story_ID: 2255
Speaker 1: Now, what you just said about getting kicked out, though, that speaks to polarization of the young people and old people I guess around the Civil Rights issues even after the bus  boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955-1956, Alabama], wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Well, even after the bus boycott, you have to remember I was at a state school [Alabama State University, Montgomery].  And the  decision came down that everybody that was involved in, in the sit-ins or in my case, it  was the demonstration on campus, because we were getting ready to go downtown to  something.  We never got there.  And the policemen said, you know, we had to disperse.  We had to move.  And I remember saying, you know, I'm not moving today.  This day I  am not moving.  I haven't done anything, you know.  I'm going to do something.  I'm  going downtown to demonstrate, but I haven't done anything.  And came over and  arrested us.  We, we, we kind of -- the law was it was kind of a premeditation.  They,  they thought that you were going to do something so they arrested you which is, which is  constitutionally illegal, but they did it.  And we were, we were arrested and put in jail.  And I remember, I don't know, about thirty or forty of us in jail.  I was standing around  in the jail, but the police people, policemen would not tell people who were trying to get  us out, who was there.  So every time someone got out, they would have to tell the name  of someone else.  People in Montgomery [Alabama] had to put up their property to, for bail to get us  out.  I remember (unclear) my neighbor Guy Sabale (unclear), who ran the restaurant and  entertainment place from across the street from me, put up the money to get me out of  jail.  And got me out of jail and a, and a number of other people out of, out of jail, but it  was, that was quite an experience that day.  I remember they were -- the guy that got us  said we were going, we were not going to, we were not going to eat the food.  And then I  agreed to go to jail, but I didn't agree to have a hunger strike here, so I said, now, you're  not going to eat yours, you give me yours, and I'll eat yours.  And I ate two or three of  the, peas and bread, whatever it was.  Taste pretty good at the time.  And I also  remember, you know, we, we went to trial and they ran out of money.  They, they had to  raise to get us out of jail was like thity thousand dollars, a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Especially, in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Dr. Benjamin Mays, President of Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse, Dr. Ralph  Abernathy and Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] held a, a rally to raise money to keep us from  going to jail because I think you either had to pay the fines or go to jail for two hundred days.  And that was, I ain't going to jail in Alabama for two hundred days for just -- not a part of my program.  But they, they eventually raised the money from, you know, wherever, across the country to  pay the fine and pay the lawyers.  And that was part of my history.
Speaker 1: But the, but the officials of the school, it being a State school were compelled to kick you  all out, out of school?
Speaker 2: Well, you, you know, everybody that was, of course, everybody that got arrested, they  had -- you know, because they knew your name, you were terminated from the  institution.  I remember going to the President's office and Dr. Turner said to me, "Son, I,  I know your mother," you know, because my mother had finished saying as him, you  know, why are you doing this?  And, well, "Dr. Turner, it's just something I just had to do, you  know.  No disrespect to the institution.  It's something that I had to do.  Somebody got to  do it."  A very short conversation, very, in fact, a very pleasant conversation.
Story_ID: 2256
Speaker 1: So I was out, you know, for forteen or fifteen months and I finally went back.  I finished from the, from the  college.
Speaker 2: So you actually went back there (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, where else was I going to go (Laughter)?  Couldn't go to the University of  Alabama [Tuscaloosa].  No black people there.  It's amazing now as I --
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Governor then was George Wallace, right?
Speaker 1: George Wallace.  Yeah, George Wallace was the, was the Governor.
Speaker 2: So what did, did it just kind of -- well, you had to stay out until it blew over and then get  back in?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't recall.  I just, I just thought -- I think it was just a matter of time.  You know,  we finally kind of ran a course.  We weren't permanently put out, but I think the pressure  of the time was that, you know, you got to get rid of these folks, you know, get them off  the campus.  Then you'll be an example for other people not to do these things, you  know, it, it didn't change.  I, I think that, you know, people who didn't participate, they  should have partic --  participated, I think they, they regret it, that they didn't.  And, of  course, they -- college campuses all over, all over the South were, you know, they were,  we were humming all over, over the South, you know.  It was, it was the young people  that -- people should remember.  It was, these were young, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, some even  younger.  The, the crowd at Birmingham [Alabama] was little, was children.  I mean in high  school, grammar school.  So.  I just hope there's a lesson to the children of the twenty-first century that you're, you, you can make things change for the better.  We, we live in a pretty  mixed up world.  And leadership that we, that we as adults that we have not provided,  now comes from of our children.  And they got a tough job.
Story_ID: 2257
Speaker 1: Now, did you know any of the organizers from those days, people like James Bevel and  (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, James Bevel didn't come down till -- Bevel and [Diane Bevel] Nash were really  (simultaneous).  They didn't come down until, till, till the march of, you know, it started in South Carolina (unclear) North Carolina, I believe they started.  But I met Bevel at that time.  I met, I just  called the name --
Speaker 1: Diane Nash?
Speaker 2: -- Diane Nash and since, of course, I met, I'd seen Bevel when he'd visit the school.  Since I had been in Chicago [Illinois].  Bernard Lee was, was from Alabama State [University, Montgomery] and he became -- I knew him because we were, we were in class together.  I knew the attorneys that, you  know, Attorney [Fred] Gray and it was another attorney there.  Two, a couple of other attorneys  that were in, involved in the legal aspect of the Movement [Civil Rights Movement, 1955-1965].  I knew them, and then, of  course, I -- Reverend Abernathy, Dr. Reverend, Dr. Reverend Abernathy lived a block  from me.  And, of course, I had met Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] because he was six blocks, six or seven blocks  from me.  So, Mrs. [Jo Ann Gibson] Robinson who had organized the women on the campus.  I knew her.  So I did.  I know, I knew a lot of the people.  I was one of the, I was one of the first  members of the Montgomery Improvement Assoc -- MIA, Montgomery Improvement  Association.  I've been trying to find my card for fifty years because I was a charter  member.
Speaker 1: It's kind of old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know where it is, but I always say when I go to Montgomery [Alabama], I'm going to  know, try to find out from the, the organization if they have the original members.  I was  proud of the fact that, you know, when Dr. King started that group and I was a member of  the MIA.
Speaker 1: That's something that (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's historical and valuable (unclear) stuff.
Story_ID: 2258
Speaker 1: What did you do  for the interim when you were out of school [Alabama State University, Montgomery]?  Did you stay there in Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I stayed in Montgomery.  I think I was working.  I was running -- my uncle had a little  sandwich shop which was right around the corner from Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], from his home, from  his pro -- where he lived, his family lived.  And I did that.  And I think it, you know, I  don't remember much, but I think it was very uneventful, you know.  And I was probably  angry about the fact that I had put out, been put out of the school.  You know, but soon  that was over with and I was back in school.  But I think it was, you know, about a year  before I went back.
Speaker 1: But now, how'd you get back in?  Did you go to them and say I want to get back in or did  they call -- how did you know that you could come back?
Speaker 2: No, I just think it was just a matter, it was just a matter of registration --
Speaker 1: Okay, so you just (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: -- as I recall.  I don't recall that being a problem getting back in or I had to go through  any kind of special process.  I think it was over with.  I had been out of school, served my  time or whatever it was and my mother [Patsy Pesant] paid the tuition and I went to school and I went  back to college, period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nobody -- it wasn't anything, you know, I needed an attorney and all that kind of business.  Just got back in school.
Story_ID: 2259
Speaker 1: Tell me about your last couple of years at Alabama State [University, Montgomery]?  You, you went back and  finished.
Speaker 2: After, after the, after I had been arrested, I went on back and finished and applied for a  job in, in Alabama.  I applied to a place called Clanton.  I remember someone, somehow,  I got connected with someone and I actually had the job.  Social Studies teacher, I don't  know what it was.  And got a phone call one day in the summer of '62 [1962], and say, you  know, we're not going to be able to hire you because you're on the black list.  I said,  "What do you mean?"  And he said, "Well, you're on it because you were involved --" yeah, I  was involved in the demonstration, you're right.  He said, well, "You're not going to be able  to get a job in Alabama."  So I wasn't too upset about it.  Well, found a young lady who  was a friend of, of one of my neighbors that was coming to Chicago [Illinois].  And I came with  her.  I didn't know a soul in Chicago.  I came with her and she dropped me at the Wabash  YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association, Chicago, Illinois].  And I went to get a job at the Chicago Board of Education, went through all the  little tests and whatever they did and physical examination.  And they would not hire me  because my college had lost their accreditation.  So here I am, you know, I'm in Chicago  without a job and I got my first job was at a car wash about 36 or 37th and Indiana [Chicago. Illinois].  And  I worked at that car wash and that dude wouldn't pay.  I mean, you know, they'd pay you a  little money so that, you know, that wasn't working out.  And then I ended up on 79th  Street [Chicago, Illinois] and working at a restaurant.  It was a good deal because I was getting some food.  And somewhere in there I did, was not working and because I couldn't pay my rent at the  YMCA, so you'd always stay in my room because I didn't want them to put that block in  your door (laughter).  And I guess it was, I guess (unclear) I remember it was cold and  somewhere I had gone out and ended up, I came back, they had locked me out of my  room.  And a friend of mine from Montgomery [Alabama] lived here (unclear), she and her husband took me in.  And I ended  up getting a job with the State, Department of Mental Health of Chicago, then the  Chicago State Hospital.  And since then I went from one job to the next job to what I'm  doing now.
Story_ID: 2260
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do for Chicago State Hospital?  That's a new one on me.
Speaker 2: I worked at, yeah, yeah, I worked as a teacher for the emotionally disturbed.  I got, I ended  up getting my Master's here at Northeastern [Illinois University] in Chicago.  And when I got, end up getting  my Master's while I was working at, at the Chicago State Hospital.  So I worked for the,  the, the Department of Mental Health.  It's very specifically for emotionally disturbed.  I  ended up becoming the, I guess, the supervisor or the principal of that particular area of  the hospital and left that job and went into business.  And then left that job and came to  my present position.
Speaker 1: Now, when you, when you went to Northeastern, did you go to the Center for Inner City Studies or did you go to the main campus?
Speaker 2: I was at the main campus.  But I, I remember taking some courses at, at Center for Inner City Studies.  I do remember doing that.
Story_ID: 2261
Speaker 1: And what, what was Chicago [Illinois] like when you got here?  I mean what was the atmosphere  like here?
Speaker 2: I thought Chicago smelled funny.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were the stockyards still --
Speaker 2: Yeah, the stockyards was still -- it was still, in the, and the sounds.  Their sounds were  different.  I, I can remember driving -- the young lady I was with, you know, she drove  part of the way and, and I, I had the last leg coming into Chicago.  And pulled up to Lake  Shore Drive and had to pull over.  I had -- cars were just going too -- there were too many  cars and I had just never seen that many cars.  I said, you have to take over here.  And the  sounds were, were different.  It just, you know, the sounds and at night, the sirens.  You  very seldom heard a siren in my hometown.  So I got -- it took me some time to get  accustomed to the smell and the "L" and the buses and the food.  The food was different,  you know, just not the kind I was, I was used to the kind of a home-cooked meal or  something.  I mean that was no more, that was no more, no more to be done.  Of course, you know, I  gradually got acclimated to it and still alive.
Story_ID: 2262
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the , what was the toughest thing about the city [Chicago, Illinois] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Toughest probably was that you gotta have a job.  That's the, that was one of the tough  experiences I went through, being locked out the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  I, I remember telling the lady  on the desk, I can't call her name now, I said, "I don't think I can make it."  She said, "Son, if  you can't find Chica, a job in Chicago, you can't find a job."  And I remember that.  I went  out and found one and eventually went back and paid my rent too that I owed the YMCA.
Speaker 1: Did they have your belongings in there locked up or something and then when they  confiscate your stuff?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have much anyway, but I don't remember.  I, I think, I never recall that.  I  must have had something to take with me to the other house.  Maybe they pulled everything  out of the room, but no, I couldn't get back in that room.
Story_ID: 2263
Speaker 1: Now, you worked for the Chicago State Hospital for years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from 19 -- 1963 up until like '68 [1968] or '69 [1969].  Then went into business, a 'Jack 'N the  Box.'  I had a, you know, restaurant, South, couple places on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and one out in  Harvey [Illinois].  I kind of moved around from one franchise to the other franchise.
Story_ID: 2264
Speaker 1: I just want to go back a little bit to '68 [1968] because that's the year that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed.  Now, how did that effect you, having personally known him?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, for, for some reason, it was Fri -- it was a Friday, and, and I was -- I  always sleep on the side -- I don't know (unclear) strange things you can remember in  some things.  I always slept on the side of the bed.  And for some reason, I was sleeping  in the middle of the bed.  And as the announcement was -- and I'm sleep.  And as the  announcement was being made that Dr. King had been shot in Memphis [Tennessee], I just rose up  out of the bed.  And I knew at that moment he was dead.  I knew from, you know.  And I  was living at 6810 S. Union [Chicago, Illinois] on the 22nd Floor.  Of course, by that time I was married.  And I remember the riots and actually, we slept on the floor, you know.  We didn't want  any stray bullets coming through the house.  It was a, it was just a, it was a moment that I  will always remember where I was and what I was doing and how sad I felt that the man  who had sacrificed all would end up being assassinated.  It just, you know, you can kill  the dreamer, but you can't kill the dream.
Story_ID: 2265
Speaker 1: Did you have any interaction with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] when he came to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I saw him.  I, I saw him a couple of times here, here in Chicago but didn't have the, the  kind of intimacy that we had, that I had in Montgomery [Alabama].  And I think that, actually, the  last time I got a chance to speak to him was at the end of the March from Selma [Alabama] to  Montgomery [Alabama].  And Dr. King and Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King were at the, were assembled at the back of  St. Jude [City of St. Jude, Montgomery, Alabama] and people were going up shaking their hand.  And that's my last intimate  moment with Dr. King, was that day behind St. Jude in Montgomery.

Speaker 1: And that march was, -- we didn't talk about that either.  That march from Selma [Alabama] to  Montgomery [Alabama] was, was a, (unclear)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) 1965?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was right after that massacre on the Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama], right, right,  after?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, that was two Sundays before when they, 'Bloody Sunday' they called it.  They,  John Lewis and them were, and William, Reverend [Hosea] Williams.  Reverend Williams was  leading the march over Edmund Pettus Bridge and they were attacked on, on, as  they, as they were, as they were really kind of beginning the march.  When I saw that on television that  Sun -- I think it was on Sunday.  I'm sure it was a Sunday.  I knew I was going back  home.  You know, I didn't know -- I didn't know what shape or form I was going to go  in, but I knew I was going back.  And I remember telling the principal of the school at the  State [Chicago State Hospital]. He said, "When are you coming back?"  I said, "I don't know when I'm coming back.  I  don't know if I'm going to come back.  I'll let you know."  And I -- they had made an  announcement that they were going to march.  And I flew to, from here [Chicago, Illinois] to Atlanta [Georgia].  And I  remember getting on a plane with my sleeping bag and all this stuff and this white  woman said, "Yeah, you rebel rousers from the North coming down here starting all this  trouble."  I said, "Lady, you know, I'm from here.  You know, I'm from Montgomery,  Alabama.  And I feel that I need to be here."  And we flew on a prop plane.  I think I, I haven't  been on a prop -- I don't think I've been on a prop plane since then from, from Hodge  Field to Dandy Field in, in Montgomery [Alabama].  And I'm going home and my mother [Patsy Pesant] begged  me not to go.  She just you know, "Don't, don't, don't go down there."  And I said, "I got  to go."  And one of my relatives said, "You know, you need to take a weapon with you."  I  said, "No, you know, I can't do that."  You know, I mean this is a -- I come this far,  philosophy and the psychology of the movement that it has to be non-violent.  If I, if I do  something like that, then I, you know, then the movement suffers.  And we, he drove me,  one of my relatives drove me to Selma.  And I, we got down near Brown Chapel [AME Church, Selma, Alabama]  or wherever it was and, and there was a lot of meetings and, you know, press and  everything.  And I got assigned to someone's home.  (Unclear) and I remember taking  my sleeping bag and sleeping on the floor, waking up that morning, smelling that,  smelling that bacon, biscuits and, ah, that was a wonderful, was a wonderful breakfast.  And we went on, got up, packed and went on over to Brown's Chapel.  And, and we  started going through Selma.  And I don't, somewhere, I wasn't in the front.  I was  somewhere in the middle.  So as we went over Edmund Pettus Bridge, all of a sudden it  stopped.  Now, of course, the communication, the walkie-talkies were not as  sophisticated as they are today, so I really didn't know what was going on.  I mean you  couldn't reach and pull your cell phone out and call anybody, wasn't no cell phones.  And I said to myself, well, this is, if this is the day, I accept it.  I'm going to take  somebody with me.  I mean probably a horrible thing to say, but that's the way, that's the  way I felt.  But what actually was happening is that they were having a prayer meeting on  the other side of the bridge, and fool, could have fooled me.  I found that out later.  And  we ended -- we, from that point to where the, where they had the, the, I guessn you could  call it a massacre or the brawl that two Sundays ago they were having a special prayer  meeting, you know, for the people got hurt.  And then we marched on till late evening.  And we got put in this big field and the tent was up and it was kind of chilly.  And I  remember they had these big blowers and a few little planes watching and the National  Guard because people was, was sitting on their lawns, you know, with their shotguns,  saying, "Nigger, step over here, you know."  You know, "I dare you to step on my, my land,"  you know.  I felt pretty good about my -- I, I just -- I guess sometimes you just have  to accept things as they are.  And if I was going to have to die that day, then, you know, it  was just going to happen.  And that was that Sunday, and somewhere along the line, they,  they cut it back to two thousand or two hundred.  I forgot what it was, you know, they, you know, they  didn't want as many people to march.  And the Governor [George Wallace] was this and that.  And the FBI  was concerned.  And I don't know, somehow I got in, got in that number of people who  were going to march the whole way.  And we marched to another camp and then there --  I remember being in Lowndes County [Alabama] which was notorious when I was a young man, you know,  for black people disappearing and lynches and so forth.  And, of course, it was an  integrated group of people saying, you know, if anything will happen, it's going to be this  night.  Well, fortunately, we went on, but didn't anything on the march.  And we went  into Montgomery on a Thursday and I remember passing Danley fa, Danley Field and  remember Harry Belafonte standing on the side.  He had just gotten off a plane and  shaking his hand.  And we went on into to -- was that Thursday, yeah, I think, yeah, went  on into Montgomery.  And we had, I think the next day -- I forgot.  I'm getting my days  mixed up, but anyway we marched into the chapel the next day.  And I think that next  day was the dispersement.
Story_ID: 2267
Speaker 1: But that night, what marked the the whole march [from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, 1965] was that Viola Liuzzo  was, was murdered.  She was a courier between Selma and Montgomery.  And she was  running people between Selma and Montgomery.  I had never seen a town clear so fast.  There must have been fifty thousand people in Montgomery for the end of that march, and  people just disappeared.  I mean, cause people were just -- I don't know what they was --  plane, buses, trucks, horses and buggies.  They were, they got out of town.  And I  remember my uncle telling me, because he lived near Selma, that he was literally behind  her when she was, when she was murdered.  So --
Speaker 2: She was shot from a car.
Speaker 1: Shot from a car, moving car.  I remember the exact hour (unclear) our attorneys say, one  of the night clubs in there and people came in and said, "There's been a murder."  And that  cut the fun out cause the victory was over as far as I was concerned, cause everybody was  concerned, you know, everybody going to be shot.  They thought there was really going to be a  massacre.  But it didn't, it didn't turn out that way.  So that was the march.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well before the march, you know, they were, there were all kinds of  proclamations from the [Ku Klux] Klan about what they were going to do --
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: -- what they -- and so, I mean to actually go out there and put yourself at risk was  something to consider, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was something to consider, but I, you know, here again, you know, people,  people, you know, like my mother [Patsy Pesant] said, you know, why not, why not someone else.  You  know, why not me?  I think people individually have to make decisions about what  they're going to do in life, you know.  I can't always look to someone else doing  something when I don't want to do it.  And it was my decision to, to make, you know, to  leave my job and to, to go to Montgomery with the possibility of being hurt, lynched or  whatever.  But that's what I thought I should do.  And I don't, I don't regret I did it.  Could have been fatal, but somebody got to take a chance.  I mean it's my freedom that  I'm talking about so I thought it was, you know -- I just thought at that particular time  that was what I should do and, and as I think about it now, would I, I would more than gladly  do it all over, and I would have done more if I had to do it all over.
Story_ID: 2268
Speaker 1: Let's pick back up, I guess, to when you finished at Chicago State Hospital,  now, I guess you were only gone -- you weren't gone long enough to jeopardize your job  or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I had an understanding with the principal, but I was, I was going to the March  from Selma to Montgomery [Alabama].  At the particular time, I didn't know how long it was going  to take.  And nobody well, you know, in three days or four days, you're going to do this and  you're going to do that.  And there were no details.  There was no itinerary, you know,  saying at 8:00 o'clock, we're going to be here.  You kind of went there, and somebody  got on the speaker and said we're moving.  And so I told him, you know, I think I had  enough days.  I -- my job was not jeopardy.  I said I would be back when I get back.
Story_ID: 2269
Speaker 1: Now, how'd you get involved with 'Jack N' the Box'?  This is 1968, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'd been looking, and, you know, I always tried to run away from  teaching for some reason, from education, but there were always signs that I should be  doing it.  And, you know, after I thought, you know, getting into 'Jack 'N the Box' would  be my way of, out of it, you know.  You know, I tried it for a while and got dragged back  into education.  There have always been little signs.  I remember the Sunday before the four girls were bomb, bombed at the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama], that one week to the hour, I  was on that corner before, 9:30, September 8th, I believe it was.  And the next Sunday, at  9:30, around 9:30, those girls -- of course, I was, that was a, to me that was a kind of a  signature, you know, that you, you need to be something, you need to be doing something else.  And leaving Chicago State Hospital and going into, into the restaurant business was, was  my way of trying to get out of education.  And I got into, into the business aspect of it and  there was a friend of mine who taught at the hospital, came by my house and said he was  on sabbatical from, from Gary School System [Indiana], that someone needed to be the Guidance  Director at Providence St. Mel [Chicago, Illinois].  I said I don't need a job.  I got a job.  (Laughter).  You know, I didn't need nothing extra. But somehow he was very insistent about.  Like I said, I, I had bought a new house, and  my brother-in-law and I, and I needed to buy some furniture, you know.  So I figured  well, you know, make a few dollars here.  Came over and interviewed, interviewed for the  job and got the job as the Director of Guidance.  And --
Speaker 1: You still maintained the 'Jack 'N the Box'?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I maintained the 'Jack 'N the Box' because it was a 24-hour, you know, 24/7  business.  And, of course, my supervisors were always wondering where I was in the day,  you know.  And I'd always say, well, I was working the night shift, you know.  You  know, I work a night shift.  I knew it wasn't coming out then, but they eventually, you  know, got tired of me pulling these tricks on them.  And then I had to make a, I had to  make a, I had to make a decision.  I had to make a decision -- this was after, oh, I'm  trying to get these days fmxed up.  I had to make a decision, you know, whether I should  stick with my 'Jack 'N the Box' or go to Providence-St. Mel.  And the long and short of it, I  decided that I would go to Providence-St. Mel because of the, the advice of a relative.  When I was offered the principalship in and  -- when was it? 70 -- I guess it was, I guess '72 [1972].  I  asked his advice and he suggested that I take the job. "For fifteen thousand dollars?" He said, "Yeah, I think you should take it." And I took  the job.  And the rest of it's history.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, it's history we need to know about.
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter).
Story_ID: 2270
Speaker 1: Providence-St. Mel at the time was a Catholic school (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: It was Catholic school, is a merger of St. Mel's, boys' school, and Providence, the girls'  school and was housed in the girls' school on Central Park [Chicago, Illinois].  The merger came in '68 [1968] when the two schools came together because of financial reasons.  Unfortunately, it was  not a very good marriage.  The Sisters of Providence and the Christian Brothers.  It just didn't  -- it was not -- from what I understand, it just wasn't properly planned.  And there was  bickering between the Sisters and the Brothers.  And they tried to operate two schools in  one school, the girls on the first and second floor.  The third floor, buffer zone.  Fourth  and fifth was the boys.
Speaker 1: So they had a buffer zone?
Speaker 2: They had a buffer zone.  Two administrations.  The boys came in one door.  The girls  came in another door.  Two, two separate graduations.  I just think -- the repercussions of  that, I still think linger now.  You know, after those, you know, some nearly thirty-five, thirty-five years  ago.  So it was, it had a shaky start.  And the Christian Brothers left in 70 -- they pulled  out in '71 [1971] or '72 [1972] -- '71 I believe.  They just said, "Look, we're out of here."  So then it was,  you know, and now it becomes a, a problem or burden for the Sisters of Providence and  the Archdiocese of Chicago.  That's who -- the building was leased to the Archdiocese  for a dollar a year with provisions that they would maintain the building.  Unfortunately,  they didn't maintain the building.  You know, there were holes in the roof and bathroom  didn't work.  It's a number of things.  Boilers were out, you know, not working properly.  Just, just was not properly maintained.  And so, you know, it now ends up, an Archdiocesan school on the property owned by the Sisters of Providence.  And so when I  became principal, they asked me to become principal, when I became principal in '72 [1972], I  didn't -- I just, you know, I guess becausemy uncle thought I should do it, I took on the job not  thinking about financial, you know, consequences, you know.  My wife, at the time,  thought about them, but I thought this might be an opportunity to do something because  of my experience of the few months that I had been there as the Director of Guidance,  you know, there was something about that school and I, you know, I just that, that made  me feel that this, this is, this school is a, is a workable institution, and we could turn  things around.  The kids were running school when I got there.  But I became principal and we  kind of -- we turned it around.  You know, we made some rules and structures and who  should be there, who should not be there.  You know, we would not tolerate this and  tolerate that.  And we had this, you know, it was a new staff.  And we made this thing  work (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 2271
Speaker 1: What were some of your specific, you know, moves here to, to restructure this?
Speaker 2: Well, I should have brought my little booklet along.  We kind of rewrote the curriculum as to what students were taking, you know.  Students would not do the electing.  Who  would do the electing.  Attendance.  Dress.  Behavior.  Drugs, gangs, were out.  And I --  and people say you have to take, you know, it takes years and years to turn the things  around.  I, I, and I'm just going by memory, but I think within a year we had turned the  place around because I remember be -- before 1974 we had gotten a letter of commendation from the Archdiocese of Chicago about how we had turned it around and the test scores had  gone up.  I think if you get enough people determined to make something  happen, it happens.  And we turned the school around.  And then in 1973, my supervisor  came by and said they were going to close the school.  So I said, "I think  I made a mistake  in my career planning here.  And --"
Speaker 1: Now, this is -- now things started turning around in seventy-what?
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972], '72, '73 [1973].  And in '73, in the fall of, actually, yeah, the fall of 70 --  yeah, actually, I think it turned around in '73, '72-'73.  And the year '73-74 [1974] school year, I got, I, my supervisor came to me in November of '73 and said they were going to close  the school in June.
Speaker 1: Now, who is your supervisor?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I can't call his name now, but he was, he was a [Christian] Brother --
Speaker 1: Catholic church?
Speaker 2: Catholic church --
Speaker 1: With the Archdiocese?
Speaker 2: With the Archdiocese.  Oh, I can't recall it now, but he was a very, very kind gentleman,  you know, who was very remorseful that he was making this kind of (unclear).  He  realized how hard we had worked to keep that, you know, keep that school open and turn  it around.  The long and short of it was that the Sisters, the Superior General of the Sisters of Providence went to see Old Man [Mayor] Richard [J.] Daley.  And the Mayor called [John] Cardinal Cody  and that was stopped, you know.  We were eventually back, we were back, back in  business.  I remember that, I remember that the Mayor sent out a bunch of people from the City of  Chicago.  I don't know what they were -- they were going to help me out or something but it  was -- I think the gesture of the Mayor at that time was greatly appreciated by myself  and, and my staff.  So we, we were back, back in business.  And one of the things was  said, you know, we weren't raising enough money.  I didn't know at the time that it was  my responsibility to raise money to be very honest about it, you know, I was the principal of the school.  I had, you  know, we was an Archdiocesan school and, you know, the little tuition that we had at  the time, I, I collected that.  So the cry, you know, that we were not raising enough  money.  We weren't this and we weren't that.  And so I became a fundraiser without any  experience.  And we went from raising like ten thousand dollars a year to raising a hundred thousand  dollars a year.  Of course, I thought that was, that was all the money in the world, and  especially when you're running the school for about three, you know, between 350 and  $400 thousand.  I thought that was substantial amount of fundraising.  And the year of 1974  came and there were two schools closing, St. Paul's and St. Michael's.  And the people  from St. Michaels came to me and said, you know, because of your experience, we'd like  for you to help us keep our school open.  So I went over and talked to the teachers and  talked to the administration and found out from the administration that they really  wanted to close the school.  Rumor in those days that they were going to close St.  Michael's and build condos.  Oh, no, no, no, we're not going to do that.
Story_ID: 2272
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) That, that was in 1978, yeah, St. Michael's staff had come to me, no, particularly the  teachers had come to me and wanted to -- since we were successful in keeping Providence-St. Mel open in 1974, that maybe I had some, few words of wisdom or strategies that we  can use to do the same for them.  And after discussing it with the staff and with the  administration, the administration were, they were in favor, it was in favor of closing the  school.  And I went to the teachers and said, "Look, you, you don't have a chance here."  The administration is supporting the closing of the school.  And I think in the earlier  session I said that, you know, that the rumor was out that, that St. Michael's was going to  be turned into condos, that area was going to be condos.  Sure enough today, there are the  condos.  But anyway, someone asked me kind of casually speaking, do you think they  would close Providence-St. Mel.  I said, "Shoot, no."  We just went through this in '73 [1973], '74 [1974].  I mean we've been doing exactly as they told us.  They told us to raise money, you know.  And it was Holy Week, 1978, Wednesday morning.  My supervisor came in and he said, I  said, "Father, you're back again this morning?"  I said, "Why are you back?" because usually  they would come out once a month, do whatever he was doing as a supervisor.  And he  said, well, you know, I have bad news for you.  I said, well, I -- you know, bad news  doesn't, really doesn't bother me, you know.  I said, "Come into the office."  He came in the  office and closed the door.  And he said, you know, we have decided to close the school.  I said, "What do you mean, 'We have decided to close the school.'?"  He said, "We, we have  made the decision, decision that Providence-St. Mel will close."  I said, "Father, I don't  remember, recall being asked or, or consulted about this."  He said, "Well, you -- we didn't  have to consult you.  You know, we make the decisions."  So I felt my steam building up.  And I said, now, I'd better control myself because I literally wanted to take him and  throw him out the window.  And I figured that was not the thing that I should do.  So I, I - - we had a, it was verbal confrontation because he wanted me to call the teachers in to  the auditorium or whatever in my office and tell them that the school. I said, "I'm not telling  them the school's closing."  This is Holy Week and Good Friday, and I mean, you know,  we're not, not here on Good Friday.  People were going -- I had a group of kids going  to London [England], educational tour or something.  Teachers going on vacation.  I said, "I'm not  going to tell these people right before the Easter break that, you know, the school's going  to close.  I'm not going to do it."  So somehow in, in, in all of this transfer of energy that  was going between us, disagreement.  And I disagreed with what he, what he was saying.  Of course, he disagreed with what I was saying and telling me in essence, you know, "What you say  doesn't count."  And that's why I'm probably sitting here.  That's why I am sitting here  today.  But we did agree that we would not announce this until after vacation, after Easter  break.  Somehow it leaked to the newspaper.
Story_ID: 2273
Speaker 1: Now, was this the visit that the [John] Cardinal [Cody] made it to or was it --
Speaker 2: No, the Cardinal had been there a year before.  That was the Cardinal and Monsignor  Bracken were there in 1977.  This is now 1978.  And my supervisor of, of the high school  is now coming in to tell me, not to consult with me, but to tell me that they were going to  close Providence-St. Mel.  And I was just insulted as a man that they would have the nerve  to come and tell me that they were going to close the school without at least talking to me  about it.  And as I think about it, I would have probably agreed.  I knew the financial  circumstances of the school and that the place was in disrepair, you know.  I'm fairly  bright.  But I was not -- I was told.  And I just felt that, you know, my, my position  at the  school had been demeaned and no, no one had consulted the parents.  No one had  consulted the administration.  And I think that I made the decision then that, you know,  I'm going to fight this, with what I don't know, but I did, I knew because of the way it  was brought to me, that I was going to find a way to keep that school open.  I had no idea.  I didn't have a dime because we were -- the budget was set up in such a way that you  presented your budget the year before.  And they knew exactly how much money you  had.  And they knew I had, I was going into my fourth quarter, beginning of my fourth quarter,  that the salaries and everything was there.  So I didn't have any money to work with.  You know, I couldn't, you know, so it leaked out the next week.  '[Chicago] Tribune,' Providence-St.  Mel closing  And I was in my favorite city, Las Vegas [Nevada], when they called.  And I  did a, did a interview over the radio, and I said, "We're not going to close.  We, we're  going to find a way to keep the school open."  Of course, my supervisor said, "Oh, you just,  you're just making a lot of noise."  I said, "Well, there's really going to be a lot of noise."  And we, we -- it became kind of that, it was one of, one of my favorite people, Harvey Gross,  who was, who really helped me organize this particular movement.  I became the David  and Goliath.  And here's a little black school on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] fighting to stay  open.  And we were the darlings of the newspaper and magazines and, and T.V. shows.  And this struggle ran from March until, oh, July.  And in that time, who -- the people  who really kept the school open were the Sisters of Providence because the property  belonged to them.  And with all the pressure put on the Sisters of Providence, they stood  tall.  And I went to, of course, without having any money, I, I wanted to approach Sister  Loretta Schaefer who was then the Superior General of the Sisters of Providence with the  idea of leasing the building.  We didn't have any money and we had a little clandestine  meeting over here on North Avenue [Chicago, Illinois].  And I went into the meeting and she was there and  her support staff and myself and I think Harvey Gross.  And I said, "Sister Loretta, I'd like  to lease the building from you." She said, "I, I won't lease it to you."  And my heart just hit  the floor because I knew it was all over.  She said, "But I'll sell it to you."  I said, "Well,  Sister, I don't have any money."  She said, "I know, but you'll find it."  And that was truly  beginning of, of the Providence-St. Mel because the Sisters had now taken a stand that  education was going to remain on, remain, at that time I guess we called it Catholic  education, would remain on the West, on the West Side of Chicago.  And between  negotiation with the Sisters and the, the Archdiocese of Chicago, we agreed on July 1st  that, you know, the school be transferred over to the corporation that I put together.  On  July 1, we celebrated.  No money --but in the process of, of, we raised about  $200 thousand and we were open, we were open right -- we were actually never closed.
Story_ID: 2274
Speaker 1: We opened up as a independent school in, in September and with all of the media at the time,  it was just only there was ABC, CBS and NBC.  It wasn't no CNN and CLTV and all  these other affiliates, none of those people because they were, just didn't exist.  And we  were the darling of the press for a year, but you -- as with the press, any, any story gets  old.  And it became a old story.  You know, I mean, how, you know, how many times can  you do an interview about a school?  I mean good news, you know, if it don't, if  it don't bleed, it won't lead.  And we wasn't bleeding so, but I guess we were bleeding in  one way, but it, it was the story that had just run it, run its course.  And '79 [1979] was the, was  the telling year.  Now, we're not in the press, you know.  We're not, you know, being  interviewed.  And I remember December of '79 telling Tom Powers, one of our Board  members, I said, "Tom, I just don't think we're going to make it."  I said, "We got Christmas  coming up, teachers need to be paid the time they are out."  And we run through all,  (unclear) and that, all the Bingo money had been put into the bank, cleaned out the pop  machines.  All the candy money.  I really don't think it's going to work.  And Tom said  to me, you know, something will work out.  And this is a true story.  The phone rang.  And on the other end of the phone was a gentleman that I don't know who -- he said that I represent  an anonymous donor.  I need to talk to your attorney.  Gave him the attorney's number.  Making a long story short, the attorney called me back and said, there's someone, an  anonymous donor would like to make a forty-seven thousand dollar donation to you.  That saved our life.  I  mean it literally saved us, forty-seven thousand dollars in 1979 was a lot of money.  And we went on from  that point and got a donation from Coleman Foundation for a million dollars.  And the  [John D. and Catherine T.] MacArthur Foundation for, I think, for a total of $600 thousand from them in, in the early, in  the early years.  And we're still here, still sending kids to college.

Speaker 1: Now, one of the features of the stories about Providence-St. Mel was the academic  performance of the students, the students.  I mean it was, from what I knew, the way it was framed in the press, is that here you had a successful school where students are, are  achieving and they go on off to college.  And you don't see that in the public schools around  here, you know, very, very seldom you see a (unclear) in,
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: -- in the other Catholic schools at the, to the level that it's being --
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: - acted out here.  So I mean now, what was -- can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you know, we -- there's a comparison about the Catholic schools and  public school.  You know, but the real, the final analysis, we gotta, we're going to  have to find a way to get our public schools in the inner city to be successful because the  private school sector is not going to be able to replace the infrastructure of the public,  public school.  But I, I've always thought the easiest part of my job, and I, I can honestly  say this after, after thirty-two years.  I mean, you know, of being in the trenches, the easiest part  of my job is teaching, raising the, the academic level.  The tough part is raising money.  I,  I, all young people, children want to be successful.  And if you give them the opportunity  to be successful, they just grab for it.  I mean it, it's almost like sponges.  They just, they  just suck it up.  You put competent teachers around them, that understand that they, that  the philosophy of this school is to move these young people to next step, and it works.  I,  I just, I just find it very difficult, you know, as I go around the country, people telling me  about kids can't, you know, they kids can't do the work.  Now, Providence-St. Mel, we  run, you know, the administration runs the Providence-St. Mel.  I mean, you know, there are  no, politics in it at all.  I mean, you know, we, we, we set the rules and regulations.  If  you don't like them, you can take a step out.  You know, I always tell people, this is  Chicago [Illinois].  If you don't like the service that we provide, there are many other institutions  in the City of Chicago.  It might cost you a little more, but you can, you can find it in  Chicago.
Story_ID: 2276
Speaker 1: I think the pleasure part of my job is, is seeing youngsters progress to the next  level, going on to some of the best universities in the country.  Last year, 202 [2002], 42 percent  of our seniors went to the top universities in the country.  This year 203 [2003], probably 50  percent.  And I would project, oh, five or six years from now, it's going to be 80 percent  because we're starting, you know, we now have a kindergarten and a lower school and a  middle school.
Story_ID: 2277
Speaker 1: And this, this year, you know, there's going to be some 50 percent [of senior graduates going to top universities] and it's  based on the fact that we start early.  If I had, you know, I had the finances, I would start  school at age three.  But I would need to build a new facility.  So I, in, in my dreams I would  like to have a 24/7 day care kind of thing provided here on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], you know,  The  latest in technology and the best in curriculum, with some of the best people in the country  working for Providence-St. Mel.  We would, we would turn, we would turn the world  upside down because kids are like sponges.  I was -- just the other day there was a kid,  well, one of my kindergarteners had came in to read to me.  That's fun.  And it, we,  we do things that, you know, that are, that are very simple.  I mean we work for the  students.  I mean we, we are there for them.  We expose them to as many things as we  possibly can, which, you know, we are in all kind of competitions, all over the city.  We're big into the, to fine arts, music, art.  I think those are really great supporters of a  top aca -- academic edu -- education.  And what we do, anyone else in the country could do.  I  mean we don't, let's not make this like rocket science, you know.  The attitude of the  people that were in schools should be of such that they are service, they are servants to  the students.  You keep that attitude in mind, then you will see the reciprocal effects of  that.  The kids will gravitate to you.  The behavior changes.  I have the same youngsters in  my school that are in the public schools in the neighborhood.  The same ones.  Seventy- eight percent of my students come from within a three-mile radius of the school.
Story_ID: 2278
Speaker 1: Now, is there a selection process for Providence-St. Mel or how do you pick the students  (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we make an assessment of the students.  We like to know who -- they're tested  using the Terra Nova [Test] as an assessment tool.  But that's, that's to, to gauge where you are  and where we should place you.
Speaker 1: But can't anybody (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  We're accepting students as low as the 25th percentile in some cases.  I mean  that's, I consider that walking on water.  Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that in four  years those kids are going to go to the top university, but I will tell you that some of  those kids will be going to four-year universities in this country.  They are going to be  successful people.  They're going to be good citizens.  They're going to be able to raise  their family and send their children to institutions of higher education.  That's what this is  all about.  This, what, what we are about is, is a formation of good citizens.  You know,  great family people. People who understand the value of education.  So the things that we  do at Providence-St. Mel which are, you know, we're not any, you know, it's not a secret  about what we do.  It's a lot of hard work on, on the, on the backs of faculties, of faculty  and the support people.  These are very competent people who spend literally twenty-four hours a  day.  I mean even when you're sleep, you're thinking about it.  But they, they put forth  the energy in those classrooms that almost, that, that just transform these students,  transform these children into, to great individuals.  And it's just that simple.  I mean we,  we put together a system where it's hard -- that you have to, you have to really work to  fail.  I mean we have a interventions, we have in intervention that's basically been form --  formulated by the, the new principal, that if you're not doing your work, on a school day,  you go to school from 3:15 to 5:15.  If that doesn't work, you go to school from 9:00 to 12:00 on Saturdays.  So the emphasis, you know, you're here to get an education.  We  have a honor assembly so students who are successfully academic are put in front of  everyone.
Story_ID: 2279
Speaker 1: You know years ago when I first started, we used to give kids cash for making the  honor roll.  Now, we give them stock, we learn a little about the stock.  Yeah, we let them  learn about the economic system.  It's amazing in this country that it's so into capitalism,  we don't teach kids much about money.  So we are attempting to do that by awarding our  students stock.  And we, we -- as a -- being a fiduciary responsibility of, of the holding  the stock, we encourage them that when they leave Providence-St. Mel, that they keep the  stock and diversify, etc., etc., etc.  We expose our kids to, to the world of travel.  One of  our former Board members, Tom Dettner, who really took the rock off my shoulder or  my chest should I say, came in back in the early nineties [1990s] and put together a program we call  'SOUL,' Summer Opportunity Of a Lifetime where we send kids all over the world to  educational experiences.  We send, well approximately, little over, a little over a hundred  students each year to Europe and Asia and Africa and the East Coast or boarding schools  and camping experiences at Nolls and Upward Bound and Rollers Travels.  The younger  kids are in camps all over, all over the Midwest.  That exposure, they learn that the world  is not the West side of Chicago.  And he said, well, how do you do it?  Well, of course,  we couldn't afford these programs.  We get scholarships to -- we're very fortunate the  past twelve years, United Airlines has been flying these kids to these various programs.  I  mean without the support of United Airline and supporters around the, around the  country, we wouldn't be able to do these things.  But you, you could find a way to do  these kind of things.  And it, I, I was talking to another administrator of a school who has  a very successful school, and he said, you know, his, his students were, who were -- that  academically qualified, however they were dropping out.  Well, you find very few of our  students that drop out because we have exposure early.  You know, they're going out  hitting, you know, meeting the competition, that, you know.  We have students  competing with students from some of the best schools in the world.  And our youngsters  are doing, are doing quite well.  We, we were, we commissioned Loyola University,  Carol, does their research, community research.  Found out that 73 percent of our  students are finishing college whereas the nation's is only, what, 53 percent.  I think that  speaks well.  That's not my research.  That's the research being done by Loyola  University here in Chicago.  So we feel that we are, we are making a difference and, and  the point I want to make is that, other institutions can do the same thing.  It's just we, we  somehow put the responsibility of education, that the students don't want to do it or the  parents.  Well, you know, tell me something I don't know.  You know, tell me, you  know, you -- we knew all the problems, the drugs and the dysfunctional families.  But we  approach it from the point of view that here's an opportunity where you could change  your life.  You know, we, we got it here.  And, you know, kids say, but, oh, I got all these  problems.  And I say, I used to tell them, you know, if you listen to me for the next 4  years and go on to college and if you really need some help, then you can be able to  afford to, to buy it.  But all I want you to do the next 4 years and, and actually, the next 8  years, is to listen and (unclear) you might not understand all I'm saying.  So just do, you  know, we're, we're not going to, we're not going to steer you in the wrong direction.  Many of them listen.  You know, they, they grumble about the school with all the strict  rule and they got the uniform and you can't do this and you can't do that.  And, you  know, we go to school, you know, every day almost.  I mean very snow days and we're  there Dr. Martin Luther King day and, and Columbus Day and Washington and all them  other folks days.  We're in school.  You can't, anyway,, you can't catch up by taking off.
Story_ID: 2280
Speaker 1: What about the involvement of the parents?  Do you have a -- are the parents (unclear)  involved in (unclear) --
Speaker 2: Yeah, well --
Speaker 1: -- (unclear) are we in a situation here where, where there are not many parents that  (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, most of the, most, most -- many -- well, most of the youngsters are from single  parent, mothers, you know, mothers run the home.  And they're working and, you know,  trying to provide the, the fees for them to, for them to go to Providence-St. Mel.  We don't  have a parents advisory committee and all that kind of business.  And, you know,  parents run the school and that's, you know, unless you want to pay the bill, you can't run  this place.  The parents in the lower school, kindergarten and lower school, are much  more active, very much more active.  In fact, we have parents in, I guess, from  kindergarten to up to second or third grade, those parents come in one Saturday a month,  talking about their children, and how they can help us make their children better students  at Providence-St. Mel.  And it's working.  I mean that the scores -- should have had them in front of me -- the  scores are, at the elementary level, are just phenomenal.  You know, the kids are a year,  year and a half ahead of, of the, of schools in the nation.  And, you know, the, we can see  the effects of the early exposure to a structured education, that those youngsters who  now, are now coming into our high school, are the tops in their class.  You know, they,  they, they're the ones taking all the, the advanced subjects.  And we're now remodeling,  re, re-fabricating our lab that haven't been touched since 19 -- 1928.  We're spending some  ten million dollars through a bond to redo our, our biology and our physics and chemistry and  we're adding a general science.  We're putting in a new fine arts center.  We expect to  get results from that, from that investment, you know.  I expect in the next three years to  have the top science students in the country coming out of Providence-St. Mel because we,  you know, it's, you know, going to take a long time for somebody to pay this, pay this  bond off.  But we ex -- we expect immediate results from that.  It's going to be state of the  art.  We're not leaving anything out.  So we, we, we hope, we hope not, we will have  some of the top science students in the country coming out of Providence-St. Mel in the  next few years.

Speaker 1: Now, you are not a Catholic.
Speaker 2: I'm not.  I'm a, I'm a Protestant, Baptist (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you, you weren't from the very beginning, you know --
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: -- when you started.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was there a concern about that when you, when you first started?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there might have been a concern, I didn't know it until we got into this, you  know, the, the problem of the school closing.  People found out that I was Protestant, but  when they hired me, they didn't ask me my religion.  They asked me, you know, if, you  know, what I'd, what I'd -- they wanted me to be the principal of the school and then it  kind of, really didn't become a factor until we, you know, we started this business of  them trying to close the close the school, that I was not, I was not Catholic.  And it  probably was a concern for them.  It wasn't a concern for me.  My job was to educate  these, educate these children and do my very best because of the crisis to keep the school  open.  And that's what I did.  So, you know, there are, you know, people who probably,  you know, see that, saw that, saw that as a problem and see that as a problem, but it's not  been a problem to me at all.
Story_ID: 2282
Speaker 1: You not being a Catholic in a Catholic school situation, which, of course, the school is not, it's not a  Catholic school now, as such --
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: It's not a --
Speaker 2: No. Christian-based I would say.
Speaker 1: And you, that, that you still retain, I think from what I've, from what I've heard, you  retain a strong --
Speaker 2: Religion class.
Speaker 1: -- value (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Value, absolutely.  Moral foundation, I think that's critical in educating, you know.  I  mean you got -- I guess you could call it something else in a public school.  So I think you, you  could do the same as we do if you call it value education.  I mean you can change the  terminology to anything you want to do, but I think if you get people concerned about the  welfare of others, you know.  Charity, remember, they say, "Charity begins at home."  And  then spread it around. You need to be concerned about in the school, you might be  concerned about it in the community. If you're there, you might go to, to your  neighborhood or to your side of the town and to the, you know, it spreads from that point of  view.  So I, I think it's, it's critical from our standpoint of view of teaching people to be  concerned about others.
Speaker 1: How often do students get, get like a, a value orientation or is it --
Speaker 2: Every day.
Speaker 1: -- integrated into everything you do or --
Speaker 2: Well, it's integrated into everything.  But we have specialized, specific religion classes,  but I, I think education is the, is an integrated process.  I mean it's intertwined in  everything, everything you do to make it a much more practical, you know, education.
Story_ID: 2283
Speaker 1: Now, do you make a special attempt to teach African American history and culture at, at  Providence-St. Mel [School]?
Speaker 2: No, we don't make a special attempt, but we teach it.  I mean we're not, I guess the word  Afrocentric.  We aren't, you know, we're not that.  But we do teach African American  history.
Speaker 1: You know, you know, the reason why I asked because a lot of schools don't teach any of  it, and that's the only (simultaneous) (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think you, you know, you don't know where you're going till you know where  you've been.  So I do think history is a, is a predictor of what you should do or what  mistakes you have made, that you don't make them, that you don't make them again.  And, and one of the reasons I am so against Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday being a  holiday for, for children being out of school.  I just, you know, I always thought that we  would celebrate Dr. King's birthday by closing the businesses and giving people an  opportunity, the leaders of, of industry to go and speak in school and parents the  opportunity to go to school with their children for one day to celebrate Dr. King's  birthday.  We celebrate a man who's, who was pivotal in the Civil Rights Movement,  who education was critical in his lifetime.  And we celebrate it by closing the schools.  Now, now, Sears [Department Store] is open, but the public schools are closed.  I mean, I'm trying to figure  out, you know, what's going on here, you know,  You know, we're having Dr. King  sales, pro basketball games.  It, you know, and I, and I love basketball.  You know, but get  a, get a grip here.  And I, I've been criticized.  People have taken their children out of  school.  Hey, in Chicago [Illinois] you sure could find somewhere else to go.  But I tell you one  thing, my children are going to remember Dr. King.  They're going to remember what he,  what he sacrificed and what he did.  You go out and ask the, you know, the average child  in the City of Chicago, black or white, "Tell me about Dr. King."  Very little.  And nothing.  "Who?" you know.  You know, if, if, you know, if everybody, and I told someone the other  day, if everybody knew who Casimir Pulaski was, then maybe we should take off that  day, public schools should take off that day.  I bet you most people couldn't tell you who  Casimir Pulaski was if their life depended on it.  Schools are closed.  You know,  [Abraham] Lincoln's birthday and President's Day and Veterans Day.  You think of all the time that  the schools are closed when children in those institutions are behind.  And we need to,  you know, when we start, you know, if we, if we start multiplying the, the hours and the  minutes, then you can see why many of our children behind, huh?  Go to school at 9:00  o'clock, 9:00 o'clock, you're out at 2:30.  Every month you got a half-day off for this  and that and the other, you know.  You pull all that time together -- I don't know, I don't  know whether anybody's done the research of this, pull all that time together.  And you'd  be amazed at how much time children missed out of school and then children not going to  school.  You know, there's no --
Speaker 1: Serious (unclear) of --
Speaker 2: You know, they're not -- there's no serious -- I mean if you're out, at Providence-St. Mel, five  days, we'll put you out. Period.  You know, we, we have rules that we follow.  Don't  have rules that you don't follow. It's a waste of time.  And so I mean the, the  success of our school is the simplicity of it.  Let's not make this stuff, let's not make this  so difficult.
Story_ID: 2284
Speaker 1: Children want to learn, then you need people around them who can teach,  who can guide them.  You can't -- you don't get an idiot around them.  So you don't need  somebody who, as I said, I don't need nobody to save them.  I need somebody to teach  who's competent in that particular area and can do it better than anybody else.  They'd be  able to pass that information and their knowledge off to the children.
Speaker 2: So how do you recruit teachers and do teachers often, do they hear about the school and,  and --
Speaker 1: They have heard about it.  They literally come from all over, all over the country.  They're  usually young, because we don't, you know, we in the, we aren't -- the salaries aren't  competitive.  We, we work them very hard so we have a big turnover because, you know,  it's, it's a lot of work.  I mean, you know, we have teachers coming in at 6:00 in  the morning, leaving at 7:00 at night.  And then coming in on Saturday.  So it's  more than a job.  It's a way of life.  I mean it's, it's a, you have to kind of tune it to a, that  this is kind of -- the time that I'm going to be there, I'm going, I'm going to make some  things happen.  And that's the beauty of Providence-St. Mel [School].  You could watch children  change right in front of you.  You know, the, the beauty of that, of working there is that  you could see that your work pays off.  You see kids come in and not, knowing very little  and leaving with a vast amount of knowledge who are now hungry to get a education.  They are raring to get into the best schools in the country.  It's very, and it's a, it's, it's a  competition at our school, you know.  Where are you going to college?  And so my  principal said, Ms. [Jeanette] DiBella said, even the kids in the, in the kindergarten and first grade  want to go, they want to get a -- they want a "scholar-lip."  (Laughter).  They know, even at  that particular grade level that they're going to leave Providence-St. Mel and go  somewhere else.  It's, the, the mission statement, you know, we do our mission  statement every day, you know, we're going to go out here and find a way to make one, every day.  And  so the whole atmosphere is, is engaged in moving you from one point to another point up,  not down.  We're moving you to the next position and leadership in the school, in our  school is transferred up to our seniors.  The seniors are our final product.  They represent  the leadership in the school.  And so, you know, the little kids are looking up to the big  people as they come up, you know, I want to be like (unclear) the Senior.  And so, so,  you know, the, the lot of responsibility put on our kids who are in our high school,  you know.  Because we're all in one building.  We got kindergarten to twelfth [grade], over 700  students in one building.  So they, they have to be the role model.  There's teachers who are  role models to the institution.  So are our seniors to the entire school of our senior, our  juniors and sophomores and our freshmen, you know.  They represent the leadership, and  we keep, you know, we keep them accountable.  If you don't do as we say do, good-bye.
Story_ID: 2285
Speaker 1: Now, how would you sum up your philosophy of education?
Speaker 2: I guess my philosophy of education is that if you're looking for a better way of life, of  making the impact, of changing the world, you need an education.  It becomes, education  to me becomes the, the basics of change.  People ask me, what can I do to help Providence-St. Mel [School]?  Get the best education you possibly can and then transfer that to someone else.  You could do more with a great education and being competent in your particular chosen  field.  And that's what I tell my students, you know, I, I want to -- the, the bases of this is  that I want you to change the world.  And you can change the world by getting a great  education and taking it back to your family, to your community and doing something  with it, make it work.  It's survival, you know, I mean you, we could say all the, you  know, all of the philosophical statements about education and fine arts and the, the  exposure, but it's, it's a very basic thing for me.  It's, it's life sustaining.  It take, it  changes your focus of the world.  I mean you can, your education can take you anywhere  you want to go.  You can, you can go to any heights and choose -- that you choose.  It's the, it's the  great balance.  We take our children, we send them to universities all over the country.  Now, you can't do that if the kids aren't being educated.  And therein lies the philosophy  of Providence-St. Mel of breaking the cycle of poverty.  That's what, that where -- I have a  young man now, John Fountain, whose writing a book.  And he will tell you that it was  his education that made the difference in his, in, in his life, you know.  He's now a writer  for the 'New York Times.'  In fact, I'm reading his book right as I, as I speak to you,  (unclear) speak to you now.  He's going, he's going to tell you about his education.  He's  going to tell you about his family pushing him for a better education.  And as a result, his immediate family now has changed because they're all inspired.  You know, if you  break that cycle one time, it, it's, it's just like a, a net, it just spreads out and it  pulls in everybody because if I see you, then I can.  Or I see my cousin or my sister or my  brother who has made it, and I can do the same. It, it was just the same as I, when I met  Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] when was, what, thirteen or fourteen years old.  He did it.  I can do it.  So it's a, it's a great  example of -- it can, it can set the pace for, for individuals, for communities and back to  where we kind of began, we're going to have to do the same thing in our public schools.
Story_ID: 2286
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a strong alumni --
Speaker 2: Ha (laugher) --
Speaker 1: -- presence.  Do they come back and help?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's one of my sore points.  We have great students.  One of the difficulties I've  had is, is getting my alums.  I think they're proud of their school and everything, but to  get them to understand the, that we really need their support.  It's been one of my  failures, but that was not my given responsibility.  My responsibility was to get them into  institutions of higher learning.  We've been very successful (unclear) that.  But now  getting them to reciprocate has been somewhat of a problem.  And I think that over the  years that they -- I think it takes a certain number of years for that to happen.  You got to  remember that we are basically a new school, that our records only go back to 1970 --  1978.  So we're just talking about twenty-five years, although I've been there for thirty-two years.  You're  talking about people who are now, kids who were in school, their children and some of  them will go on to college.  But, but, you know, part of that I kind of take back about the  alum.  Many of the alums now send their children to our school so I think that is a big  start, as far as I'm concerned, of the testament of what the school has done.  And we,  we have former alums sending their children to our school.  And they are sending their children to the elementary and to the lower school, which means that  they're going to be much better educated than, than their parents.
Story_ID: 2287
Speaker 1: What is your -- what are your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Education, education, education, just like location, location, location.  We have to do a  better job of educating our children in the inner city. Period.  I mean, you know, I mean  you, you know, you tell me about how well your educational system is doing.  Show  me the schools that are at the bottom of the list and tell me how well, how well they have  done.  I, I try to en -- engage a young man (unclear).  We need to focus on education almost on a  daily basis.  I mean, then in Chicago [Illinois], I would, I would like to, to take the focus and  put it on every alderperson and ask them, "How many lousy schools do you have in your  ward and how many have you improved?"  And make, you know, make that the report card  each year that you go back to these fifty aldermen, "Now, last year you had X-number of  schools that were in disrepair or, or none academically performing, how many have you  pulled out of that?"  I think that would be a great story because it, it becomes so nebulous,  you, you can't, you know, you can't put your finger on all the principals of the school.  You know, you have the [Chicago] Board of Education is kind of this, kind of out there, but make  the focus, fair or unfair, you know, of the politicians who are in these communities and  say, you know, "Let's, let's, let's do an inventory.  Let's do a baseline.  Let's find out how  many schools are, are in your ward?  How many are be -- below standards?  How many are  mediocre or in the middle?  How many at the higher level?"  And we kept a track of that over the  next eight years, I guarantee that these schools would change.  You put the -- you start  putting the pressure on somebody.  Somebody need to, somebody need to be on the hot  seat.  We have, we have, you know, they changed superintendents.  You know, you can't find him.  You  know, you find them, but they, they need more than one person whose in charge of  400 thousand people.  You know, he, they need, they need some help.  So why don't we get  the help of our politicians, you know.  Maybe they need to pull in these, their state  senators and state reps.  But my immediate concern would be the aldermen's.  It, it would  be great to, just to see what the inventory looks like, looks like on a baseline.  Find out,  right now, each ward, one through fifty, how these schools are ranked.  What are their test  scores?  I mean, you know, and put it right at the top, you know, "Alderman Whoever, is  in this ward and this is, this is your report card."  And, of course, some people would, you  know, say, "Well, it's not my responsibility."  Well, you know, we'll just make it  somebody's responsibility.

Speaker 1: But I -- and, and we must do that, and we must do it soon  because it -- you know, we keep, we keep saying we're doing this and 'No Child Left  Behind' that the President [George W. Bush] is talking about, but I don't see the inner city schools changed  that much.  I mean we got some great new schools that opened up in Chicago [Illinois], Walter  Payton [College Preparatory High School], near the North suburbs.  You can't get into those schools unless you are somewhere in  the ninetieth percentile.  Well, hello.  Those kids are going to learn anyway.  I mean, you know,  who are you kidding?  We need somebody to come into the inner city -- you know, I wish  we could do it.  And, you know, it, it, it's expensive to run a school.  We need somebody  to come in the inner city and say, in the mid -- in the inner city of Chicago, on the West  Side of Chicago, we're going to make these schools the best schools in the country.  And  it can be done.  I mean you're not going to be able to do it on a five-day schedule, you  know.  You're not going to be able to get -- the schools have to, need to be run year- around.  They need to be run from eight [o'clock] to five [o'clock], on Saturdays.  That's what it's going to  take.  Until we step up to it, we step up to the plate, and realize that it, it's much more  important to educate our kid than to send him to jail for twenty-five thousand dollars or thirty thousand dollars, more than  the -- you can send a kid to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for as much it cost to send somebody to jail.  You  know, just the economics of it is absolutely baffling to me.  In a city as large as Chicago  that the business community allows this to happen, has always floored me.  I, I, I just  don't understand because these are the same people that are going to be coming into their  employee, employment.  And that if they're not doing what they're, should be, trying to be doing,  they've got retrain them.  It costs money.  So if, if seemingly, we would spend it at an early  age, then some of these problems we wouldn't have, you know.  You know, you can  reduce the -- the population of the prisons are getting -- there're so many people in prison  now until they have to put out on early leave or whatever, whatever they do.  And you  think about all the money that's being spent in, to incarcerate people, you can take that  same amount of money and educate people.  You'd have less problems ahead.  See,  education runs across all lines.  It, it makes a difference all over, I mean it's, it's that, it's  that great lifter to any level that you want to go.  I mean it, it, it just makes so much  difference that I just don't know why we have not made a, a greater effort to make sure  that the, the least of us get the best education.  Even if it means bringing teachers in to the  inner city and paying them double, but with accountability.  So we have run schools  and people, if people's salaries go up, but nobody makes them accountable.  And nobody  says, "Well, how are the students doing?"  I think, I think if taxpayers in the City of Chicago  and, and in the (unclear) schools in the country, would say, "Look, if raising our taxes to educate  children means that they're getting a better education, fine.  But you prove it..  We're not  going --" you know, "You show me where you are, and then show me a year later where  you've gone.  Then we put the money in.  If you don't make the improvement, you stay  where you are." In some cases, I would reduce it or terminate people.  That, that would  be my, my solution to it.  But we don't make teachers accountable in most cases.  You  kind of go in and do your thing, nobody's checking on them.  If you check on them, the unions' are  going to, whatever they're doing.  But we, we have to start laying blame.  And say, "Look,  you are responsible for the education of my child" and children coming out of school not  being able to read.  The system should be sued.  You should be able to tell people early  on, child's not fitting in this environment.  They need to be in a much, you know whatever,  a specialized environment and it should be known.  I mean the problem in the school is  based on the fact the kids can't read and write.  You know, I'm fourteen years old and can't read.  I'm  raising all the hell in the classroom because I don't want to be, I don't want the teacher to  call on me.  So I, you know, I'm the bully.  I can knock you around.  Then the attention is, is on my behavior, not on, in teaching.  So there has to be a solid environment in  school.  I mean we don't allow our kids to disturb the learning environment.  You disturb at  that environment, bye-bye.  You know, and if the system took that particular attitude,  there'd be nowhere for you to go so you would have to perform (laughter) you know.  But if, you know, you can pass kids around from school to school to school and then sixteen or seventeen years old, you not, haven't got a education.  They kind of throw you out of the system  so you, you kind of go through a system that throws you back into welfare, the mental  health system, crime, you know.
Story_ID: 2289
Speaker 1: Well, you know, they -- I guess to be the devil's advocate, they've got to go somewhere.
Speaker 2: If you kick them out the public schools, then --
Speaker 1: They're going to jail anyway.
Speaker 2: -- the behavior (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Why don't we look at what we got?  What do we have?  People in jail.  You go, I go down to 26th and California [Chicago, Illinois] and you'd think that all Chicagoans are black.  Now, there -- this is -- these are my  experiences.  I don't, I don't know about other people.  You would think that the entire city population in,  in Chicago was black. And you don't have to be real bright to figure out something wrong  here.  If the schools were structured in such a way that each school was accountable to  the students, that the kids were learning and all this parent stuff -- you know, parent input  might be great, but you need strong teachers in school.  Pay them.  But you got to show  results in that and I'm not talking about no five-year plan.  I'm talking about maybe a two-year  plan, you know, everybody get their little baseline together and you're going to be  tracked.  That don't mean you got to go testing every month, you know, I mean, you just,  you know -- you, you got to know.  I mean you're going, you're going to be able to look  at -- you, you -- if you took the ACT [Assessment] scores, SAT [formerly Scholastic Aptitude Test] scores -- they're not going to listen to me -- PSAT [Preliminary SAT],  and start tracking them.  And you're awarded, the schools that were doing a greater -- or  they should get more money.  But I think the schools that are at the bottom of that, you  got to bring in the troopers.  I mean you got to bring in the, the, the 'Green Beret' [United States Army Special Forces] of  education in those schools, and say, "Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is, this is the way it's going to run from now on."  And you can complain, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, you  want to transfer them out.  But if the system is across the system, transfer won't do no  good.  You will have to conform.  All these buses running, kids -- I think that -- I don't  know what the budget is for buses in Chicago.  I never understood that.  Why don't you  take the money that you spend on -- I know I'm going to make somebody mad here -- why  don't you take the money that you spend on buses and put it into schools that, that you're  taking them from?  The, it just doesn't make any sense, you know, the way we do things.  And, and I think it's that way because the public schools in many ways is not about  education.  It's about people having jobs.
Story_ID: 2290
Speaker 1: Yeah, most people know in Chicago [Illinois] if you really want your son or daughter to have a  decent education, more than likely they will not attend the neighborhood school where  you're trying to invest to make sure they don't.
Speaker 2: But that's, that's, that's -- I mean, you know, how many red flags do you need?  I mean  here, the size of that.  I mean, people waiving, saying, "Look, you know, the kids --" I hear parents,  you know, parents at Providence-St. Mel [School], say, you know, I need to, I need to get my school  to charter, one of the, the academies, not academies, but what is it, you know, the  magnet schools.  I understand that.  You know, they don't have to pay for it.  I mean we all  pay for it, but, you know, paying the, single parents who are struggling.  You know, we  appreciate the education at Providence-St. Mel, but we have to pay.  What do  you do?  I  mean you, you pay, you don't pay it all because we have to raise $3 million a year.  But I  understand.  But they're trying to find the best school for their children to attend.  I don't  blame them.  But the best schools should be in your neighborhood on your block.  And,  and Providence-St. Mel is only in one of the worst neighborhoods in the country as far as  drugs and sexual predators and blah, blah, blah, and the income or whatever, all the  other benchmarks that you have to commute.  And we've done it right here.  And if we  can do it, you know, let's not make this thing some kind of special package we got going  here.  It's not a special package.  It's dedicated people in those classrooms saying, "This is  what you're going to do.  And if you don't want to do, then you need to go somewhere  else.  I mean if you don't want a educate -- if you don't want to go to college, you don't  need to come to Providence-St. Mel."  I mean it's even for the kindergarten.  You know, if  your child -- if you, you know, have already made some plan that your child's not going  to go to college, you shouldn't even think about us.  And it, and Providence-St. Mel is not for  everybody.  It's a lot of hard work, you know.  It's two or three hours of homework at night,  you know, consistently.  And I tell people, if your child comes and they have, they have  no homework, it should be the last day of school.  And they should have a book they're  reading.  You know, parents can be assured that their child, if they don't see their child  working, something's wrong.  They may need to call us because we're going to be calling  them, saying your child's terminated.  And, you know, here again, you know, and I hate  to make, to make it so simple, but if we can do it right here in Chicago, we, we could take  our schools in our inner city and make them models.  You know, that's my philosophy of  education that the private sector is not going to be able to do it.  People ask me, "Why  don't you open up another school?"  (Laughter)  It's, the fundraising is a killer.  I have not  been a good fundraiser.  That's been my, that's, one of my other negatives is not doing  well with alumni and parents and other things.  I have not raised enough money to go out and  say, "Okay, now I have enough money.  Now, I can go out and open another school."  And,  you know, and if I, if I had those kinds of funds, I would go here right in Chicago.  But  they'd have to be run my way.  People say, well, you know, "Why don't you open a charter  school?" but, you know, my hands are tied.  You know, you got this and who you know.  The at, the attitude and the atmosphere in the school has to be different.
Story_ID: 2291
Speaker 1: The athletic teams here and you said that, that this year you had  the worse --
Speaker 2: Worst record this year, but we've had some, I guess our, our premier sport is boys'  basketball and we won [Illinois] State Championship in 1985.  1984 we were third place in Class  A.  I guess we've been downstate [Illinois] about ten times.  But this was not our year so we're in  a rebuilding process.  I think you can have a strong academic program and strong  athletic program.  But the, the competition in all the games that are played with athletes  in the city, I don't play them.  I mean, you know, what can I do for you?  For your child?  Give them a good education.  You got anything else on your mind?  I don't have it for  you.  And so I sleep well at night, don't have to worry about, you know, that I did  something illegal and that kind of thing.  But it's, it's amazing that you, parents will  make an education decision based on the athletics of the school.  And they, I just -- it  absolutely blows my mind.  I mean when you, when you think of, I mean the, the odds of  kids going pro.  You have about a better chance of being a brain surgeon.  And people are  making those decisions every day.  I have, you know, parents come to me and say, "Well,  what can you do for me?"  Well, I'm -- we can give the child an education. That's all, that's all.  "Well, you know, so and so school --" I said, "Well, that's where you should go."
Story_ID: 2292
Speaker 1: And do you think there's a -- are, are your students more likely to come from, I mean or  the parents who are interested, really interested in education, more likely to come from  families that have just recently come up from the South or a family that's been in  Chicago [Illinois] a long time or is there a typical --
Speaker 2: A great, great question.  As I reflect over my thirty-two years, the families usually are the  ones that are struggling.  They, they, they don't make enough money really to send their child  to Providence-St. Mel [School].  Sometime they're collecting money from other family members.  It, it's amazing that, if you're talking about black people, if we're talking about black  people that really afford to send their kids to Providence-St. Mel, don't want to send them  to Providence-St. Mel.  It's all black.  You know, we -- I know I heard people that, we  have our own racism that goes on, you know.  I, I know very specifically of a school that  closed here on the West Side.  I won't even call the name.  And the internal memo got to  me that the reason they were closing the school, there were too many black people in the  school.  And that always stuck in mind, you know.
Speaker 1: Was this a Catholic school or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the one I'm talking, yeah, it, it was a former Catholic school.  It's always stuck in  my mind.  And, of course, our school is open to all races, you know.  It just happens to be  in a segregated neighborhood and happen to be in the most segregated city in the United  States.  But, you know, we, we're open to any color and, and as long as you get here by  8:00, you know, you're welcome, and do what we tell you to do.  But that has  always stuck in mind.  And I, I want, I want people to know that we're a predominantly  black school.  But I tell you what, you bring your college -- whatever school you're  from, and you know, you got your records about where your kids go to college.  I got my  mine.  We're going to be competitive.  You tell me your baseline scores of the kids  coming to your school, and you look at the baseline for my kids coming to school, we're  there.  So I'm not, not supporting, you know, a school that should be all black, all white,  all whatever it is, but I am saying that let us, let us not make black negative.  And we  have been predominantly black for about, I don't know, maybe twenty years.  When I came  here, back in '71 [1971], I think it, maybe 10 or 15 percent of the school was Latino or white.  And as they moved out the neighborhood and the gangs kind of carved up the  community, not the word rather I should use, but, you know, people couldn't cross over  -- all that kind of foolishness that goes on.  It has been predominantly black, but I think,  you know, what I'm seeing with gentrification that it's going to change.  And it's coming,  coming down Madison [Chicago] like a freight train.  So that's going to change.
Story_ID: 2293
Speaker 1: Sir, tell me, I know you've talked a lot about discipline, you know, I was wondering if, if  the students have -- do you set aside ways for the students to make decisions about things  that go on in the school at all?  I mean do you have --
Speaker 2: Well, to a certain extent, but we, we're very limited in that area to be very, very honest  with you.  We don't have time for experiments here.  We tend to, you know, mostly just  basic education.  We have what you call a discipline court where the students sit on.  They can make decisions about the, some of the behavior in school.  But every serious  problem is not going to be passed on to the student.  It's going to be the principal of the  school that makes that decision.  We, the, the mileage that we -- the concentration is  going to be academic.  So we want to get enough baseline education into your head that  you're going to be able to make, to make certain decisions at a later on period.  So there's  not a lot of power put into the hands of, of students.  I mean, I, I guess the best way that  we demonstrate the, the kids making decisions is that when we offer them opportunities to  travel.  I mean they're, they're on their own.  But they do understand that if there are  going to be some problems, you won't be coming back to Providence-St. Mel [School].  I mean  because you're representing yourself and family, but you represent Providence-St. Mel.  So  I guess we've sent twelve hundred, thirteen hundred students to all over the world in the past twelve years.  And I  think we have had two, maybe three incidents of behavior.  There are very few behavior  problems be -- because the emphasis is on you moving to the next level.  I mean it just  sounds, it sounds kind of, doesn't make good sense, but if the children are busy trying to  move to the next level, they don't have time to be getting into trouble.  I mean the rules  are very simple.  This is what you will do and this is what you will not do.  There's no,  there's no in between, you know.  I mean if you, you get into a fight, 99 percent of the  time you're going to be put out of school.  You caught with drugs, 100 percent,  guaranteed, you're out.  You don't come to school, I'm going to put you out.  When I  first came to Providence-St. Mel, I used to spend almost a third of my day talking to  parents about their kids not coming to school.  I said, "Wait a minute, this is -- what this  got to do with education?"  So what I did, I started charging them.  It was ten dollars in the old  days.  It's twenty dollars now.  I think it's twenty dollars now, but I would bring them in, the parents in.  And I'd say, "Now this conference is going to cost you twenty dollars if your child stays.  If they  are not going to be here, then it -- this will be a free conference."  It's amazing that the,  the, the list of being of people tardy went to almost 5 percent or less, you know.  There're  consequences for your behavior.  You know, we are a ed -- institution of education.  We  ain't, got time to talk to you about you being tardy, you being late and your  behavior and your dress.  I mean if you take away from the, from the academics, the  academic atmosphere of the school, you don't have to be here.  And I tell parents, I mean  if you don't have control of your child, it's the easiest thing to do, is to get out of  Providence-St. Mel cause you act up, you're out.  And we make it very clear, very straight,  you know, all -- you know, we have our little consequences continuing and, you know,  and probation and all that kind of stuff.  But it, it's -- the system is set up to weed the  ones that shouldn't be out.  You're not going to stay at Providence-St. Mel and not do your  work.
Story_ID: 2294
Speaker 1: Do you have a big attrition rate with, with freshman or --
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, let me give me, give you some perspective, some baseline on this.  In, in the  early seventies [1970s], mid-seventies, the attrition rate was 70 percent.  Seventy percent of the students  from the high school were not getting through.  I guess that now, now, it's about 25, maybe  30 percent.  It's still, it's still high.  And it's going down because we now have added  junior high, middle school, primary, kindergarten.  So the kids are accustomed and they,  they are academically competitive so that now, the attrition rate goes down.  I mean you,  you bring kids in at the high school level in the ninth grade, and they haven't been in a, a  academic environment, it's tough to make at Providence-St. Mel [School].  You really have to want  to make it.  So you will find that the attrition rate from kids from the ninth grade to the twelfth  grade is higher as opposed to someone who comes in the seventh grade or the fifth grade or the  fourth grade.  It's a difference between, between day and night.  If I, if I really had my way  of doing it, I wouldn't even accept kids at the ninth grade.  I think, and I don't want to say  it's too late, but in many cases, it's too late.  I would probably, the minimum, you have to  come in the seventh grade, but the system is kind of set up, you know, it's kind of a one through  eight, 8/4-system.  And so you  would have traditionally people who have come in  at the high school -- but we try to encourage parents to send to their children to Providence-  St. Mel before high school.  The difference, like I say, is between day and night, the, the  exposure and the, the kind of the things that we're going to be doing in the future with a  new science lab just for elementary school.  It's really going to make a big difference.  I  really think that our curriculum in, in the early parts of the twenty-first Century will be, will be  basically, after the sophomore year, a college curriculum, you know.  And we teach  biology down in the sixth and seventh grade and geometry down there.  We get to the  advanced placement courses in high school.  I mean, and the recent, the, the things that I  see in the future, students doing research at the high school level.  Which just puts them at a  different level when they come out of high school of getting into the best schools in the  country because of that, because of that college atmosphere that you had created at the  high school level.  We push our curriculum down.  I think, you know, you know, when we,  when we had opened up the kindergarten, we took the first grade curriculum and pushed  it down to the kindergarten.  And then we, we had reopened up our pre-school, third grade.  We'll push that down.  So it means the kids are, you know, what you do in high school  should -- most of that stuff should be done in the elementary school and elementary  school down to your pre-school, and pre, you know.  You just, you just push it down,  expand at the top with advanced subjects.  Kids thrive.  With great teachers,  teachers that won't have to be dealing with foolishness in the classroom appreciate --  people that really want to teach appreciate being at Providence-St. Mel because they don't  have to deal with a lot foolishness.  We take care of all of the foolishness, that's my job.  You know, not my job now, it's the principal's job to deal with the people that don't  want to, that don't want to conform to the rules and regulations.  And we're very matter  of fact to parents that this is the way it's going to work, you know.  You know, are they  happy about it?  They're happy about it as long as their child is not involved, but as soon  as they're child's involved, they're not so happy about the rules and regulations.  They  think great rules and regulations until my child.  Well, last week it was fine.  Now,  you want us, you know, to switch in the middle, middle of the pond.  We're not doing  that.  The rules are the same, you know,  This is the way it's going to be.
Story_ID: 2295
Speaker 1: Now, if you had something to do over again, now that you (unclear), what would it be or,  or is there anything that you would do different (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, I, as I said, I wish I had been a better fundraiser.  I really, and I say that in all  sincerity because I think that Providence-St. Mel [School], the, the spirit of Providence-St. Mel is  being that we had taken children who didn't, couldn't afford to go to Providence-St. Mel.  And I regret to say that I think in the future, if we're not very lucky in raising a lot of  money, that the school will end up becoming a school for the people who can afford to go  to school there because, as my business manager say, we, we really can't afford to run  this school on the backs of teachers.  For too long that that has happened.  People need to  be compensated while working, retirement plan, good health plans, all the little tidbits  that, you know, to make teachers happy and make the, the support staff happy, should be  a part of the job because, you know, you're looking for that energy that goes into, to the  academic framework, frame.  And in order to do that, you have to pay people for, for their  skills.  They, there's somewhere I think down the line, we're going to have to start using  technology.  We use technology already, but we have to use technology in the teaching  frame of reference that, you know, we have teachers that teach via the Internet to two or three  cluster schools.  So three or four schools can divvy up salaries that pay people, you  know, a hundred thousand, a hundred fifty thousand, whatever they need, need to, you  know, need to maintain a -- that's going to be tough and still try to, still try to have poor  kids in the school.  That, that's going to be the tough cookie.  But I think if, if we could  put together an endowment, you know, somewhere around 30 or $40 million that would,  would be used to make sure that those kids that cannot afford to go to a Providence-St. Mel  or other school that would have the same idea, then that money would be there for, for, to  be able to subsidize the tuition of those kids that might -- I believe that everyone that, in  my philosophy, they should have to pay something.  If it's ten dollars a week, you need to pay it and pay it on time.  So, and that's our philosophy and if you don't pay it on time, you  know, not by the December the first, we starting fining you, you know, until the fine ends  up being more than what it would cost you to go to school.  But that's my regret, that I  wasn't a little smarter, you know.  You know, I didn't, I didn't start first grade,  kindergarten, thirty years ago.  I mean it's amazing, hindsight is.  But I think the biggest,  biggest -- the area that, that is of most concern to me is, is, is the fundraising.  And it is  just drain, it's just draining because you have to go through the same loops and hoops.  And I thought at one time, you know, if I really made this school competitive, I wouldn't  have to worry about money.  Hah.  I do.
Speaker 1: Not like that.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Not like that.  I really think, you know, and it, it -- I don't know what it, you know -- I  mean if the school is really doing well, people kind of say, well, you know.  You know,  it's not, you know, we're not controversial, you know, we're not, you know.  We, you  know, it's a good story, so it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't make that kind of a lead.  And I guess we  haven't marketed ourselve enough, you know.  Some people say, "Well, you don't market  yourself enough."  (Unclear) all that time, it takes time, it takes money.  You know, people  into marketing, don't come and say, you we're going to do it pro bono.  We got to pay the  people that market you.  And you got to pay, you know, have a fundraiser.  I got pay  them.  They're not coming in, you know, volunteering to raise money.
Story_ID: 2296
Speaker 1: And so, you got all of those things and you, and you're looking at the morale of the staff to make sure that  they're being compensated.  And that, to me, is very, very critical.  That's what's  going to push salaries up because I think, you know, really superior teachers are being  recruited by people that can, that can, really can afford them, you know.  Public school, I,  public school people look at us and thinks -- I heard, I had a parent tell me, she  was complaining about something we were doing.  And she's a teacher, said, "Well, why  don't you come and teach here?"  She said, "You don't pay enough."  Hello.  You know.  But  people want to send their children there because they know they're going to get a decent  education.  But I think the future really lies in the fact that these people must be  compensated for, for the value that they bring to the institution.  They've got to be paid  top dollars.
Speaker 2: How far off, off are you all from paying what the public schools pay?
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess 20, 25 percent.  I mean we're moving, I don't think we will ever competitive but we provide an  environment of such that you got peace of mind.  You are able to teach.  You know, you  are able to see children grow.  So although I don't think we'll ever be competitive with,  with public schools around the country, we are going to end up paying people livable  salaries.  You know, people don't have to go to the poor house when they, when they  retire which I just think is criminal.  So, on that standpoint, you know, unless someone, you  know, comes along and dropped a billion on us, we, you know, things would change.
Speaker 2: Have you had teachers who have been able to stay here a long time and teach --
Speaker 1: Very few.
Speaker 2: Very few.
Speaker 1: Most of the staff is new.  I mean where they've been there three years or, three years or  four years.  And turnover is about three or four years.  They're just very few.  There only -- I  think there's only one person around at Providence-St. Mel [School], out of a staff of nearly one hundred that  was there when I first came.  So people have gone on, started new careers, a number of  our teachers are recruited by other school systems because they's get good  teachers.  And I guess that's a plus, but it -- of course, it's a drain for the staff because  you have to retrain people.  But you, if you get energetic people who will listen, who are  very competent, you, you, you got something.  I mean it's almost worth going through  that training.  The thing is, is to get them to buy into the philosophy of the school when  they come in.  They come in with, you know, some kind of hokey pokey philosophy from  where they came from.  And it's not going to work here.  And I mean and we, we know  what we're doing.  And if you want to change things at Providence-St. Mel, you need to  come and demonstrate or tell us about it so you can, you know -- I'm always looking for  changes.  I don't think the place should, you know, remain stoic.  But at the same time, the,  many of the things, the procedures that we have that might sound very unfair to you or not  democratic, then that -- and let me be very clear that this is not a democracy.  It works.  Bottom line, bottom line of Providence-St. Mel is that what we do, which is not that  difficult to do, it works.  Students are successful.  They're going to the best schools in the  country.
Story_ID: 2297
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, Sir, at this point in your life, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Legacy.  That we have put together a demonstration of, of a school that, that works in the  inner city that can be copied by those who choose to do so.  That, you know, that you  can, you don't have to bus the children out to wherever you're busing them; that we need  to make a stand in our own communities and operate the best schools in the country.  And that you, we need to figure out a way of doing that and it's not, it's not very difficult to do that.  I  mean you just say, "Look, you know, this is what we're going to do and this is the way  we're going to go about it."  You get enough, enough nucleus of a group of people to say  this is how it's going to happen, (snaps fingers) and it happens.  You know, you need help.  You stand on  the shoulders of others.  You take, you take the, the experiences that others have had and  you, and you build on it.  You just, we're not doing anything that's original to Providence-St. Mel [School].  I mean this is not, you know, something, you know, that was just created over the last few  years.  This is my experiences and the experiences of other teachers.  And we've kind of  just put it together to benefit the child.  What can we do to move the child to the next  level?  What can we do?  Not what can the children do.  I mean given all of the negatives  in our society, you know, and you hear people say, well the kids come from dysfunctional  families.  Tell me something new.
Speaker 1: It's not, not what the kids can do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They're coming to be educated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're coming to be educated, you know, you know, like I tell the kids, you know,  "When you hit the door here, forget all about that stuff at home.  I know it's going to be  tough, you know, but we, we're going to educate you here.  These are the rules, decide,  this is how we're going to do it."  And, you know, over the years, that, you know, we've  been very successful in doing that.

Speaker 1: Now, this is slightly different from that question, the last one, how would you like to  be remembered?
Speaker 2: How I'd like to be remembered?  Well, probably I was a, I was a hard worker and I  believed in my mission as a educator, that when there was no way, I found a way; that,  that I had the tenacity to keep looking.  I didn't give up; that I believe that if you put  your, put your mind and your heart and your soul into something, that it can happen.  If I  could pass that on to the next generation, especially to my daughter, then I think  everything's going to be great.
