 Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday, March 5, 2011. Also with me is Tanya  Finchum, and we   re in Perry, Oklahoma, at the Broken Bar L Ranch,  home of Terry and Judi Leonard. They   re with us today for the  Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral History Project. Thank you  so much for inviting us into your home. We   d like to begin by learning a  little bit more about your family and how they came to Oklahoma.  Well, this land was settled by my great-grandfather. In my information I  have received about him   I never knew him. He was dead before I was  born, but he migrated over from England. He didn   t make the Run in  1893, but he settled the land. He received a patent, which I have never  been able to figure out how he was able to get the patent by not making  the Run, but the records that we have show that he actually settled the  land in 1896. His name was Peter Stewart. He had nine children, of  which most of them were boys. There was, I think, two girls, and one of  those girls was my grandmother, whose name was Francis. She married  my grandfather, and we have it on record that they were married in  1906. His name was Cecil Leonard.  Shortly before I was born, Peter Stewart left this place, and it was then  settled by my grandmother, Francis. Cecil Leonard had already died. She  had two children. One was Christine, a girl, and Alfred Leonard, who is  my dad. Alfred married my mother, Alva, and they moved here in about  194   I was born in    43. I guess they moved here in    44. I wasn   t born on  this place. I was actually born west of here, about seven or eight miles.  My grandmother had left this place to go live with her daughter,  Christine, in Ark ansas  City, Kansas, and then my dad and mother  moved here. My brother was born here. I was born in a farmhouse about  eight miles away, and after a short period of time, we all moved over  here. Since that time, Judi, my wife, we moved here. I lived here as a kid  from 1944 until about   I guess, I left briefly to go to college in 1962 to  5  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard     65. We moved back right about    68.  We moved back in    65.  So we   ve lived here continuously since 1965. We have two children, two  boys. Chance Leonard lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, and another son by  the name of Jason Leonard lives in Moore, Oklahoma. And so, this place  has been in   even though it was settled in the name of Stewart, it was  passed down to my grandmother  who  got a ninth. Shortly after that,  why, my dad bought out the remaining heirs, who all had a ninth  interest, which amounts to about eighteen acres or something like that. I  actually bought the last remaining acreage of one that hadn   t been  bought. So at some point in time, I guess, it will pass down to our two  boys. We never have any intentions of selling, but they don   t have any  intentions of living on it at this point in time, either. They just have  different type of lives now than what we had, but anyway.  Well, going back to the early days and early stories that you   ve heard of  the farm, do you know what some of those early crops or early animals  they had were?  I have some records where it shows that in 1896, it was the first legal  record of my grandfather staying on this place. At that point in time, he  had three years in which to make improvements and then go to court.  The court hearing was held in Guthrie. He had to bring along three  witnesses, which would testify as to what improvements he had made.  We have these records here of those three witnesses that testified that he  had broken out eighty acres of land. That was an extensive deed, at that  time, with the type of equipment that they had, and had built a house and  built a barn and a chicken coop or a chicken house, and had a small  orchard. That testament I find somewhat interesting of the people, but in  order for him to get a clear title, he had to make those improvements. I  guess that answers your question.  Through the years, could you kind of trace the progression for me?  Yes, the house that I lived in, my brother and I, Mom and Dad, was the  original house that Peter Stewart had built, which was a very small  house, and it was an old house. I don   t think we have any pictures of that  house, but I can remember we had a kitchen off to the south end of the  house. And I can remember before we had any electricity, we had a  small pump that would pump water up into the lavatory, the sink area.  We had a living room and a bedroom and a bottom floor, and then we  had an upstairs. It was two stories. I remember we had a large barn that  was all wooden, and later my dad had, because of deteriorating  conditions, went and put metal on it, sheet metal, tin.  6  J. Leonard  I can remember that one of my uncles was named Seth Stewart, and Seth  was one of the original nine of Peter Stewart. He was living in Missouri,  and I remember that Judi and I went there to visit him one time, and he  asked about the barn, if it was still there. And I said,    Yes.    And he said  that he had made several trips. The only place they could get lumber, at  that time, was at a saw mill in Chandler. He would take that wagon and  team, and it   d take him several days, but he would go to Chandler and  pick up the wood that they made the barn out of. It was largely  cottonwood at that time, because there wasn   t a lot of timber in this  country at that time. So consequently, there wasn   t very many saw mills.  But anyway, he would go all the way down there.  We tore that barn down about, maybe, fifteen years ago, and it was full  of almost 100-year-old cottonwood, two-by-twelves and two-by-tens,  and stuff like that. I pulled all the nails out of that wood and kept all the  wood, still have all the wood, but we replaced it with a large, more   modern barn . The barn was built back in the days whenever it had  granaries on the sides of it, and it had an area that we used to milk cows  in, it had extensions in it, on the west side of it, and a large hay loft. It  was really not feasible anymore for our modern day-type agriculture. So  we tore it down, and I kept all the wood and still have it today. Still have  a lot of that old wood. It   s still good wood.  The things that we used to do, like for example, the milking of the cows,  Mother and I used to milk cows early in the morning and late at night.  Dad had a job, worked for the county. We used to have eight or ten cows  that we   d milk every morning, and I helped her milk them before school.  That seemed like that lasted until I was about a third grader or something  like that. The milk, it was not really profitable with the small type  operation like what she had. So anyway, we got rid of the milk cows and  just had beef cattle.  But I can remember the old porch. I think Mother and Dad, they saved  forever to buy a cream separator, and they got it from Sears and  Roebuck. I still have the big stainless steel top. I can remember we   d  pour milk in the big top of that thing, and it   d separate it down. That was  quite a little deal. We stuck that inside the house, in that porch. I can  remember that   s about the only thing we had in that porch, but that   s  where we   d separate the milk, with that separator. She bought that thing,  and she didn   t use it for more than about a year, and then we quit the  dairy business. (Laughs) It was probably a good deal. I was tired of  milking, anyway. (Laughter) Boy, that was a job.  We were raised as kids off that milk.  7  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  We used to have somebody to come by and pick up these milk cans. I  can remember that. And it was Gold Spot or some milk company, maybe  it was Borden. I don   t remember who it was at the time, but they   d come  by and pick them up. I can remember you   d get down there, and even  when I got up to the fifth or sixth grade, we still had one milk cow,  because we wanted to have milk to make butter and to have whip cream.  Put that cream on your cereal, boy it was good. But, anyway, why, I  would go down there, and them old cows (I think we had one or two)  they knew the way right into that extension. You just put out the feed,  and they   d just walk in the door and walk right straight in there to that  extension. It was an old wooden-type extension, and you   d just pull that  lever across and hook a piece of wire over it. That   d hold her head in  there, and you could get down there and start milking.  I can remember the cats, they   d be lined up over there and you could just  take and squeeze that old udder and, man, I tell you what, that milk  would shoot across there, and you could just wet them cats    faces down.  They   d just be there licking their lips. (Laughter) Seems like you   d  always have your head   the cows seemed like they had some lice or  something. You had your head over there when you   re milking right up  next to their sides. I can remember you could feel something itching on  your head. Golly  That was quite an experience, milking them. It was  fun. The kind of lives we grew up doing, no kids today, no kids today  have ever experienced what we experienced when we were young.  Well, outside of milking cows before school, what were some of your  other chores?  Well, that was about the principle chore before school, but when I got  back home at night, why, we had a chicken house. And, of course, there  was lots of experiences about chicken houses. I can tell you a few of  them, too. But we   d have to go down, and we   d have to make sure the  chickens had feed and water, and we   d gather the eggs. We   d bring the  eggs back up to the house. And sometimes them old chickens would be  wanting to sit on them eggs, and you   d stick that hand in there and that  old chicken, she   d peck you because she didn   t want to give up them  eggs, because she was sitting on them. Sometimes you   d reach in there  and feel something slick, and you look in there and there   d be a big old  black snake, or something. You didn   t even look before you stuck your  hand in there, but later on that black snake might have had two or three  eggs stuck in its throat. (Laughs)  I guess besides feeding the chickens, why, I think we had a few hogs  that we had to feed, too, because back in those days we just pretty much  had about every kind of livestock. We got rid of the chickens at one  point in time, we got rid of the dairy cows, and we got rid of the hogs  8  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  because none of those things were real profitable. But I do remember  always going around trying to fix that wire that they   d root up  underneath. We   d have these stakes that we   d drive down to hold that  wire down because them hogs would be always getting out.  I think that was probably pretty much the extent of the chores besides  feeding the cows or something like that. Dad had that job. We had one  old pickup. I think Dad would get a lot of gas. It was real small. We   d go  down and they   d blow this drip, this gas well that was down there on the  south end of the place. He   d get enough of that drip to run that pickup to  go to work.  Outside of your mom and you helping out with the chores, did you have  extra people helping out on the farm?  No, not really. Not at that time. We   ve growed a lot. We   ve got a lot  more land than what we used to. At that time, why, we really only had  the one-quarter, the 160.  Did you have siblings?  Just my brother. Mike is his name. He lives in Dallas, Texas, now. Him  and I growed up here. I don   t know how much of some of this stuff is  pertinent, but to kind of give you an idea of how we grew up, we grew  up by modest means   somewhat, almost downright poor. Kind of like  what about everybody was. There wasn   t anybody that I know of that  grew up on farming around in here that was wealthy. So Mom and Dad,  they just done the best they could with what they had. We never grew up  hungry, but I can remember when we would go to school, I have some  pictures of   I think there   s a picture   one of these pictures here,  somewhere, is a picture of me going to school with a shirt that my  mother made. This was not an uncommon deal.  Did she use flour sacks or   ?  Yes, because on Saturdays   the only time we ever went to town was  Saturdays. And on Saturdays, why, Mom would have all the eggs we  gathered for the week it seems like. Then we   d go to town and what  would happen next is we   d go with Mom. Dad would go off and do  something else. But we   d go to the feed store and she   d get   now, this  dress that she   s got on right now is made out of a feed sack. We   d go,  and we   d get feed, and those prints on those sacks was things that  Mother would make us clothes out of. She   d get enough feed for the  week or two weeks or whatever, and today you probably don   t have any  kids that clothes were made by the parents, made out of sacks, but that   s  what we went to school with.  9  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  I can remember, I   ve told Judi this several times, whenever we went to  school in the fall at the start of the year, I can remember Mom would  take me and my brother in, and we   d get a couple pairs of jeans and a  new pair of shoes. And the jeans, because we grew so fast, we   d always  buy them about three or four inches too long, and we always wore cuffs.  Jeans with cuffs, cuffed up legs, because that was to grow into them in  the wintertime. And the shoes would always be a size or two too large  and that way, why, our feet would grow into them. But as soon as we got  home, the first instructions we had was take them shoes off, and we went  barefooted. We went barefooted all summer long. We always just wore  cutoff pants or whatever, and that   s about all we had on, maybe a shirt  sometimes. Most of the time we   d just burn up from the sun, but we  always wore old clothes. We had to keep them school clothes nice  because they had to last us.  Well, back in the old house, how was it heated?  There was a gas well across the road, and we had a line laid from it to  our house, and we had natural gas. We had plenty of heat, and I can  remember how we used to take our baths because we had a pump right  out to the west of the house, a hand pump. Mom had this tub about so  long. It was a galvanized tub, wash tub. (Gestures) She   d pump that  thing full, about half full of water, and then she   d heat up some water in  the house. And then she   d bring the water out and dump it in that cold  water to kind of warm it up a little bit. Me and my brother, we   d get in  there and take a bath together, outside.  We tore that house down, and we built a new house. It   s this house here.  We   ve rebuilt this, but this house was built in 1957, I believe it was,    56  or    57. That   s whenever we had torn the old house down, and then we  had running water and electricity in here. We finally got electricity in the  old house, but I can remember before we had electricity our principle  light was coal oil lamps. We had outdoor bathrooms and stuff like that.  I remember in sixth grade, I brought a friend home, and he stayed all  night with me. We went back to school the next day, why, he was telling  some of his friends, I overheard him. He was talking about how we had  an outdoor bathroom. It caused a fight. (Laughs) I did some whipping up  on him after that, but he thought it was somewhat funny. I didn   t think it  was too funny. That was just one of the things that we grew up with.  What catalogs did you have out there?  Sears and Roebuck, Montgomery Ward is the only two I know of.  (Laughs) Yes, anyway, back on Saturdays when we would go to town,  10  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  why, then with Mom we   d go to the grocery store, and we   d follow her  around, and then we   d go to a movie afterwards. I think they had two  theaters here in this town. One was the Perry and one was the Roxy, two  movie theaters. I think it cost us a dime. We   d go and watch all the old  cowboy movies, Roy Rogers, Lash LaRue, all them, Johnny Mack  Brown. Then we   d come out of that movie about three o   clock in the  afternoon or whatever, and we   d go sit in the park where Mother was  and all the rest of the farm women, all sitting around visiting on benches  in the park.  Dad would be in the pool hall and every once in a while, she   d send me  in there,    Go get your dad. It   s time to go home.    It might be four, five  o   clock in the afternoon, time to do chores. You go in there and, man,  you couldn   t hardly see. There   d be so much smoke. You   d have to just  duck down low so you could see, find out where  he was , you go over  there and talk to dad,    Dad, are you ready to go home?       No, not yet, I   ll  be ready in a minute.    That whole scenario would play out again the  next Saturday. Same thing, but that   s the way the life was.  We had no TV. I can remember the very first time we got a telephone. I  can remember that wall telephone, and it stood up there about eye level  with an adult. And my grandmother, who was staying with us at the  time, fell outside and broke her hip. She was wanting me to pull on her  leg, and I tried to pull on her leg, and it was hurting her. She said,     You   re going to have to call your mother.    There had been a number     I think our ring was a party line. I think there was about four or five  people on our party line. I think our ring was a long and two shorts.  Anyway, I drug some chairs over and crawled up on that   I couldn   t  have been older than about eight or nine, I don   t remember, ten. I don   t  remember how old I was, but I drug that chair over there and got up on  that deal.  You   d pull that receiver up and ring it, and then you could hear that  operator. I think there was a card there for where my mother was  working. I think it was a four digit number. I think it was 4-1-4-1 or  something like that. I dialed   or I had to ring that number and told  Mother that Grandmother was hurt. She was laying in the yard, and so  that was the first time I ever used a telephone. (Laughs) That was quite  an experience, but as far as what we did as kids, we just made the best  with what we had. We had BB guns, and we   d go roam the creeks. And  as we grew up we   d shoot whatever would stand still for us and built  forts, all kinds of things that boys would do that didn   t take any money.  Mischief?  Oh, yes, we was always in mischief. Kids are so much influenced now  11  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  by TV and the games and stuff that they have now. The kind of  influences we had were quite strikingly different than what they are  now. I can remember what Mother and Dad did for entertainment was  visit the neighbors. That   s what we done. Maybe once or twice a week,  we   d all load up and go to the neighbors. And sometimes we   d go to the  neighbors that had TVs and sometimes we didn   t. It was always a real  treat to go to a neighbor that had a TV, because we could watch the TV.  I can remember what they would do would be play cards. They would  play canasta or pinochle or pitch, some card game. Ain   t very many  people anymore that know how to play pinochle or maybe even pitch,  but that   s what everybody did in those days.  And, of course, if they were lucky enough to have a TV, we   d get our  first chance to see a TV. I think we got a TV whenever we was about  nineteen. I   m just guessing. It was a Sylvania TV, and it was a big  monster-looking thing. I think it might have been about 1955 or    54,  somewhere around there we got our first TV. It stood tall, had a blond  cabinet, had a big old picture tube. Like I said, it was a big thing. I don   t  know if Sylvania is still in business anymore, are they?  I think so.  Are they? Well, that was the very first TV we ever got.  Before that you had a radio?  We sat around and listened to the radio. We   d sit around and listen to the  radio at night. And, oh, there was all those Fibber McGee and Molly and  Homer and Jethro. It seemed like there was a black group, Amos and  Andy, that   s what it was. Amos and Andy, we used to listen to them and  the Grand Ole Opry. A lot of those shows that was made for radio, the  radio shows, they were entertaining. You could sit there and listen. And  I remember that quite distinctly. We never had the TV. We just listened  to the radio.  Most of the time it was get to bed early. We didn   t have any air  conditioning. I can remember that what Mother used to do is she had  these old, kind of like a muslin-type cloth that she   d put into water and  put them on the south windows, hang them so that that hot air when it  blew through there, it would kind of be a little cooler. We always slept  outside, it seemed like, in the summertime, because it was cooler than in  the house. I don   t know if people could still survive nowadays. I don   t  know if I could, even, without air conditioning, after I   ve got used to it.  (Laughs) No, we never had any air conditioning.  Did you have a favorite room in the house?  12  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Oh, our bedrooms were upstairs. I don   t know that we had a favorite  room, not really, maybe the living room. It was real small, but I  remember one time I slept down there, I had a scorpion bite me. Never  forgot that. That was probably one of my recollections of sleeping down  there that stood out the most.  You shared a room with your brother?  Yes, we shared a room and a bed. We had an old flue that went up  through that house and an old heater there that tied into the flue. It was a  small house. I   m going to say that probably that house totaled, maybe,  was 1000 square feet, maybe twelve, something like that. So it wasn   t  really big.  Did your mom have a garden?  Oh, yes, we always had gardens, big gardens. Mom would spend most of  the summer canning, if she wasn   t working. We don   t do much canning  now. We used to, but all the things that she canned, we   d eat on them the  whole winter long. That was one way of keeping the cost down, because  money was tight. Like I said, we never did ever go hungry. We always  had plenty of food.  What were some of your favorite meals that she would cook?  It seemed like, to me, like as far as not really describing favorites, but I  can remember some things that we used to have that is not as common  now. Used to take that cornmeal and make a cornmeal mush. Have you  ever had that?  No.  Well, you   d make it into a loaf, and you   d let it dry. And then you   d  slice it off, and you   d brown it.  Fry it.  Fry it.  Put syrup on it.  Yes, we   d put syrup on it. What we had was molasses, sorghum  molasses. But that cornmeal mush is what they   d call it, and we fixed  some of that, because I kind of had a desire to go back to the old days.  And it   s pretty good, still. It seemed like we had a lot of things that we  13  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  used that sort of molasses on. I don   t remember where they got that at,  but we didn   t have some Karo syrup at that time, we had sorghum  molasses. I remember we always had butter on the table. We always had  good cured, smoked pork. And it seemed like we always had an animal  that we would process, fatten and process. And after we got our first  deep freeze, we had plenty. We had plenty of meat. I don   t know that we  ate unhealthy. We probably had a more of a fatty diet than what you   d  want to have today. We always had fresh milk.  Did your mom or grandma have a trick to butchering chickens?  Oh, yes. I got in on that a couple times. She   d grab them old chickens by  the neck and   I don   t know if you want to go into that or not   but just  wring them necks. Spin them around. She had a big old piece of wood  that had been cut up that stood about two foot tall or so, and it had a  flat   where it had been sawed off, flat, and that   s where she   d use that  ax to cut their heads off. Stillwater Mill is still here. Back in the old  days, whenever I was a kid, it was in that same location. It   s where we  get our feed. But we   d always go in in the spring, and we   d order about  two hundred or so baby chicks. It seemed like we   d always have about a  hundred of them. We would take and process them and put them in the  freezer as young pullets. The other ones we   d let grow a little older, and  we   d let them become layers. We   d leave them for old laying hens and  then after they got so old, why, then they   d become chicken and noodles.  (Laughs)  Yes, I was going to tell you about that. Do you remember Jerry Clower?  He   s an old country humorist, down from, I believe, Mississippi. They  made the records. You know Jerry Clower? Well, he talks about one of  his old growing up friends by the name of Marcel Ledbetter. He tells a  story on one of those tapes about Marcel, one day, coming to school, and  he got to school late. So the teacher asked him,    Why are you coming in  late?    He said,    Well, because I was cleaning chickens all morning long,  all night.    He asked him what happened. He said,    Well,    that night they  heard something down there in the henhouse. There was a bunch of  chickens that was carrying on, commotion and so on. They knew it was  probably some kind of predator after their chickens. So, I guess, Uncle  Vercy, who is Marcel   s father, he creeps down there with a shotgun, and  he has on one of these old, long flannel nightgowns. And he crept down  there and stuck the gun through the window of the chicken house and  just about that time, this old dog by the name of Beauregard, this old  coon dog that they had, come walking up behind Uncle Vercy, and he  stuck that cold nose up that night gown. And Uncle Vercy let loose with  both barrels and shot all the chickens. So they had to clean chickens all  night is the reason why Marcel couldn   t get to bed on time.  14  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Anyway, what that brings back is old memories, because almost every  night or two, we would have something in our henhouse, and we   d slip  down there. It was usually a coon or a skunk or an opossum or  something that was after the chickens. So we   d be down there shooting  at them. There was always something that went on with the chicken  house, some kind of a critter. I can remember one time I went down  there and shot an old civet cat. I don   t know if you   ve ever heard of a  civet cat, but a civet cat is kind of like a skunk. You don   t even see any  of them anymore. Instead of having a double stripe, they   re real small,  but they stink like a skunk, but they   ve got one single stripe down their  back. A skunk will get about eight to ten inches tall. These civet cats,  they don   t get over about four or five inches. I don   t know if anybody   s  even seen a civet cat around here in the last thirty, forty years. So I don   t  know if they   ve migrated out and become extinct or what, but I can  remember one time slipping down here because of all that commotion. I  had to shoot that civet cat. You know what happened. Well, I mean, all  the smell in the world was in that chicken house forever.  So growing up you had the barn, you had the chicken house     Yes.  What else was on the property aside from the old house?  There was a hog house right out here, a hog pen. We went to the cellar  one night. We went to the neighbor   s one night, because of threatening  storms, because we didn   t have a cellar. When we got back, the tornado  had torn up that hog house and part of the chicken house. It just wiped  that thing clean, and all the hogs were out in the yard when we drove in.  That was another building that we had and, really, that   s primarily it. We  didn   t have a lot of buildings, just a chicken house and the hog house  and a hog barn and a cow barn. That   s about the extent of it.  Your dad spent his career working for the city?  No, he worked for the county.  The county. And so farming was     It was almost a secondary deal to him, because he couldn   t make a living  off 160. Mom, later, as we got a little older, she went to work also. She  worked in restaurants and at the grocery store, and stuff like that. Later  on, they had their own restaurant. They had two or three of them and  made their living doing that. As they got a lot more prosperous, why,  then they started buying more land, and we   ve just continued with that.  We have, now, about 800 deeded acres and got around 1,600 or so that  15  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  we rent. So we   ve got enough to keep us busy now.  So as you   re growing up and you   re going to high school, are you  thinking you want to continue to be a farmer?  No, I didn   t really have that thought in mind as I was growing up. I  didn   t really know exactly what I wanted to be. That kind of blossomed,  and after I come back, Judi and I were married after we went to college.  I went to Michigan State because of wrestling. I wrestled there. Wrestled  in high school and then went on to college and wrestled and then met  Judi at Michigan State. She   s from Grand Rapids. That   s where she was  born and raised. Then later, we just moved back down here because  there was a job opening, after I graduated from college, here to coach  wrestling. And so came back to do that, and my dad died in      67?     68.     69. Yes, he died in    69, and so I just kind of took that over, too, because  I was already here. And it was a good place to raise the kids. That   s  probably the best, most beneficial thing of the farms that maybe gets  overlooked. It   s a good place to bring up kids. It   s an opportunity for  kids to learn responsibility and care for animals and learn how to   the  environment in town is a lot different from the country from that  standpoint. I didn   t get a chance to go to town very much. I probably  missed out on a lot of stuff, but what I didn   t know didn   t hurt me. Same  way with our kids, they stayed home a lot more than what the city kids  did. They were always out, so our kids didn   t go to town very much. I  think it helped with our family. I think it   s important to have a rural  background. I think it   s good for kids.  How   d you get interested in wrestling growing up?  That   s kind of a long story. I was just coming out of a gym one day up  there, from a PE class, and the high school wrestling coach caught me as  I was coming out of the door. We kind of met at the door. He put his arm  around me and said,    I   d kind of like to have you come out for  wrestling.    He showed some interest is really the factor that brought me  into the sport. I started about the ninth grade and become skilled enough  that I could go on and wrestle in college. Of course, in Perry, there   s a  lot of wrestlers in Perry.  Yes.  They just got through winning their thirty-eighth team championship,  which is a national record for winning state titles. But it   s helped our  boys, too, because both of our boys wrestled. Both of them wrestled at  16  J. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  OU. And our youngest boy, Jason, he continued at OU and went to law  school and graduated and then become a lawyer. And then, later, an  opening came at OU, and he is now the director of the compliance  department at OU, for NCAA. He teaches a law class, and he was the  head of the law department. He   s excelled well, and so much of that is  based upon his wrestling background, acquaintances that he made, the  contacts, the reputation he developed from hard work. It all goes along  with it.  I kind of think that that   s another thing that you might contribute back to  farming, the work ethic. Both of our boys have real strong work ethics.  They learned that  early . I bought them a hay wagon whenever they  were teenagers. They were both driving whenever they were about just  barely old enough to see over the wheel. Maybe five years old, six,  seven, I don   t know. They were both driving about everything we had.  They had a hay wagon whenever they were teenagers, and they had their  own jobs of hauling hay all summer. Am I forgetting anything, Judi?  No.  So you came back to Oklahoma after college, and you   re still involved  with the land. So tell me about what happens with the property here,  what   s going on? Are you running cattle at that point on it?  Well, yes, we do very little farming. We do have both rented and deeded  land. We have probably about four hundred acres of broken ground. We  raised some alfalfa, probably got about sixty-five, seventy acres of  alfalfa. The rest of it, we put out in wheat and rye grass. Primarily, our  focus is just only on providing crops for winter pasture to graze rather  than to harvest. Rye grass is something that we turn our buffalo out on  and our cattle, and it lessons up the feed bill in the wintertime,  immensely. Then in early spring, why, you   ll get pretty good grazing  then, too. The rest of it is just pastures, native grass, and stuff like that. It  seems like we put up hay about all summer long, just so we   ll have  enough hay to make it through the winter. We have about, probably,  250, maybe 300 head of cattle and about 225 or 230 head of buffalo.  How did you get started with the buffalo?  Well, that was a hobby deal that turned into business. Whenever I first  told Judi I wanted to buy some buffalo, they weren   t worth anything to  speak of. I think we bought those cows for two hundred dollars each. I  think there was three of them or something like that, three cows. And  then we went and found a bull somewhere. And then we just put them  out here on this small pasture west of the house. The first time we turned  them out, we had them in a pen, first, because we kind of wanted to get  17  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  them acclimated to being here and not where they were. We turned them  out and they just went   there was a couple calves, I think, seventeen or  eighteen calves out there in that pasture. We turned them out and, oh, I   ll  never forget that. They took off running, and they ran as hard as they  could go to the other end of the pasture, and they were just wanting out.  I mean, they were just glad to be out. That   s what they were. They were  excited about being out. They took after them cattle and scared the  daylights out of the cattle, and the cattle was running for their lives. I  thought everything was going to crash into the fence and go right on to  I-35. But they made the turn when they got to the edge of the fence and  come back. So everything was alright after that.  We just started to slowly keep our calves, and we   d pick up a few more  somewhere else, and the herd built up to like twenty head or something  like that. And then, lo and behold, we had people stopping by, wanting  to buy. We were still in the process of building and didn   t know what we  was going to do. We were getting more head than what we had pasture  for, so we had to get rid of some cattle. Now, we   ve got two herds.  We   ve got one on this 320 acres out here by the house, and then we   ve  got another herd on the other side of I-35. What it   s become is a business  somewhat like cattle from the standpoint that we wean the calves, and  we take the calves away from the mommas, and we put them in another  pasture or we put them in pens and grow them.  The buffalo market   s got very good. It got real good again after   we  bought those first ones for two hundred, then the first thing you know,  we were selling heifer calves for two thousand, weighing four hundred  pounds, six months old. We thought that would never end, and all of a  sudden that market went south, and we were selling cows again for two  hundred dollars. See, we   ve raised them now for thirty years. Now, the  meat market has developed and there   s such a demand, and there   s not  very many animals. Whenever they got real cheap, they liquidated a lot  of them and numbers went down, and now the meat market is up and the  animal numbers are down. So to make a long story short, it started out as  a hobby, and then we got into a deal where it   s become a very strong  business. We just recently sold twenty fat-out bulls, weighing about a  thousand pounds each, and they   re going to a guy in Texas who has a  meat market. They sold them things for more money than what you get  out of cattle. I don   t mind telling you, it was two dollars a pound, live  weight on the hoof. I was told I could have got more than that out of  them, but there   s just a real demand for them.  Plus, I think the reason he took them was he admired those buffalo. They  have traits that are just different from cattle.  Yes, I like to watch them. Buffalo live to be a little longer age than what  18  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  cattle do. The mommas are really good mommas and they really protect  them. You   ve got to watch around a momma whenever they   ve got a  calf. If there   s any kind of noise from that calf, if that calf lets out a  squall, you might have four or five mommas in there in your hip  pockets, because it   s not uncommon for other mommas to try to protect  other calves. That   s not uncommon at all.  With the bull. Remember the baby that died?  Yes, we had a situation one time   I   ve told this story several times.  There   s been several people that have asked us to speak at deals about  buffalo, characteristics and whatever. Anyway, I can tell you this one  story. We had this pet wolf, and this wolf loved to torment the buffalo  and especially the cows. He   d give those cows fits because he   d run  around them, and the cows were trying to protect their calves. They   d be  chasing him, and they never could catch him, but he   d cut and weave  and everything else. That one cow had a calf, and she was out there  trying to protect the calf. The calf was dead, laying on the ground there,  but she was standing guard over it. That wolf was up there, and I was in  the pasture right next to where that wolf was. It followed me up there  because I wanted to go up and see about that cow. I could see the calf  was dead, and so the wolf was tormenting the cow, and the cow was all  concerned about its calf. The bull come walking up there.  Anyway, I hollered at the wolf and had the wolf follow me back to the  house. So I went around into the other pasture with my pickup. And  when I drive into the pasture, those buffalo know they   re going to get  fed. Usually, the first one there is the bull. There   s one or the other bulls,  there   s several bulls in the herd. This one particular bull always wanted  to be the first one there, and he would stand right beside your door, and  he   d eat cubes from your hand, whatever. But as I drove in there, all the  buffalo came to where I was except the bull. That bull stayed right there  by the calf, didn   t care, never left it, even though he knew he was going  to get fed or would have got fed.  So I make that little story known to some people in a day and age when  you   ve got mothers that abandon their children and everything else.  You   ve still got characteristics by certain animals that are exemplary. So  there   s a lot of things about buffalo I like, and they   re just a neat animal.  They   re nature   s animal. They   re just an animal that is kind of a symbol  of America. Anytime you have an animal that was on a coin, there aren   t  any other animals on coins. There are towns named after buffalo and  everything else.  Well, it   s nice because at one point in Oklahoma   s history, buffalo  roamed the land and you know, then, they were gone. So it   s nice that  19  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  you   re bringing them back.  Yes, I guess you might say that we   re bringing them back, because of  the value to them in one respect, but, yet, when we started out trying to  bring them back, they weren   t worth nothing then. So that   s not the  entire reason why we raise them. We raise them because we like them.  But to answer your question, we do raise buffalo and cattle and that   s  primarily the main animals that we raise. But we do raise hay, which is a  valuable commodity to us, some rye grass and wheat, and it   s primarily  used for grazing. So that   s about all we do with our land. I didn   t know  if you meant earlier whenever you asked what we were going to do with  this land, if it was aimed at passing it on or what our kids are going to do  with it. That   s a question we haven   t really thoroughly identified or  answered yet. Our kids, like so many farm families, ranching families,  whatever, the kids don   t have that interest anymore.  I think the interest would be in the fact that they want to keep it in the  family, because they do care about that. They don   t want to work the  farm because they saw us, and we worked every day of the week kind of  thing. I don   t think they want to live that kind of life, but I think that  they recognize the value that it belongs to this family, and that   s where  it   s going to stay.  Yes, we don   t have any plans on ever getting rid of it. It would be nice  to see them have more interest in it, outside of just being the owner of it.  And at some point in time they might change their mind. They may be  late bloomers. (Laughs)  Were they in 4-H in high school?  I don   t remember if we ever had them in 4-H or not. I was in 4-H in  school, but I don   t think they ever were in 4-H. And being in athletics,  they didn   t have time for FFA.  And all summer long, we worked. We   d be over cutting or baling hay,  and they   d be hauling or something. Everybody would be at the lake  celebrating July Fourth, and we   d always be in the field. We just never  had time to do a lot of other things.  Yes, that   s very true. They never did really have the time to go run  around with their friends, because they were either working for us or  they were working on their own, which I don   t think that we need to be  apologetic for that.  No.  20  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  I think that work ethic is what has got them where they   re at right now,  and they   re very successful.  And I think the fact that every weekend we wouldn   t let the kids go to  town, we kept them out here   but every weekend, we had town kids out  here.  Yes.  Every weekend, we   d have five or six boys that were always with our  boys. So those kids wanted to come out to the country. They didn   t  really want to stay in town. They wanted to be out here.  Yes, because they   d be fishing     Oh, they   d be fishing        or going down there and playing in the ponds or swimming        building forts        or doing all kinds of things. That   s one thing that we used to often do  a lot of when we was kids, and I kind of halfway forgot about that. We  had canes and we   d be in there standing in the creeks, getting crawdads,  playing with them crawdads or going fishing with the grasshoppers or  whatever. We did a lot of that fishing, did a lot of hunting when we were  kids. That   s another thing that our kids no longer do. I used to take them  hunting whenever they were young. They enjoyed it. They had guns, and  we   d shoot, trap, and all kinds of things. They don   t seem to do much  fishing or hunting anymore. They don   t have time for it. They   re too  busy in their endeavors in town, whatever.  How many ponds are on the property?  Oh, I guess there must be about   I guess there   s two, three, four, five,  six, seven, eight, nine   probably about fifteen.  Conservation efforts through the years? Terracing or   ?  We   ve done all that. We did waterways and everything, and that   s  always been a good, primary focus of ours is to make certain that we  have adequate conservatorship of the land. We   ve done the terraces, and  we   ve done the waterways. My dad did a lot of those terraces. It   s  almost better not to even disturb the land, period, just have grass. What  we have now   and I have seen the biggest change on this since I have  lived as long as I have   is the amount of trees. I spend a good part of  21  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  my time fighting those trees. Now, there   s trees that I like, don   t get me  wrong, but we have those trees like hedge apple, bodark, that are just  taking over. We have the red cedar, and I   m cutting red cedars down all  the time. I spent yesterday, until I about froze, out cutting cedars. I   ve  got a skid steer, and I   ve got a clipper on it, so I   m out there cutting  them. And the little ones, there   s millions of them, as many as you want  to count in this one field over here. If you don   t stay on top of it with the  amount of land that we have, they   d just take over. If it   s not the hedge  apple or the red cedar, we   ve got a big old growth of honey locust, the  ones with the big long spikes?  Yes.  They   re coming in strong. And besides that, you   ve got the blackberry  bushes that have come on a lot stronger. We didn   t used to have those.  The sumac and the plum thickets, and what else is there? All those kind  of undesirables, you spend a lot of your time spraying those and trying  to kill them and keep the land where you   ve got room for the grass to  grow, because they take over. You   ve still got a lot of undesirable trees,  like hackberry and a bunch of that stuff, and the elm trees that are thick.  I can live with them, but I can   t live with them honey locust, them big  long spikes, because they   re awful. But we spend a lot of time in the  summertime just eradicating those undesirable trees so that the grass can  grow and we can keep our prairies, our pastures in good shape.  We spend a lot of money on spraying to get rid of all that scrub brush.  What people will tell you whenever you had the Land Run, there was no  trees, only a few trees and the creeks. But it was solid grass. Now, if you  look out here, you   ve got all kinds of trees that have grown up. If you  took a picture of all this country from fifty years back, a fifty-year-ago  picture, you wouldn   t see all these trees. It   s amazing how much brush  has come in. There   s trees that I like. I like the big old shade trees, the  oaks, the walnuts, and the pecans and stuff like that, but we can do away  with some of those others.  Did you have much interaction with county agents through the years?  We did when we was kids. The one that we have now, I really like him.  We talk quite a bit. But when we were kids, I can remember, we started  a 4-H club right here in this house with a 4-H   I think his name was,  well, I   m not going to say it was him. I remember Jay Hesser, but I don   t  think it was him at that time, that came out here to this house and we  started that 4-H club. We called it the Hunter 4-H Club. I don   t think it   s  the Hunter 4-H Club. I think it   s gone into another one. But the Hunter  4-H, there was a county school that   s a mile south of here, and my first  year of school was the year that it closed. I think I went down there for  22  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Finchum  like, about three or four weeks, and then they closed it, and we went to  town after that. But that was named the Hunter Schoolhouse. That old  schoolhouse was down there for probably eight or ten years after that.  No, it was probably longer than that, maybe twenty years after that, and  then later on somebody burned it down. But I remember going down  there and spending, oh, about a week before I was to become a first  grader. I remember the way the schoolhouse was laid out. It was just like  any old country school, but there was all the neighboring kids. It had  about maybe fifteen kids in that schoolhouse, total. That country school  would   ve been all right. I   d have liked that.  Since we   re speaking of schools, did you spend any time in the library,  downtown?  Down here?  Yes.  Yes, yes I did. When I was in school, you mean?  Yes, or even now.  I don   t spend near as much time as   that   d be the person you   d want to  talk to is Judi, right there. She spends a lot of time down there. (Laughs)  And it   s a Carnegie library.  That   s the Carnegie library, right. But I found it real helpful whenever I  was in high school. That library was good for if you had to write reports,  things like that. But I used it quite a little bit whenever I was teaching  here, years ago. Send kids down there to dig up information out of that  library. We   re lucky to have that library, and it has developed quite a  little bit in the last fifteen years.  When you were growing up, how would you get to school?  I rode the bus.  How was that?  We had a bus. I rode the bus until I guess I was old enough to drive and  then I had a car. If I didn   t stray out of line, why, I got to continue  driving the car, otherwise it   d be the bus again. But we had an old  county bus that   d come by here to pick us up.  We talked a little bit about 4-H. Was your mother a member of a  23  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  homemaker club?  She was at an early point in my life and that wasn   t for a very long time,  but yes she was. I don   t remember which one it was, though. I can  remember that when that old school closed, it kind of became a kind of  convention center, in a way. I mean, you might call it that, you might  not. Mother and some other neighbors organized dances to be held down  there, and it was a neighborhood dance place. It wasn   t very big, but I  can remember when we were kids, we   d go down there and we   d all   as  soon as you walk in, there was an old pot-bellied stove over here on this  one side, but there was a big table. And Mom and the rest of the mothers  would bed all the kids down on this big table. That   s where we   d sit and  stay out of everybody   s way so they could go dance. They   d have that  and talked a little old group of people into playing that was somewhat  good with playing a guitar and whatever. I think it was three old  bachelor brothers by the name of the Thompsons.  They   d play every Saturday night, and all the neighbors would come  there and then dance. I remember one time they had a cake walk at one  of those dances. That was my first experience to be in a cake walk. You  got out there. You   d walk around in a circle. As long as the band would  be playing, you   d continue walking. But as soon as that band stopped, if  you were on that spot, why, then you   d get the cake. I remember I got  the cake that one night. Of course, everybody got to eat it, so I didn   t  take nothing home. (Laughs) Yes, that was quite a time. Every Saturday  night, that   s where all the neighbors would go. Bring the kids. It was a  way of living and a way of entertaining yourself.  How did this particular property earn the name Broken Bar L Ranch?  Where did that come from?  Well, we wanted the L because our last name is Leonard. There was  already a Bar L, and we wanted a ranch name that was not the same as  somebody else   s. So I come across this book that was published by Time  Life on ranches and brands, and there was a Broken Bar in this book of  brands. So we just put it as Broken Bar L, and then we registered that  brand with the   it   s not registered now because you have to pay every  year to have it registered every year with the Cattleman   s Association.  The first five years, I think, we just registered it, so we   d have that. But  there was already a Bar L. It was up there by Marland.  So this is what you do in your retirement?  Well, I   m not really retired. See, we did have the Sale Barn. We just  recently sold that, effective January first of this year. We had the Sale  Barn for about five years, six years I guess it was, five and a half. That  24  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  was my outside employment. Judi, she works at Meridian VoTech.  Anyway, we sold that, so now I am kind of somewhat retired, but I   m  not really retired. I mean, old enough for Social Security, but I got a lot  of cattle to feed and a lot of buffalo to take care of, and I   m still looking  for something else to do. It   s always been a deal where we   ve had other  employment our whole life and taking care of whatever else needed to  be done out here. So we   ve always been real busy and always had more  to do than what we could get done. Now, I   ve grown up that way and  lived that kind of life. I don   t like to slow down, so I   ll probably look for  something to do one of these days. Somebody told me one time, it   s  better to wear out than to rust out. So there you go.  How long did you teach?  I taught fifteen years and then I decided it was time to go do something  else before I got too old to do something else. Judi, she taught   sixteen?  Seventeen, seventeen years.  Seventeen years. We   ve taught quite a while, but we   ve had two  restaurants. When I got out of teaching, why, then I got into the oil field,  and I had two hot oil service trucks, which are trucks that treat oil and do  a lot of remedial work on wells, and an acid truck. We had wells that we  drilled. We drilled seven or eight wells, oil wells. So we had a very good  business in the oil field until the oil field went sour back in the early     90s. So we sold all that, and then we built another restaurant. We had  that, we had Cattle Baron   s restaurant that we built in Perry and had that  for ten years. Got tired of working everyday and never having a day off,  so we just sold that thing. Then I became a stockbroker for, I guess,  seven or eight years. Success rate of being a stockbroker is about a 90  percent failure rate, 99, 95 percent failure rate, usually in the first year. I  lasted for about eight years and when I bought that Sale Barn, why,  Morgan Stanley wouldn   t let me continue if I had another fulltime  business, because there were certain days I couldn   t be available to be by  the phone when we had our sale going on. So I had to quit that, and then  I bought the Sale Barn. So we   ve done a lot of stuff. Had a lot of  different experiences in our lifetime, I guess.  And continue to farm the land.  Yes.  That   s why our kids don   t to it. We always encouraged them, don   t be  farmers because you never make any money. So they took us for our  words. (Laughs)  25  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Well, I think our kids   we worked them so hard, I think that   s the  reason they don   t want to come back.  Once they did that, they didn   t want to come back. (Laughs)  They always ask when they   re getting ready to come back,    Is all the        Wheat in?        work done?    (Laughter) Here is a picture here of my dad and mother  and me and my little brother. Now, this picture is not at the old house.  (Gestures) I don   t know where that was. Here   s a picture of my mother  and me. (Gestures)  Looks like maybe a church, you went to church, possibly?  Could   ve been, could   ve been. Here   s a picture of my dad when he got  his first white-faced Hereford bull, young Hereford bull that was a  complete upgrade from any kind of bull we ever had before. (Gestures)  He bought a Brahma bull one time that he was really proud of.  Yes. Here   s a picture of me. I weighed ten pounds and seven or eight  ounces, I think it was, when I was born. I weighed more when I was six  months old than I was supposed to weigh in a year. You can see my legs  here. (Gestures) I was a big lad. (Laughter) Here   s a picture of me trying  to pet that bull. (Gestures)  Any first tractor ride stories?  There   s the first, right there, the first tractor with my dad that I ever  remember buying   or my dad ever had, the John Deere. I can remember  when I was a little kid, these roads used to be really terrible about being   muddy . If they ever got wet, you couldn   t hardly get up and down  them. Somebody come down the road and got stuck and come up here,  and I was just a little small kid. And my mother, he asked my mother to  pull him out with that tractor. She was trying to start it. It had the old fly  wheel on the side that you had to spin to get the   you flipped it over  past the compression deal, and it had a little petcock on it. Anyway,  why, that   s the only way you could start it. It didn   t have electric start.  You had to move that wheel. Once that fly wheel would spin, it might go  ahead and hit, it was a two cylinder. Anyway, she caught her finger on  something in there, and it just smashed her finger something terrible.  After that, the guy, he felt bad. Mother felt worse, but the thing was he  never got pulled out by her, because she went straight to the house with  that smashed finger or smashed fingers.  26  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  Here   s me in my first   I don   t know if it   s my first calf or not, but you  can see what kind of livestock we had. It   s not the best. You can see one  of them old cats back there. That   s probably some milk that we had  milked out of the cow and give it to that calf to eat.  And our kids did that all the time they were growing up. We told them  that they had to have calves. And they had sold those calves, and they  put the money away, and it lasted all the way through college. They  saved all their extra money. But they would get up early and go out and  give those calves some milk, bottles, all through their lives.  We   d buy them little old dairy calves.  And they   d ride them, later, when they got bigger. (Laughs)  They   d raise them up and sell them and put away for their college  money. See, there   s the kind of car we had back in those days.  (Gestures)  What were holidays like?  We did a lot of reunions, a lot of going to the relation. That   s the thing  that   s changed now. Memorial Day was a holiday in which all the  relation   most all of the Stewarts and relations buried out here in Grace  Hill. Memorial Day was a holiday a lot of the relation would come in  and visit after they went to the graveside. Nowadays you don   t have that  near type of thing. It   s a holiday that   s evolved and changed a little bit.  You don   t see that anymore. A lot of people don   t go and decorate the  graves like they used to.  I can remember that we used to go a lot to Ark City where my aunt was,  my dad   s sister. I told several people this story before, it seemed like to  me back in those days, we were a dry state. We used to go to Ark City  because that   s where my aunt was, my dad   s sister, and we   d visit with  them. It seemed like we went up there about once a month. Well, we  didn   t go up there near as often after the state became wet. (Laughs)  We   d go to my aunt   s and then after we got through visiting with them,  why, it seemed like dad would go down there to that liquor store, and  he   d get some bottles for him and the neighbors. And they would come  back and put them in the pickup   or in the trunk of the car, and we   d  come home. We did a lot of visiting with relation, and we don   t do that  near like what we used to. We don   t have the association with our  relation like what we used to.  Would you help out on other farms?  27  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Well, I didn   t do that that much. My dad was involved in that. I used to  have some pictures of all the neighbors harvesting. I remember that there  was one gentleman down here, south of here about three miles, by the  name of George Warner. And he was the only person around that had a  baler. Whenever we wanted to get our hay baled, he was the gentleman  that would come up with his tractor and bale it. It seemed like that we   d  go help him, my dad would. Dad was on a circle, it seemed like. He was  one of the ends of the stop. This gentleman would go to here, and dad  would go help them, and then he would come to here. (Gestures) So in  other words, dad worked his bill out with the gentleman that had the  baler. That went on for years and years because the balers were  expensive and not very many people had them at that time. Nowadays,  everybody   s got a baler. But those days, there was just one man.  Somewhat similar to that was the way that they would put up their wheat  and their oats, you know. They   d have somebody that would come over  and they   d put them out and bind them up. What was it called? When  you bind those oats up in bundles and you bundle them up into     Shocks?  Shocks. Shocks. You   d shock them. I remember that. Yeah. Take them  and you   d cut them oats off with a mower. A mower would lay down to  a binder, is what it   s called, and it   d run them all together, and it   d tie  them, and it   d be in that big a round of a bundle. You take all these  bundles and put them into shocks, you know. It   d be kind of like a  teepee. That   s how they   d store them in the wintertime. Yeah, I didn   t  really get in on much of that, going to the neighbors and doing that kind  of stuff with them, but my dad did.  Have the neighbors changed through the years?  Oh, yeah. I think there   s a lot of changing from the standpoint of people.  We seemed like we were more involved with the other people. Today,  you   re more involved with yourself, or your own family, and not as  involved with the neighbors. You were more aware of their needs. You  were there to help them more than what we are today. We   re too much  focused on ourselves today. And we spent more time with them. Now,  we don   t, you know. We know who they are, but it   s not the same kind  of neighborly thing that I grew up with.  The town   s changed quite a bit?  Oh, yeah, I   m sure the same thing. Same attitude has changed in town,  but when we were small, we would go to all of our neighbors. That was  our big thrill. We   d go to the Bezdiceks that lived down south. Then  28  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  we   d go to the Cartiers that lived over west, and we   d go to the Kanories  that lived over here west. You know, the Smiths and the Woodalls and  we just had this group of neighbors that all got together and played cards  together and did all kinds of things together. They were more aware of  needs of individuals. I don   t know if you   d call it more caring or    It   s  just a different attitude than what we have today. We lost that years ago,  years ago.  Well, as we wind everything down, do you have some nuggets of advice  that your parents passed on to you that still ring true today?  Well, I don   t know that anything I have that   s any different than what  other parents probably preach to their children. Things like you   re only  as good as what your word is. Those are the principles I still live by. I  don   t tolerate people that lie to me. I don   t tolerate people that   s word  isn   t any good.  I think if you asked our boys too   our boys and different kids in  different generations   I think that when they wrote in high school, they  write about Dad and the fact that he has always respected them. Respect  is a big issue for the boys and everybody. All their friends respect the  family, this family, and that was really nice. Their college friends would  talk about it, too. That they were really proud of the fact that we were  still married, and we still lived on the farm, and we still worked hard.  That   s what our kids talk about a lot to their friends.  So many of their friends    families were split. That comment was made a  lot of times. They were always dragging back friends on weekends and  stuff like that. They were amazed that we were married as long as what  we had been. But we just told our kids to be themselves and to work  hard and to be honest and caring for each other. Just the basic things. I  don   t know if anything is any more important than another. If they were  going to wrestle in college, which they did, and they did well, they had  to have the right traits. Perseverance, discipline, dedication, all of those  kinds of things that make you a success. Otherwise, you   re not going to  be successful in wrestling. Wrestling is the one sport that takes so much  out of you. They learned so much of that right here. Right here on this  old farm.  What does it take to be successful on the farm?  Some of the same points. You can be a hard worker even though    I   ve  seen a lot of people that just work their tail end off and didn   t pay very  close attention to the financial part of it. Work all year long and then be  broke. Farming has changed a lot, and that   s the only reason why I don   t  like to be involved very much in farming, because you can work like all  29  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  get out and still have a poor crop due to a million different things. It  could be weather, hail, lack of rain, bugs, whatever. There   s a lot of  things that work on you and not have any crop when you get done. Just  go in the hole. Or you might even get a good crop and then the price is  so low that, you know, you can   t make a profit. So. You can work hard  and still not be successful. I guess maybe you have to get a little bit  lucky. Or you have to diversify. Don   t take a lot of risks.  I think that   s one reason why we were lucky whenever we diversified  and got into the oil business. We made income off of that and had  buffalo and that   s a diversification from just straight cattle. Cattle is  down and buffalo are up, whatever. We even used to have some elk. The  state government got involved in that where they imposed a lot of  restrictions on you, and it made it difficult to operate with those  restrictions, so we just decided to get rid of them. That would have been  a good diversification, also, if the State Department hadn   t gotten  involved with that.  There was a disease called chronic wasting disease, CWD, that  somewhat resembles mad cow disease. There was an outbreak of that  down in Edmond, at an elk ranch, in which they imported in an animal  that had it, from Montana. So veterinarians in the Department of  Agriculture, in all their wisdom, decided that they were going to come  up with all these new requirements and restrictions that banned the  import and export of the animals. I can go into a lot of that, but I won   t.  To make a long story short, it just got to be real cumbersome to own.  Might as well get rid of them, because they hurt the value of them.  To answer your question, there   s a lot of people that have went broke in  farming. A lot of them had everything given to them and they still went  broke. There   s a lot of people that just scratched and made themselves a  real success, did it with almost nothing, and are a success today. So I  don   t know that I really know the real answer or if I could ever put my  finger on the one trait that would make you successful. It   d have to be a  host of things. You can   t just go out and work and not be aware of your  costs and what you can arrive at from your sales of your products or  whatever. It   s a tough business. I guess that   s the best way to summarize  that.  It is a tough business. You   ve mentioned several times in the interview  today, the future of the farm. What do you hope to see happen to the  farm in the next one hundred years?  Well, I hope it can remain intact and be operated by somebody that will  be a good steward. Take care of it. One of the things that we are all  facing in this country is land that is subdivided and made into housing  30  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  developments and whatever, large ranches that get broken up. We   re  losing a lot of that. I just kind of hope this stays in place and somebody  takes it over that will like it like we do. This is what we like. We like  staying here. We like living here. This is our little spot. Not as big as  some, maybe larger than others, but it   s a nice place for us to call home.  Our kids never really have picked up on that yet, I   m just hoping that  they do.  You know, you can come out here and you walk around and you   re not  bothered. You don   t have a neighbor right next to you, or whatever,  hollering or screaming and you can hear them through your window. Or  somebody   s dog is barking, or whatever. We do have to put up with I-  35, we didn   t used to have that. But when the federal government came  in back here in 1959, whatever, said they were condemning our land.  They said,    We   ll give you seventy-five dollars an acre.    Our recourse  was,    Well, you can fight us in court, but you   ll probably lose. Whatever  money we give you, you   ll probably spend to fight us.    Several  neighbors, they met and talked about whether or not they was going to  fight it, but nobody wanted to fight the federal government. So we got I-  35 that split us. We   ve got land on the other side. Just one of those deals.  They ended up building that highway in    61.  How did that make you feel?  Well, you know, that law has been on the books forever. I think there are  times that law is abused, maybe not by the federal government in this  particular case, but I think there   s municipal governments and state  governments that abuse that law, because they can. Eminent right, public  domain, they can just go in and condemn your land and use it for  whatever purpose they want, whether you want to sell it or not. I never  did like it. I   d rather see I-35 somewhere else besides right next to us.  How much land did they end up having to purchase from you?  Well, I-35 goes down the half-mile line, you see, and so they take a little  bit off each side. In this particular case, on this quarter here, they took all  of it off of this quarter instead of being in the middle. Took all of it off  here and it wound up taking about twenty acres off this quarter.  Trucks going through at night, it   s not always pleasant     No, it   s not the most pleasant sound here. It used to be really quiet when  I was a kid, and you very seldom seen many cars. That   s another change  that we have nowadays, you have a lot more cars running up and down  the road. This used to be really the country. We   re almost the outskirts,  now.  31  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  I heard the train whistle a little while ago.  We   ve always had that, and the numbers of trains have increased greatly.  Increased?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. They   re up to, I don   t know, we   ve got two tracks that  go through Perry. We   ve got the Frisco, which runs east and west, and  then you   ve got the Santa Fe. Now it   s the Burlington Northern. But  when Perry was started, there wasn   t the town of Perry. There was a  little old spot on the map where both these tracks was    I can   t  remember the name. What was the name of that little town? It wasn   t  really a town. It was just a stop just right outside of where Perry is now.  Those tracks, trains came through a long time before statehood, like in  the 1870s. But, nowadays, when you count both of them I suppose  you   re up to close to two hundred trains a day. There are trains coming  through every four or five minutes, and they   re longer. There was a  length that they didn   t want to exceed. They   re passed that now. I think  some of those trains are close to a mile and a half long.  Did they come through this property or close to this property?  It splits our property on the south.  So back in the early days, were there issues with hobos?  Yeah, when I was a kid. There was hobos, then. You   d see people  walking the track when I was a little kid. You used to have issues of     The trains do a better job now of taking care of their right-of-ways, and  they don   t do a very good job anymore on their fences. Because see, that  fence along the boundary lines of the tracks, the right-of-ways, are  maintained and owned by the railroad. If you have a problem with the  fence, you have to address it through them. A lot of times, they   re not  very receptive.  Is that same thing true with the interstate?  Yes, it   s the interstate fence. It   s the state of Oklahoma   s. They built it.  The federal government built it and then they gave it to ODOT. They  have to take care of it. They   re trying to back out of their agreement to  keep the fences up, too. Because when you call, they say,    We   ll give  you some wire and material if you go fix it.    I said,    It ain   t my  responsibility, it   s your fence. You   re the one that come down here and  condemned the land.    So we have a fight with them all the time. Those  fences, they were put in in 1960 and they   re in bad shape. Yeah, we used  32  J. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  J. Leonard  T. Leonard  Finchum  to have issues with hobos. We   re lucky that we don   t have a lot of  people hopping off of I-35, we   re really lucky about that. We have had a  few that come down here. Something happened along I-35 and then they  walk to where there   s a light. We have a light at night, or something.  We always had the whoof, with the Dobermans. So we didn   t get many  visitors. (Laughs) Always kept big Dobermans.  That would keep me away. Anything else you   d like to share with us that  we haven   t asked you?  Well, you   d probably have to ask me to get me to say something. I don   t  remember. (Laughter)  Did your mother make cottage cheese?  I don   t recall her making much cottage cheese. I know a neighbor over  there used to talk about making cottage cheese, Fred Wollemeier. His  mom used to make it and hang it out, whatever, you know. I don   t  remember Mom ever making cottage cheese. I can remember, we used  to make a lot of butter. The way we made butter was not probably the  best way to make it, but Momma just had all this cream she   d saved up,  she   d skim off the top of the milk every day, and we   d put it in a gallon  jar, and we   d just shake it. Shake it back and forth until it became butter.  We   d pass that around. Somebody would shake for a while,    I   m tired.  Here, you do it.    (Laughs) But she had a butter mold. Do we still have  that butter mold?  We still have that butter mold, the old wooden one.  Still got that butter mold. Put all that butter in there, make it and then  freeze it. And we did all that canning stuff. You know, make jellies and  stuff like that out of sand plums and the berries, blackberries. We didn   t  call them blackberries, we called them dew berries. I don   t know how  much difference there is between the blackberry    Still looked like a  blackberry, but they called them dew berries. That   s what I was talking  about. We got the outbreak of those vines. Used to be, when I was a  little kid, we had to go all over to try to find a few vines that had those  things, and we   d always get the chiggers and everything else you   d get.  Now, we   ve got areas that would be bigger than this house of nothing  but solid vines. It may be eight foot tall. They   re terrible. It takes a lot of  spray to kill them vines out, and you have to do it more than one year,  too, because they come back. It   s evolved from a deal that it was kind of  nice to have a few vines on your place to they   re becoming a scourge.  You mentioned there was an orchard early on. Did any of those trees  33  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Finchum  T. Leonard  Nykolaiszyn  survive?  No, no, no, they   re all gone. I don   t ever remember them whenever I was  a kid. I know we had a peach tree out there, but I think most of those     Orchards are tough to raise. Those peach trees and stuff like that are  subject to getting bores in them and all that. There   s always  something    Seemed like we used to have a peach tree out here and  about eight out of ten years, you   d have a late freeze and it   d kill all the  blooms and the peaches that was on it. Then whenever you finally got a  few peaches, it seemed like the wasps got into them and got their share  and made them fall off and everything. It   s always something eating on  them. We never had very good luck with the orchard. But, it   s still a  good life.  How early do we get up these days?  I get up at, what, 4:45? Something like that every morning.  Before the sun     Yeah. I go to the Y at 5, 5:30 every morning. I kind of got away from  that when I was in the Sale Barn, but now that I   m not in that, I   ve made  it every day this week and every day last week. Almost every day, the  week before. I say every day, Monday through Friday. Trying to get my  belly back down to where it should be. Try to diet and exercise.  Whatever.  Well, we appreciate your time. Thank you so much for sharing a little bit  about your farm and your family with us. We really appreciate it.  -------  -------
