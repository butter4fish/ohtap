 Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Today is Wednesday August 6, 2014, and we are near Guymon,  Oklahoma, interviewing Edward Mueller, part of the Bartels-Mueller  Farm. This project is part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families  oral history project. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn. Also with me is  Tanya Finchum. Edward, thank you so much for joining us.  I   m glad to do it.  All right. So let   s learn a little bit more about your family. Can you tell  us how your family came to this part of Oklahoma?  Well, actually  it  would be my step-grandfather. All my half-brothers  and sisters, it was their grandparents that came here, their grandfather.  And he came out here from Missouri from the Sweet Springs, Concordia  part of Missouri, about the middle, back in 1906. He was born in 1884,  so that made him roughly about twenty-two years old. He loaded up  some belongings, some equipment. I don   t know if he brought livestock  or not, but mainly equipment and got on what he called an immigrant  train that was headed this way, down the railroad. As he got out here, he  had a stop in Buckland, Kansas and inquired about land and they said,     No. Go further. Go on further down the line,    and ended up at Guymon  and that   s where he stayed.  He got off and come out to the north of Guymon and found a track of  land, I guess, that suited him. It apparently had probably been settled on  a year or two before, but those people had left, and he bought what was  known as a relinquishment in 1906, which you have to improve it for  five years, and then it becomes yours after the five years is up. I know  when I got ready to do this centennial  farm application  I could not find  any records of his owning the land until 1911 until I finally went to the  historical society in Oklahoma City, and they sent me the copies  showing where he had bought the relinquishment in 1906. So it did  5  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  verify that he did settle in 1906 and stayed the rest of his life.  And what improvements did he make on the land?  As far as I know, there was no improvements there at that time, and he  lived in a half dugout there on the place for a couple of years. I believe  his first child was born there in the dugout, and then his second child,  which would be my mother   s first husband, was born around 1914 or  1916, but by then, he had a house. Then it just went from there. The  house was added on to several times over the years and improved and a  cellar and what they called a smokehouse, which we now call the motor  shed. It changed several different uses and, like I said, the well house  and just several other buildings that we have on the historical structures   list  that are still standing and still used.  The original house is still standing?  The original house is still standing, yes. It   s modern. I mean it   s been  added onto several times over the years.  The original acreage of the relinquishment was how big?  One hundred and sixty acres which I own all of it now. And like I said,  it   s got numerous buildings on it that   s been put there over the past.  And so as he started out, what types of crops did he start adding?  Well, I guess probably the main crop that he would probably have grown  was wheat and probably some milo, I   m just not sure on that. I do know  that when he did come out here, he always told me about bringing a  checkrow corn planter. For a long time I never really knew, but I finally  studied up and found out what a checkrow corn planter was. That was  something that would not work out here with our droughts that we have,  the dryness, corn would not last. So, needless to say, that went by the  wayside. Most of it I   m sure was wheat that they grew out here. I know,  you know, the first year you broke out about five or ten acres was all  you could get done, and it just slowly went from there.  And tell me how the farm ownership progressed.  Well, my grandfather, my step-grandfather I should say   my dad,  actually his dad   let me back up a little bit. He homesteaded up north  here, thirteen miles, a mile this side of the Kansas line. That   s where my  dad was raised, so my family has been out here also this same amount of  time. We don   t own the place anymore. I wish we did. Now your  question was?  6  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  The progression of ownership.  Okay, the progression of ownership. My grandfather stayed there, I  believe, pretty well through the mid-  40s. I   m going to say somewhere  around    46 or so is the best to my knowledge that he retired and went to  town, him and his wife. She was raised two miles west over here on a  homestead. Her last name was Kroencke, and I knew he used to talk  about when he first moved out here in 1906 and met some of the  neighbors, and the Kroenckes had four or five girls. He would work all  day in the field with his horses or mules, and at night he would walk  over there to see her because the horses were wore out and so he would  walk. He would talk about walking home during the night after dark, and  the coyotes would be a hollering, and you know you just kind of picked  your pace up a little bit and moved a little faster. Anyway, he married  her a couple of years after he was here, and that was the start of his  family down here at that time.  I think their first child might have been born, I think maybe it was 1908  or 1909, his daughter, and then the son was born a few years later, might  have been 1912. Then when he retired and moved to town, he took up  the job as a custodian at a local school, just a little grade school there  because he loved to grow flowers. He would grow the biggest flowers,  biggest garden of flowers there at the school I can remember, because I  went to the grade school in the   50s. During that time, when he moved  off, my mom and her first husband moved to the farm then. They had  lived a couple of different places out here close, and they moved there  and they had five children.  She   d just had her fifth   let   s see. There was three sons and three  daughters so she   d had six children. I know she   d just had her sixth child  but the one that was just a year older, was born in    47, came down with  leukemia. It was a daughter. And so they were in the process of traveling  to go to Oklahoma City for treatments quite a bit. Of course, neighbors  helped you know. My dad was a bachelor up north, had been in World  War II. He also was good friends with her first husband, so he helped a  lot, too, you know, but people having to drive down there and watch the  kids and all this. And in about, (I might get a little emotional) during the  time with her leukemia, she was maybe a year old, they had a fire under  the house down there. It was one of the floor furnaces, something caught  on fire underneath. Her husband went under the house, and while he was  putting the fire out, used to have these glass fire extinguishers. They had  some type of chemical in them that would burst, kind of a sulfur type,  whatever. Well, one of those broke, and he inhaled it, and he didn   t last  but about two or three days, I think. So she lost her husband, she lost her  daughter in about a month, you know.  7  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  So here she is with five kids and nobody to help her, except my  grandfather did move back out to the farm and helped of course. Then  my dad come along and he did a lot of help, and then they got married in     50. Then I came along, and so I   m the only son of my father. So from  1950 on Mueller was the one that lived there then. He died in    95, my  father did, and then my mother died. I think it was five years ago.  She was in her nineties, then?  She was ninety-five. So it went from Bartels to Mueller, and so actually  my mother was the second generation living there. Now my daughter  and her husband are living there, so that   s, you know, another  generation. They   ve only lived there about three or four years, or since  she   s passed away. So that   s kind of a hard life that they had.  I   m sure that was a struggle for her     It was.     to take care of the kids and you have the farm.  Yeah, they had milk cows and you know, the whole nine yards, so it was  pretty trying at that time.  And you add in the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl.  Right, oh yeah, she remembered the Dust Bowl very clearly. She would  talk about it, about having to cover the kids up at night with blankets and  sweep every day and sweep the dirt out.  Was there ever a conflict with the elder siblings to not get the farm?  No, the what now?  The sister. The first child.  Oh, you mean the first one of the Bartels? No, the first one was a son.  No, he   s in the oilfield business.  He didn   t want the farm?  No, none of them. He did stay in the oilfield business. The next  daughter, my closest probably stepsister lives at Boise City. She   s just a  year younger, eleven months younger. She   s raised a family out there  and that   s where her and her husband live right now, out west of Boise  8  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  City. They actually live in a historical house, in a sod house, a two-story  sod, and it   s pretty fancy. I think it   s in the record books. Then the  others, the other ones, I have a sister that lives in Amarillo I know won   t  come back and a brother that lives in California that no, not his kind of  life. And then of course, the sister that I never knew that passed away at  a year, and then I had a brother that passed away in January that  probably would   ve farmed but just didn   t quite have it all together to do  it, couldn   t quite manage. So it fell upon me, and I was lucky to be able  to come up with it. It probably wasn   t what some of them wanted, but  you know I   m the one that was farming with my dad and stayed on the  farm. I mean I moved from there up the road three quarters of a mile to  here, and this has been my home for forty-some years.  Well, in going through the centennial farm application, there are a  couple of things I   d like to talk about.  Okay.  Could you tell me a little bit about the hog butchering?  Well, I don   t know whether they did a lot of butchering before my dad  moved down there. I really couldn   t tell you whether there was much of  that. I know that after he moved down there, he was used to it, him and  his brother they lived up north on the home place. We started doing  butchering in the wintertime and always did. They would butcher oh,  six, eight hogs every winter, whenever we   d get good and cold and  hopefully some snow would fall and at least you knew the weather was  going to stay cold because we hung them in the garage. Usually we   d  butcher them and let them hang for a couple of days, and of course by  that time you were processing some of the other stuff, making, you  know, I mean just things that needed to be done.  It was usually between my family and my uncle   s family up the road and  then my grandparents. My dad   s parents would come down from  Winfield, Kansas, and probably could   ve been a neighbor or two that  joined in, you know, when I was real little. I remember getting in a lot of  them and cutting the meat up usually about the third day and rendering  the fat down and making lard, filling up the lard crocks and making the  cracklings, when you was squeezing the lard out and stuffing the  sausage. I   ve still got the sausage press and the grinder, and we   d take  the intestines   the women would take the intestines and clean them and  scrape them and everything, then that   s what we used to stuff the  sausage in, and we made a lot of head cheese out of the heads, cook the  heads down. It   s still one of the best parts, so.  Used every bit of it.  9  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  We used every bit of it but the squeal. (Laughs)  Had a family recipe for sausage?  Oh, yes. Well, I don   t know. It was in my dad   s head, and he knew how  to put the seasonings in and mix it all up and grind it and make the  sausage. He would cure out the hams and the bacon, so, yeah, we would  do it all.  Have a smokehouse?  No, we just did a salt cure. Just rub them down good with salt and the  mix you needed and put them on a car sided table. Car siding was also  known for a door that was used in railroad cars to block the doors when  you were either filling them with grain or whatever. That was just a  plank made out of several boards about a foot and a half wide and  maybe six, eight foot long. Lay it on a couple of barrels and put a little  tilt to it and put the hams on it. While they would sit there for several  days the juice would drain out of them, and that was how they cured  them. Those were good days.  Show up for Christmas, then.  Right.  Did chickens play a big role on the farm?  Oh, yes, chickens always played a big role on the farm. Every farm  probably always had chickens and my folks, my mom I know grew up,  my grandmother, I mean they always had a lot of chickens. I remember  going into the railroad depot early in the morning or late at night when a  train would be coming through and pick up the chickens. They would  come in boxes, and they were delivered by the railroad. Also, with the  chickens there was a lot of them butchered.  In the   50, right after my dad married my mom, a couple of years, he  built her a chicken house down there. I   m going to say it   s probably  thirty, thirty-five foot wide and fifty foot long, and he put cages in it. We  had three rows of cages, and we had chickens in cages just like your big  production and a feed trough on each side. I mean it was chickens back  to back with a water trough down the middle of each unit and forty foot  long, each set was, and chickens on both sides. You walked down and  filled the feed on both sides, and the water automatically run in between  them in a little trough. We would get usually every other year, or every  year, we   d usually get around three hundred chickens, Pollocks, and  1 0  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  raise them up from babies. When they   d get big enough they   d put them  in the cages and take out the older ones when they were ready to lay. As  time went on, it got to where they kind of quit raising the little ones and  would buy chickens ready to lay, out of a hatchery in Manhattan,  Kansas, that   s still in production yet today. They serve a lot of big  chicken places.  There was a man who would come around and take orders from  individual farms, and he would set up his route, and he   d come every  year with three hundred laying hens, ready to put in the cages. We did  that for fifty years. If fact she did that up until the time, I think she was  ninety years old. She fell one day. My mom was coming from the  chicken house with her basket of eggs. I wasn   t going to make her quit,  but we were cutting the number of chickens down to part of a row, and  she would go out every day and gather her eggs. It got to where the last  couple of years, I would have to feed. She couldn   t quite handle the  fifty-pound bags very good anymore. She was walking to the well house  one day to wash the eggs, and just before she got there she either turned  her foot on a rock and fell and broke her hip. So we always kidded her  after that because she put all her eggs in one basket and fell. Used to, she  would carry two baskets to balance, but she put them all in one and that  didn   t work. (Laughs) So that kind of did the chickens. I mean, we did  keep the chickens for a while after that, but not very long.  When they got the layers, did they sell the eggs?  Oh yes, yes, yes.  That   s what that was for?  We sold   they delivered a lot of eggs. We used to do some places in  town. Some customers my mom would deliver eggs to. I still remember  we used to deliver some cream to them, not real much, because we did  have milk cows. We always had dairy cows. Generally the cream was  always put in cream cans, and we would take it to the railroad depot and  set them off. And then the rail would pick them up and haul them to a  creamery somewhere. I don   t know where. They always hauled them.  We never worried about that. I just still remember, like I said, the rail  picking up the cream cans, and then every so often we   d take one in and  pick up an empty or two can. They had all your tags on them. You know  so you never lost any cream cans.  How would you get there?  By car. Yeah, my grandfather when he first came would talk about going  to town in a wagon and crossing the river. Of course, there was no trees  1 1  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  down here at the Beaver River, the bridge you come across.  Was there water?  Yes, there was water. When I was little there was water always, always  water. You could even go find a few catfish in some holes. But we   d  always go down and get minnows for fishing. There still is water in that  river, just to the west about six miles, eight miles. It   s always got water  in it.  So your mother, did she spend her entire life just working on the farm?  Yes. Well, after all of us kids grew up and that and she kind of felt like  she needed something to do, she did go to town and worked, mainly just  to have something to do. That was the only reason. It wasn   t for any  income reason. It was just to have something to do. Then as time went  on, my folks ended up with a flower shop that my sister in Amarillo had  started here in Guymon, the one that lives in Amarillo. They kind of got  it dumped in their lap, and so my mom took over this flower store in  town and run it for, oh, I guess probably twelve or fourteen years. It was  successful and finally sold it a couple of years before she passed away,  well, about four years before she passed away and she was more  homebound then.  Did your dad have to have people help on the farm?  A long time ago, he did, probably when I was little, you know. Then it  was mainly up to my brothers and I. We did all the tractor driving, and  we were mostly dry land farming up until the mid-  60s. Actually my dad  started irrigating back in    48, drilled I think the second well here in  Texas County up on the Kansas line where his home was, him and his  brother. He   d been irrigating up there before he came down here, and  we   d grow a lot of milo and alfalfa up there and baled it. We didn   t start  irrigation down here on the farm until about the   60s. We   ve kind of  changed from dry land to irrigation, and I kind of went back to dry land  after he passed away, and things just kind of worked better that way.  When my youngest son wanted to farm and college didn   t really work  for him, and it was OSU  Oklahoma State University  that didn   t work  for him, but it wasn   t OSU   s fault. (Laughs) He just, kind of like I was. I  never went to college, either, but he wanted to farm. I knew we   d have  to expand again, and so we went back to irrigation, and we   re just slowly  building it back up.  How have the crops changed over time?  Well, the crops have probably for us have not changed a lot. We   re still  1 2  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  growing wheat, dry land and irrigated. We used to grow milo, irrigated,  and corn became popular here in the   60s. All of a sudden it just  exploded with corn. Everyone found out that they could grow it under  irrigation and make good yields. Some farmers out here are planting. A  few plant cotton, some plant some soybeans, and they tried other things.  Corn and some milo, and wheat is still the main crops that we grow, and  we have some of all of it. We grow a little hay, too.  Well, going back to when you were a little boy, what were some of your  chores growing up?  Well, I don   t really know. I can   t really     Before school, did you have to do anything?  Oh, as I got a little older in school and I started having a few sows, yeah,  I had chores like that, to take care of my hogs. I did show a few calves  while I was in school, but the chicken deal was mainly my mom   s. I  mean that was her deal. She was a hard worker, you know. She did all of  that. She carried those cases of eggs around up to a pretty old age.  There   s thirty dozen in a case, and she could handle those. She wasn   t a  very big lady, either. We did cows, and my dad was a hard worker. I  mean he didn   t expect us to just work, work, work, but I mean, we had  our chores to do. We helped haul the hay down from up north and stack  hay, and, like I said, we always milked cows back when I was little.  There were always ten or fifteen milk cows, and they had to be milked  every morning and every night, and he always had some hogs. Like I  said, we separated the milk and sold the cream. We didn   t sell milk. Of  course, you fed all the milk back to the   either you had some bucket  calves or you fed it to the hogs.  Tell me about what you recall of record-keeping.  I   m probably one of the poorest record-keepers there is. My wife gets  mad at me because she knows very little about what I do, I mean about  what I am doing every day. It   s all up in my head. I know it   s not a good  way to do it, but that   s kind of the way it works.  Was your mom the same way, and your dad?  My dad was pretty well the same way. You know, he didn   t worry about  taxes until it got to the end of the year and you decided you   d better  gather everything up and go file it and try and get everything to where it  needed to be. That   s kind of the way   I guess I learned from that. My  mom was probably a little more   I know as time went on with her store,  the flower store, she kept records a little better on that. She was always  1 3  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  trying to make sure that everything was just so-so, you know. That   s  fine. But yeah, our record-keeping probably wasn   t the best.  Did your parents trust the bank?  Yes, yes. My dad had a good deal with the bank. He originally was  banking more over in Texhoma because people up north, I mean, in  Hooker, people up north of here just kind of all went to Hooker. That   s  where he did all of his at until he finally moved most of it into Guymon  and started banking there. He always had a good deal with the bank. I  mean, he was very successful in his dealings. I mean he didn   t own a lot  of land, but he did buy some land as time went on. He bought land down  here. His main deal when he bought land, and I don   t know that he ever  did, was that if he didn   t have the royalties with the minerals, he wasn   t  interested. He was very wise in what he bought, and it did pay off some,  you know. Nothing great but still always was a steady little income.  Helped supplement the farm income.  Helped supplement the farm income.  And over time did the family retain the mineral rights, or did they  eventually get sold off?  No, they   re still retained.  You mentioned earlier that your mother was heading to the well house to  wash the eggs. Is that something that she had to do before she sold  them?  Oh, yes. She washed them every time, washed them, cleaned them up,  and then she would go in there and candle them.  Which is what? I   m not sure what that is.  Candling is, you turn the lights off in a room, and you have a little can  there. It was a homemade can with a light bulb inside with a hole, not  big enough for the egg to go through, but you would put the egg up and  turn it, and it would shine through the egg. You would see if there was  any blood spots in the eggs. Chickens get excited sometimes if some  stranger   we very seldom let anyone into the chicken house, not  because of disease or anything, but a stranger walks in and the chickens,  they were in a small cage, and they   d just go wild. And they can hurt  themselves in a way that causes blood spots in the eggs, so you just  didn   t want anybody going in, walking through. Because they get used  to, you know. My mom got a little, I think, jealous there at the last  1 4  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  because it didn   t bother   she thought it was kind of funny, but used to,  she could go into the chicken house, and all the chickens would just start  humming. You know, they   d just hum along, just make a real soft noise  when she   d be feeding them and gathering eggs. Well, as time went on  and I started feeding them, they would do that for me and they wouldn   t  do it for her anymore (Laughs) because they were used to seeing me all  the time. They would just kind of    mmm,    make a noise. Animals are     they have ways of letting you know when they   re glad to see you, and  the chickens do, too.  Didn   t know that.  Yeah, animals do, whether it   s chickens or whether it   s cats. In fact, I  was down there this morning, and (this is off the subject) my  granddaughter come out of the end of the barn. We were standing there  talking, and here comes this black mother cat walking along. We can see  her coming from this pile of tree brush, and she has kittens in there.  Well, she could see us over there, so here she comes. She   s got her tail  up in the air, and I said,    See? She sees us down here, and she   s showing  off. She   s showing us that she   s here and she   s coming to see us.    Well,  something distracted her, and she quit walking all the way. She turned  and headed for the house, and she had her tail down. I said,    See? She   s  not showing off anymore because she   s not coming to where we were.     Animals do that, you know, any kind of animal. Cows, chickens, cats,  you know, they show their feelings. You learn a lot of things on the  farm.  Well, tell us how equipment   s changed through the years.  Well, like I said, my grandfather came with a check-row planter which  didn   t seem to work out here. I don   t know what other machinery he  brought out here with him, but I know there was some small little discs,  horse-drawn discs, because that   s what everything was, was horse-drawn,  maybe five foot wide and small of course. There was the old  moldboard, one moldboard that you had two handles and walked behind  a horse with or whatever pulled it. Of course the combines, a lot of that  has been cleaned up, the pull-type combines. Of course they had pretty  big headers on them for cutting. We eventually went self-propelled, and  you start back with the small headers you know, twelve-foot header on a  combine, and tractors weren   t very big, no cabs.  In the   60s we kind of started getting cabs on tractors. Everybody did. I  didn   t like them. I was more used to the outside. Didn   t even like the  umbrellas that much. All the equipment has just progressed in size and  gotten bigger. I mean, now our combines, ones that I have, have thirty-foot  platforms on them instead of fourteen-footers. We   re all the way up  1 5  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  to forty- and forty-five-foot platforms on the bigger machines now for  cutting. And the disc instead of being a little five-foot disc, single way,  just one row of discs, now we   ve got anywhere from thirty- up to forty-,  fifty-foot discs. So everything has progressed quite a bit in size.  Tractors are the same way, the old tractors. Still got one of the old ones  down there that   s a    55 model Moline. I look at it and think,    Yeah, I  used to plow a lot of ground with it, and it was only about a sixty-horse  tractor.    We, in fact, just recently as of yesterday, bought a tractor that  has 235 to 270 horsepower, and that   s still not great big. That   s big, but  it   s a little more modern that what I   ve had, so yeah. Cost has also went  up tremendously, very much so, probably more than anything else. Used  to, we would buy new equipment back in the   70s,   80s, and we could  pay twenty thousand, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five thousand for a  combine or a tractor that was good size. Now if we was to buy new, we  would spend well over three hundred thousand for any piece of  equipment like that, a tractor or combine.  And today, how many acres are you farming?  As far as farming, we   re only farming about fifteen hundred acres. We   d  like to try to find some more. I   m kind of limited where we   re sitting at  because everything to the south and west of our home here is all grass.  So I have to go east or north, and competition   s a little greater, but we   re  slowly finding more. We have a thousand acres of grass, so we run a  cow herd also. That helps quite a bit.  The drought impacted that some?  The drought impacted it severely. I had a pretty good size bunch of cows  a few years ago, and three years ago I had to sell them all because there  just was no grass left. My grass was pretty well gone, and we were  renting up CRP  Conservation Reserve Program . Everyone else was,  too, on emergency grazing, and that was going to be gone. The only  other alternative was to start hauling hay and finding hay where you  could. I thought with the cost of what the hay is and the wear and tear of  having to feed every day and on your equipment and handling it, that   s  not going to work, so I sold all my cows, and that   s when I invested into  the irrigation and put the money into that.  But now this last fall, we   ve started back into the cow business again,  and it   s working out real good. Not knowing how much grass we might  have, I started a little smaller, and now we   ve got more grass than we  know what to do with. Of course, we need grass for wintertime when it  doesn   t grow, for pasture, but we   re sitting real good. We   re putting up  some hay, and with the irrigation we   ll have cornstalks to graze on this  1 6  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  winter, that and milo stubble from the irrigated milo after we cut it. We  pretty well try to use everything that we have.  Are you using the round bales of hay or the square ones?  Both. Well, actually we use probably more round bales than we do  anything. We   ve got to where we handle those. I have put up some little  square bales. We did put up some little square wheat straw bales in the  barn for bedding, and we also sell some. Not too many people do that  anymore, and people are always wanting little square bales. We   re  putting up a few little grass bales, too, for our own use, but most of it is  the round bales. We have started, also, in the last year or so putting up  big square bales four foot by four foot by eight foot long out of the corn  stubble and the wheat stubble. There   s a friend that comes in and will  swath it up, on the corn, and then put it in big bales and pays us so much  a ton, and he gets rid of it. Last year we had a really tremendous corn  crop off of that, the bales. I mean it really paid off.  We did the wheat stubble this year. You don   t get as many bales, but we  windrowed it with the combine and just cut a little lower and let it fall  straight behind, and that way you just had to bale it and haul them off.  So that gives a little more income. Even on the corn, it doesn   t get rid of  all the stubble. You still have some stubble to work in, you know. You  still have all the massive roots underneath the ground to deteriorate and  add to the soil. I don   t like to take everything off, but then again, even  the wheat, we still leave two or three inches, and you still have it plus  the stubble and the roots to help put back into the soil.  Of course, one way of farming now that   s a little different and that helps  a lot on that is strip-tilling where we go back in, even if you didn   t take  your cornstalks off, and you let them sit all winter. You go in the next  spring, and we plant on every thirty inches on rows of corn or milo. You  would just incorporate your fertilizer about eight or nine inches deep  every thirty inches. Of course, you have a coulter, a wheel that cuts  everything off in front of your shank so it doesn   t drag, and you  incorporate your fertilizer every thirty inches right through the stubble.  Leave all the stubble standing, don   t even mess with it. Then come back  in with a planter and a drill, and with a GPS you plant right on top of  that, exactly on that thirty inch where you put that fertilizer ao all your  fertilizer is contained right there below the plant instead of spreading it  all over the ground and waiting for the moisture to take it down so the  roots can find it. Much better, much better way.  More high tech, too.  It   s more high tech. I don   t do the work myself. I hire it strip-tilled. I  1 7  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  hire it planted because I don   t have GPS yet, which there again, high  tech, you pay for it. For a good unit you   re looking at twenty, twenty-five  thousand for a GPS unit, and if you want a strip-till rig, you   re  going to pay eighty thousand or more, lot more if you buy a new one,  and it depends upon the size. For a planter like it needs to do, you   re  going to pay that much and more, and it   s cheaper to have somebody  else come in and     Got to balance those costs.  Got to balance those costs. I don   t have to do that, and they can come  right in and plant it and I just have to turn the sprinklers on. I didn   t use  sprinklers until three years ago and before I was flood irrigation, years  ago, with aluminum pipe and had to move a lot of pipe. I got lots of  workouts. Sprinklers are nice. And they are conserving, very water  conserving you know. I know people look at the sprinklers and they say,     Well, they run them all the time. They just run continuously.    Yes, but  it   s a more even spread of water over your fields instead of your flood  irrigating in rows where the top end gets six to eight inches of water and  the bottom end gets about an inch or two by the time it gets there.  Whereas with the sprinklers it   s even all the way around the field and  you have no runoffs. Whereas with flood irrigations everyone had the  ditches at the end of the fields to take it to tailwater pits to recover and  then pump out of the tailwater pits back. You would lose a lot of water  in the process. Irrigating with sprinklers is very conserving.  Has crop insurance come into play?  Crop insurance, I   m sure that everybody has their opinion of crop  insurance, and I know we have to have it. The government says we have  to have it if we   re in the programs for whatever reasons, but crop  insurance is expensive. As far as the drought the last several years that  we   ve been in out here and you know they   ve talked about it being far  worse than the dirt bowl days and we are. We   re still dry underneath.  I   m probably ahead, you know, as far as what my premium has been and  in most cases I never paid a premium because they would take it out of  the insurance before they pay you. (Laughter) They got paid, but I mean  they deducted that. As far as irrigated crops, it   s a joke. I don   t know  why we   I mean I have to have it, but it wouldn   t pay, unless you have  a 100 percent wipeout is the only way. So, I guess that   s why we have to  have the crop insurance.  How do you keep up with all the different government programs out  there?  Well, you just kind of have to watch the paper. I probably go into the  1 8  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  agriculture office every so often for something and I   ll ask,    What else  do we need to do?    I   ve known the people in there, I trust them and I  say,    What do I need to do?       This is probably the best,    and    Ok, then  that   s what we   ll do,    you know. And I   ve always been real happy with  them, but no, you just kind of have to keep checking with them and see  what   s coming up. I was just in there yesterday turning in my summer  acres, my corn and milo planting, so they have record of it. Nothing  coming up right now so I   ll just wait until I hear something.  Do you keep up with things via the Internet?  Not really. I   m not much on that much as far as Internet. I mean, I do use  the Internet. I watch an auction service, video auction deal out of  Manhattan, Kansas, called    Purple Wave    all the time. They have a lot  of agriculture auctions, farm equipment. They do trucks and cars, but  they also have a lot of farm sales and you know, I want to see what  stuff   s costing, plows, tractors, combines.  How do you keep up with the weather?  I do get on it occasionally to see what Amarillo   s getting because we   re,  as you know, we   re not really part of Oklahoma out here. I know that   s  the way most of the people in the Panhandle feel, that Oklahoma forgets  us. You know if you ever watch, if you can get Oklahoma out here on  the TV when they give the weather, 99 percent of the time they stand in  front of the Panhandle and point to the rest of the state on the map. They  never say anything about the Panhandle. So we don   t know what   s going  on, if we had to watch Oklahoma news. I mean, that   s literally the way it  is. So we would be better off if we were part of Texas, like we were at  one time, but there   s always been talk too, about the Panhandle of Texas  and Oklahoma making a state. It   d be good.  Use the Mesonet any?  No.  No.  Has there ever been a time where your family, even you know fifty,  seventy-five years ago, thought that they would lose the farm?  Not that I recall, that I ever recall.  Was the farm crisis of the   80s, did y   all weather that storm okay?  The farm   the American Agriculture Movement? Yeah, we just   my  1 9  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  dad and I just ignored it. We were not part of that and we did not feel  that that was appropriate. And that   s just not the way   I don   t need any  more groups telling me what to do, too independent. We had neighbors  that were very strong, very strong Agriculture Movement people, and  one or two of them would come over and try to talk to us, talk to my  dad. And you know, we stayed friends but no, we were not part of that  and would not participate.  Were you in 4-H in high school?  No, I was in FFA  Future Farmers of America . And well, I was in FFA  for my first three years, back when it was the old style program, Ag One,  Ag Two, Ag Three, Ag Four. I didn   t do it my senior year. There was  another class that I wanted to take that I thought was far more beneficial  and which was, of course my senior year was fairly simple, which was  carpentry class, three hours a day. (Laughs) That happened to be during  Ag Four, and I couldn   t take Ag Four. And we built the administration  building in Guymon at the high school, what was then the high school,  which is the superintendent   s office and it   s still in use and it still looks  as good as it did, you know.  Did you show things at the county fair?  Yes, we   ve always been, we in the past participated a lot. I will say this  year, none at all. We enjoy the county fair, but my feelings on the county  fair have changed because of the time schedule they have. Now, we have  been very busy this summer. We just got back Sunday night from Las  Vegas, Nevada. My son had got married, my youngest son that farmed  with me. We   ve had this wedding that was planned out there and we had  to go out there, and so that   s what we   ve been looking forward to and  going and had a very good time. And hope he comes out today because  we got things we   ve got to do, but he   s home. I might see him, I might  not.  We   ve kind of been taken up with a lot of things. My grandkids down  here at the home place, my grandson does have show lambs. Probably  don   t know that we   ll be taking them to the fair, mainly because of the  heat. It gets awful hot. It   s hard on the lambs. The lambs are mainly for  other shows, either Tulsa or Oklahoma City or places, bigger shows.  And you just don   t want to stress them out all the time, and you know  it   s just not something that we   re probably going to be doing.  Our fair years ago used to be the first part of October, which we really  enjoyed. Of course we did run into a snowstorm one year. We had a  blizzard, you know. You run into any kind of weather out here. Then it  was kind of moved into the latter or middle of September and now  2 0  Finchum  Mueller  they   ve moved it right here, the first part of August. It   s hot. I   m going  to go talk to the fair board members and try to give my little two cents  worth of    Let   s put the fair back in October, when people have garden  products.    I mean there are some people that have garden products but  not a lot, just everything and it   s too hot in there to do a lot of that, and  everybody   s busy in the summer. Right now people are taking their last  vacations before school starts next week. Everybody   s really busy and  they say we   ve got to have the fair when we get the carnival, and if we  have it in October all we get is the bottom of the line carnivals, the little  podunk carnivals that you really don   t know whether you want to get on  the rides or not, they   re old. All the major carnivals like the ones we get  are at the big cities like Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Amarillo at those  fairs. They   re not going to come to Guymon later on so that   s why we  have to have it now, to get the carnival.  Well, Liberal  Kansas  just got through with their fair last week and they  had the carnival. Then the carnival comes here this week, and I don   t  blame the carnival people. They can   t travel any further than they   d like  to, they want to make stops. We do the same thing in the spring when we  have Pioneer Days. We have the carnival at Pioneer Days which is  super. It   s the first Saturday in May. And then it leaves here and goes to  Liberal so it does just the opposite.  I still contend    Okay, go ahead. Carnival is what makes the fair.    I mean  it draws people. Go ahead and have your carnival in August, but let   s  have the fair in the end of September, first of October when everyone  has vegetables, and a lot of times your kids are in school and teachers  will have them do artwork and they   ll bring it out and enter it. You  know, you don   t see that at the fair anymore. In fact I heard from a  family yesterday that went out and entered some stuff, they said there  was just hardly anything yesterday for entries. It   s too early. So, I don   t  know why we can   t have the fair later. I think we   ll still have a turnout,  and I still think we can have the animal show, the stock show, the hogs  and the goats and the sheep and cattle. Just do it when it   s cooler and I  think we will have just as much participate. We don   t have to have a  carnival then, but they can have their carnival now.  Now this year, we used to do a lot of things. My kids, they   d enter fruits  and vegetables. We   d enter the wheat show, and we   d enter the grasses.  My granddaughter or my daughter would enter in 4-H food products,  cookies, all kinds of   but not anymore.  Did your mother?  No, she never did really ever enter anything.  2 1  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Was she in a homemaker club?  Yes, she was. She was in a Home Ec club and     Do you remember the name?  Well, I think it was the Friendship Home Demonstration Club. It was the  Friendship District out here. And yeah, we used to   my wife was in it  with her as time went on. It was still active. Them women, I don   t know  what all they did at their meetings. Then so often in the wintertime we  would get together at somebody   s house and play cards, you know. We  would also have card parties, you know, the Home Demonstration group  would. And every year we   d have a Thanksgiving meal. That was  always real successful except for one year. At Thanksgiving you   d have  the turkey, the mashed potatoes and you know all the good stuff, green  beans. One year the women decided to have salads. (Laughter) I think all  the husbands said,    Do that again and we won   t go   .  Well, how were holidays with your family at the farm?  Well, years ago the holidays were probably more than what they are  now. I think usually at Christmas time, I remember when I was little we  would always go up to my dad   s brother   s just up the road here where  his home place was for a big Christmas meal you know, usually just  prior to Christmas or maybe it was on Christmas Day, I can   t remember.  And then on New Year   s we would usually go over two miles east over  here to my mom   s   her first husband   s sister   s place, where they lived  and have a meal over there on New Year   s, all the family. A lot of the  family would get together. Pioneer Days, we   d always meet in town at  my grandparent   s where they lived. They always had the parade in the  morning so everybody would get there and everybody would bring food  and you know, go down and watch the parade and then come back  because it was like a ten o   clock parade and come back by noon and eat  and then just whatever. You could go to the picture show that afternoon  or go to the carnival.  So, yeah. There were a lot of good family memories, you know, part of  getting together. But a lot of them are all gone now and of course back  then, people didn   t travel as far. Like I said, my grandfather went two  miles and found his bride, and of course my dad, like I said, he was in  his mid-thirties when he married, after the war. He come back from  World War II, but he had just   it was one of those customs back then.  Here was a lady who had five kids and went through a lot of problems,  she needs help, and I guess everybody thought,    He   s the most  available.    So, can   t say it was always the best, but it worked out, you  know.  2 2  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Well how have your neighbors around here changed through the years?  Well, all the neighbors I grew up with are gone, you know, have died  and passed on. Now a few of them might have, there might be a person  or two, a family member that   s farming but, you know a lot of them  have moved to town. There   s not many of them that live out in the  country anymore. So, that   s all changed, too. I mean, a lot of the kids  that I grew up with either live in town or have moved on, but some of  them still farm, a few of them. But yeah, there   s not the places out here  like there used to be, a lot of the good people that lived here.  Where did you go to school?  I went to school in Guymon. Yeah, I was in the Guymon district here.  There   s a little school up the road here that   s a grade school that   s called  Straight, and enrollment is only like fifty kids. A couple of my kids went  there. We were able to transfer them up there even though we are in the  Guymon district. The Straight district is only a mile or two away, so is  the Optima district to the east of us, but we were able to get permission  to send ours up there in grade school. And first we had to take them up  to the corner two miles to catch the bus every morning. Then the  Straight district finally got permission, this has been twenty years ago, to  come down here and pick our kids up. Being as how we have a little  circle drive, they could turn around and go back and they would let them  do that.  So there was people from Guymon also coming out and bringing their  kids to Straight. So over the years, since then (and we don   t have any)  the bus, Straight bus pulls into our yard every morning and there will be  five or six cars setting out here and kids pile out and we hear them  sometimes, sometimes we don   t. They get on the bus, and every  afternoon at three thirty here comes the Straight bus, and people are  lined out here, picking their kids up. We   re kind of the drop-off point for  Straight school district.  The dogs go out and welcome them?  Sometimes yeah, they have to go out and get their pets. My son, he just  walked in, he did show up. That   s my youngest son.  Throughout your life have you always worked on the farm, or have you  worked in town at all?  Right after I was out of high school during the wintertime, I did work in  town at a little feed mill for a few years, which I enjoyed. You learned a  2 3  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  lot. I mean it wasn   t fifty-pound bags. It was hundred-pound bags that  we sacked everything in, gunny sacks, but it was fun. I did that, and then  a few years ago before I went back to irrigating and before he wanted to  farm, I was pretty well just trying to figure out, you know, kind of not a  semi-retirement. A friend of mine had an animal health store here in  town that he run for a company, and he   d always been in it all his life.  He   s a few years older than I am, but he wanted to know if I wanted to  come in and help part-time. I started doing that, and I did that for five or  six years until that finally stopped and it   s no longer there. Oh, I enjoyed  it, but it really wasn   t my kind of work.  I did have a feed store in Guymon for a while, too. I put a feed store in, a  Purina feed store, years ago and run it for, I think I had the feed store for  fourteen or fifteen years. I finally got out of it when we kind of started  back in the drought several years ago and people started selling their  cows. Customers started dwindling away. I mean, we had a lot of other  customers, a lot of specialty products, chicken feed, all kinds of stuff. I  really had quite a variety of feeds. My bigger customers did that, and the  sale barn closed and there went a good customer. Man, I thought,    This  is a good time to       My kids were just about out of school, and it was  time to drop that. It was successful while I had it. I still sell some feed.  The grandkids have show lambs, and we get a specific brand in that we  have shipped in, and we sell to some people that come out and buy.  Otherwise, it   s mainly just the farm.  Well, you mentioned that your grandkids have some show lambs. What  else is happening on the farm today? What   s going on today on the  land?  Well, we are fixing to get back into the field. I   ve been mowing since  we   ve come back from our little trip. I   ve been trying to mow some of  the weeds down on the corners of the sprinklers and around the  machinery and down at the other place and around here and just trying to  clean up the weeds the way their growing, before we get back into the  field. We   re fixing to start disking, and we still have chiseling to do that  the rain had stopped us from here a while back. We   ve got some hay laid  down that we   re getting baled here in the next week or so. I need to  check in on the cows, and I   ve always had a few sheep, and I   ve got a  herd of ewes up here that are out running lose out in the field.  Do you shear them?  I don   t shear them, but yes, we have them sheared every year. Yes, we  do.  So you stay pretty busy.  2 4  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  It   s pretty busy, yeah.  Any thoughts on retirement?  Not really. No, I don   t know that you ever retire. At least I don   t.  Well, tell me a little about your kids.  Well, my wife and I, we have four children. We   ve been married forty-one  years, I think. Our oldest daughter, she lives down at the home place  now. She has three children, a daughter that   s in college in Edmond at  Redlands. I guess she   ll be going to OSU after this year. Two sons, one  of them will be a senior and the other is a third-grader up here at  Straight. He goes here to this school so she has to bring him up here  every morning to catch this bus.  And how did you meet your wife?  Well, I actually, I met my wife, if you   re familiar with the Optima Dam.  Have you ever heard of the Optima Dam?  No.  Well, a little short brief history of the Optima Dam was it was a dam that  was promised to the people out here in this country for a recreation area.  Because, you know, downstate you   ve got the Keystone, you   ve got all  those other places you know, recreation areas. We didn   t have anything.  But many, many, many years ago a politician said,    You people need  something out here.    Now this is the story that I get. He said,    You  people need this.    So he got it put on the books, proposed it downstate.  Now this is, you got to understand, way down here in the   30s I believe,  if not before. I don   t know. And got it approved but nothing ever  happened. Got this project approved to build a recreation area out here  and build a dam on the Beaver River. Well, it never went any further. It  went on and on for years, for like forty years, maybe fifty, forty or fifty.  Someone finally said,    Hey, there   s a project here that   s been proposed  and approved and never been done,    and so back in the late   60s it was  decided that, when this came about, that this needed to be done.  So they started, going to build this dam. My father-in-law worked for the  Corps of Engineers out of Tulsa and one of his future jobs would be to  come out here to oversee whatever his part of it, as far as the Corps of  Engineers, to build into this dam. So they came out here in the    70 or     71. He had two daughters he came out here with. The third daughter  was in college and never came out here. But him and his wife, they came  2 5  out here during the winter, during a blizzard I know a time or two,  because they   d talk about having to not being able to get to their house  in the Elks Addition. They had to stop on the main highway out south  and go across the snow and the railroads tracks to come in the back door,  just to get there, but anyway. We can have blizzards. Anyway, they  moved out here and she was fifteen at the time. We went to the same  church and we got to know each other. Well, we got to dating and he  worked on the dam. In fact, she turned eighteen and we got married and  so that   s been it. So the Optima Dam is what brought her out here.  The Optima Dam is virtually no more anymore. I mean it only had one  gate. It never filled with water. It might be dry. The boat docks or the  boat landings that they built never could you see water from where they  built them. I   ve always heard that it was the longest dam built in history,  which it is three miles long. Now, it starts fairly small you know, but  still it   s the dam. It   s been shut down now and the gates were welded  open years ago. There   s been a lot of controversy about selling back the  land to the original landowners, but a lot of people say    No, leave it,     because it   s state land or government land. A lot of people hunt down  there you know, pheasant. Well not pheasant but turkey, quail, deer. I  don   t know what   s going to happen. Anyway it was a flop, but that   s  what brought her out here was the Optima Dam.  We got married, and a year or so later our daughter was born and she   s  been out here all her life. She did a little bit of college but not much, but  then she got married, had the kids. My oldest son was born a few years  later and he graduated here, did good. He went to OSU, became an  architect, graduated from OSU. He was in the process of joining the  Navy and after he graduated on a Saturday they said,    We   re ready for  you.    He went to the OCS-Pensacola. He   s an officer. He   s been in for  thirteen years now, and he   s been to Afghanistan twice, on building and  stuff like that, in some of the hot areas. Luckily he came back. Now he   s  in the Pentagon for three years, working on projects. And he   ll stay  another seven years, he   d better.  My next son also did good in school and went on down to OSU. Never  did get his bachelor   s but he went to the vet school. I thought you always  had to have a bachelor   s in order to get in but he never did. He got  accepted into vet school and got his veterinary license. And did some  practicing in Tulsa at emergency clinics for about five years. I was told  that would get old and sure enough, that gets to you. Now he   s back at  OSU to get his PhD and working with some of the professors on some  research. He loves that type of work, has to do with some type of viruses  that he   s working on. So, he   s pretty successful in that. I   m glad he likes  what he   s doing. I mean, he liked being a veterinarian. He liked working  with animals. He   s always loved animals. He really loved horses and  2 6  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Finchum  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  sheep and stuff. We still talk about sheep all the time. And again, my  youngest son, tried to go to OSU, had a good time down there while he  was there.  Didn   t take, huh?  Didn   t take, and this is really surprising. He had the highest ACT test of  any of them. But, just wasn   t his thing, so. I   m glad to have somebody  taking over after me though.  Well, looking at the next one hundred years on the farm, what do you  hope to see happen to the land?  (Laughs) That   s a long time. Well, I hope the land stays in the family  and we   re going to try our best and all the kids, all my children want to  see it stay as a unit. And we   re going to try and do our best to keep it  that way. I don   t really know what to think about the next hundred years.  I know things have changed a lot. So, I don   t really know.  Best advice piece of advice that your mom or dad gave you.  Oh, now I don   t know. I guess I can   t really say much about what my  mom gave me because, like I said, there   s some things that you don   t  like to talk about. But on my dad, you know, I guess it wasn   t  necessarily advice but just watching him work, you know, and be  successful and following in his footsteps more than anything. And his  dad was the same way.  Do you have a favorite     Oh, go ahead.  Do you have a favorite time on the farm?  Oh, I   m not sure. I suppose just growing up on the farm when I was little  and playing down there in the barn in the hay, just walking down  through the pasture where our ponds are at a little age, which now we  don   t hardly let kids do, you know. We   re always trying to watch after  them. We did a lot of things, a lot of things we shouldn   t have done, a lot  of things our parents didn   t know about or just having fun you know,  that would have been dangerous. I would really get my kids if they did  some of things I done.  Well is there anything else you   d like to add before we close on out?  Well, no about the only thing   of course I know it doesn   t have to do  2 7  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  Nykolaiszyn  Mueller  with this place here, but this is the place that my dad ended up buying  from a good friend that left. Pretty well told him when they got ready to  leave back in    60,    Well, we   re going to leave. We   re moving back to  Kansas, Paoli. You   re going to buy this place.    So, I   m glad. My dad  said,    I don   t have any money.       That don   t make any difference.  You   re going to buy it.    And so this is how we ended up with this tract  of land, too. Everything was done on handshakes and just word of  mouth.  A little bit different today.  A little different, yeah, a little different.  Well, Edward, thank you so much for taking some time out and sharing a  little bit about your family and your land here.  Thank you. I hope this helps a lot.  -------  -------
