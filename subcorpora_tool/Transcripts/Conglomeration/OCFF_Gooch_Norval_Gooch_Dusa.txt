 Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn and with me is Tanya Finchum. We   re  with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library.  Today we   re on the Gooch farm, interviewing Mr. And Mrs. Gooch. It   s  September 30, 2010, and we   re in Logan County, Oklahoma. What part  of Logan County are we in? I   m all turned around, now. Would you  consider this Guthrie?  Our mailing address is out of Guthrie. Right where we are right now,  we   re seven miles northwest of Guthrie. We are seven miles right  straight east of Crescent. We are seven miles southwest of Mulhall. So  here we are in a little bitty dot out here.  Beautiful. We   re on the farm here, and we   re conducting an oral history  project called Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families, and we thank you  for joining us today. We really appreciate  the chance  to learn more  about your family and the farm you live on. Can we begin by having you  tell us about how your family came to Oklahoma? Mr. Gooch?  They came to Oklahoma in the Run of    89. The Gooch family is well  represented right here. This particular farm was homesteaded by Nathan  Gooch. Across the road south was Joseph Gooch. To the north was  Harvey Gooch, to the east was Jim Gooch. Lee Gooch went to the west,  but he didn   t like the first quarter. There was two canyons in there. He  went to the second quarter west, and homesteaded there. My  grandfather, who was Howard, showed up. He was nineteen years old.  He was not eligible to homestead, but he could come later and buy  someone out. He came in the fall of    89 on horseback. The story goes  that he visited with these over here and went on west to visit his brother.  His brother told him about this guy up on the hill, west. He said,    Go up  there, I believe you can buy him out pretty cheap.     Well, he stayed the night with Lee, and the next morning he went up  5  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  there on the hill. He was riding the horse back and the guy come out of a  half dugout, half log cabin, the only improvements he had made to the  hundred-sixty acre farm. He come out with a double barrel shotgun  stuck right in Granddad   s face. Granddad said,    Fellow, I don   t mean  you no harm. Just put that thing down.    He said he didn   t put it down  very quick, but anyway, after they talked for a little while, he finally set  it aside and they   re talking along and all at once this guy happened to  think. He said,    By the way, what the hell are you doing here?    And my  granddad said,    I come to buy you out.       You got ten dollars?    Bought  him out.  One-hundred-sixty acres. For ten bucks.  Ten dollars. For a one hundred-sixty acre farm. Later on, he bought the  quarter to the north from him. I don   t know how many years this was, a  few years later, he bought from Mort Carey. He bought one-hundred-sixty  acres for five hundred  dollars . He went ahead to be, at one time,  the biggest farmer in Logan County. Probably the biggest indebted too,  I   d expect. He was a plunger. He bought a Skeleton bottom farm, which  is where, at the time that I came into the picture, we lived on the  Skeleton bottom farm. Granddad went broke in the Depression and lost  that Skeleton bottom farm, but he managed to keep these half sections a  mile west here. I know that he deeded one quarter over to a neighbor,  and a year later the neighbor deeded it back to him.  You know, that   s friends. That   s trusting friends.  But that makes quite a little story there. As time went along, we bought  this quarter here from my uncle, who happened to buy it from the son of  Nathan, by the name of Dan Gooch. He bought the south eighty. Later  on he bought the north eighty from Henry, Dan   s brother. I don   t know  how that come about, whether Nathan gave the two eighties to the two  brothers, or what. He, at that time I suppose, or back somewhere there,  bought a Skeleton bottom farm up here a couple of miles away. Well, a  pretty nice farm up where Donald Coffin lives. Donald   s also a friend of  mine from the other side of the family. (Laughs)  He   s a first cousin on the other side of the family from his mother   s side.  But this farm originally was one hundred and seventy-two acres. It was  on a correctional line. He could not homestead more than his hundred-sixty  acres, but he could buy the other twelve, and so he paid fourteen  dollars. I have a copy of the document that the National Historical  Society from Washington, D.C., sent me the homestead papers. I   ve got  copies of homestead papers, and also that paper where he paid fourteen  dollars for that extra twelve acres on the hundred-sixty, keep from  breaking it.  6  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  And this was Howard?  No, Nathan. This is the Nathan Gooch Homestead.  Now when you were telling me how Howard bought that land for ten  dollars, did he have any background in farming before he purchased  that land?  Well, I know he did, but I     From Missouri. They came from Missouri.  The Gooch family originated from England to Virginia. Governor  Gooch was sent to the Virginia colony, to be the governor of Virginia.  Him and his wife never had any children, but he brought his brother  over, and he had nine children, and that   s where we came from. The  family multiplied back in those days, everybody had eight to ten kids.  Well, on this particular land, the Nathan Gooch farm, can you tell me  about some of the original structures that were here? Barns or     Yes. According to the homestead papers in there, the original house was  fourteen by twenty six, and eight or nine children were there.  Eight.  Eight children. Now that   s togetherness.  In a dugout.  That house later burned and one of the daughters, who was living at that  time, told me that after that house burned they built this house that   s still  sitting over there. Which is what, how many rooms is it? One, two,  three, four, about five rooms. That   s what they lived in. However, now,  Nathan   s first house sat on a hillside down here close to the spring.  There   s a spring down there that runs, and I   m sure that   s where they got  their water supply, was from that spring right nearby. You can see the  old foundation there. That   s all you can see is just the old foundation.  Out of sand rock, you know.  Sand rock. Probably where, he   s probably like that guy over there on the  hill. He just made a little dugout and a log cabin and the rest of it. I have  no way of knowing that. Even the lady that was his daughter that told me  about the old house and so forth, she didn   t know about that part of it.  7  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  But you know, when they staked their claim, they had to live on it five  years and prove their intent to stay. So, he had a peach orchard, two-hundred  peach trees, something like that. And so many acres under  cultivation and     A smokehouse?  It didn   t mention that. It mentioned    Can I go get those papers?  Absolutely. Sure.  You mentioned earlier Skeleton bottom. I   m not sure what that means.  A good farm on the bottom. Next to a river bed is a good farm.  Yeah, Skeleton bottom farm? Can I tell you about that?  Please.  Yes. The farm was owned by the McPeak family, and in 1920, the  Skeleton flooded and their house was sitting down in the flood area. The  story goes that Mr. McPeak woke up in the middle of the night, stepped  out into knee-high water, and because of that, after the flood was over,  they either moved their house. There was about three acres on that whole  farm that   s not Skeleton River or Skeleton bottom. They moved their  house and barn and everything up on that high point. The rest of the  farm all laid in that Skeleton bottom and the Skeleton River went all the  way through it. It was one pretty excellent farm as far as what it would  grow and everything. We grew cotton, wheat, kaffir corn. I guess that   s  the main crops that we grew on it. Of course, I was only nine years old  when we moved on there, and I think when we moved off I was about  fifteen or sixteen. He lost that farm for a thirteen thousand dollar  mortgage.  He had a real bad sick spell and had a real long hospital stay, and the  hospital bill is what broke him.  My dad told the story that he was sitting in a room visiting with  Granddad, and he   d been in there two weeks. They brought him the  hospital bill of four hundred dollars, and Granddad just hit the ceiling.  They said,    Mr. Gooch, we have no way of affording this hospital except  to get it from you guys that   s got it. Most of the people don   t have it, and  we don   t get nothing.    So he paid them. He spent six weeks in the  hospital, I believe it was three months. Then he was sawing wood and he  lost this hand here, like this. He had these two fingers.  8  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  He only had two fingers on that one hand.  Them two fingers. He could grab a pair of lines on a horse, set them on  the ground right quick just squeezing those two fingers. He had a lot of  power in those two fingers. And then he died with a stroke and heart  trouble and all sorts of things at age sixty-five. My father died at eighty-one,  and I   m eighty-six.  You   re doing pretty good.  Still growing. (Laughter) I   m a firm believer that if you want to die  quick, just take to that rocking chair right over there. That   s the reason  for that sawmill down there in the barn, is it keeps me active. My active  days are getting shorter, though.  Well, the original land had     What he had done, he had to be on it five years. And what he had on it at  the end of five years was a frame house, fourteen by twenty six, a stable,  ten by twenty, a well, a cave, a henhouse, two hundred fruit trees, sixty-five  acres under cultivation. Valued at seven hundred and fifty dollars.  Three-thousand rods of wire fence. A wife and eight children. He said,     Yes, sir.    (Laughter)  Now he   s here alone, see, his wife and family are not here with him for  this five years.  Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute.  The only time he left this place was to go to Kansas and get his wife and  eight children.  Right, but that   s not after five years. That was back original.  When he got claim to his homestead that he had staked, he had to have  four witnesses that he hadn   t left this place.  Here   s the four witnesses: Riley Ellison, James Thompson, Louis Slaton,  and Andrew Tellaro. I remember Andrew well. Minnie Rose Tellaro   s  down there. She   s still living. Her father.  That would be his granddaughter.  And these four guys     9  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Tony was her dad.  I was thinking I had one of them letters that said what he had done to the  farm.  It   s right here, dear.  Well, I know. That was his claim, what he claimed, but they also had  four letters from these fellows here.  I   m not sure about that.  Well, with what he was growing, between the trees and cultivating the  land, was he producing anything to sell? If so, where would he take it?  Cotton.  Well, the peaches, too. Two hundred peach trees. Over here at Lawrie,  the railroad. Straight east of us here there was the Lawrie station, and it  was even a mail address where they dropped mail, the railroad. They had  cattle pens there where they sold their stock, where they   d load the cattle  onto the trains. You could ship loads of watermelon, peaches     Cattle. Jim, the one on the east place here, he was the cattle man.  He   s a cattle man.  He bought and sold cattle by the hundreds from all over the country, and  shipped them out and brought them in and shipped them out and so  forth, over there at Lawrie.  But it was by rail. They had a railroad through here at that time.  If they were going to go to town to pick up things that the farm did not  produce, where would they go?  It would be into Guthrie.  Cotton was one of the main factors in those days. I heard my dad make a  remark one day about this particular farm here, that Dan Gooch had  cottoned it to death.  Now, would your father and his siblings have to work at picking cotton,  or did they have hired help?  10  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  We pretty well did a lot of it ourselves. My dad, well, I remember him  hiring help up on the Skeleton.  Because that   s hard work, picking cotton.  Oh, it is hard work.  You   d better know it.  That   s back breaking work.  He went into Guthrie and got a colored man, who had a wife and two  daughters, and moved them in what they called a sharecropper   s house.  It sat down in the middle of the bottom, and it was elevated up on this  high foundation, about, oh, probably eight foot foundation built up  above the ground, and then a little two room shack up on top. That   s  where these colored families stayed during the cotton harvest. Another  interesting fact there was, he found them in Guthrie. They had a covered  wagon and a team of horses, and they came out there and brought that  team of horses and covered wagon. While they were there, one of the  horses laid down and died. I remember my dad hooking onto that  wagon, and trailing the horse behind it, and pulled that wagon back to  Guthrie. They had situated over there, again in the flood area, of  Guthrie. That was after they   d been out there and picked cotton. That old  black man, he was a big man, and oh, he could pick that cotton. He  would have one daughter on each side of him. He   d pick two rows and  then reach over and grab cotton off of their rows helping them, to keep  them up with him all the time. Man, he could sure pick that cotton. That  wasn   t for me. It just didn   t fit in my hand. I had to do it, but it wasn   t  for me.  When you were growing up, where did you live? Did you ever live on  this property?  No, no.  You were at the other farm?  No, it wasn   t neither one. Actually, my dad lived three miles south of  here down   we lived on a Cimarron bottom farm down there. At the  time, I went into service in WWII and came home on furlough and we  got married. Then I went overseas for eighteen months and came home.  We were living there in town and I was expecting to go to farming, put  my name in on the GI list to buy a tractor and a combine.  And a car.  11  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Anyway, to make a long story short, everybody got home before I did  and rented all the land. I couldn   t find nothing to rent.  We had a tractor. Our tractor came in, and we had a tractor, but we had  nothing to farm it with. We had no implements to work, we had no land  to farm.  Those days the combines were pull combines, and that   s what I had my  name in for. The guy said I was number five on the list, and he had six  combines come in. I saw them, but I didn   t get one. Ooh, I was mad.  Well, we didn   t have a farm rented, see.  Anyway, when that happened, I already had a job of two hundred and  forty-five acres promised that I could combine. Well, I had to give it up  and tell the guy I couldn   t make it. Anyway, my brother came in and he  wanted to buy my tractor from me. I wound up letting him have it, and I  stayed in town. To make a long story short, in town, I went into the  appliance business in 1950, sold out in 1960, and went to work at First  National Bank as a loan officer. Worked there for three years, and there  was just a lot about the banking business that just wasn   t my deal.  Seemed to me like the man coming in and sitting down was begging me  for money, you know. I had been a salesman all my life, and it just  didn   t fit me. My idea was to sell him, not him sell me. But anyway, to  make a long story short, I left the bank and went into Coast to Coast  Hardware store. Made that for eighteen years, and sold out. During that  time is when I bought this property.  (Laughs) Can   t retire to the farm. That   s a laugh.  So you retired to the farm?  I retired to the farm.  While we were in business, we were getting close to wanting to retire,  and so we   d wanted just an acreage, because we have three children, a  boy and two girls. We   d raised our family in town, and we decided we  wanted to retire just on an acreage. Just buy an acreage and build us a  lovely home on it, and get rid of that business. We had invested in  business properties downtown in the meantime, so we had pretty good  income coming in off of that rent. We came out here on a Sunday. A  neighbor down the road here, we told him what we wanted to do, and he  said,    Come out, I   ll sell you.    He owned that farm across the road, and  that one over there, he said,    I   ll sell you an acreage off of mine, come  on out.    So Sunday, we came out, but he wasn   t home.  12  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  So in the meantime, we   re driving the roads and we found cattle out  along here in front where our home is now. Our Uncle Raymond owned  this farm here and was living over there in the little house. We thought  they were his cattle, so we drove over to tell him about the cattle being  out. He said,    By the way, what are you all doing out in this part of the  country today, anyhow?    And we told him we   d come out to look at  some land and that the neighbor had offered to sell us some, enough to  build a house on. Uncle Raymond thought for a while and he looked at  Aunt Ella, and he says,    Well, you know what?    He says,    Give me  some time. Let me talk this over with Ella.    He says,    We may just sell  you some land off of this.    And we said,    Oh, really?     So we give him time. When he had come in, he had talked to his two  sons, and they were agreeable. They were going to sell us the whole  farm, other than he did keep the five acres that his home was on. They  had a lovely garden over there. Oh, they grew the best vegetables. Aunt  Ella was the best little old gardener. Watermelons, every time we came  out, they   d load our car down with watermelons. The trunk of the car  full of watermelons, and back to town. We   d feed them to our three little  kids.  Anyhow, on this farm, see, Uncle Raymond had seventy-two acres. We  had an American Missionary Fellowship pastor in the area at that time.  They go to the different churches at different times and preach here this  Sunday, there next Sunday, and there and all. So Uncle Raymond, he  and Aunt Ella decided, and they gave ten acres off of this corner down  here to Camp Joy, is what they named it. And then they gave two acres  to this missionary, Brother Luster. So that   s twelve acres gone off of  their 160, or 172, so that left them with 160. They kept five acres for  their home over here, so we own 155 here of the original. We have the  loveliest camp. You should go home this way. Go down past there. It   s  beautiful. We have a missionary that lives here in our community that  upkeeps that. We have camps there in the summertime, three different  weeks of camps. There are five neighborhoods that combine in support  of this Camp Joy. When we have camp, each church furnishes help on a  certain day, to cook for all those children. We have dormitories. The last  two years, it   s been full. I think this year they turned children away. It   s  a beautiful place. You   ve just got to go see it.  You were looking for an acreage, and you ended up with 155 acres.  Right.  Yes. Then, with our one hundred and fifty-five acres, we   re going to  build a home where we can find water on here. There   s two lovely ponds  13  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  on here, where I can go fishing. (Laughs) And I wanted my house by the  ponds, where I don   t have to walk very far to get to the fishing place. He  was not agreeable to that because of having to build so much roadway  into where I wanted my house. There was one place down there in the  trees, no matter what time of the year, the hottest day of the year, you  could go down there and it was cool, and there is where I wanted my  home. But we got saltwater for the well, not usable through the home.  So he asked the man that was the well digger where would he go if he  was going to drill for good water. He said,    I   d go right back up on top  of that hill,    which is where we are now, on top of this hill. And the only  thing that was on this hill was that old blackjack tree back out there, and  I   ve guarded it with my life. It   s a beautiful old tree, but then the other  trees that are here, I have planted. I have a nice orchard, and my pecan  trees, I have started from the little nut itself in a milk carton through the  winter, and then come spring plant it outside. Beautiful big lovely trees  now, and everybody   s life is threatened if they touch my trees. (Laughs)  What year did you move to the farm?     75, wasn   t it? We built this house, started first of July in    75. We had it  practically completed at Christmastime, and I put my house in town for  sale. It sold the second day, and the lady wanted immediate     Possession.  She wanted to take over immediately, and needed a place to stay. So I  got to thinking, we moved the day after Christmas, out here. A friend of  mine had a big old wheat truck, and we put everything in there that I  hadn   t already. I   d been moving every day. Every time I   d come out  here I   d move a pickup load of stuff that wasn   t essential there in town,  so I had it pretty well pared down. We put everything else in that     My furniture in a wheat truck  (Laughter) He came home from the store  that evening and he says,    Oh, by the way, Verlin will be here at eight  o   clock in the morning to move us.    And I said,    What? Verlin will be  here? My furniture is not going in that wheat truck     And would you  believe, all of our neighbors around that we have lived by all these years  came that morning when they saw them loading my furniture out in that  wheat truck, came over to help. They loaded everything up. I put our  clothes in the car, and we get out here and Norval   s mother and dad had  come out ahead of us, and she had cooked the first meal on my brand  new stove. She had brought food, because see, I had no idea this was  going on until the night before. Needless to say, I am a nervous  breakdown. I   m running around in this house from room to room to  room to room. Our baby daughter, which had helped me plan and knew,     Mother wanted this in this room,    and all. When they came off of that  14  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  wheat truck with that furniture, Pam says,    Mother wants that here,  Mother wants that in that room. Mother wants that there. Mother wants,  Mother wants.    (Laughs) And I   m just going berserk.  When it was through, by evening, we had the house pretty well set up.  Norval   s dad, they had placed him, he had had some strokes, and they  took my rocking chair and put it right in the middle of the living room in  there. Pop sat there and rocked the whole time, and they   re walking and  running by him in every which direction with my furniture, getting it all.  One scratch on a coffee table was all that I could find.  Not too bad.  And I had visions the night before of just scooping it out of the wheat  truck, you know.  Well, when you realized you had all of this land, what were your  intentions for the land? What did you plan on doing?  (Laughs) Oh boy.  Running cattle.  We bought cattle. You buy them in the spring and sell them in the fall?  Yeah. That   s what an old cattle man told me. He said,    You don   t ever  winter an old cow. That   s where all your profit goes.    He said,    Just buy  them in the spring and sell them in the fall.    Well, I bought, what was it,  fifty-four head, wasn   t it?  Fifty.  Anyway, somewhere around fifty head of     Went to the stockyards.  Black Angus heifers.  In Oklahoma City.  Put them out here, and before the year   s out, she   s done got some of  them tamed to come and eat out of her hand, and so forth     And named. (Laughter)  We wound up keeping eighteen of them.  15  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Picked out the best. The ones I had tamed.  Imitates distressed voice      You can   t sell old so-and-so, you can   t sell them.     Anyway, the gist of it was we wound up with eighteen cows and heifers.  Oh, they were pretty.  I had cancer in my arm and had to go to Houston to get it taken care of  and lost, what, eight head, wasn   t it, having calves. Anyway, we kept, I  think it was something like ten head of them. We added to them and so  forth, and first thing you know we   re keeping them all winter, feeding  them all winter and so forth, and     Then he   s buying a good bull, a Black Angus bull. Registered.  Wanted to go somewhere in the wintertime, and sold out completely and  started back to buying in the spring and selling in the fall. I wound up  just    to heck with it all    and rented everything out. Now I   ve got a  sawmill. That   s all I do.  So what do you do in the mill?  Make lumber.  Sells it.  Where do you get your trees from?  My logs, I buy most of them. I get some myself on my land, but I buy  most of my logs.  I   m going to take a tangent, because I want to know how you make your  lumber.  We go down to the barn, I   ll show you how we make it.  Do you have machinery out there and you just run it through?  Right.  A sawmill.  Right. Put a log on the mill and proceed to cut it.  He   s got forklifts where he lifts it, loads it onto the sawmill and stacks it.  16  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  And do you do this all by yourself?  Most of the time.  Really?  I   ve got my grandson involved with it now. He worked for me for seven  years.  His way through college.  While he was going through part of high school and all of college he  worked for me. After he was out of college he worked for a while, and  we seemed to think that he ought to get a better paying job. He   s a smart  kid, and we convinced him of it and he went and got a job as a  policeman in El Reno.  So now he   s the policeman, an officer at El Reno.  But I   ve taken him back in as a partner in the deal, and this machinery   s  all going to wind up as his. I wanted it to continue, and I can see where  my time was going to be limited, and I want it to all be his.  He   s earned it, because he is a hardworking young man, and he   s a  young man that you don   t have to tell him to do this and do that. He sees  it needs to be done and does it, and it   s done right when he does it. And  that   s an unusual trait this day and age. His daddy was     Killed in an oilfield accident.  When he was four. And he had a little sister, three months old. And the  mother has never remarried. Her life has been devoted to those two  children. She   s got good kids. She   s a good daughter.  He was here yesterday and he saw that I hadn   t changed the oil on the  equipment down there in quite a while, and he took right to it. He got  them all changed yesterday while he was here. Changed the oil filters  and so forth, and then we went to Crescent and picked up a big red oak  tree that had been cut down for us. I   ve got what you call a knuckle  boom loading logging truck trailer, and     It   s a weird looking thing. It   s scary, actually. (Laughter)  He about got his limit yesterday on that tree. I didn   t think he was going  to get it loaded. Red oak is, I guess, about the heaviest lumber there is,  17  Finchum  D. Gooch  Finchum  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Finchum  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  and that eight and a half foot log, about like that, it was one big load. I   d  have gave up on it, but he didn   t. He stayed with it and he finally got it  loaded by picking it up on the end, working it around and getting it  edged up, and setting one end on the trailer. Then he got ahold of the  other end and swung it around and loaded it on the trailer. Then the rest  of the tree he was able to just pick up and swing with the loader  wherever he wanted it.  And your customers would be home builders, or furniture makers, or  what?  Some of them are, both.  Both?  I sell very few     Hobby. People with hobbies.  Most of my lumber goes to hobby guys, guys my age, and there   s a  younger one. (Laughs)  He did get a black walnut, he did ship    An eighteen-wheeler pulled up  out here in front, and he carried it with the forklifts and, I forget how  many feet of black walnut     Thirty-seven hundred and fifty feet of lumber went to Hayden Lake,  Idaho.  To build a home.  Bought it sight unseen.  How did he find you?  Through a friend of ours that had moved out there.  He had a good recommendation from a past customer of mine that had  moved up there in the veterinary business and he recommended me  highly and told him I   d treat him right and so forth, but the guy was still  edgy. But he bought it, and as soon as he got   we loaded it on Thursday  afternoon. Friday this truck   s in Albuquerque unloading part of the load.  Saturday he   s in Montana unloading the other, about a quarter of the  load, and then my half a load went on to Hayden Lake. He was there  Saturday night to unload and the guy wouldn   t unload him Saturday  night. He had to sit over there until Monday. He called me Monday at  18  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  noon, and he was just ecstatic. Said,    That   s the best        He was so happy with his lumber. And it was beautiful lumber. It was  native grown, right here, you know, on the farms around here.  He was well pleased.  We go to look at farms to buy. He   s looking at the trees that he can cut  down for the sawmill, and I   m looking at all the red rocks and the  rattlesnakes and these kind of things. (Laughter) In the meantime, we  have bought a few farms for those trees that   s back there. We did that  four miles north of here. We have four farms up there, and first thing he  does is go in with the bulldozer and dozes out all the old fence and puts  new fencing in around them and all. We had just got that completed  when that tornado came through. Well, he had all this beautiful pecan,  walnut. There was some cedars, and what other kind of wood was on  there that was going to make good money?  Everything but oak.  It was going to make good lumber. We   d walk. I enjoy walking the  farms like this, and he   d talk about it, you know,    This tree will, that   s a  good tree, I   ll use that one, this and all       That tornado that went  through here in May of, what,    93, wasn   t it?     99.  It did away with all those trees. It did away with everything on those  farms. Just tore everything up. All that beautiful new fence we   d put in,  it just rolled it all up into everything else, into the treetops, into you  name it. And these cross-country highline poles, those big aluminum  poles where there   s two, and then there   s a bunch of lines across the top,  that unit of power went across those farms. All those poles and all that  wire was wound up in all that timber, and cattle. We had them rented  out, and our renters lost cattle they never did find. Of course, it was  really was something.  We built.  Anyhow, we had to build another fence in July.  We started in June, and finished in August. Built four and a half miles of  fence.  Hot.  19  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Yeah, that   s a hot time of year.  Our renter, of course, was anxious to get the fence back in for his cattle,  so he helped. Norval and our grandson, Scott, and a friend of ours, Jeff,  and    Who else?  Well, Waylon Duke was one of the renters.  He helped.  He had a couple of hands helping him.  Yeah. He had his hands help, too.  He was working one crew and I was working the other one, and we  finally got it done. But I can still show you barbed wire in the biggest  old Elm tree up there. I can still see that wire going over that. (Laughs)  What   s interesting is we were walking down, there   s a little creek goes  down through there, and we were walking this creek bed, and he   s  crying tears over,    That   s my big tree  I was going make lumber out of  that.    And I looked up, and here is a tree laying long ways across the top  of some more trees that were left standing. I mean, it   s just laying up  there. Way up. And it   s just unreal what a tornado can do, you know.  We had three farms on this one quarter, or one section of land, and  across the road we had the fourth farm on it. A separate renter was on  that one across the road, and he had a wheat crop in. They had to walk  that wheat field. Of course, all the farmers had to. They had to walk that  wheat field and get all that tin and all that wire and all that stuff out  before they could put their combines into the field. It was something you  don   t want to go through.  Oh no, not at all. Mr. Gooch, going back to your youth, you had a lot of  relatives in the area, in Logan County. Where would you spend the  holidays? Would you go to one family?  Where would I spend the holidays? Well, it had to be in Logan County,  because we didn   t go nowhere about that time. We didn   t do some of the  traveling that a few of our fellow citizens could afford to do. My folks  were rather poor coming up.  Everybody was.  Nobody had any money in the 1930s.  Would you go to your grandparents   ?  20  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Come Christmas, I remember, his Grandmother Gooch always, on  Grandma   s birthday, it was in October     September.  September? The family always got together with some neighbors that we  classified, they   re family. They   re family now. Everybody took dishes,  and went not always to Grandma   s house, because she was getting  elderly. We   d maybe be at Norval   s mother   s house. It might be at Aunt  Ella   s house. It might be at Aunt Margie   s house. And then at Christmas  time, the same way. I remember the Christmas that he was in Korea,  Uncle Raymond that lived here on this farm came to town. I was a  telephone operator, and I had an apartment. I had an apartment in town,  and Uncle Raymond came to town and got me and brought me out so I  could spend Christmas with the family. It had snowed, and the snow had  drifted beautiful down these roads. It swirled just like whipped cream. I  enjoyed it, and it was awfully sweet of him to do that. He came down,  brought me out, and then took me back home.  Would the grandmother and the aunts do a lot of canning?  Oh yes.  Everybody canned food in those days. That was just part of the deal.  You canned all the fruit you could get your hands on, vegetables and so  forth, and things you raised out of the garden.  Now, my mother canned meat, too, because we had no refrigeration.  And how would she can the meat?  We processed it in a pressure cooker. And the sausage, when Daddy  would butcher a hog, we fried the sausage and put it in the fruit jar, and  then the grease that fried out of that sausage you pour back over the  cooked sausage. I don   t remember pressure cooking that, but it kept. It  was sealed, naturally, with the old rubber ring, and the zinc lid with the  glass top, you know, glass inside.  Do you still can?  I just now got through canning pears.  From your orchard?  Yes. My pears, they   re all gone now. I   m through   21  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Do you remember how your parents or your grandparents slaughtered  chickens? Did they have a certain technique?  Yeah. Like that (demonstrates) with their head. My mother could dress a  chicken quicker than anybody. I swear one day I saw the muscles jump  in the chicken, it was that fresh, in the skillet.  Oh, she could fry good chicken.  Oh, she could fry that chicken. Whoo.  She could make the best homemade vittles.  She always raised a lot of frying chickens, and she always skinned them.  My mother never saved that skin.  My mother always scalded and picked. We even peeled the feet.  You used every piece of it?  That was one of the things that Mom was so good at, was frying a  chicken. Boy, she could grab a chicken. She always had that long wire  with a loop on it. She   d reach and grab them by the leg, and the next  thing you knew, she had their head wrung off. Then she   d grab a wing,  and that loose skin right under the wing, under both wings, and about the  third time, about the third grab, she had all the skin off of them. Cut  them up. Put them in the skillet.  After they got electricity and got their deep freeze, I can remember one  time, particularly, Mom had raised a whole bunch of frying chickens.  We were living in town, and had the three little kids, and she had sent  word to me that on such and such day she   d be dressing those chickens  to put in the deep freeze, and if I wanted some, to come out. So I went  out early that morning to help her, and I forget now, there was two or  three other neighbor ladies there that came to help. It seems to me like it  was fifty-some fryers that we dressed that day. Of course, she always  sent me home with fryers to go in the deep freeze to feed our kids.  They had sheep, and one time they butchered one, and she wanted to  know if I wanted some of that, a lamb roast. I   d never eaten it, and I   d  never cooked it. I didn   t know what, really, to do to it. Well, she told me  what to do to it, and I thought I did what she told me, but we really  didn   t like it. About like when we go, he and I deer hunted an awful lot,  and bring them home, and I would butcher them and lay them out on the  table like this. Cut them up, and get them into that deep freeze. Then  22  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  when I would cook them, he   d say,    That   s not beef. That   s not beef  steak.    And I said,    What   d you expect? It didn   t start out even to be  beef steak.    So, we quit deer hunting. Well, he says,    You mean, I   ve  got to quit?    I said,    I   m not butchering another one. You just don   t need  to bring another one home.    Well, if he   s not going to eat it, you know.  So he was crying big tears. Not really. I said,    No, you can still go deer  hunting, but just make sure someone is there that wants the deer before  you shoot it.    And it worked out that way several years we went.  About the last, at least five years, we always got a deer, but we gave  them all away at the camp. Never brought them home. I   ll never forget  one time we had an old red Jeep that we used in deer hunting up in those  mountains. For the trip home, we had been lucky that year, we had three  racks. One of them is right here on the porch. These three racks, we had  the whole head, rack and all, and we set one in each seat in that Jeep,  and one in between. We propped it up somehow, I don   t remember now  just how, and it looked like they was driving the Jeep. We was towing  that behind the pickup, coming home. People would start around us and  get up beside that and then all at once they   d take off just laughing. We  entertained all the way home. Everybody was going around us, pulling  that Jeep.  Every time we stopped, we collected people.  Pulled into a restaurant, a service station, or anywhere. Everybody was  looking at that Jeep, them three heads a driving that Jeep.  Mr. Gooch, did you have any brothers or sisters?  I had three brothers. She had four sisters.  No brothers  for me . No sisters  for him .  My oldest brother and my youngest brother died of cancer. My brother,  just younger than me, lives over here about a mile south of Crescent.  We go to church together. We see them most every Sunday.  Well, I want you to tell me how you two met.  I don   t know that I can remember where we met, but we went to school  together for a short time.  I   m wondering how he   s going to tell it  (Laughs)  We knew each other and so forth. Let   s see, our first date wasn   t planned  23  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Finchum  D. Gooch  Finchum  D. Gooch  Finchum  or anything. I just saw her and her sister walking down the sidewalks of  Guthrie. We stopped and got to gabbing with them, and pretty soon I  asked her to go to, what was it, the preview?  It was a show.  Show, anyway, at the Melba Theater in Guthrie. She went, but her sister  wouldn   t go.  She kept saying,    I   m going to tell mother on you. I   m going to tell  mother.    She and I had a sleeping room in town. Mother and Daddy  were living out at Seward.  Anyway, that was our first date, and it went from there.  That was January the first. Not New Year   s Eve, but January first, and  he went into the service the twenty-fifth of January. He came home in  July on a furlough pass. For what, eleven days?  Had a twelve-day furlough, eleven of it we was married. We got  married     And then he   s in Korea for     Eighteen months.  Eighteen months. Sixty-five years ago.  So you wrote a lot of letters back and forth?  Every day. We got them in piles. The mail wasn   t all that efficient, you  know. But when we   d get, it   d be a long time that maybe I wouldn   t  even hear from him. Then all at once, I would get maybe two weeks     worth of letters all at one time.  Did you save them?  You know what, I wish I had, because I wanted to. But when he got  home, he says,    Where are all these letters I sent you?    And naturally, I  had them, and I don   t remember now, in a little box or something, and  he had the letters that I had written to him. He insists that we go out to  the park and burn them. And we did. And, I wish I hadn   t let him do  that.  Young love. But he wrote them, that was what counts.  24  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Well, there was personal things that our children shouldn   t be reading.  (Laughs)  You were a telephone operator.  Yes.  How did that come about? Tell me about being a telephone operator.  Well, Mother and Daddy had five little girls. My sister, just older than I,  just fourteen months older than I, and I went through school as twins.  Then we had the next two sisters that went to school in the same grade.  The year that my older sister and I were graduating from high school,  mother also had two others graduating out of the eighth grade. So she   s  got four little girls graduating, and they don   t have the money to buy the  pretty graduation formal dresses and the pretty little shoes to go to the   banquet . We didn   t have a dance, because the boys had all been drafted  into the army. But we had a banquet.  As a matter of fact, my older sister and I worked our way through high  school. We wouldn   t have been able to have gone to high school had we  not worked. We worked in the cafeteria at noon for our dinner. We took  four classes, which was our requirements, of a morning. We worked in  the cafeteria at noon for our lunch. We went to work, I think, at one, or  maybe one thirty, I   m not sure, at the Kress store, and worked until it  closed. And that   s how we went through high school, a few years there.  Then we went to work for the drugstore, I did. She still worked for  Kress, and I went to work for the drugstore. Then I had a friend that  came in that was moving, she was going to Tinker to work in the social  security deal. Anyhow, the job she had was for a real estate man, typing  insurance policies and so forth, so she came and wanted to know if I  wanted to  take that . She said,    Dusa, you can do it. Would you like to  have that job?    It was taking shorthand, dictation. It was what I had done  in high school. So I went over and applied for the job, and he hired me.  Then not too long after that, I found out that there was a vacancy at the  telephone office, and I went and applied for that. They paid better, and  you also had more days off.  In the process of working at the telephone office, the insurance man, he  didn   t replace me. He didn   t hire anybody back to take my job. He just  waited until I had a day off at the telephone office, and then he   d come  and he   d say,    Dusa, have you got some free time? Could you come and  type up my policies, catch me up on the work in the office?       Okay,  heck yes, for more money, yeah.    And besides, Norval   s in Korea, so  what else have I got to do? So, then I worked at the telephone office all  the time he was gone. Finally, it got to the point to where I could see the  25  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  ladies that were working the night shift were ladies that, part of them  were widow women with children, and part of them, their husbands were  overseas, but they still had children. Well, they   re working nights, and  their kids are running wild. And so I volunteered to take a night shift,  because I don   t have anything, you know. So I took a night shift,  providing when I get the message that he   s on his way home, they   ll  shift me back to days. That   s the way it worked   When they shifted me back to days, he comes home, he can   t find any  work, and he went to work in the oilfield night shift. Here he is working  the night shift, and I   m working the day shift, and we   re passing at the  door, with him going to work and me coming home. That lasted for a  while. Then when I found out that I was pregnant with our first baby, I  quit. We were very fortunate. We could   ve used the money had I stayed  on, but we were very fortunate that he was able to make a good living  for the family. I never worked out of the house again until our baby was  nine. I was able to stay home and be an at-home mommy, and a PTA  momma, and a Girl Scout, Brownies and Boy Scout  mom .  Did either of you ever think that you would ever end up coming back to  the farm?  No way.  No, we never figured that way, but it just so happened that we was out  here looking for a place to build a home, and wound up buying a farm.  So that started it. We had bought some properties there in Guthrie.  We drew up our own house plan. We drew up our own blueprints for the  house.  Anyway, I had run into some disagreements with the city of Guthrie and  the    Hysterical Society,    I call it, namely the Historical Society. When  they start telling me that I can   t do this, or I can   t do that, to the front of  my building, that   s where we parted ways. I wound up, they even had  the gall to send me word that if I ever took that Coast to Coast sign off  of the front of that building, which I had never dreamed of doing, then  I   d never put it back on. I already knew that from past experience.  Now, we owned our building. We bought our building, as well as the  business.  And they just got under my skin every time I turned around, it seemed  like. I just told them,    By God, I   m just going to sell out, sell out  completely,    and all the different properties I had there in Guthrie, and  as I sold them, I bought farms. I happened to catch it high, when the  26  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  demand was high for Guthrie property and low for farms. We   ve got  three or four farms up there, we   ve got three farms southwest of  Crescent. Thirteen hundred and five acres, and it   s all paid for.  How do you keep up with all of it?  Oh, it   s easy the first year or so, good grief. (Laughter)  Is it hard to find good renters?  No.  They come to you.  You know what? We have been very, very lucky. I mean, we   ve had the  very best of renters. We really have.  But I had the last renter that left on that farm, west of Crescent, I had  four people wanting that. I rented it to a guy out east of Guthrie, and he  rented them three farms, and he run onto hard times. He was going to  quit. Gave me notice last winter that he was quitting, and I don   t know  just all the why for it, but anyway, he had the land sitting idle.  Somehow, through a government check or something, he   s hanging on  to it up until July 1, when his lease runs out. By July 1, I had four  different guys wanting that land. I rented it to a relative.  We had invested not only in the business properties in Guthrie,  downtown businesses, we   d rented them out and had good renters there,  but we also had invested in CDs and all, for our retirement. And then, as  the CDs have come due, there   s just no interest, there   s no, you    And  so when one comes due, we just go buy another farm.  So what do you look for when you buy a new farm?  Trees. (Laughs)  Well, I look for trees. She looks for something else.  We buy unimproved land. Nothing that has a house, or a barn, or  anything like that that   s going to cause upkeep, you know.  With good fences on it. (Laughs)  Good fences. Of course, we   ve ended up putting good fences around  most of them, but     27  Finchum  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  With the intent to rent?  Oh, yes. All of them are to rent.  I   ve got three renters.  You know, we   re not going nowhere. This is home. This is where I  intend to be when I die.  What do you think will happen to this specific piece of land, this  homestead, in addition to all of your other farm properties? What do you  hope will happen within the next hundred years, long after you   re gone?  We   ve already got that taken care of in my will. It goes to my three  children.  And we   ve got it pretty well balanced out equally between the three of  them.  And do you think it will remain in the family? Is that your hope, to keep  it within the family?  That   s what I hope, but they   re going to be free to    I   m not going to tie  them down with the will that they can   t sell it, but it   ll transfer hands. I  hope without any squabble.  But all three of them are family oriented enough, and history oriented  enough, that it would really come to hard times for them if they ever  parted with the ones that had been homestead by family. Or, that   s our  thinking at this point.  Do they enjoy coming out to the farm?  Oh yes. Oh yes. Grandkids and great-grandkids     Holidays now are here?  Oh, always. But I have had a heart attack and some strokes, and Mother  can   t handle too much work anymore. But they come. Mother   s house is  big, Mother   s house is always clean. (Laughs) But you   re not to cook  anything. They cook all, they prepare all the food and bring it out.  Mrs. Clean.  But then Mother   s got to clean it up, too, after. But I enjoy it. I enjoy it.  Except when I haven   t been feeling very well and I have let things go,  28  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  then it worries me that there   s dusting that needs to be done, the vacuum  cleaner needs to be run. Oh, that old vacuum cleaner hurts so bad to run  it anymore. But yes, Mother   s got a big dining room table in there that  has two big leaves, and then we   ve got more tables and chairs in the  basement. The grandchildren, when they come in, they automatically,  Brandy and her husband, will head to the basement and start bringing up  chairs and tables. The next thing you know, Joel and Katrisa are helping  them, and the others are out here in the kitchen piddling, bringing food. I  mean, they can bring in more food    Each one of them brings enough  food to feed the whole family, and they   re good cooks. They   re all good  cooks. Happy, happy times.  Well, is there anything else you   d like to tell us that we didn   t touch  upon that you   d like to get in for the record?  Where   s the pictures?  Over there.  You had asked earlier if  we have OSU graduates. Our son  graduated from OSU with honors, in the military.  Oh, wonderful.  He graduated July 31, 1970, a distinguished military graduate. Also, his  degree was in business administration. I   ve got several pictures of him,  and he was the Scabbard and Blade. Outstanding there, and then I   ve got  several pictures of he and Dr. Kamm that was there.  And did he go into the military after graduation?  Yes. Helicopter pilot, Vietnam. His mother liked to have had a nervous  breakdown when he said he was going into flight training for helicopter.  I said,    That   s the most dangerous  Rex, you don   t stand a chance  If  anything goes wrong with that thing, you don   t stand a chance of getting  out of it alive        Mother, that is the safest       He was distinguished  military. He   s convinced me he was safer in a helicopter than he was in  an airplane or on any other mode of transportation, because if that motor  dies, that rotor on top reverses itself, and it just settles you back down to  the ground. Of course, you   re trying to convince your mother.  There   s two different. This is on photographic paper. That   s just on  regular typing paper there on bottom. You can have one or both of them.  Arial of here.  And that   s here? Tell me about these buildings.  29  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Well, this is our house, where we   re sitting. Here   s a barn and shop, this  is the sawmill barn with all the lumber in it and the sawmill itself.  There   s the dryer, and here   s a dryer.  Dries the wood.  Solar dryer to dry the lumber, cure it out. I have, actually, three. There   s  been one added since then. This belongs to the neighbor across the road.  You can have one or both. These are pictures of Uncle Jim   s. Everybody  called him Uncle Jim and Aunt Fanny. He   s not an uncle to me, but I  always called him that. This is on the farm east of here.  That was the homestead.  We now own it, but that was the house and barn over there. They both  are gone now. That   s the house, that   s the barn, and this is some of  Uncle Jim   s cattle.  That   s the other quarter here, east of us.  Is the house still standing?  No.  Nothing is.  The house is gone also.  But now, when we moved out here, when we built our home here in    75  and moved out here, the barn was still there and the house was still  there, and     What happened to that barn? A storm got that, or     No, no, no, she gave that barn to Roland     Roland Taylor   s dad?  Leslie Taylor, and she wanted it taken down. She wanted it gone. It was  time. It was deteriorating.  For lack of a roof.  He wanted the lumber in it, and also it ended up, the house the same  way. He could have the lumber if he took it clear to the ground. Well, he  didn   t, and I don   t remember exactly what happened to get the barn  30  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  down. When we bought the place, the house was still there, what  remained of it, because he dozed it down and burned it, because he had  just stripped it.  Just the remains of it.  He had just stripped it of all the good lumber. It was just a two by four  here, and over there, and maybe a board across here and all. But there  was a cellar.  There was a cellar there, but it was shot, too. I filled it full of concrete  and dirt with the dozer.  So really, there   s nothing there now, except I think maybe there is an old  cement water tank. A big cement water tank. It   s as long as this table,  and a little wider, by the windmill, where their windmill was, where they  watered the cattle.  The corral   s still there. I got a steel corral there.  Our renter uses the corrals.  But nobody   s using it. Just like back there, I   ve got a good steel corral  down there, but nobody   s using it. My renter, he   s got his own corral  over on the, he rents this whole section here. He   s got a good corral over  on his side of the section over there, and he just runs everything in there,  and he likes to use it. I don   t care.  It   s really interesting, because when his mother cows are ready to calve,  he pins them in on this place, and the old cows have their little babies  out here where we can see them and watch. It   s real fun. (Laughs)  How did you get interested in lumber? Did you just think one day that  would be fun?  I had a good buddy of mine. We were cutting firewood in the winter to  have something to do. We were cutting firewood, and every now and  then when you   re cutting firewood, you   d come against this beautiful  tree out there. I remember one in particular. It was a white oak tree,  about that big around, and it went straight up eighteen foot before the  first limb. Out in the wild, for no apparent reason, that thing had grown  eighteen foot until it had a beautiful top on it, but it was just straight as a  needle. I fell it on the ground, and I saw how straight it was and so forth.  We always worked, oh, half a block apart, so there was no danger of  falling a tree on each other. I hollered at him,    Come here     He come  down and he took one look at that, and he said,    That   d be a crime to cut  31  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  that into firewood, wouldn   t it?    And I said,    Yeah, it sure would. We  ought to get it in a sawmill somewhere. He had a sawmill just down the  road, he lived on the west side of Guthrie and just down the road a ways  was a sawmill. So we took it to him and got it sawed into lumber. He  had his sawed into two inch lumber, and I got mine sawed into four by  fours to build a wagon out of. Well, I built a wagon alright, and had  quite a time building it, but anyway, I built one. I don   t remember, I sold  it one time.  Yeah, where   d that wagon go?  Didn   t amount to a whole lot for what I got for it, but anyway, that  doesn   t matter. That got us to talking sawmill. Well, when I got ready to  buy the sawmill, I called him up one night and said,    I   m ready to buy  the sawmill. You ready?    We were going to buy it in partnership. He  was a combiner.  Custom combiner.  Wheat combiner, at the time had four big John Deere combines that he  always toured North Dakota with every summer. He   d cut firewood in  the winter, he said, to pay his grocery bills. Anyway, he said he was too  broke. I said,    Yeah, you   re so damned broke, all you can drive is  Cadillacs.    Which was true. But he wouldn   t go in with me on it, so I  called up the company and had it bought, so I thought. The old boy says,     Alright now, Mr. Gooch, it   ll be twenty-seven weeks for delivery.     And this was in July. And I said,    Twenty-seven weeks? My god, you   re  talking about next year, man. I want that thing now.    He said,    I   m  sorry, but we   re that far behind. We really are.    And I just kind of  mumbling to myself said,    Wished to hell I could find a used one.    And  he said,    Just a minute, we   ve got them here on the computer.     This was in Indianapolis.  I said,    You mean, you   re helping sell your customers    used sawmills?        Yes sir, we want to keep them all busy.    I said,    Okay. Give me a  name.    And he gave me two names, both the model that I was wanting,  and both of them were less than a year old. One of them was in  Nebraska, one of them was in Kansas City. We drove to Kansas City,  took one look at the sawmill and bought it. We hooked it on behind that  Suburban we was driving at the time, come back home seventy mile an  hour down the highway. It was a manual mill, had no hydraulics on it.  To where you had to turn the log by hand, and handle the log weight.  You had to use an old cat hook to turn them big old logs, and that gets to  32  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  be a chore. Well, anyway, I wound up with two bad hips, had to get two  steel hips. She   s telling me that sawmill   s got to go. Well, I put it up for  sale, was going to sell it, and I got to thinking about it. Well, if I had that  hydraulic mill, I wouldn   t be turning them dang logs. So when I sold the  mill, I sold the mill in January. Then February 24, I   m in Indianapolis, at  the factory.  When we go up there, the doctor had already told him, the stress test was  just way out in left field, and he needed that heart taken care of. We   re in  the doctor   s office. The doctor is begging him, and I am begging him  with tears rolling down my face,    Let   s get the heart taken care of first,  and then go get the sawmill.       No, by damn, I told them I was going to  be there on such and such day,    (which was two or three days later than  what that was)    And I   m going to be there.    And there   s ice and snow  and everything all over everything between here and Indianapolis. The  doctor says,    Norval, if you slid off in the ditch, no telling what would  happen to you with a heart in the shape it   s in.       Oh, she   s a good driver,  she        We got the sawmill and nothing happened.  We went to Indianapolis. We got that thing, and we put it on behind that  little old pickup. Now, he is at the point with this heart that his reflexes  are very slow, and I kept noticing, and then he kept kind of dozing off at  the wheel. He was slow getting on that brake, and it was just scaring the  living daylights out of me.  Should have left her at home. (Laughter)  Well, he wasn   t about to do that. I drove all the way home. When we put  that sawmill on there behind that pickup     That was the suburban that we went and got that with, wasn   t it?  Well, no, the new one we had a pickup.  Oh, you   re right, that was. The suburban   s what we got the first one on.  Yeah. He put it in the barn when we got home, and he reports to the  heart surgeon in Oklahoma City. They wouldn   t even let him come  home. He went right on into surgery. All he   s doing the whole time he   s  in there recouping is bugging the doctor,    I   ve got a brand new sawmill  that I haven   t even got to use once. When am I going to get to go  home?    Finally, the doctor, Dr. Heartsuk, says,    Mr. Gooch, have you  got a lawn chair?    Norval said,    Well, yes. Why?    He says,    I tell you  what. When you get home, you get your newspaper and that lawn chair,  33  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  and you can go down and sit by that sawmill in that barn, and read the  paper for six weeks.     And the rest is history.  We have been well blessed, we really have, because when he had  cancer    That   s where he should have started out with the reasoning  how he got into the sawmill business, into the lumber business. When he  had cancer in this arm and we went to MD Anderson, if you notice, he  has quite a scar there. It was clear to the bone and all. When he went into  surgery, they couldn   t guarantee that he would even have an arm left  when he came out. Anyhow, he did. During the stay at MD Anderson,  off and on, they found a spot on his lung. The colon, they found a polyp  in the colon. It wasn   t malignant, and but it couldn   t be taken out other  than through surgery. Then the lung, the spot on the lung, they never did  come up with what it does. They didn   t know what it was, but he had to  go through that surgery of getting the chest opened up, and the lung  deflated, and then re-inflated. All this time, it   s life threatening things,  and the good Lord has been good to us. He   s taken care of him, and he   s  still here.  The arm bit. They told him that if he quit using that arm, they gave him  so much radiation that you could hold your hand out like this above that  arm and feel the heat coming out of it for weeks after we got home.  They told him if he ever quit using that arm, he would lose use of it  completely. He would carry a bucket of sand when he   d head to the barn  with that arm to pull those muscles out, make it work, see. Then he  started cutting firewood with this friend, just for the exercise to keep this  going. He didn   t need the money. One thing led to the other, like then  when we come into the nice trees that he   s cutting into firewood that   d  make such beautiful lumber. That   s when he decided we needed a  sawmill, just what the doctor ordered. (Laughter) Eighty-six years old,  and he   s still running the sawmill. That dear little old sawmill is just  hanging on, keeping up with him.  That   s good. Well, it   s great to hear the background behind the story,  how it came about.  You asked about the lumber, the logs and all. Customers will bring their  logs in, and pay him to cut them to their dimensions. See, that   s the nice  thing about the sawmill. He can cut lumber to the dimension you need,  not what you   re going to find in the lumberyard. If he   s got the log  available, it   s wide enough, he cuts it to the dimension of what the  customer needs. He charges the customer so much a board foot to cut it.  Or, if the customer doesn   t want to pay, he   ll bring his log and he   ll cut  it on halves. In other words, we keep half of the lumber, and he takes  34  Finchum  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  half of the lumber. Or, if he doesn   t have any use at all for the lumber,  he sells it to Norval, if Norval has use for it. And he pays him so much a  board foot for it. Then there   s customers that will have, like this one that  he and Scott went to Crescent and got, this gentleman had had this tree  taken out. They can   t handle these big logs, you know, and he   s wanting  it out of his yard, so he just gave it to them,    Come and get it.    He runs  into that every once in a while, and he can   t say no.  Probably got quite a few from the ice storms?  You know, no.  Not a lot of them from the ice storms, no. Probably should. I have one  story to tell about one of these farms west of Crescent. I stopped at a  neighbor   s house over there. I was gabbing with him, and I saw this  beautiful oak tree sitting there, about that big around. It   s something like  twelve or fifteen foot up to the first limb. The ice storm that got it the  winter before, it looked like it was about ready to die, you know, but it  hadn   t destroyed its size. I said,    Give me that tree, I   ll take it out for  you.    He had just inherited the farm. His wife   s father had died, and  given them the farm. They   d just moved in, and he said,    I   d have to talk  to talk to the war department about that.    He said,    You can have that  one right over there.     I looked over there, and there standing in the fence row is another oak  tree about the same size, sticking up there in the air, looks like it   s been  dead for twenty years. The top   s all gone except one limb sticking out  here about eight foot. I said,    I don   t think so. Don   t believe I could have  any use for that.    Went ahead talking, and Scott was with me, and Scott  was talking with him. I walked over to the pickup and got a hammer,  walked over and pounded all around that thing, and it sounded solid all  the way. You know, white oak tree. I walked back over there and I said,     Tell you what. Give me that one, and I   ll take that one. I don   t know  what the heck I   m going to do with it, but I   ll take it. It   s solid.    He  called me two days later and he said,    You   ve got your trees. Come and  get them.     We went over there expecting to load them both on the truck. I had a  rollback wrecker at the time for hauling one. Man, we got one of them  on there and that was all that truck could handle was one of them. We  brought it home, went back and got the other one. I sawed that old tree  up, and it   s already dried. I don   t need to cure that lumber, man, that   s  good and cured, and it   s good lumber. Scott said,    Grandpa, what are  you going to sell that lumber for?    And I said,    Oh, about three dollars a  board foot.    He laughed.    Who are you going to sell it to?    And I said,     Oh, some damn fool from California probably wanting to convert his  35  D. Gooch  living room into a den and put that oak on the walls. We   ll call it    old,  old oak.       So we wrote    Old, old oak    on the price sheet down there  hanging at the sign down there.    Three dollars.     It wasn   t one week later, here walks in a guy, cowboy boots, cowboy  hat, and his wife. He wants something to put on the walls of his den.  Hmm. I sold it to him, three dollars a board foot. Took it all. We get it  on his trailer, ready to go, and he looks over at his wife and he says,     How many square feet did you say was on that wall?    And she said,     Five hundred and fifty.    He turned to me.    How many did we buy?    I  said,    Four hudnred.       Oh my god. You got some more?    I said,    Man, I  ain   t got no more, probably wouldn   t ever have any more.    And he said,     Man, we   ve got to do something different.    So at that time, I had that  round barn down there. When we built it, I had made the ends of the  barn, both ends of it, out of wood that we   d sawed down there rather  than buy steel for steel ends, and get by a lot cheaper. So, I had done  that. Well, I   d made the doors, these big fourteen foot, three inches tall  and ten foot wide, out of cedar. Every time it rained, we seemed to have  trouble with them doors. The cedar just soaked up a lot of moisture, and  would get real heavy. And that   s why we had trouble with them. Finally,  we decided to do away with them and we put steel doors on them.  I had taken those doors, there was four of them, and they was laying out  here on the barn lot. I was figuring on stripping them and taking that  lumber off, and I told Scott, I said,    Scott, if you   ll take that lumber off  on your own time, I   ll give the lumber to you.       Okay.    So he had that,  and it turned out to be five hundred and fifty feet feet. He had it, saving  it over here in the west barn, and I happened to think of it. I said,    Hey, I  think I   ve got just the deal for you. And I took him over there and  showed him that lumber. He said,    Man, that   ll do. That   ll do.    Between  him and Scott, Scott traded him that lumber for what he had just gave  me for this, this old oak lumber. So he traded him for, I think it was  twelve hundred dollars, I believe it was. (Laughs) He got well off with  that used lumber. And later on, I did sell that for three dollars a board  foot. Just for the same purpose. I sold it in two or three sales, but  anyway, I did sell it for three dollars a board foot.  Last spring, when you ran out of cedar    Cedar   s one of the demands,  that pretty red cedar is. He ran out of logs to cut, and so he just kind of  put out the word to different people that had been bringing logs in and  selling to him. He was out, and if they could run onto any, well he   d buy  all they could bring to him. So part of the time, the barn lot looked pretty  empty. He   s had it stacked so high that I can   t see out down that way,  and I kept telling, you know, when they built that round barn, the last  one to go up, I wanted it built where I could see him, or hear him, and  not have to go down there, and yet I didn   t want it to block the way to  36  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  D. Gooch  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  N. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  view that north eighty     It blocks the hillside over there for us.  That north eighty acres. We could sit here on the patio and watch the  deer and the wild turkey, or count our cows and calves. It was so nice,  and I didn   t want anything to block that. Well, we decided there was just  no other place to go with that round barn where I could see him and not  be worried about,    Has that sawmill got him down, or a forklift on top of  him?    Anyhow, I can go there now and hear the machinery, or hear him,  or if I stand there long enough and watch, I   ll see him move past the  door and know he   s okay and I don   t have to go down there. Anyhow, I  told his little brother, he was helping put that round barn up, I said,     Now Glenn Dale, in that wall over there, I   ve got to have a window.        Why do you want a window?    he said. There   s no window, just doors  on each end. No windows, nowhere. And he said,    What do you want a  window over there for?    I said,    I   ve got to see that hill over there.     Anyhow, I didn   t get the window.  Well, I   m glad you are taking it easy in your retirement. (Laughter)  Well, my days are getting shorter and shorter all the time. I used to work  eight, ten hours a day, and they get shortened as the time goes by. I go to  town every morning and have coffee, and shoot the breeze with the other  guys.  Every morning.  I come home about nine thirty, ten o   clock, and go to work. And I may  work    til four, I may work    til three, I may work    til five, but anyway,  just when I feel like it, I come to the house.  Is there anything else you   d like to share with us before we end our  interview with you two?  Let   s go to the barn, and I   ll show you the sawmill and how it works.  That would be great. Thank you so much for telling us about the land,  and giving us a little glimpse into your lives here in Logan County. We  appreciate it.  You know what, it   s real interesting. The old buffalo, did we tell you the  old buffalo wallows, they   re still over there on top of that hill? Well, we  can   t see it for the round barn.  We   ve seen some near Crescent, on a farm near     37  D. Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  D. Gooch  Oh, you saw the buffalos.  We   ve seen some wallows on another farm near Crescent. Not today. It   s  quite interesting.  It   s interesting that they would be there this long, this many years.  That   s a whole bunch of years.  -------  -------
