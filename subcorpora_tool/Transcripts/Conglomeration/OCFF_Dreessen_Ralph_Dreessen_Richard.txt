 Finchum. I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library and we   re conducting an oral history project entitled Oklahoma  Centennial Farm Families. We   re here in Stillwater, Oklahoma with  Ralph and Richard Dreessen. They are former owners of a centennial  farm in Guthrie or Logan County. Today is June 17, 2009. Thank you  for joining us. And by the way, Richard is the youngest of nine children,  and Ralph is the oldest of the nine children. So thank you for having us  today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having one of you tell us how the farm came to be in your  family.  Well, the farm at one time belonged to Grandpa Smith. That   s my  mother   s dad. He didn   t make the Run himself, but he bought it from a  bachelor who had made the Run in    89. He started trying to follow the  rules of what you had to do to maintain a farm that you ran and staked.  He found out that it was too much work; for some reason he couldn   t  commit to the challenge of planting fruit trees and certain things that  were required of those who staked claims. Grandpa Smith one day  somehow or another ran into him and found out that he wanted to sell it  or get rid of it or something. But anyway he gave him a hundred dollars  to have his claim and that   s how he originally got the farm, was from  less than a year after the fellow found out all the things that he had to do  to finish out the claim.  And how many acres was it? 160?  160.  5  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  And how did your grandfather come to be in Logan County? Did he live  there already or do you know?  Well, say the Run was in    89.  Right.  Which up until that it was Indian Territory and when the land was  opened up he came in from Colorado after the Land Run. He didn   t  make it before the Run but he came that same year. And that   s why he  came to Oklahoma, maybe just looking for the opportunity of the Land  Run and what was available. At the time, of course, my mother was not  yet born or I don   t think any of his children were at that time.  So he bought the farm and then did he get married? Or was he married  at that time?  I think he was married at that time.  I think so.  I believe he was.  He was kind of adventurous himself. And the 160 that was claimed and  then he bought another 80 and added on to it. But the actual 160 that he  got from this fellow that staked the claim was his and he moved there  and started making improvements that were needed to handle what he  wanted to do in the way of farming and livestock and things of that  nature.  So what did he do? What did he raise?  Well, it was a general crop. One thing he liked about it, there was a  spring on it pretty close to the hill where he built a home, an all weather  spring. He got a rock smith or brick smith or whatever you call them to  build a little cover for this   it was an arched cover way   and put  concrete around it and it would hold water, the spring would. There  would be a year round water source right below the house and where he  later built a barn. The arrangement worked out just great because the  spring was a quarter mile from the road and handy for a place to build a  house. And he built a big pond on it to.  The spring was used as a refrigerator. At the time they had no  refrigeration so  due to  the coolness of the spring they kept the eggs,  milk, and things in the spring. They had hooks in the archway that they  hung their beef on in there, when they butchered, to keep it cool.  6  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Must have been a pretty good size.  It was. I mean the frame they put around this spring that come out of this  hill, it was running water year round and a good amount too. It was a  tank for the cattle pasture. They put a concrete wall around it to where it  looked like a tank around any location in a farm. In fact you didn   t  realize it was a spring there because you couldn   t tell it from just a  covered stone, rock frame around it.  Besides cattle, did he raise any other crops?  Oh yeah, it was a general farm. They raised     Alfalfa hay, the lot.  Alfalfa and corn and maize and     Cotton some at that time.  Yeah. Then they built a house there for a hired hand, which was usually  a colored person. And to make this colored person happy he always had  to have two to three acres of cotton. One of the deals was that was a  bonus for this hired hand and for his family to have this little cotton  patch. But that was just about a two acre patch that he had. The rest of it,  there was maize and corn and wheat and oats and alfalfa. Calfer corn  and the crops that kind of grew at that particular time.  Were there any fruit trees?  And some fruit trees, right. Yeah. Always planted a little orchard.  And how did they get the products from the farm to the market?  I don   t know. Usually, it was just selling to people who would come by  the house and buy it if they saw that they had a fruit tree there. I don   t  know that they ever tried   oh once in a while if there was a good crop,  you   d put them in a basket and haul them to town. I don   t ever  remember setting up a market there at the house. The peaches and apples  and plums and things of that nature were taken to a fruit market some  place.  Well, the farm was located ten miles southwest of Guthrie, which is the  biggest town. There were two small towns at the time not too far away.  About 2    miles from Seward, which is just a very small town and  Navina, which was probably a larger town which does not even exist  today. Seward is just there by name only. Navina, I don   t think you  7  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  could even find the name.  See there used to be a railroad track that went off of the Santa Fe. It was  a spur that went to Kingfisher. It was just a spur from the Santa Fe line  that went within a half a mile of that farm   a quarter of a mile probably.  Through the years did they manage to make enough on the farm not to  have a second job somewhere?  Dad had had a full time job and had this second house for usually a  colored family who lived there. But he was a full time farmer. He never  had a part time job. He liked to have good fences for the livestock to  stay home. We used to cut a big pile of wood every year for winter. He  had a windmill on the farm up next to the house where he pumped water  into the house. He had a storage tank that was covered and we had  running water in the house from this storage tank and a windmill that  filled it. It was up on some stilts and it was covered   it was a squared  built kind of a shed. But it had stout posts on each corner and then had a  storage tank on top of it that he kept full of water.  Yeah but this was in the    20s, that this came about. But prior to that  when Grandpa Smith first moved there, they built a log cabin and then  used the spring. And actually our mother was born in 1898.  1898?  Yes, and she was one of the first children in the Territory, and her older  brother. But actually Grandpa Smith did the farming and all this until my  mom and dad married and that was about 1917. And so from    89 to 1917  it was primarily Grandpa Smith. Then from 1917 on, then my dad  married my mom and he took over the farm. Grandpa Smith went on to  other things, which he was kind of an investor and a speculator and an  oil leaser and quite an entrepreneur. And he left the farming business to  my dad and took on other enterprises.  And your mother had a brother?  She had two brothers.  Two brothers. There were three children.  Three children in her family.  And the other two didn   t want the farm?  Well, actually they ended up over at Crescent. There was a farm over  8  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  there and one of her brothers ended up there on that farm. And that   s  way beyond my time so I can   t tell you how that happened. But you   Ralph  probably don   t remember that either because that was before  you came along.  I don   t know just exactly where Grandpa Smith got his original money  but he had a little and people would want to borrow five dollars or ten  dollars or something. They found out that he would loan them money  provided that they   d provide some security. If in the process they  happened to own some mineral rights someplace that they had inherited,  they weren   t worth very much at that particular time because there  wasn   t a whole lot of drilling and stuff, he would accept royalty as  security. It might be 80 acres of royalty for a ten dollar loan. I mean stuff  of that kind. So he wound up with some mineral rights scattered  everywhere that weren   t worth anything, but he had it anyhow.  Trying to be a smart business man?  Yeah.  Fact of the matter is, some of this royalty that he had obtained in the  early    10s or    20s is still in our family. We still have some of these  royalties that Grandpa Smith obtained at that particular time.  The only thing is he had three children and then in our family there   s  nine. So I mean it doesn   t amount to too much but everybody   s got an  acre or two of royalty in our family. (Laughs)  So when the nine of you were growing up, did you have particular  chores assigned to you around the farm?  Everybody did. I mean when it was potato planting time or garden time.  We always milked the cows. We had eight to ten cows that were milked  every morning and night. We cultivated or did something on the farm,  every day. Dad was a worker. He had everybody around him working.  He saw that there was somebody that had an assignment every day. And,  of course, raising livestock on the farm, there   s always chores. You have  to build some kind of protection for the winter time, and having sow or  having pigs or a cow have a calf or something. There were neighbors  that told me that there wasn   t any question that Dad was probably a  pretty good farmer. Grandpa Smith, he was always planting, too. Dad  had a farm before Grandpa Smith finally let him farm his farm.  A little bit of practice before he got it?  Yeah.  9  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  So what was your particular chore that you were responsible for?  Well, being the oldest, I usually went after the cows when they were  over in the pasture. Bring them in to milk and things of that nature. But  probably the best caller of bringing them  in , the cows would be out in  the pasture. Then you   d bring them in of the evening. They liked good  fresh Alfalfa hay or small ground grain or something of that nature.  Then we had a little smaller pasture there right next to the barn that we   d  put them in overnight. But in the day time they had most of the pasture  which would be probably 40 or 80 or whatever dimension that you  wanted to turn them in. But they liked to eat of that fresh, rather than just  straight, grass all the time.  And Richard, what was your job for the day?  Well, of course, there was quite a bit of difference between when Ralph  was doing it and when I started because the year after I was born, he  went away to college. So we really never grew up on the farm at the  same time. But all the kids, every one of us had a job. I can remember  the first job I had was in the hay field. We had a stationary hay baler and  we had to poke the wires through the bale. Dad always had at least two  teams of horses, and sometimes more than that and always used them.  We started out always using horses. Then Dad got a tractor, the first one  about when? 1940 probably     Something like that.  They had the first tractor. We still used teams but we did have tractors.  He had one of the first tractors in the county.  And your sisters did more house type chores?  Not really. They all went to the hay field and they all had a hay job just  as the boys did. They did the same kind of work and as I said, the  perspective that we have is quite different because he was the first and I  was the last and we had all those in between that did different things.  In that length of time the farm changed some, too, I would guess.  Considerably. I cannot remember not having electricity on the farm. And  then we had electricity and running water in the house when I was born.  And that was quite unusual for a farmhouse to have that at that time.  For that era?  Dad was very creative and as he said, he fixed this water tower. We had  10  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  running water. It didn   t have any pressure but it was sure nice to have  running  water  in the house.  Did you have indoor plumbing then?  Had indoor plumbing from the time I can remember.  How about you Ralph? Did you have indoor plumbing?  Well yeah, some kind. The facilities improved over time but   and I can  remember as a young 4-Her, our county agent would come out. We were  on the first terraces that were around that area. He would put me on the  rod out there and he would sight through his telescope and we would run  terraces and those terraces were maintained and they are still in place on  that particular farm. That was when soil conservation first started.  And that would have been about what?  Well in the late    20s. But there wasn   t a lot of terracing. I mean that was  something that   to avoid washes and gullies and stuff. Take the water  off the fields in a slow manner.  And your father volunteered to let them try on your property to do that.  Yeah. In fact actually   they are going to change the way you had to  work the ground with the terraces rather than just have a square field.  But those kinds of practices   Dad had been to college. He didn   t  graduate, but he had some college work and was a little more  progressive than the average farmer.  Where had he gone, do you know?  He went up here.  OAMC?  Yeah.  Did they also do ponds? Make some ponds for him?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was part of it too. Avoid some washes. Build a  pond and have a spillway to control a little bit of washing.  Well, there still is one pond on the place that was built by a team of  horses that Ralph was involved when they built that pond. It   s still there  and still being used as a pond. Another thing I remember as a kid was  11  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  when the CCC, the  Civilian  Conservation Corps that they had just  prior to the Second World War, they came out and they planted a bunch  of trees on our place and some of the trees are still there. As well as at  the same time the WPA was putting in culverts down on the roads and  things. Those projects were things that were happening when I was just a  kid, just barely old enough to start remembering things.  I can remember when Lake Carl Blackwell was being built, a number of  our neighbors came over with teams and slips during the WPA days and  it was about the only cash anybody could get a hold of, was to come  over here at Lake Blackwell and help build it.  That would have been in the late    30s or    40s?  Late    30s, yeah, because prior to the war. 1941 was when the war  started. So that would be in that period of time.  So horses were very important too then.  Oh, we always had quite a few horses. Everybody raised their own colts.  I mean you just didn   t go out and buy a team. You had a team and had a  few female mares and they would raise their own colts and teams, a lot  of them. That was a common thing to see, a horse with a colt.  How many barns did their original farm have on it? Once they had built  the cabin then what? How many barns?  Well, somehow on that particular place, Granddad built a great big barn.  I   m talking about probably a 100     It was a 100 by 125 is what is claimed. It was a huge barn.  One edge of it was where we milked the cows. They came in because  they were handy there and had a corral, a short pin where you could  keep a cow calving or try to have something in there that kept your  weeds down or grass and stuff. But it   s on a slope of a hill and that was  always a chore, keeping all the things straightened a little bit.  Where did they get the lumber to build that one? From the farm itself or  from town?  Well, there were a lot of local saw mills that would come in. And the  original, most of it was from that farm or neighboring farm or  someplace. They made their own lumber out there on the farm. You   d  have to buy some. But most of it was milled right there on the farm.  12  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Who would be in charge of building it? Showing them how to build?  Well I don   t know if we had very many people that were trained. But  they learned on the job, I think. (Laughs)  Well, is it still standing? That barn?  No, no it fell down eventually. It went down in about   oh probably  around 1995, something like that.  So it was up a long time then.  Yeah, it was up a long time. And you had asked  about  the barns. There  was the main barn which was the huge barn. Then there was a horse barn  that was built primarily for the horses and it was there. Besides those  two big barns and the house there was just sheds, different sheds,  different places. I wouldn   t call them barns. They were just sheds they  used. Some of them are still standing there now, one or two of them. But  most of them are gone.  Like a chicken house.  Yes, there was a chicken house, always raised chickens.  A hen house, and then a chicken house.  Baby chickens.  Baby chickens. You   d have mother hens sit on eggs and hatch them.  Then we had an incubator and you could hatch eggs in an incubator. No  hens were around when those eggs were hatching. There would be in the  chicken house where all the chickens roosted at night. Then maybe  you   d have a few hens over here that had some baby chicks or maybe     it was kind of an elaborate chicken house and laying house for the  chickens.  And wood, of course, you had wood stoves. You   d have to cut wood and  make a big stack of just trimmed trees and limbs. And then you   d get a  buzz saw and cut chunks. You   d have those for winter for a heating  stove. Also small ones for the kitchen stove.  It was a two story house, so was the second floor warm during the  winter?  Well, it was as warm as you could get it. (Laughter)  13  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Not much, not much.  There wasn   t much heat that ever got up there, except by the chimney.  The chimney went up through the house and it did heat it a little bit  through the chimney. But there were no heating units up there at all. It  did get cold up there.    Refreshing      Dad was one of the first horned Hereford breeders in Oklahoma and one  of the first in the United States, I imagine. He originally belonged to the  American Horned Hereford Association and had registered all of his  cattle and kept track of his registration. So he was one of the original  that did the registration. This was before all the exotic breeds and all the  other things that they have now. Dad had the three basic breeds of cattle.  Short horned, Hereford, and Angus and that was about all they had.  Except for the dairy cows.  And when he was raising those, would he take them to market too?  Yes, on Sunday.  By truck, I guess?  Yeah.  Well Ralph talked about going down to the state fair, driving some cattle  down to the     We used to have a community fair there at Navina. We   d drive them  there from home about three miles because they didn   t have a trailer and  equipment to haul them in. And this trailer left  from  there to the  community of Navina. I never did take anything to Oklahoma City to the  fair. But we used to have those community fairs all over the county.  Each community that wanted to have a little fair would have one of their  own using the pattern of the county fair as a guide for things to display.  Livestock and canned goods?  Yeah.  Did your mother quilt much?  Well, she belonged to a club and this club, they would have a quilting  project for this family maybe this summer, and the next summer one  other family would take on. They would make as many blocks as they  could each and then put all the blocks together. Whenever the club met,  14  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  that is what they did mostly then, was quilt.  With nine children in the family, I   m surprised she had time.  She didn   t have a lot of time for quilting. That wasn   t her thing. She did  a lot of gardening and canned a lot of vegetables and things but   .  Oh, Mama had a goal of 100 quarts of everything, peaches if they got  ripe or whatever else kind of fruit or, of course, she canned all this  garden stuff. She shot for 100 cans of peas or 100 cans or beans or 100  cans of this or something.  That   d keep you through the winter until the next season came, huh?  Yes.  That   s a lot of cans.  Well, we had a big family.  There was always extra, too. Hired hands besides the family.  Where would she keep all of those?  We had a cellar and     There was a good sized room underneath the house.  Or beside the house.  So what was your favorite thing she fixed?  I didn   t have a favorite.  You like it all. (Laughter) Not strawberry jam or   .  Well, I   ll tell you, you never expressed a favorite. You ate whatever you  got.  Whatever was on the table, you liked. (Laughter) Glad to get it.  So on Sundays did you have to do your chores and then have time for  fun?  Mama was a real good churchgoer. We usually went to church and  Sunday school.  15  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  And then came home and did what?  Depending on what group you belonged to. There was some that would  go fishing. Some would hand noodle along the creek, you know.  Looking for catfish?  Yeah. Of course I don   t think Mama ever had an off day. She had a full  day of housekeeping. (Laughs)  Dad nearly always took off on Sunday. Hardly ever worked on Sunday,  unless it was harvest. He always planned his week so that everybody  could have Sunday off. All the hired hands.  So at any given time, how many hired hands would he have?  Well, we usually had a colored family that lived there all the time. And  then there would just be special times that you had extras. But other than  that you did it all   .  Hired man worked for him for years. And there   s about   usually I   d say  about four people besides the kids that were employed to work  especially during harvest time and hay time and a lot of other times.  A pretty busy farm then to have     Very busy, busy farm.  Well, raising alfalfa you know you can get three to four cuttings a year.  And baling time and harvest time. There was never a day that Dad didn   t  have something that was going to happen out there on the farm. He was  accused of being a good farmer, but he always had something to do out  there on the farm. There was fixing fence or mowing weeds or seemed  like something going on.  But us kids, I remember they didn   t have combines. We had thrash  machines. We had a binder, you had to cut it with a binder and put it in  shocks and then you had to bring it to the thrashing machine and thrash  it to make a straw pile. And that was all prior to the combine. That was a  different era and a different way of doing things.  Well, did you belong to a ring? A thrashing ring?  You had several neighbors. This one here would furnish a team with a  hay rack to haul stones. This one here would have a grain wagon that  would do that. This one here would have a hired hand to pitch stones out  16  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  the field. And a straw stack was a pretty important element then in  everybody   s mind because it was used in the winter time for the cattle,  to eat that straw and kind of winterize around the straw stack. I can  remember when combines were first   there were some neighbors up the  road there that bought a combine. And my goodness they were just  going to spread all that grain on the ground. Waste it. But the main thing  was they weren   t going to have a straw stack for winter for the cattle.  The combine wasn   t going to permit you to have a straw stack. I can  remember hearing people really objecting how that combine was going  to waste all that grain out there in the field where a thrashing machine  and you have a crew that did thrashing. This one here would furnish  your wagon and team, this one here a hay rack to haul bundles. And this  one here   it was kind of a community project, thrashing was.  One man had a thrashing machine and he just traveled from farm to farm  and the crew followed him.  And your mother had to cook for extra people on those days, I guess?  Right. You were thrashing for that person and they would furnish the  meal.  Twenty or 30 hands would be there for the lunch time.  That   s a lot of mouths to feed. That   s why she had to do 100 cans.  Well, that   s true. And now usually thrashing on one particular place  would last maybe four to five days and then they   d move on to the next.  So did your father ever get a combine?  Oh, yeah.  He finally got on board with the new technology.  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  He got one fairly early in the process. He had about a six foot  International combine. The first one he had I think was   the first one I  remember anyway. And then, of course, the Allis Chalmer came along  with the five and six foot header. You gonna want to put those on a  tractor and compare to those to the 35-40 foot headers today. It took a  long time to go cut 100 acres. Whereas they go out and cut a 100 acres  in a day or half a day sometimes.  What happened to the hay stack then?  17  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  The straw stack?  The straw stack, yes.  Well, when you had your own equipment, it was plowed under. And you  lost the straw stack when the combines come in.  Where did you go to school when you were in elementary school?  A little community called Navina that does not exist today.  Was it a country school, like all grades in one building?  Yeah. All of them clear from third to twelfth grade.  How many would be in your class?  Oh about eight.  And what about Richard, when you     Well I went to Guthrie school.  A little bit different then.  Yeah, a little bit different then. Actually the first three girls   well first  Ralph and the oldest two girls graduated at Navina High School. And  then the rest of us graduated from Guthrie.  So did you have to walk to school or ride a horse? Or did they have  some type of bus system?  Well, of course, when I was a kid, somebody had to take us. I can  remember Mama had a neighboring teenager that came and helped her a  little bit. But also she was old enough to drive a horse and buggy and  when I first went to school why we took the buggy and horse and they  had horse stalls up there at the school, too. There were kids that drove  horses to school and quite a few of them walked. I can remember when I  was in junior high, we were driving a car to school and had three or four  sisters. Of course, six sisters come along there. Drove a car, and there  would be other kids walking to school. Usually we   d pick them up.  We   d get to school  with  about ten. Had a sedan car and you hated to  drive by them and kick dust up. Sometimes you got overloaded with kids  by the time you got to school.  We lived at the edge of the school district, so all the way along you  18  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  picked up kids or they came   or they did. I wasn   t involved in that. But  they talked about that. And a lot of times when there was snow, they had  to use the horses to get through the snow to get to school.  Even rode a sled to school, horse driven. Built a pretty good little scoop  looking sled that with a blanket you could throw over you and drive to  school.  Winter seemed to be a little harsher then?  Well, yeah. (Laughter)  Didn   t have cars. One interesting project that they talk about, I don   t  remember it at all, but Ralph remembers it. There was a lot of  grasshopper infection coming into the country and Dad rigged up some  kind of a machine that was a big sled that had kind of a cage on the back  of it. They put a horse on each side and they drove it down through the  field and the grasshoppers would jump up in front of this sled and land  in this cage and behind. And then when they got to the end, they   d set  them on fire and burn the grasshoppers up.  Kind of an inventor.  Pour gasoline on them, and it would kill them. You made a cage, is what  you made, and you had a lid on the top that came up like this so the  grasshoppers hit that and tried to fly over. They   d usually hit that door  that was across there. Then at the end of the row you   d let the lid down,  so you could spray all those grasshoppers that were inside the cage and  dump them out.  Pretty ingenious way of doing it.  Well, it was one way of trying to do it.  Later on, there was an old gentleman that came and stayed on the place  and he raised turkeys. He would take the turkeys out to the field and  they   d get the grasshoppers. So every morning he would take a herd of  turkeys out or a flock of turkeys out and get the grasshoppers with the  turkeys.  There was a railroad track that ran through the place there, and he came  from Ohio. He   d hitchhike on the railroad, and when he got to the little  town of Seward, which was east of where we lived, why then there was  a track that went from there to Kingfisher. He got off of that train there  on the farm and come up and he was looking for a job. Somehow or  another, he and his family   I don   t know what he had done or how he   d  19  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  come to leave Ohio. But he lived with us from that day    til he got his  pension. Then he quit working and started raising turkeys. He didn   t live  in our house but we had another house there and fixed him a place to  sleep. He was a bachelor. Somehow or another, he and his family had  gotten into something. Never did know what it was.  He got crossways somehow.  Somehow. And left and lived with us until he passed away and he   s even  buried in the family plot down there.  Well your family was open arms, didn   t know strangers?  That was about it, pretty much it. We had plenty of people around, but  had room for another one. That   s kind of the way it operated.  What were holidays like in the old home place?  You always had your chores that you had to do. Had cattle, hogs and  beef cattle and then your milk cows. Then it was an activity that you just  participated in without anything special, hardly. Wasn   t any holidays  because the livestock needed feeding every night and morning.  Like for Christmas, did they put up a tree?  Oh yeah, oh yeah. Whatever was in season got taken care of. Everybody  recognized that this was the time for Christmas, or this was Easter.  There were farm women   s clubs that met every month. Mama belonged  to them. There weren   t any events that weren   t recognized. (Laughs)  I can remember as a kid on the Fourth of the July and this was always  real special because we went over to the station not too far from there  and Dad always bought a case of pop. That   s the only time we ever had  pop in the house. On the Fourth of July he would go buy a 24-bottle case  of pop. And sometimes we could even have two bottles. Of course it was  a celebration, but that was the only time we ever had pop in the house  when I was growing up.  Pop being Coca-Cola?  Coca-Cola.  Coca-Cola.  And Grapette.  20  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Mix you up a little mixture then.  Oh yeah. And that was the only time he bought a case of pop, he did on  the Fourth of July.  Did you go in to town to the movies?  After we got to high school, I had a cousin that lived just a mile from us.  We did. And then, of course, we   d play party games on Saturday night  with the neighborhood.  A lot of neighborhood parties.  A lot of neighborhood parties.  Most of them were at our house.  Well, Mama belonged to a farm women   s club and they met once a  month. A lot of times they were quilting.  Yeah.  Somebody had a quilt they   d made at their house. Everybody put in a  stitch or two around the quilt. Then in the summertime about every  Sunday afternoon Dad would get together with a group and go noodling,  fishing, down the Cottonwood Creek. It got to be where there would be a  pretty good group come in on that cause you   d catch so many fish then  put them in how many different people were interested in taking them  home. And different piles. And somebody would say,    Okay who gets  this pile?    And somebody blindfolded or turned with the back and say,     Let Joe have that one.       Who gets this one?       Well, Pete gets that  one.    So forth. In the summer time every week just about, on Sunday  afternoon.  Did you have fish for supper?  Well, yeah. Of course, at our place anyway, Saturday was a work day  too. It was just a regular day for whatever chores needed to be done on  the farm.  Do you recall having a radio?  Oh yeah, the radio. Always had a radio it seemed like. I can   t hardly  remember when we didn   t have a radio.  Same for you?  21  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Well yeah, we always had a radio. Of course, we didn   t get a television  until I was a senior in high school. The first television we had in the  house was   it had to be in    52.  But telephone lines, when they were ringing, everybody on the line had  an opportunity to take off the receiver and hear the conversation.  You had a party line, huh?  It was a party line. I mean whenever that phone rang, you heard clicks  all over the line. And everybody was just quiet as a mouse    til   well of  course it would be two shorts or a long or two longs or something. I  mean there was the length of your rings determined, whether it was a  short ring or a long ring   .  Which party it was.  Whose number it was. And maybe two longs and three shorts or  different combinations.  Do you remember what yours was?  Not for sure. It seemed like it was two shorts and a long.  Were the children allowed to answer it?  Not unless they got it first. (Laughter)  There weren   t very many phone conversations at that time.  But invariably you   d hear people on the line listening.  That   s just nature, I guess.  Sometimes you   d have to invite people to hang out so they could talk to  Suzy. (Laughter)  Invite them kindly. (Laughter) Were there any times when the farm  didn   t make money, or at least break even?  It was pretty tough at times, I   ll tell you that.  What about in the    30s when the Depression was going on?  Well there wasn   t much money anywhere. In fact people   well one of  the best things that several of the neighbors and so forth there came out  22  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  to build Lake Blackwell in the    30s. But otherwise it was pretty tough.  You didn   t go buy a lot of stuff at the grocery store.  You raised all your own food, meat and vegetables, and all this. You  never   well if there was a depression you really didn   t know it because  you didn   t have anything when it wasn   t. That   s kind of the way it  worked.  Clothes were hand-me-downs?  In our family, yeah.  For  the girls it was kind of a process. But usually  each one had their own. There wasn   t too much, some handed down. But  then each person pretty well wore out their own clothes.  That   s what I was going to say, we didn   t hand them down, we wore  them out, basically.  Did your mother make them?  A lot of them.  I don   t remember her making mine but when I came along     Oh, I mean the girls did.  Yeah, the girls made their dresses.  We always bought overalls and stuff of that kind. Jeans. Overalls  mostly. I don   t remember Mama making anything for me. You had to  buy that.  So describe a typical family meal. What would be on the table?  Mashed potatoes and gravy, a meat, green beans or navy beans, and  probably some greens of some type.  Corn bread or biscuits?  We didn   t eat cornbread that much. Biscuits quite a bit. Or at least I  don   t remember cornbread that much.  And the meat, was it   .  And fruit. There was always some canned fruit. Peaches or whatever. Of  course, everything was canned, that you could think of.  23  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  With eggs and chickens, you   d have fried chicken some?  Oh, a lot of fried chicken. In fact that was required. You start with baby  chicks and grow up to fryers. But the meals didn   t change a lot. Once in  a while you   d get a special meal.  But always plenty to eat?  Right. And milk. Always just expected to have it.  So the farm, when you all were there, was actually a working farm for  50 years or more?  Oh yeah.  100 years. I mean it was always a working farm, and is still a working  farm.  It still is now?  Yeah.  What do they farm now?  Well, wheat   s become a big product of the farm. And then it is used for a  lot of cattle now. I mean it   s more than the other part that still raise cattle  and produce those. We are both still involved in raising cattle ourselves.  And do the other things. Put up a lot of hay. Hay is such a big thing.  Alfalfa. That was a full time chore. By the time you got this patch cut  and baled and then the next patch cut, this one over here was growing.  About every month you   d come back and mow this patch. And in  season, there   d be some of the neighbors that would have some fruit that  would bear like peaches or plums or apples or something. An orchard  that they   d have where you   d have off of a tree. Of course, farm  women   s club would meet once a month and they would have different  ideas that they would express. Then the farm organization like the Farm  Bureau or Farmer   s Union, they would have an annual activity of some  kind, that was a family affair.  They always an ATA   Anti Thief Association   that met and had oyster  suppers in the winter and ice cream socials in the summer. A lot of  community activities like that. You didn   t have organized sports and  stuff.  No one even thought anything about having to walk two or three miles  24  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  to a job. In fact actually in our place there would be a small house down  the lane that a family would live in.  Would you have family reunions back on the farm?  Oh yeah. Dad had three brothers that lived in Moore and they took turns  coming up or maybe all of them would come up at one time. Then these  farm women   s clubs, they would have a meeting. Navina was a small  community and our high school kids at that time would have Skip-to-  My-Lou and party games that you   d swing and out in the dirt on the  grass lawn or something. That was  it  for partying in high school. It   d  be the high school bunch that would have Skip-to-My-Lou. (Laughter)  Parties usually  were  about every Saturday night unless there was  something else special on.  But we were from a large family. When they did come in, there   s a lot of  family. And still we get together and still talk about when we were little  coming to the farm and things. A lot of times they   ll spend the night at  our place.  So how many bedrooms would the old farmhouse have? With nine kids?  Well, actually five bedrooms, or six. There was one that cut the wall out,  six bedrooms at one time. And then of course any place else you wanted  to sleep. But you could have six bedrooms available all the time.  I imagine the kitchen table was quite large  Well, yeah.  We could all get around it.  It reached from one wall to the other, almost. I mean there was usually  10-12 at the table each meal.  Do you have a favorite memory from those days?  I was probably different from his because part of the time I lived in town  and part of the time in the country. We kept the farm and sometimes  we   d be in town to go to school and then come home on weekends, go  up to the farm. Then be on the farm all summer. So mine was a different  kind of raising so I have as much town as I do country in my  background.  I never did live in town. When I was in college, I   d go back to the farm.  Dad had gone to college, so they expected me to. So I came up here to  25  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  college  at OAMC . When I graduated   in fact back then hitchhiked  from   usually take me to Guthrie and then I could hitchhike from there  up here to college.  Up to Stillwater?  Yeah.  So you went here when it was Oklahoma A   M?  Oh, yeah.  Before the name change?  Yeah. See I came up here in    35.  So campus has changed quite a bit since then, hasn   t it?  Well, the thing about hitchhiking, I could walk from home to the  Interurban  Oklahoma Railway  which was a street car from Guthrie to  Norman and catch the street car to Guthrie. And then walk through  Guthrie. Then start hitchhiking from Guthrie to as far as I could get.  Usually maybe to Coyle, then maybe catch another ride. Invariably,  you   d catch a ride and an old boy would say,    Have you got a quarter to  buy gasoline?    I say,    No, I don   t have a quarter, otherwise I wouldn   t  be out here hitchhiking.    But once in a while, you   d have to buy a gallon  of gas for the old boy that picked you up to give you a ride. Then you   d  get to Perkins Corner and then you   d have to catch a ride from there to  Stillwater.  How long would that take you?  Oh, it   d take half a day.  How often would you do that when you were in school?  Well, not too often. Usually I would ship back my clothes to have them  washed, in a box. Mama would wash them and then put them back in the  box and ship them back over here.  So she didn   t get out of work even when you left home.  That   s right. I mean she got to wash my clothes. We had mail boxes, you  know, they actually let you put your clothes in to ship them. You had a  card on one side that they gave the address of home. On the other side of  the card you had the address in Stillwater. So all you do is just slip that  26  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  card over and insert it on the side of the cardboard box.  And you used the box over and over?  Oh yeah.  Could you? They didn   t do that when you were in school, did they  Richard?  No, no, no. (Laughter) No, it was a different time.  So when did you graduate from OAMC? What year?     39.  That was unusual, too, for them to send you to school when the  Depression was on.  Yeah.  That was really unusual.  Of course, coming out of the Depression at that time, but then it still  was.  Yeah.  But then, he came over here and the next sister who was a year younger  went to UCO, well Central State College or Central Normal College, I  guess it was at that time.  I had never even seen a game, but came over here and stayed in the  dormitory and some of the guys liked to play poker so they taught me  how. First time I   d ever seen a poker game. We used mills and they had  aluminum mills that were worth 1/10th of a cent and a half a mill was  worth    cent. And that   s what you learned with. You could sit there and  play poker all evening and go home and have 17 cents, maybe.  A pretty good day?  Pretty good evening and you had a whale of a haul. (Laughs) But that  was when mills were in operation. You don   t remember the mills, I   m  sure.  No.  27  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  They were used during the war time, especially. They had the bills. And  that   s what they used for taxes instead of pennies. They had so many  mills.  I   ve seen that.  Ten mills make a penny. It was just a smaller unit.  So do either of you remember visiting the Carnegie Library in Guthrie?  Oh yeah. Not a lot.  I grew up half a block from the Carnegie library. That was my town  house. And so I went to Carnegie a lot when I was in high school. They  had Teen Town downstairs in the Carnegie library and I spent a lot of  time there.  It   s a pretty building.  Beautiful building.  Well, I lived on the farm all the time I was in high school. So     He was the Ag teacher in Guthrie, and I was in his class as well as one  of the novelties that we had.  That must have been interesting.  Then I had a brother just a year older than I was. We were both in his  class for four years while he was teaching and we were in school.  And was he harder on you two than he was the others?  Probably not. (Laughter) About the same.  I tried to treat them all alike. Yeah, I was there ten years. So you know,  train them for judging teams and things of that nature, that we  participated in here interscholastically, judging contest.  So you kept your hand in agriculture just in a little bit different     Yeah. Well as a teacher, you   re working with kids and trying to motivate  them to get some livestock and do a little better job of taking care of  whatever they had and showing, and exhibiting and judging contests and  covering the subject pretty much.  28  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Did you come up to OAMC for 4-H Round Up?  Of course, we were in FFA. I was a 4-H member when I was growing  up, well ag and FFA have become more of a program for high school  students.  When you were in high school, you were in 4-H.  Oh yeah.  And did come up for Round Up.  Yeah, they didn   t have a full ag program in the school where I grew up.  You know, back then if you were particularly good in school, you got to  dust the erasers. You got to take them outside and find a rock to dust  them on. (Laughter)  If you were good?  If you were good. Specialty of the teacher. (Laughter)  When we came in, you said you had sold the farm?  About 2000. No, it was about 2003, I think it was.  Any particular reason why?  Well, there were nine kids, all had 1/9th.  It   s kind of hard to farm 1/9th.  Yes it would be.  We knew that someday one of us was going to die and it meant that  many more involved. So we decided probably the best way to resolve  the problem was to sell the farm, and that   s what we did. None of the  nine was able to or wanted to buy the farm, so it was easy to sell outside  and that was the reason for it. Since we sold it, three of them have  passed away. Our timing was about     Pretty good. So that  100 investment paid off for itself many times over  I   d say.  Many times, many times.  Did all nine of you go to at least some college?  29  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Well, most of us did. Two or three of us got master   s degrees and then  everybody went to some kind of schooling.  So education was important for both of your parents?  Yeah, very important. I think four or five of us graduated with at least a  bachelor   s. And three or four of us got a master   s. And then none of us  got to the PhD but then some of the grandkids have. But the rest of us  didn   t. Ed went into education, I went into education, a sister went into  education as well as Ralph is in education.  So will the new owners let you come back and visit?  Oh yeah, yeah. I rented the place, for about three years after we sold,  from the guy that bought it. The fellow who bought it was just kind of an  investor, lawyer in Oklahoma City.  So is the spring still flowing?  It   s still there. And the house is still there. It really is an historic thing.  There   s a picture of it in this book if you want to look at it.  The farm house though you said is not     It   s gone. It   s not there.  But there   s another house on     No the spring is about the only structure on the   .  The spring house.  The spring house is the only structure left on the place that was there.  Did you put watermelons in it in the summer?  Oh yeah.  Yeah, I   m sure they did.  Kept milk down there, too. It was the coolest place we had around the  place. But yeah, it became a rent place sometime. Why everyone and  everybody take care of upkeep. So there were occasions when it   s  everybody   s business and it turns out to be nobody   s business. But Dad  shingled that barn by himself one time.  30  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  The big 100 by 125?  Yeah.  That had to take him a while.  Yes.  Yeah, it was a long big job. A big, big job.  Saw his lumber, I think, every evening or something. Do a little bit.  What did your grandfather do once he gave the farm to your mother?  Well that   s what we were talking about. He kind of became an  entrepreneur and   .  Did other things.  Investing. And I don   t know what all he did. But he did leave the farm to  my dad and he went on.  Left it in good hands and went on.  Well, of course, actually he still owned it up until he died and then  Mama inherited it. That   s what happened there.  So he just worked it.  Because Grandpa had a place on the other side of Crescent and the son  got it and Mama got this land here.  Well sounds like she got a good deal with the fresh spring on it and   .  Well, they   ve got a nice place up there.  Do they?  Yeah.  They had added actually at one time, they had 760 acres between what  Dad had and what Mom had and what they got together. So at one point,  that   s how large it got.  That   d be a lot of fence to keep up, wouldn   t it?  31  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Finchum  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Richard  Ralph  Finchum  A lot of fence. A lot of fence.  Well I   ve asked all my questions, is there anything else you want to add  before we sign off?  Well I just might say that of my folks, Mom and Dad had nine children,  33 grandchildren and someone did the figuring up and I think about two  years  ago  they figured that there were 254 descendents from just Mom  and Dad. And then that   s the direct blood descendents. So quite a  prolific bunch. We did our part in populating the world.  Helping Oklahoma become Oklahoma.  All nine children are able to all get together every other year, isn   t it?  Every other year. We   ve done that for about the last ten years. We were  together two years ago. And all nine of us were still living and still  together. Thanksgiving we had about 147 there for Thanksgiving dinner.  And that was our group.  Lot   s of cooks I hope. Not just one.  Lots of cooks. Everybody brought lots of food. Enough food to feed an  army.  Where could you have that many people?  Well our house and our yard. In our garage, in our barn.  Hopefully it was a pretty weather day.  It was a little cold, but     Yeah it was a little bit cool. Do you have pictures there of our group?  I don   t have the group here. I   ve got them at home but not here. But  that   s     You   ve got some of them. Oh, that   s yours.  Yeah this is just part of the groups, but then we   ve got a whole bunch of  family   I   ve got the whole bunch here. That   s part of them, yeah.  Yeah.  It would probably take more than one picture to get 147 in it.  32  Richard  Finchum  Ralph  We do have one picture that   s got 147 at my house. In one picture. And  you can see everybody in it. You can count.  Well it   s been our pleasure to spend this morning with you both learning  about your farm. It   s been very nice. So thank you for letting us.  Well, we appreciate you having an interest.  -------  -------
