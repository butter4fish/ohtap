 Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn, and with me today is also Tanya  Finchum. We are with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program  with the OSU Library. Today is Thursday, September 30, 2010, and we  are in Crescent, Oklahoma, interviewing Frances and Phil Macy on the  Alfred and Joella Murry Homestead. This interview is being conducted  as part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral History  Project. Phil, you wanted to tell us a little story today.  I   ll be happy to. If you all can go back to 1893, that way I can best give  you a story about this farm. My great-grandpa and grandma lived on the  farm next door. Their names were James and Mariah Murry. My  grandpa   s name was Alfred Murry. He was about twenty-one in 1893  and the first Run in Oklahoma was 1889, near Guthrie. There was about  four or five littler runs, but the next big run was called the Cherokee  Strip Run, and that was where people lined up on the Kansas border,  they shot the gun, and they all started south with their flags. My grandpa  was about twenty-one, Alfred Murry. He has a horse, and so he leaves  home where his mom and dad live across the fence over here. He goes  up to the Kansas border, and when they shoot the gun, he takes off  heading south. He gets about as far as Billings, Oklahoma, which is near  Enid. Now, these are towns    current names. I   m sure they weren   t there  then, but that lets you know where I am talking about.  He gets as far as about Billings, and he puts his stake in the ground on a  hundred and sixty acres. The year is 1893. I think it was President  Cleveland back then who had the proclamation that if you went out and  homesteaded and put a stake in the ground, and stayed there for seven  years, lived there and turned ten acres, at the end of seven years for  twelve or fourteen dollars, you were given that hundred and sixty acres.  So Grandpa put his stake in the ground, dug him a dugout to live in, and  he lived there by himself for seven years. That brings us up to 1900.  In October 1900, he   s now been there seven years, and so he goes to the  5  F. Macy  P. Macy  land office, and you have to have a piece of paper signed by five or  seven other existing Americans that live in that area that vouch for you  that says you   re an honorable and honest person. We have that piece of  paper today. We got it out of the records. So, there were five or seven  people that said,    Alfred Murry? He   s A-Okay.    So he got that farm that  day in October, 1900. That is seven years after he put his stake in the  ground.  Approximately the next day (laughter) he sold that farm for, I think,  either twelve-hundred or twenty-one hundred dollars. He gets on his  horse and rides from Billings down to where his mom and dad lives next  door, and he buys this farm where we   re setting, and half of this house  was a part of the farm. He built the back half. I think he bought this  place for somewhere between twelve-hundred and twenty-one hundred  dollars. His wife, my grandmother, was Joella Brown. She lived one  mile west, over here in the farmhouse with her family. He begins to  court her and they get married the next year. They have three children  that are born in this house. Uncle Bill was born in 1902, my mother was  born 1904, and my aunt was born in 1910. Another aunt was born in  town when they moved to town, years later.  So, that gets us to this house. When he bought it, the large part of the  house, the front part of the house was here, and he added these two back  rooms. When we get inside, I will be able to explain it to you better.  They got married in about 1902, so they moved here. As the years pass,  as a young man, he gets serious rheumatism. He has trouble living out  here on the farm with the weather, so they move into town. As the years  passed, this farm then got occupied by a third child, which was Aunt  Pete. Her name was Velma. She got married in 1930. She and her  husband, Uncle Russell Wilson, moved here, and they lived here then  for the next forty some-odd years.  My mom moved to town, and that   s another story, not a part of this  story. My aunt and uncle, that is Velma and Russell Wilson, did not  have any children. I was their surrogate little guy. As the years passed,  I   d come out here and stay at the farm with them in the summertime,  harvest time, et cetera. What I need to do is take you inside, and start  telling you about stuff inside the house. Frances, have I left something  out?  Well, you could tell them that across the road, where the milo is now,  there was, like a village. There were a number of houses that went from  here down to the corner. Down on the corner there was a little grocery  store, and a post office was there, called Acton.  Actonville.  6  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Did the Actons share that with you?  Yes.  Actonville Village.  A blacksmith shop, and a     The church was around the corner.  Yes, right. Dunkard Church.  Dunkard Church.  Phil   s been there.  My mother, when she was a little girl, she used to go to that church with  Grandma and Grandpa. They would have feet washings. Are you  familiar with that term at all?  I am not. Could you explain it?  Feet washings. Well, way back in Jesus    day, as Christians, people  traveled, and they usually wore sandals back in those years. The story  goes back then that in the evening time, when they came in to finish  their day of traveling or wherever they   d been, they always washed their  feet. There   s a story about how, I believe it was Mary, in washing his  feet she took her long hair   she had long hair   and she dried his feet off  with her long hair and used some perfume and stuff. So anyway, back in  the early years before Christianity, in Jesus    day, I think, was a  somewhat normal procedure in those years. Well, some of the churches,  as the years passed, picked that up. This little Dunkard church over here,  my mom said, used to have feet washings, and in those days, of course  Jesus was not involved, but the people, I don   t know their procedure, but  they would come up, take their shoes and socks off, and go through the  procedure as part of a ritual of early Christian life. So that   s that story.  I think she called it foot washing.  Foot washing?  Foot washing. (Laughs) But there is a cemetery over there where that  little church used to be that is still used.  Is that Mt. Hope?  7  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Yes.  Mt. Hope, a little cemetery.  It   s pretty well-kept, and there are people that are buried there  frequently. Now     When I was a real young guy, they had pie suppers and box suppers over  there. I have been over there and I   ve bought a box a time or two, for a  quarter, or a nickel, or a dime, or whatever you bid. It was an auction. I  can remember that kind of activity also.  Before we go in, can we share a little bit about the yard, while we   re out  here?  Well, sure. Let me ask a quick question about Alfred. Why did he sell the  farm in Billings?  My opinion   I don   t have anybody to contradict me   my opinion is that  he wanted this farm. He was twenty-one when he went up there, so  seven years, he is twenty-eight, so he is saying,    I want to go get that  farm next door,    to where his mom and dad lived. He sold that so he  could buy this farm. That is my answer to that question.  I think another reason is, through the years we have discovered that this  is a very fertile farm. This is what I was going to share with you. He was  very good at agronomy. He wasn   t educated, but he was excellent. The  things that he had around here were so far advanced of what anybody  else ever had. That is the original smokehouse. On the other side of that  he had a cold frame, and he raised plants in the springtime. All the  people from all the community would come and get their cabbage and  their tomatoes. He was so far advanced that he had a huge orchard, a  large orchard.  A little grape vineyard here.  Yes, and hops. He grew hops, and then they used the cellar, you see, to  preserve the things that he learned how to grow here. This was and is  still a very fertile piece of land. I guess it was a hundred and sixty acres  when he first got it? And then he got the other     I haven   t told that story yet. I   ll tell them that.  Okay. But I think that he knew that this was a better kind of farming that  he wanted to do because that   s pretty much wheat fields up that way,  8  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  you know. It is more flat and prairie.  Do you have any sense of how Alfred learned how to be such a good  farmer, an industrious farmer?  We really don   t know.  I wish we could tell you. We do not know that part. I need to tell you a  little bit more about him, that will explain to you why I am not going to  be able to tell you very much about Alfred. I told you about his arthritis.  At the age of forty-nine   that is very young   he had already had ten  years of bad   in the wintertime he   d have pain. Have either of you ever  been to Hot Springs, Arkansas? Are you familiar with that place? Well,  back in those years, and even for the next thirty or forty years, clear up  until maybe 1950, that was a big place for people who had ailments to  go and take baths. That   s in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In Claremore,  Oklahoma there was also a hot springs. I don   t know whether you knew  that or not. They did the same thing, like a mini Hot Springs, Arkansas,  in Claremore, Oklahoma   Will Rogers    country. Grandpa would get on  the train here in Crescent, and he   d ride the train to Claremore and take  these hot baths because supposedly that would improve your pain. While  he was there, he died. Forty-nine years old.  Leaving Joella alone with four kids.  That would have been 1922. I was born in 1930, so all of my stories  about Grandpa is what Grandma told me, and Grandma is Joella. I need  to share with you that I don   t know a lot about how he got to where he  got to.  So did Joella handle the day-to-day farm duties after Alfred passed on?  That   s a good question. At the time he passed on, they had moved to  town in Crescent. So the farm was then rented to people until my aunt  and uncle moved here in 1930. So therefore, they weren   t at the farm,  and she was raising the family in Crescent. So when he was gone, she  was the keeper of her kids. My mother was born in 1904, so in 1922 she  would have been eighteen. Oh, by the way I   ll tell you a quick story  about my mom. She graduated from high school in Crescent in about    21  or    22, about the year that Grandpa died. She went to   there was a little  college in Edmond, Oklahoma, called Normal. It was a little two year  teacher   s college that   s now University of Central Oklahoma. Anyway,  so she goes over there for a summer course, gets a stamp of approval,  and she started teaching school when she was seventeen out here in a  one-room school.  9  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Some of her students were the same age as she was.  And she had two boys in her class that was in the eighth grade that were  as old as she was. (Laughter) Anyway, how did I get on her story? Oh,  you were asking me about Grandma     How they lived.  Now, you asked me about Grandma. So Grandma   s at home in Crescent  and my mother is eighteen. She   s teaching school, so she comes and  helps Grandma with finances. Then Grandma has two other kids. Aunt  Pete, who   s born in 1910, so she would have only been ten or eleven  years old. Then Aunt Tootie (which her name was Mary Frances), I  think she was born 1916, so she would have only been three, or four, or  five years old. So Grandma had two little kids in the house, my mother  who was eighteen and her brother who   s nineteen, Uncle Bill. He goes  and leaves home and works in the oil field, so he is gone. My mom is  kind of a big helper with Joella. Joella is Grandma. So I think     But they lived very frugally. They even had a garden in town, you know.  Grandma had a garden in town, she canned and she had a cellar. There is  a cellar here, and this cellar is hundred and twenty years old, setting  right there behind you, and it is still a good cellar. I   ll show it to you  later. Grandma took care of herself there in town and raised these two  kids, and     Until Aunt Pete and Uncle Russell got married. Aunt Pete didn   t want to  go to college. So Aunt Pete and Uncle Russell got married.  In 1930.  And Uncle Russell came from the farm, a big farming family, and they  moved here. They lived here        for about forty-seven years.  And they would take, from here, chickens in to Joella, and any  vegetables     Eggs, chickens, a pint of whipped cream   a pint of cream. I think they  paid Grandma a little bit of rent, but they helped her with food products.  He farmed with horses, and the two of them together milked cows in that  barn, and in this smokehouse was the cream separator that you     10  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Behind you is a barn. I will show it to you later when we start taking a  tour. They milked eighteen cows a day, twice a day.  Wow.  Uncle Russell and Aunt Pete hand-milked them, and then they'd bring  the milk up here to this little smokehouse that also had a separator  inside, and they would separate. Their cash product was the cream. Then  every two days, the creamery truck would come down the road and they  would give him a thirty gallon bucket of cream. That was their cash,  except when they had wheat, and then they would get cash for wheat.  The residue, then you   d slop the pigs and feed the calves with the    Blue  John   .  So very self-sufficient.  Yes.  Yes, very. Extremely.  And I guess during the Depression years, it was a little bit easier  because they had     Oh yeah. Nobody else had anything, so you didn   t know that things were  poor. (Laughs)  No electricity, no electricity. Now, they did have a telephone. That   s  amazing. They had a country telephone.  My grandpa Alfred had the first telephone out in this area. The  neighbors would get on their horse and they would ride over here     (Laughter)  To call the doctor. (Laughs)     to use the telephone, and they would hold the telephone like this and  they would holler in there,    Hey, Jim     (Laughter) They   d have like two  shorts and one long would be their ring        but everybody listened  (Laughs)  Yes, everybody listened on the telephone. Grandpa had the first  telephone in this area, out here. They had them in town. I don   t know  what year it would have been, but I   m going to guess it would have been  1910 or something like that.  11  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  Well, when did electricity come to the farm?  After World War II. It was called rural electrical     Did you grow up in Oklahoma?  No ma   am.  Okay, Oklahoma was the last state to get rural electricity. (Laughs)  After World War II, which we are talking about what,    46,    47,    48, the  rural electrification system came into America, and certainly here in  Oklahoma.  They all had it in the east long, long before we did.  So when I was a little boy coming here in the    30s, there was no  electricity.  Coal oil lamps.  So we had a coal oil lamp. You   re going to ask me this question, so I  will tell you that now, about the stoves. This house was heated with a  black belly stove that sat in the front room. I will show you that when  we go inside. In the kitchen there were two kinds of stoves. There was a  summer stove that ran on coal oil, and in the wintertime, it used wood.  My aunt and grandma, in the earlier days before my time   I   m talking  about now in the teens   this little wooden stove, you   d put wood in it,  and you cooked and heated the kitchen part of the house with the wood  stove in the winter time. When spring came, you   d take the black belly  stove out of the living room. You would just take it out of the house.  And put it in the barn.  Just sit it in the barn. (Laughter) You would take the wood burning stove  out and put in a coal oil stove, because with a coal oil stove, you can  control the heat right at the stove and not necessarily heat up the house  with it. Then when October came, like about now, out would go the coal  oil stove and in would come the wood burning stove in the kitchen, and  in would come the black belly stove, goes into the front room. When I  grew up as a kid, that   s what was here, because there wasn   t any  electricity and there wasn   t any other kinds of power.  So when you spent the night, how would you keep warm?  A lot of quilts  (Laughs)  12  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  That   s the answer. (Laughter) That   s the answer.  Or a rock that you   d warm, or a brick that you   d warm to put at your  feet. That   s how I did it.  You could do that. You could take a brick and heat it up, then put a  towel around it, and put it at the foot of the bed. I wasn   t here a lot in the  wintertime. Usually I was here in the summertime when I was a kid. I  was born in 1930, so all through the    30s, I probably was six or seven  years old before I came and stayed here many days. Otherwise, it would  just be a night, as a little guy. As the years passed, then I would come  when harvest time would be, and I would help take water to the field.  When I was about eleven or twelve years old I was pitching bundles and  actually working with the harvest hands. Now, I wasn   t as strong as the  full-time men were, but I would help in the fields. Not a lot, but some.  This well was here when Phil   s mother was a little girl. It was called a  pitcher pump then. She thought it stood up on something because it was  a little pump like that one right there. (Gestures) You   d put your bucket  there and then run in the house with your water for the house. She also  told us when we first got here, we didn   t know that these rocks were  here. Those rocks over there (gestures) were brought up by his Grandpa  Alfred from the creek so we could get to the smokehouse without  walking in the mud or in the snow.  You   ll see those when you get up and walk around. They   re big, big     But Mom Mae insisted that there were rocks that went out through an  arbor that was right here. Like that arbor down there. (Gestures) We  found one that was like the one that   Alfred had made an arbor here. He  was very clever with making things. He   d make toys. A merry-go-round  for the kids to play on. But anyway, she insisted that these rocks were  here. And I   ll be darned, we kept digging down and digging down, and  we found these, what? Twelve inches down?  Yes.  Wow.  And there they were  Just like she had said they were. (Laughs) So  anyway, we kept them. We pulled them up, put dirt under them, and  used them.  She is telling you about this well. (Gestures) Behind you, right back over  there was another well that I think Grandpa or his predecessor that was  13  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  here had dug down. It was like a well that would have been three or four  feet around with rocks, and you can stand and look in it. At the top  would be a little copula like this with a wheel and a rope on it. You had  a bucket, and you   d drop the bucket down in the well, and the bucket  would pick up water out of the well. Then you   d pull the bucket up and  pour it into another bucket and take it in. So that well was there also  back before this one.  It   s under the tub. There is an opening that is still there.  It   s back there now, behind you. You   ll see it when you go back there.  And we understand there was another well out by the barn somewhere,  but we have never found where that is. But, Phil   s mother was sure that  there was one there.  Well, there was a windmill out there back in the teens,    20s, and    30s.  There was a windmill out there near the barn of which the windmill  could bring the water up for the trough for the animals up there.  And then one of them   and we are not sure whether it was Uncle  Russell or Grandpa that built   there is a wonderful   you   re going to get  a ride out to the pond and see the pond. And then there is another one  over on the other one that is beautiful. It   s a lake.  I need to tell her about that right now.  Go ahead.  We said in 1900 this farm became the Murry Farm Homestead. In 1910,  there is an offsetting one-sixty right behind you. Quarter section is  northeast, southwest; this is the southwest quarter section of section  thirty-four. The northeast quarter is offsetting this one, so they sit like  this. (Gesturing) Grandpa, in 1910, bought that other hundred and sixty  acres, so this farm now is three hundred and twenty acres. I don   t know  how much of this story you want to hear. I   ll tell you this story. This is  an interesting story. You know all the kids. So as the years passed,  Uncle Bill dies at forty-nine like his daddy did. His wife, Aunt Adeline,  she wasn   t all that excited about the Murry family. That   s her kin folks.  So she says to Joella,    I want out. I want my inheritance, now.     Well, the inheritance basically was these two farms. So, Grandma and  my mother and the other two sisters   one of them is living here now,  Aunt Pete and her husband   they get some estimates, and they give her  an estimate, of which her inheritance would be one-fifth. There is  Grandma and four kids, and her husband was one of them, and he has  14  died. He has just died. So that means she wants one-fifth of the assets,  which is the two farms. She rejected the dollar figure they came up with.  I haven   t any idea what it is, but I am just going to guess four, five, six,  seven-thousand dollars. Maybe that much in 1950, I guess it is, about  1950. So she forces them to sell the farms on the courthouse steps. The  courthouse is in Guthrie. My mother and grandma, who is Joella, and  Tootie, who is Mary Frances, and Aunt Pete and her husband, who live  in this house, they get together and they say,    Okay, we will go to the  auction and we   ll buy the farm, whatever the bids.    There   s not going to  be any big bids, they think.    We   ll buy the farm. All we got to come up  with is one-fifth of what the price is to buy her out.     So, Uncle Russell, who   s married to Aunt Pete and they live here, he  makes a deal with all of them, because Grandma is still alive. He makes  a deal with them and he says,    Okay, whatever the one-fifth comes up  to, I   ll pay that. Therefore then, I   m now one of the five owners.    At the  time they did that, my mother, who was the eldest of the siblings, said,     Okay, what we need to do right now, because Grandma (the year is  1950, and Grandma   s getting up in age), we need to kind of identify how  this farm is going to get divided when Grandma dies.     What they did was, there   s four. Grandma would be the fifth, but when  she dies it would be four. So they sit down and calculated how to do a  one-fourth ownership of the two farms, the three hundred and twenty  acres. Because Aunt Pete and Uncle Russell were living in this house on  the home place, the original place, Mom and the one other sister  (because the other sister lives with Uncle Russell), say,    We   re going to  now state you all get the home place.    Uncle Russell   s got one-half of it,  and that is a hundred and sixty acres. And the house. So Aunt Pete is an  owner of half of it because of her blood line, and Uncle Russell is going  to pay that one-fifth I was telling you about.  So, he then gets the other half, so eighty is Aunt Pete   s, eighty acres is  Uncle Russell   s, my mother gets eighty acres of the other one-sixty, the  offset, and the other sister who is Tootie, Aunt Tootie, she gets the other  eighty acres. So, Mom   s identification is the south half of that one, and  Tootie   s is the north half, and Uncle Russell and Aunt Pete get the home  place. Now not right now; it   s when Grandma dies. But they identified it  and put in all the paperwork. They got paperwork. Okay, so eight years  pass, and Grandma dies. Well, whenever she dies, now these papers all  get put in the county courthouse records. Now officially, officially now,  Uncle Russell and Aunt Pete own the home place. Mom and her sister  own the other hundred and sixty.  Each Fourth of July, Christmas, Thanksgiving, et cetera, we always got  together   the families did, those of us settled around. As the year  15  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  P. Macy  passed, the next year, and the next year, Uncle Russell every time they  got together would say to Tootie    Tootie is the youngest one, youngest  sister. She is the one that owns the north half of that one-sixty, over  there. He would say to her,    Tootie when are you going to sell me you  half of the farm?    He never did say anything to my mom because I think  he said,    Mae is not going to.    My mother   s name was Mae.    She is not  even going to entertain me talking to her.    He   d make Tootie mad. This  went on for a year or two every holiday, every time they   d get together.     Tootie, when are you going to sell me that farm?     Well, Tootie got mad at Uncle Russell because he was bugging her. She  says to my mother one day after a couple of years of this going on, she  says,    I want to sell you my half. I   m tired of him bugging me about the  farm.    So my mom gives her twenty-five hundred dollars for her half, so  now my mom owns all that one-sixty. She takes that twenty-five  hundred and buys one hundred shares of AT T stock way back forty or  fifty years ago, and it   s probably worth a hundred-thousand dollars  today. (Laughter) But Mom then owned the farm, and that I think is an  interesting story. Then my mother, who died last year at a hundred and  four, when she died then, my sister and I now own that one-sixty over  there. I own the south half and she owns the other. You know, it   s  undivided. She and I own that one, and Frances and I thirty-some years  ago bought the home place from Aunt Pete and Uncle Russell because it  became theirs when Grandma died. That is a little story about how Phil  and Frances ended up owning this Murry Homestead that we got sitting  here. That is kind of an interesting little story.  Oh yeah.  So what did the sister finally get for her fifth?  Oh, I do not know the number. I am going to guess probably four or five  thousand dollars, because I doubt if these two farms in 1950 sold for  much more than, let   s see, a hundred dollars an acre back then, would  have been sixteen thousand, and so one-fifth of sixteen would have been  three thousand. So I am going to guess maybe four, five, six thousand  dollars at the most. But, that would have been a lot of money in 1950.  You could buy a new car for two thousand dollars, you know. That   s  about what she got. Oh, I am sorry I could tell you another little story     royalty. You all should be interested in royalty. The royalty   this is the  craziest story in the world  (Laughs) She got cash for her surface and she  got her one-fifth of the royalty with a thirty year termination. That was  1950, so by 1980, she   s out of it, and that reverts back to the  homeowner. In 1980 we bought the farm, but Aunt Pete and Uncle  Russell, they kept their royalty for life. They died five or seven or eight  years later. So the royalty then goes to   it   s ours. We   re talking about  16  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  the home place. The hundred and sixty that   s over there, my mom and  her sister sold royalty to one another so each of them has half of half of  half of half. (Laughter) I got all that paperwork. It is the craziest thing in  the world  (Laughter) So anyway, they also had the thirty year deal, and  that was back in 1960, so by 1990 that vanished, and because Mom  owned the farm, the royalty was hers. So now it is my sister and I on that  piece of land over there, and Frances and I have all of the home place.  Crazy stories.  Did they find any oil, gas     The answer is yes. (Laughter) Ten years ago. It was ten years ago     Not that long.  Yeah it was, the first one. Ten years ago, they drilled a well right over  here on our farm. It produced for sixty days, and the guy that drilled it,  he wanted to re-work it.  This little cloud up here. (Laughs)  So he went in to re-work it, and dropped the tools in the hole, and killed  the well. (Laughter)  Oh, man   I   m glad we can laugh about it, you know? (Laughs) It was producing.  Now that was ten years ago. Three years ago, some other guys came in  and they drilled a well over there too, in the same area. They were doing  some great stuff. They went down and did that horizontal drilling. Are  you familiar with that term?  I am not.  It is a big deal.  You don   t want to hear about it at all. (Laughs)  You go down five or six thousand feet and then you turn and you go  parallel to the surface another two-thousand feet. That way you can  produce that much more sand out of one hole. This is going to be a big  deal. Boy, they were going to get fifty to a hundred barrels of oil a day,  and now the Mississippi     Thank goodness Phil and I said we are not going to count our chicks  17  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  until they are hatched. (Laughter)  Well, the biggest fracking job (fracking is where you go down in a hole,  and you pressurize the formation and you explode it out so it will  produce the oil and gas) job that had been done at this time in this area  was done on this well. I mean, there was twenty-six Halliburton trucks  over there. (Laughter) I mean, the whole county was     There were people driving by looking to see what in the world they were  doing  It was like a circus  (Laughs)  Normal fracking is done at three-thousand PSI  pounds per square inch ,  and this was done at six-thousand PSI   big deal. I am not ever sure they  even got in the right hole, because they had two parallel holes down  there. (Laughter) They had two of these horizontal holes. I was there  every day watching all of this thinking,    Oh boy, golly  We can buy a  new car, Frances     (Laughter) Now we get a check every once in a while  for fifty dollars or     Through the years was farming the primary source of income?  Yes.  Only source.  I shouldn   t say only.  So nobody had an outside job?  No.  Well, now wait a minute.  Uncle Russell, at the end of their life here on the farm, he actually  worked for the   they called it    working on the road      and he drove a  grader.  But that   s when they moved to town and retired.  But he did that a little while he was here, because that is when he found  that doll. But anyway, he did that in order to build up some social  security time, you know, so he could have     Now that   s Uncle Russell.  But that   s at the end of his life, you know, my goodness. That   s     18  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  But go back to Alfred     Never anything there.  When they moved to town, Alfred worked at the hardware store. He still  owned the farms. They rented it out for whatever token it was, but he  worked in the hardware store in town. Joella, who   s Grandma, she had a  brother that was very industrious. Bill Brown was his name, William  Brown. He was in the grocery business, so he was an entrepreneur of  those years. I am talking about now 1900, 1904. In fact, if you go to  Crescent, there   s a building that the drugstore is in and you   ll see  Brown, you will see his name up there. He built that building back in  about, I think it says 1904, but I am not sure. It might be 1908 or  something about that time. So Grandpa was a worker in town, just in the  hardware store.  That   s what I was going to add about when you asked the question about  why did he come here. Crescent was a very unusually vibrant little  community at that time. They had big orchards and they would ship  peaches out on trains. I mean, this whole area was very fertile and lots  and lots of agriculture and lots of product that got shipped out. I think he  knew that four miles away was a little town that was pretty good, and  then the county seat was Guthrie. Phil   s mother has told us how, many  times, the whole family would get in the wagon with the horses and they  would wagon all the way to Guthrie, spend the day. She would get to  ride on the interurban and they would put the horses in the stables over  there, for the day, and then come back at night.  They would buy their groceries, do their shopping, and come back that  night.  And she would put hay in the wagon so they could fall asleep on their  way home, with quilts.  Have you ever been to Guthrie?  Yes.  Well, there is a restaurant there in town called Stables. That was where  they used to put their wagon and their horses when they went to town to  Guthrie. We   re talking about in the teens.  In the teens. Before the    20s.  Yeah, before 1920. They were all living here on the farm then.  19  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  When did they purchase their first car?  (Laughs) Mom, Mae     Boy, howdy   First woman in Crescent to own her own car when she was teaching  school.  Wow.  She went in and negotiated and bought her own car. First woman.  Brand new car, and she was nineteen years old. (Laughter) I mean, she  was a libber, she was a women   s libber before they knew how to  pronounce it. She was a neat lady. That   s my mother, Mae. I could tell  you a lot of stories    She got a car, and the year would have been    23 or     24. She bought a new Model-T, I believe it was. I think it was three  hundred and sixty dollars or something.  So she   s teaching school, Mae?  Yes. Mae is teaching school.  How did she meet her husband? Tell me about the husband, your dad.  We are getting to the Macys for a minute. My dad came here from  Missouri with his family. There were ten kids. They lived in the  panhandle. He was born in Beaver County, Oklahoma. His daddy was  what you called in the earlier days a shade tree mechanic. He had the  Red Ball Express mechanic store in Blackwell. Dad was born in 1900,  so we   re talking about 1915 and 1920. He comes to Crescent, my dad  does. He comes to Crescent, I am going to guess, around 1921 or    22 or     23, and opens a little automobile repair shop with another guy. My  mother met him there in Crescent and they got married in 1926, about.  They courted there and she was teaching school at the time. They met  there, and he had this little automobile dealership     Can I add a little bit to that?  Yes.  I don   t know if you have seen the Cimarron River or not, but it has  pretty sandy beaches on the edge of the river. Well, the young people  around here most days, and even later, would go to the Cimarron River  20  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  and picnic and cook. They would have hot biscuits, and fried potatoes,  and take maybe fried chicken with them and have picnics.  Kodaking.  They would take their Kodaks.  Kodaking. It was called Kodaking.  We have so many pictures of Kodak parties. (Laughs) And they always  stand on the bridge and have somebody take their picture standing on the  bridge. (Laughs)  We have got a lot of old pictures of my mom and dad and other young  couples.  That was what young people did and they were not dating necessarily,  just a bunch of them would go and hang out together. (Laughs)  I don   t know a lot more about their courtship other than they got married  around    27, and my sister was born in    29, and I was born in    30.  Somewhere in    31 or    32 the banks closed in America, and my dad had  borrowed five hundred dollars or so to buy a new car to put on the  showroom floor. He was very frugal. When the banks closed   I don   t  know how long they were closed. Days, weeks, months, I am not sure  how long. But when they re-opened, if you had a loan you could buy  your loan for fifty cents on the dollar. He was able to buy his loan out  and get back free. Then for the next ten years (we   re talking about from     31,    32, until World War II) my mother and my dad, all of their money  was in cash. He did bank at the bank, but their real money went in the  refrigerator, in the ice box, in the kitchen. I remember as a kid, they  could easily have had hundreds of dollars in there in fives and ten dollar  bills, because if your house burned down, your refrigerator is insulated  and your money wouldn   t burn up.  I remember in 1936, my dad (we are off the subject of the farm here for  a minute) bought our first house, our only house, for I think it was four  hundred or seven hundred dollars. We are talking about 1936. Therefore,  to have saved tens and twenties and fives in your refrigerator, if you had  five hundred or a thousand dollars, you had a lot of money in the  refrigerator. We were cash and carry all my life, and I am that way  today. I borrowed to buy a house, but that   s it. We have never borrowed  to buy anything else. We are very, very conservative and very frugal.  Do you still keep a stash in your refrigerator? (Laughs)  21  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Finchum  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  (Laughs) Are you ready?  Yeah  (Laughs)  The answer is yes. (Laughter)  That   s great  (Laughs)  Learned that from my mom and dad.  In a special container or just   ?  No, I   ll tell you. You all have a refrigerator that   s probably got a  freezing unit in it   the upper half or somewhere. The freezing unit is  really insulated. And so if your house burned down and everything is  gone, you   d walk in there, and that refrigerator would still be standing  there. It would be left and that   s where you put your money, in the  freezer.  In fact, in 2008 (that wasn   t very long ago, two years ago) things looked  pretty serious in America. It   s still serious; we are still in big trouble.  We   ve got a crap government. But anyway, we put some extra money in  the refrigerator in 2008. It is not a big deal, but if all of a sudden, the  banks were to close and everybody is frantically running around, if you  had a thousand dollars you could be wealthy   you know, I mean you  could   ve been.  Anyway, the answer is yes, we still do. (Laughs) Funny little story, isn   t  it? Do you all ever listen to Dave  Ramsay ? He has a radio show about  how to manage your money. He says that the paid up mortgage replaced  the BMW in the driveway.  Going back to the farm     Okay get back to the farm, yes.  Tell me a little bit about preservation on the land through the years to  the different structures. Obviously they all look in really good shape.  I   ll do the best I can on that. Frances and I bought the farm thirty years  ago. Therefore, we have rented it to a farmer. He is a big farmer over in  Mulhall. He has got over a thousand acres over there. He maintains our  farm for us, and the farm is terraced. This wheat field out here is sixty-some  acres and every so many years   in fact, he just did it last year   he  redoes the terraces with special equipment. The terraces, of course, are  to control the rain runoff. Are you familiar with how terraces work?  22  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  A little bit.  Well, if you can imagine, if you just have a hillside like this and you  have done nothing to it and big, heavy rains come, they will begin to  wash. When they wash, then they start taking the service land with them.  If you terrace that in circles, then when the big, heavy rains come instead  of it washing, it will only wash as far as that terrace goes and you end up  with, I   ll just call it a little lake. So, you   ve got twenty little lakes. Every  terrace creates a little lake, but it holds it. It doesn   t run. Then two days  later when the rains stop, you   ve still got your land, it hasn   t washed  away. So right now you might not be able to tell it, but that sixty-three  acres there has probably got at least a half a dozen major terraces. We  are talking about big, big swings   four, five, six, seven, eight-thousand  feet long. They are big semicircles like this. This land is all terraced. I   m  talking about the farmland. There   s ten acres out behind the barn, and it  has a little terrace in it. It is only ten acres. But, the rest of the farm is all  pasture. The pasture, unfortunately, is not terraced. Therefore, when the  rains come hard, we do have a few canyons. When we go for a ride, I   ll  get you in the gator and we   ll go out to the farm or to the pond over  there. I   ll show you where there is major erosion, but it is hundreds of  years old out in the pastures.  One year, fifteen or eighteen years ago, Frances and I spent a lot of  money in one pasture over there. Had eroded bad enough that I didn   t  like it. There are gullies here and gullies there. That little acreage over  there was probably forty acres, and we got a bulldozer and came in and  completely planed it. So, all the gullies are full and everything was  planed on an angle like this. (Gestures) Then we built a pond down at  the bottom of it, so that hopefully when it rains, the water would run  down to the pond. The pond had a horn in the bottom of it that would  take it down to the creek and then take it away. We did that fifteen or  twenty years ago. In general, that has been a major protection of the  pasture. I will be able to show you that.  We bought the house, as he said, thirty years ago, but we lived in St.  Louis. Phil worked for McDonnell Douglas and I taught school. Nobody  was in this house. It was occupied by birds, rats, and some mess  producers. (Laughs)  Oh, wow.  Oh yes. Hole in the roof.  There were some druggies that got in here.  23  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  We did keep the roof on it, but the rest of it, we just couldn   t keep up  with it, being so far away. After we retired and moved here, that   s when  we started bringing it back to life.  So you   ve done major restoration?  Major, major.  When we get inside we are going to show you     Because even the foundation    We found an old man, he lives south of  Crescent. Wonderful...  Should I tell her that story?  Go ahead. (Laughs)  Frances wanted to rehab the house. In a minute we will show you  pictures of the house. It was just in shambles, it was just trash. The  windows were rotted out, the doors were rotted out, the floors were  rotted out, and it was just    Well, we   ll show you pictures. It was just a  pile of junk. She wanted to restore it, and I said,    No, I am not going to  do that.     Naysayer. (Laughs)  Finally, she kept bugging me, and I said,    I   ll tell you what, I am going  to get this old man.     He is a famous, not a brick man but     Stone.  Masonry guy, stone man. So he comes out. By the way, he has got a  beard this long.  He looks like Santa Claus. (Laughs)  No, he looks like     A troll. (Laughs)  Old Rip Van Winkle, a troll, yeah. (Laughter) His beard is this long and  his hair is this long. (Gestures)  And he wears a pointed cap.  Interesting old guy. Anyway, he comes out and I say,    Okay, look at  24  this.    I said,    My wife wants to bring the house back to life, but I am not  going to do anything to this foundation.    The foundation was made of  pieces of sand rock. Here was a little piece, here was a little piece, and  here was a bigger piece. I am talking about the guy that build it  originally back in probably 1890, and I will only talk about that half  there. My grandpa built this house. So, I say to this old guy,    What do  you think about that foundation?    He says,    I   ll tell you what I   ll do. For  five hundred dollars, I   ll dig a ditch one foot wide and one foot deep  around the periphery of this house. That   s right up next to this rocky  foundation, and when we dig that ditch, I will be able to then tell you  what the situation is.    Okay, I   ll spend five hundred dollars just to find  out what we   ve got.  So, he digs this ditch all the way around it, and when he does, he says,     Well, I   ll tell you what, Mr. Macy.    He said,    I can build you a new  foundation and I   ll push the mortar.    So what he was going to do was  put the foundation down in this ditch, which is beside the foundation.  Then he   ll push the mortar from this foundation into all these rocks. He  says,    I   ll build you a foundation that will be better than what they had  originally. That   s going to cost you two thousand dollars.    (Laughter) I  said,    Well, she is bugging me. Okay, we will do it.    We get in the car  and we head for Colorado or Santa Fe. We   re gone. When we get inside  you   ll see, but back on that corner, it was so rotted out that the floors  were rotted out, the walls were rotted out, and you really couldn   t build a  foundation over on that corner over there. So, he says to me,    Well, I  have got a son-in-law that   s a good old carpenter.    He says,    I   ll have  him fix the framing so that I can go ahead and finish the foundation.     We   re gone for ten days. We come back, and sure enough he has this  foundation all the way around the house. I am going to be able to walk  you around and show you, it is a neat deal. He said,    Mr. Macy, you   ve  got a better foundation now than when originally it was put in.    In the  meantime, his son-in-law has started major substructure back in that  corner so that they could put the foundation around that side of the  house. I guess I could tell you that story. The son-in-law, I meet him. I  really like him. I like him a lot, and I watched him work. I came out  every day when I got back from Santa Fe. I watched him working and  his name is Jack. God, I just love him. He is really a good old carpenter.  Young guy, fifty years old. I said,    Jack, Frances wants to redo this  house. What do you think we could do?    It is August. He says,    Well, in  three months, by Thanksgiving, we ought to be able to fix the house up.     We made a deal that I was going to pay him four thousand dollars, and  in three months we   d have it all done. We didn   t know exactly what we  were going to do, but we were going to put in new windows. We did say  that. This house had lath and plaster. Do you know what that is?  25  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  No, sir.  Okay. (Laughter) Do you know what drywall is?  Yes.  No drywall. (Laughter)  Before drywall, before World War II, which is before drywall, when you  built a house, to get the equivalency of a wall, like drywall, you took  laths, and the laths were like a quarter inch thick and maybe an inch and  a half wide. They were just long laths. You can imagine what that would  be. So you have your two by fours that   s built you walls up, you put  these laths up there, and you have a gap between each lath. They   re just  in there angled like this, then another one, angled like this. (Gestures)  Then you come along and put a screen over it and now you get plaster in  a bucket. You take a spatula and you just smear it on this screen that   s  on this, so it   s called lath and plaster. That   s the way they built homes  back before, say, World War II, all homes, to finish the inside wall.  Either that or you put wood plank or whatever. So, all these walls were  lath and plaster.  So we are going along and we are saying,    How good is this wall?     You   d touch it, you know, and you could tell it was really loose. After a  day or two, we said,    What we were going to do, we can   t do it.    We  started tearing this out. We tore out all the walls inside of the lath and  plaster because it was all deteriorated. It was just coming apart. You  couldn   t have ended up with a finished house. We tore all that out, and  when we did that our Thanksgiving date went up in smoke. (Laughter) I  made a deal with him. I just paid him so much a week until we got it  done. Well, it took us until May.  Wow. (Laughter)  But oh, boy  You are going to like what you see when you go inside.  This would have qualified, you know, all those big long pieces of paper  you have to fill out, it would have qualified for being a historic  farmhouse according to the national standards, except that Uncle Russell  had covered it years ago. Because when you got down to the wood you  would see this was just pieces of old wood from torn down barns up the  road and     Junk.  It was just pieces. It was really not very well put together. So a lot of the  26  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  outside had deteriorated rapidly, and Uncle Russell had covered it all.  Years ago we used to have asbestos shingles that they would nail on, and  they were wonderful at the time because they were very impervious to  bad weather.  Nobody knew they were bad for your health.  But we didn   t know they were going to kill us all. But if we had taken all  that off, we would have had stringent guidelines for disposing of it.  We wouldn   t know how to dispose of it.  We didn   t even know what we would do, so we decided the best thing is  to just give it a raincoat. (Laughs)  We put a whole new coating on it that looks like the original wood.  It   s just covered up. But that   s what the original    You can see some.  We have two or three places where the original wood is inside.  We   ll show you some of the original wood. This wall looks just like it  looked one hundred years ago.  But anyway, we couldn   t qualify it for the National Historic  Preservation, for the house. But, the chicken house could   ve qualified,  but it was in such bad shape that we tore it down. (Laughs) We could   ve  saved the outhouse, the toilet, which had Uncle Russell   s numbers up  there. He was in three-four-nine. That was the toilet. (Laughs) I  should   ve saved it. I don   t know why in the world I didn   t save it.  And it had a moon hole on it.  I don   t know why we didn   t save that.  It was a two-holer too, by the way.  Is it?  So you could go out there and visit with your friends. (Laughter)  Which catalogs did they have out there? (Laughter)  Sears and Roebuck.  Of course.  27  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Oh yeah, that is true. That   s exactly right. That   s exactly what was there.  You would try to go back to the yellow pages because they were a little  boring. (Laughter)  Not slick.  They weren   t slick like the     But the old garage that was over here, Uncle Russell had found someone  tearing down an old barn up the way there. It was just literally an old  barn with a gravel driveway going in. We tore it down, too, because it  was not usable.  But that old barn was post-Grandpa.  Yeah, right.  This other stuff was here, back years ago.  Now the original barn, is it still on the property?  No, it burned.  Well, what you   re going to see is a barn that is ninety years old. There  was another one there, my mom says, that     Lightning struck it.     burned down, lightning. But that one that is out there is    Let   s see, I  was born 1930, and it was on old barn then, so that barn out there is  about a 1910 model. It   s a hundred years old. We will show you that,  too.  It was mostly tin for a while, and then they covered it with wood.  Have you done any restoration on the smokehouse?  Yes.  Okay, now on the smokehouse, this is a funny story. When that  smokehouse was built     You might want to make it short. I think they have got a timeline.  (Laughs)  That smokehouse was built, the four walls that were laid on the ground.  28  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  They just put a two by four frame and then put one by eights, one by  sixes     That is how it was when we got there.     and it was lying on the ground.  We didn   t even know it.  So, then they just swung it up and attached a roof to it. (Laughter) So ten  years ago when we did this, we   re putting a new roof on that. Two guys  are up there putting a roof on, and it   s doing this. (Gestures) They come  back down, we look inside, and there is no basic structure for the walls.  You and Jack. (Laughs)  So we built a new structure. When you go inside you will get to see  where we added proper framing and proper structure.  So it wouldn   t blow over. (Laughter)  We put in a concrete floor. When I came here as a little boy, one of the  stories I was telling you about when Aunt Pete and Uncle Russell milked  eighteen cows a day, it was just a dirt floor. At one time Uncle Russell,  on this end, on the south end, he had a fifty gallon drum cut half in two  with a shower nozzle on it, and a ladder, and he would climb up there  and take water and pour in that. Then the sunshine would warm the  water up, and that was their  shower , instead of using a number two tub  inside. So in the summertime that was where they could take a shower  with that.  But they did get a bathroom in about     After World War II. In the    50s they put a little bathroom back there.  But we are going to     Then Uncle Russell closed in this porch and made Aunt Pete a little  laundry room.  A little laundry room.  She was so happy to get her own washing machine out here.  Oh, I bet.  This porch right, here. When we get inside I   ll tell you some more about  29  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  when we started to redo it. We had a picture, a 1910 picture, so we made  the house look just like it did in 1910.  Are you all familiar with  Joseph Pierre  Foucart, F-O-U-C-A-R-T? He  was a very important architect.  Architect in Guthrie.  Well, all over Oklahoma. There are many Foucart buildings all over. He  did the city hall, and lots and lots of those beautiful buildings downtown  in Guthrie are his design. Well, the Logan County Historical Society  gives awards each year for three or four restorations, and we got the  Foucart Award for the restoration of our farmhouse.  Four years ago.  It was a very nice award. We   ve got it over here. (Laughs)  For this little house. (Laughter)  On all of your acreage here, have you added any new buildings?  No new buildings.  Yeah, right over there.  Oh, I   m sorry. (Laughter) I   m thinking she   s talking about farm  buildings.  No. (Laughs)  Next door three years ago, we built another house. Instead of having a  second house in the Colorado mountains, it is next door. We   ll show you  that when you are all done with this part.  We go on Rocky Mountain retreats eighteen miles from home. (Laughs)  Our kids come and spend the night.  You   ll be able to tell when you get over there. We get the sunsets, the  sunrises, and the moon sets. It   s really pretty over there.  Well, I have to ask how you two met.  I can   t tell that story. (Laughter) I   m in the sixth or seventh grade   I  hope I can keep a straight face   30  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F.

Anyway, the bus comes in and out jumps these kids out of the bus. She  jumps out of the bus and I see her getting out of the bus.  Holding my little sister   s hand. (Laughs)  That would have been   what year would that have been?  Only you know. (Laughs)  I was in the seventh grade, so seven and five is twelve, so I would have  been twelve or thirteen years old. I   m eighty, so that would   ve been  sixty-eight years ago. So that is when I first saw her. Then we went to  school together, we went to high school together, and we dated     We went to college together.  And we dated in high school. Then we went to college together and we  got married in our junior year in college. We were nineteen, and she was  old enough to get married. You know, a girl is an adult at eighteen, but  men are not adults until they are twenty-one, so I had to get my mother   s  permission to get married. (Laughter) We got married sixty years ago  this January.  Wow.  1951.  We grew up together, literally.  I can   t ever remember being single. (Laughs)  We used to come out here when we were in high school and go down to  the creek and get Christmas trees. We would get a tree for Aunt Pete, we  would get a tree for his house, and my house. (Laughs)  Cedars. We would go down     Cedars, so we still have a cedar tree at Christmas time. We go to the  creek and     Yes, we go down. Now we   ve got grandkids. We go down now and get a  Christmas tree each year and put it in the house next door. We   ll show  you that when we get over there.  31  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  You did ask questions about holidays in the olden days. Well, we can   t  tell you how much they did, but when we were growing up we   d always  come out to Aunt Pete   s for Fourth of July, and they   d make ice cream.  That was a big thing.  Homemade ice cream.  But years ago, Phil   s mother told about when she was a young girl, that  one of her cousins played the fiddle. Her mother actually had a pump  organ in that parlor. They had rag rugs, that they made, on the floor.  They would roll up the rag rugs and they called the fiddle player.  Grandma would get on the pump organ and they would have dances in  that parlor.  In this front room. We   ll show you when we get there.  And if it was nice weather, they would come out and dance in the yard,  under the trees. Wasn   t that a cute story, though? (Laughs) And they  would have lemonade and cookies. I don   t know what they called them.  My mother went to play parties, but I don   t know if that is what they had  or not.  Frances, did you grow up on a farm?  I did, I did. Yes, yes.  Two miles, right over here.  I didn   t have electricity. I didn   t have a telephone either, so nobody  could call me. (Laughs)  I used to call you.  Well, when we moved on the other side of town     Yeah, when you moved to the other farm.     but I was a junior in high school, then. (Laughs)  Yes.  I was grown up.  Where did you go to college together?  Central State  University of Central Oklahoma now . He got a degree in  32  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  business and I got a degree in education, elementary. Then he got in the  navy and from there we went to California, the East Coast.  We graduated in    52. I started in    48 and she started in    49.  And I caught up with him.  She finished in three years. She went summer, winter, spring, and fall.  And worked one hundred hours a month.  Whew   In the library. The library got me through school, girls  (Laughs)  And how many kids do you have?  Two girls. One was Amy that just came here, the blonde. She is coming  to get her horse to take it closer to where the kids are. They live in  Edmond, just a block from us. The horse is too far out here. We can   t  drive out here every day and take care of it. Our other daughter, the  older daughter who doesn   t have any children, lives in Kansas and owns  Bartlett Arboretum. I don   t know where. It just got National Historic     Write that down, you want to go see that.  Yes, you need to look that up. Look it up on your computer.  Look it up on your computer. Bartlett Arboretum, or Robin Macy.  .com.  Either one. You will get the whole story.  bartlettarboretum.com  Do you have anything else?  When you were thinking about retiring and considering this place, was it  first on your list?  Absolutely not  (Laughter) I love St. Louis, Phil loves St. Louis.  We lived in St. Louis forty-seven years.  And all of our friends were there, we had raised our kids there, and  33  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  every time I would go to the grocery store I would have a PTO meeting  because I would keep seeing parents of kids that I had in first grade, and  now they are in college, and they   re getting married and having kids. I  loved it in St. Louis. St. Louis is a beautiful town. It   s very historic, but  when he retired, he had two or three other jobs. Finally I retired. I taught  first grade for thirty-two years, and he was at McDonnell Douglas for  thirty-five years. Then he was Willy Wonka the Chocolate Factory, he  managed a chocolate factory in St. Louis. Then he was the little old wine  man because he ran a winery out on the     For two years on the Missouri River.  (Laughs) On the Missouri River. Then Phil   s mother was living by  herself, my mother was living by herself in Guthrie, and we were the  trustees for this. Aunt Pete that used to live here had no children. One of  them was always needing us.  Seven times a year we would drive from St. Louis going from     Going back and forth. Finally, we said,    Okay, let   s move back to  Oklahoma.    So we sold our house and moved back. I cried buckets  when we left St. Louis.  We bought this farm years before.  That was why I kept bugging him because that was part of the deal. If  we move back, we get to restore the little house. (Laughs)  Well, we bought the farm from Aunt Pete and Uncle Russell in 1980.  At the height of the    (Laughs)  The price of land was the most expensive it had been. That was back  when farms were selling twice what they were worth. We bought it then  and we spent ten years paying for it. Every year we would send money  and interest     But we wanted it paid for before we came back.  We had it paid for     That was our goal if we came back. So, anyway, that is how we got here.  It was not my first choice, but it   s okay now. Now that Amy and her  little kids moved here, we have family   close family   here. And Robin  is just really an hour and a half away.  34  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Yes, after we moved here    Robin used to live in Texas and now she  lives up in Belle Plaine, Kansas.  Belle Plaine.  She   s a school teacher up there  at Wichita Collegiate in geometry .  What does the future hold for the farm the next hundred years? What do  you envision?  Well, we have already started what I consider traditions, family  traditions. We had to start from scratch, of course, because we weren   t  family before. Every Fourth of July we have a celebration to celebrate  the birthday of our country. We started out kind of little. Phil is the  ringleader, and we do old fashioned games like toss the egg, and gunny  sack parades, and     Sack races.  We have no fireworks. We can   t stand to have fireworks our here, it is  too much of a fire hazard for one thing, plus the fact that I can   t stand  them. Anyway, we all eat, we have a big barbeque. And this past year  for the first time   and we   ll keep it up because it was so much fun   no  this was the second time, wasn   t it?  The second time.  Yeah, the second time. We march in the Crescent Fourth of July Parade.  Little town.  We make great big  cardboard  blue birds and we carry these big  bluebirds. (Laughs)  This is the Bluebird Farm, and this time we had, was it thirty?  Yes, at least, in the parade.  I think it was thirty-some people in the parade that comes to the party.  We have a big Fourth of July party out here.  It   s getting bigger. It   s sixty or seventy. Our girls     Each one of the girls invites their friends. (Laughter)  You can come. You   re welcome to come.  35  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  So now you guys have got an official  invite .  We   ll see you on the Fourth of July  You know how to get here   You   ll have a big time.  And our girls are both very good musicians, professional musicians in  addition to their day job. This is the pickin    porch over there, and we  have lots of music in the evenings.  We are talking about great musicians. Both of these girls are very  professional entertainers.  Both have entertained professionally in their early, early years.  This gal out here, she did Broadway shows in Nashville for years.  And traveled with many people that you would know.  She traveled with Marie Osmond for three years.  What is going to happen to the farm down the road?  Oh, you asked that a while ago.  You did ask that in your questionnaire. Our girls love the farm, both of  them do. They   d both like to live here. Amy has talked many, many  times about building them a house out here, but school is such a problem  out here. She teaches online for the University of Tennessee in  Murfreesboro. She could do it here, but his job is in Edmond. School for  little kids is just so difficult because you have to drive them in. There is  no bus. And they   re into all kinds of activities that are available close by.  So I don   t know, they love this place, and we are hoping that the little  girls will like it too.  I think there is a question mark to her question.  Oh yeah.  You do not know what your offspring     We don   t know if that is going to happen, we   re just hoping.     or your grandkids     36  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  Who knows? They may sell it.  If they take a liking to it, then it could be here fifty, a hundred years  from now.  Or they could sell it.  We haven   t any idea, but it is all paid for. Everything we did was cash.  If we didn   t have the money, we didn   t do it. That is the status of it. We  don   t really know.  We don   t know. But neither did Joella and Alfred.  Yes, see Joella and Alfred when they started    In fact, if they could  only     We sit here sometimes on the porch and say,    I wonder what Joella and  Alfred would say about this place if they were sitting here now?    They  would probably say,    My God  What   d they do?     (Laughter)  Or they may be proud.  Or they might love it.  You never know.  We think Aunt Pete would love it if she were here, and Uncle Russell.  They had such a hard life. Make it forty years milking those cows day  and night     Before we came here they didn   t have lawn mowers and stuff, so when  they mowed Uncle Russell would have a horse, or Grandpa would have  a horse. Have you ever seen a sickle? It has got a big long blade and it  goes down like this. And it goes back and forth, like this. It is six feet  long. That   s the way they mowed the yard. Well you can imagine, it  didn   t look like this. I am talking about the yard. If they saw it today  they would go,    Good Lord  How did you get this to looking so nice?     Is there anything else you want to share with us today before we go in,  that we haven   t asked you about?  It might come up as we walk through. Can you write and walk at the  same time?  We could, but we won   t be recording. Is there anything you want to  mention? We will be taking photographs.  37  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  Well, let me see. I   ll show you stuff inside and I   ll tell you a little bit  about it here. I am going to show you some pictures in there. In northern  Oklahoma, I think around Pawnee, there was a Miller Ranch that they  called the 101 Ranch. Have you heard about that?  Yes.  Every fall, the 101 Ranch, back in the teens,    20s, and    30s, had a  reunion and a roundup. Grandpa would go. Inside I   ve got two different  sets of pictures of 1921 and 1922, of all of that reunion. Twenty, fifty, a  hundred guys all in a row, and Will Rogers would go. We   ve got  pictures in there of Will Rogers and Grandpa. Will Rogers is sitting here  and Grandpa is standing right behind him. So that is a fun little story that  they used to do back in the    20s, back in those years. Will Rogers was  the neatest guy in the world. He was a part of our picture resume.  Another thing, we did preserve as much as we could in the house. This is  the original door to this porch. It is original.  That   s a hundred and twenty years old, that door.  But it was protected because it is kind of back in that corner there.  It is in that corner. Everything else rotted out.  Wow.  We had to get a different door for this because the original doors were  real narrow, but we have the original threshold. The kitchen was Aunt  Pete   s, so it   s old. The kitchen cabinets are very old. I had to get a new  counter top.  Pre-World War II.  The broom closet Phil and Jack had in the burn pile. I said,    Go get that  broom closet  Bring it back in here  It goes in this kitchen     (Laughter)  They brought it back and said,    You want that old thing?    I said,    Yeah,  I want that old thing      It would be one hundred years old. The floors are original. When we get  inside you   re going to see original floors. You will see the trim is  original. Oh, that is good, I am glad I remembered that. In one of your  questionnaires, it was about where does the wood come from. The  original house was built probably 1890. Grandpa added this addition in  probably 1901. The wood, whenever we took all the trim down   and  38  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  when you see the trim you will get a sense of big, wide trim, very fancy  wood trim in there   but we took the wood all down and took a hundred  years worth of paint off of it. There was blue, green, yellow, white, and  every color in the world had been painted on it. We scraped all that off.  On the back side of those big pieces of wood is    Mulhall Lumber  Company,    and it was started in 1889 when they had the first run. So, a  lot of the original wood came from Mulhall, and you know where  Mulhall is, between here and Stillwater. Of course, Mulhall is a tiny  little bird now. But anyway, that   s where a lot of the wood came from,  and maybe where all of it came from, but we do know the first part of  the house has actually got their names on it, on the back of the wood.  Did you just discover that within the restoration process?  Yes, oh yeah. We would not have known that except when we pulled off  all the trim and were putting in new drywall and taking out the lath and  plaster. When those planks came out there were twenty or thirty of them  out here. I spent days and days and days scraping off that old paint.  When I turned them over, here is  stamped  the    Mulhall Lumber  Company    on the back side of it.  Phil   s mother would share many memories. She died at the age of a  hundred and four, just recently. I   ve got some pictures over in the other  house I   ll show you of her. We had a celebration for the hundredth  birthday and it was our fiftieth anniversary, so we called it the  sesquicentennial party. (Laughs) But anyway, I   ll share some memories  that Phil   s mother had. She remembers sitting on this porch here when  she was a little girl and looking at that arbor. She swears   and you  know, I kind of believe she   s probably right   this porch was higher  because her feet would dangle down long because a little girl here, her  feet wouldn   t dangle.  The ground could have been lower.  So we think probably the dirt has blown in.  The ground could have been lower a hundred years ago.  It covered up all these rocks, and they were twelve inches below the  ground. She remembered sitting on the front porch, and watching the  sunset, and wishing she had a dress that color, you know, whatever it  was. Then she remembers the roses and the flowers that her dad   not  her mom, her dad   would plant leading out to the mailbox from the  front door.  This was a little paradise, even back in 1910. He was a very special     39  F. Macy  P. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  P. Macy  F. Macy  Nykolaiszyn  P. Macy  My goal with the yard and gardens was to try and replicate something  that he might have tried to do in his spare time. I know he didn   t have  much time for flowers, but then in those days neighbors would share  seed. If they had an extra cutting of daylily or something, or a root, they  would share that, so I do share with various neighbors. I couldn   t do it  all because it   s too much to try to find enough neighbors with that many  things to share. (Laughs)  When we get inside I am going to think of more things to give you. You  can   t record it, but that   s okay.  That   s okay, and we could make additions within the transcript, too.  Yes, you can do as you see fit.  And the cellar. Phil will want to show you the cellar. We do have a  storm shelter in the other house because I really didn   t want to run over  here and get in that dark cellar. (Laughter)  That   s a good story. My mother said when she was a little girl, when the  storms would come, Alfred and Joella   Grandma and Grandpa   would  take all the family down in the cellar and they   d go to sleep, the kids  would. Then when the storm blew over, well Grandma and Grandpa  would come back     And go to bed. (Laughs)     and she would wake up the next morning. She said,    I can   t tell you  how many times I have awakened in the morning and I   m down there in  the cellar with the other two kids.    There were two others then. (Laughs)  I   ll open that up and let you see it. It looks just like it did a hundred and  ten years ago.  We probably just bored you to death. (Laughs)  Oh, no  It is fascinating, actually. Phil and Frances, thank you so much  for sharing your stories of your family and your farm with us. We look  forward to taking the tour and taking some photographs. Thank you so  much.  Okay. You   re so welcome.  -------  -------
