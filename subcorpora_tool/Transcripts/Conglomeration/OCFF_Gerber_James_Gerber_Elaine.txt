 Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn. Also with me is Tanya Finchum. Today  is Thursday, March 21, 2013, and we   re in Kingfisher County,  Oklahoma, with James and Elaine Gerber with the Kremke-Gerber  Farm. This interview is part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families  Oral History Project. Thank you so much for joining us today.  It   s good to be here.  Well, we   re going to begin by learning a little bit more about your  family and the farm. Could you tell us how your family came to  Oklahoma?  John Kremke came down from Saint Cloud, Minnesota. We   ve got  records that show that he came over in about 1850s on the boat. Maybe  it   s more like 1860-70s. As I found, a lot of the immigrants would come,  and then they would move to an area where there were a lot of other  immigrants of like sources. I believe that they first settled somewhere in  Ohio. Then they moved on to Minnesota. All those conclaves were  either united by, like I say, region that they came from, religion,  whatever, but he came down from Saint Cloud, Minnesota, in about  1900. I can   t find a copy. I had an extra copy of the actual deed report.  He bought it from the guy who got it from the  land  run. As you know,  when you settled on the run, you had to improve it for six years, and you  actually went through the US Patent Office (haven   t figured out why) to  get the land grant.  The only other name, I think, was something like Crook or Cook. I can   t  remember exactly. The next name on the deed is John F. Kremke. That   s  my great-grandfather. He came down, and as far as I can tell from what  oral history I   ve gotten from my relatives, he improved the land. My  grandmother was born, I believe, in Saint Cloud in about 1896. When  she was about seven, which would have been about 1903, after he had  5  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  already kind of broke some ground, built a dugout   I   m not sure where  the dugout was. Nobody ever knew for sure, but my common sense  approach says,    I   d only dig one hole. I would dig my dugout where I   m  going to build my house.    The old house had a basement with old native  stone sides, not very secure because the foundation was kind of going  bad even in the   50s and   60s when I was a kid.  Anyway, he lived in the dugout, and the rest of the family came down on  the train about 1903. The house, I think, was probably built about that  time. I   ve got one living uncle. He thought it was built before 1900, but I  think Kremke built the house and it was probably 1901, 1902. That   s the  house you see on the painting, and I   ve got a better picture of it if you   d  like to see it. When they came down, Grandma, my grandmother Helen,  was about seven. I didn   t really know this until lately, but apparently  they were all Lutherans. I remember Grandma used to say her name was  actually Helena Maria Wilhelmina Kremke because most are given a  christening name as well as their middle name from their family. So  that   s how they came to own the land. He actually, he didn   t make the  run. He came down later and bought it from this other gentlemen.  And were they farmers?  Yes. Yes, he came and, you know, being from the old country, I   ve often  wondered,    Why did those people come over?    If you   ve seen some of  the boats they came over on, you   d have to be pretty desperate to get out  of a land where all of your relatives are, all your ancestors. What would  cause you to be so desperate that you would want to cross in a little boat  to a place you   ve never been before and try to make it on your own? It   s  just incredible. I had my theories about the old country. Because the  boundaries changed so rapidly, it was like you didn   t know if you were  in one country. The next day you might be in another country because  somebody won a war and changed the boundaries of the country.  At any rate, he came over here as a farmer. As you probably know, in  the 1890s when this land was first broken out, fallow, Kingfisher was,  like, the number one exporter of hard red winter wheat. Because it was  so fallow, you didn   t need fertilizer. It was all just, you know, buffalo-fertilized  and virgin soil, and we had huge crops. I think that   s probably  why those first farmers really made it pretty easy, but that was his main  occupation.  So in the early days, it was mostly wheat?  Yes. He had cattle, and I   m told that they even had their own fruit  orchard down here, probably mainly peaches, just north of where I   ve  got that loafing shed now. They were pretty self-sufficient. They had a  6  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  few milk cows, I   m sure, because even my grandfather milked enough to  keep the family going. What extra went to town to the creamery.  Well, in addition to the old home, what are some of the other early  structures on the property at the time?  Well, you can   t see it now, but when I was growing up, there was this  big, concrete   actually, just off the bumper of your car where the  driveway takes a deep dip, assume that that   s a wall. That was the back  wall of this trench-like structure. We always thought it was just a trench  silo because that was popular. You would throw your silage in there, let  it compost, and dig it out when you needed it. Come to find out, that was  the basement of the first barn. I always remember the sides. They didn   t  go straight up. At the top, they kind of went like that. (Gestures)  I recently talked to a lady at church who grew up in the house down  here, to see if she remembered any of the structure up there, because I  thought we   ve been to Europe enough that they have all these exposed  beams. The way the bottom was shaped, it was like,    Hmm, I wonder if  he built it like the old European barns.    But it was a trench silo. That  was the original basement of the house because, like most Europeans,  I   m told that they lived above and had the animals down below. I don   t  know that for a fact, but that   s kind of the supposition, that that was the  actual first homestead.  Then while they were living there, then they probably built the house  that sat where you see the white saltbox-looking house. The other  structures are the windmill. I   ve often thought if I was a  water  witcher  and I told him to dig here, and you dig for forty days to go down fifty-five  feet and you don   t find water, I   d go find the witcher. (Laughter) It  wouldn   t be too healthy for him. Anyway they got water. It   s a fifty-five-  foot windmill. It takes a pretty good breeze to pull water that deep.  The jet rod and everything causes weight and, of course, the water, so it  takes a pretty good wind to get the windmill to turn. The post orchard  that we   ve seen out there, you can find one place where they harvested  one or two posts, but the rest of it nobody ever harvested because fence  posts became cheap enough. It   s a lot of work, cutting those bodarks.  And they last a long time, too, don   t they, once they   re in the ground?  Untreated, they last thirty years. Treated, they last longer than that. Yes,  bodark posts last thirty years just untreated. You can   t beat that.  Were they primarily farmers, or did they have jobs outside the farm?  The first family, Kremkes, that was my great-grandfather and his  7  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  children, which were my grandmother and great-uncle and -aunts, as far  as I know, they just mainly had jobs here, you know, keeping the place  going.  When they would take their product to market would they go to Dover or  Kingfisher, or do you know?  I   m told it was usually Kingfisher. Kingfisher probably had a creamery.  It   s kind of interesting, Dover was actually as thriving as Kingfisher  early. If you see maps early on, there was a railroad bridge over the  Cimarron here, but there wasn   t a highway bridge. The actual highway  went across what we call the Loyal Road, and so people would come  from Kingfisher. I remember some of these corners. You know what a  correction line is? These correction lines would have these huge banks,  people would go around them, like at Daytona. I often wondered,    What  is the deal?    Well, that used to be a main road because you would make  these correction lines and then get back on a main highway to get over  the Cimarron Bridge out here and go to Dover to shop. The creamery  was mainly at Kingfisher, and they, of course, had to haul it in by horse  and wagon which took all day.  How many children did Kremke have?  I was thinking about that. I think there were five girls and one boy.  So from that point, take us through how it came to be in your hands.  Okay. One of Kremke   s daughters was Helen. Again, I got a feeling that  John Kremke did well because by 1917   (to Elaine) you want to check  the date of Grandma Helen and W. D.  Gerber    s wedding? I think it was  1917, John Kremke moved to town. Having all girls, yes it would   ve  been nice to give everybody part of the farm, but they probably had  husbands because two of them married Harrisons, which had a lot of  land and holdings around here. Was it   17?  Yes.  So by 1917, John Kremke   s moving to town. He   s taking it easy.  (Laughter) My grandfather, W. D., marries Helen, and they buy the  farm, basically. In fact, I think I ran across that deed one time. They  didn   t get it for free. They bought it from John Kremke. So that was my  grandmother. Well, then my father and his brother   my dad was born in  1923 in the house down here. His brother is five years younger. I   m  assuming he was born here, too, and so this was their family home. Dad  was born and raised. In fact, he told me one time, this viaduct up here on  the highway, he was about ten or twelve. He said they were building it.  8  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  They didn   t have the main road at that time. Again, that headed for  Cimarron, and they built the bridge then to go along with that highway.  They were actually digging and building the viaduct when he was about  twelve. That would   ve been about 1934,    35. That was how it came to  my hands because Dad inherited a half. He bought the other half from  his brother. It was all in one package as a 160. Then when he passed  away, it passed all to my mom, and then we bought it out of the  inheritance, basically. I   d always dreamed about building up here. It   s  rough, let me tell me you. (Laughs) That wind is terrible.  Well, your father, where did he go to school?  Well, he and his brother both went to Dover about the first ten years, but  then they went two years at Kingfisher, which had a better curriculum.  They had physics and chemistry. Dad went to OU from high school in  Kingfisher. He graduated in 1940, and he went about two or three years  at OU. He said the worst thing he ever did was drop out of college  because he was drafted like that. (Snaps) It was 1943 or so,    44 I guess.  My uncle, five years younger, wasn   t in the right age range to be drafted,  went to OU, and came out a chemical engineer. He got his physics and  stuff there at Kingfisher, so that was a little better education. About nine  or ten years at Dover, and then they transferred to Kingfisher. I   m not  sure what the transfer laws were then. If you had a car, you went  wherever you wanted to, I guess. (Laughs)  That was my next question. How did they get there?  I   m not sure. I think probably they did have an old car or a pickup.  So he spent his youth on the farm?  Yes he did.  Did he ever tell you stories of his chores?  No, not really. No, he didn   t talk much about that.  When he came back from the service, what did he end up doing?  Well, he bought a small farm. He was married at that time. He married  right before he went overseas in    44 , September of    44. I didn   t really  appreciate this until just lately. He got over in the European theater  about a month before the Battle of the Bulge. The Battle of the Bulge  pitted, apparently, more soldiers in one concentrated area than any of the  other battles. He was green when he went to the Battle of the Bulge.  9  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Then VE Day came in May of    45, so he was only in a short time, but he  was subjected to, apparently, battlefield trauma. He did tell me a story  that he basically found   it sounds like he was caught in a mortar  barrage. Now, with all the guys coming back, girls too, from  Afghanistan and Iraq with concussion injuries, traumatic brain injuries,  we understand a lot more what my dad went through.  He was a radio man. He had to hang wire for communication, so he was  perfect sniper bait, which would make a guy a little nervous. Then he  was caught in a mortar barrage, and they found him wandering behind  the lines. The 101  101st Airborne Division  picked him up. He was  with the Eighty-Fifth Infantry. They got him hooked back up with the  Eighty-Fifth, and came home already married. I found the deed, too,  where they bought a little place.  In fact, if you take a line and draw it three miles from this corner up here  and then duck to the right, that   s where he bought the farm, about  twenty-seven acres, right in the bend of Turkey Creek outside of Dover.  He farmed. He helped his dad farm. Because he was a veteran, he took  all the classes, you know, the extra conservation and agriculture and  everything that they offered. Then there was also an opening for a civil  service job as a postmaster at Dover, and so he was commissioned. He  was commissioned as postmaster on my birthday, June 10,    49. That was  his main source of income, but we still farmed a little bit, still farmed  over here, rented ground, did the usual stuff.  How did the crops change over here once your grandfather and your  father started working the land?  You know, that I don   t have much knowledge of. Knowing and  supposing from what Dad   s habits was, it was mainly hard red winter  wheat. We didn   t really have enough cattle that we would raise cattle  feed. They had native pasture that would carry them most winters. We  would put up hay and buy hay. We just didn   t have the equipment to put  up our own hay.  So did you grow up in town or     A little twenty-seven-acre farm outside of Dover.  And so when you would have family gatherings, a holiday celebration,  where would you go?  Usually Grandma Helen   s. Grandma Helen lived here until 1951,    51 or     52. Because my dad and my mom were living in Dover, he was helping  Grandpa Walter Delbert Gerber farm this. He became ill with what  1 0  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  turned out to be, probably, acute myelogenous leukemia, and he lived  for a year or so and died. Then the plan, I think, had been for my uncle  to come back and take over the farm, but being a chemical engineer, you  don   t need that to be a farmer. (Laughs) There were much more lucrative  places, so he went to Galveston to the Union Carbide. Grandmother  didn   t sell the land, but she sold all the equipment. As a kid, I can  remember all the people standing around, looking at the equipment. I  didn   t really understand, but I remember all of the equipment laid out,  and they basically had an auction and sold off tractors and drills and  stuff like that.  So as a little boy you would spend some time up here on the farm. What  were some of your favorite things to do?  Well, I was so young when he passed away and Grandmother moved to  town in    51 or    52, that   s really about the only memory I have there.  Then when we   d go visit her in town for holidays and stuff.  Okay.  I am told, though, that my Grandfather Kremke for Christmas would  play the accordion. I guess all Germans play the accordion. (Laughs) My  grandmother and three other sisters would vocalize, and one other sister  (Anna, I think) played the piano, and so they made their own music  celebrations for Christmas and stuff.  And where are they buried?  They   re all virtually buried in Kingfisher Cemetery. Let   s see. John and  Augusta Kremke, Helen and W. D., and my mother and father, some of  her sisters. One of them went to Illinois, and she   s buried up there. I  think the other three are buried here, and her brother. That would   ve  been my great-uncle, young John Kremke.  This is a very unique location. Could you describe some of the features  of where we are right now?  Oh, I think it   s great as far as history. We even have an article from an  old magazine that they used to put out in Oklahoma City. Basically,  down about our front gate, the Fort Reno Trail   the Chisholm Trail, as  you know, split. One branch went to Darlington to take cattle to the  Indian reservation to be slaughtered for their purposes. That trail then  curved back and met up with the Chisholm Trail, and the Reno Trail  because, again, they probably didn   t have any cattle, it was a smaller  trail. They just had a couple of buck boards and stuff.  1 1  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  In fact, my uncle said one time when they   d demonstrate new  equipment, they would bring out tractors and plows. They demonstrated  one down here, and they dug up an old musket that had obviously fallen  off somebody   s horse. (Laughs) Anyway, the Reno Trail, it looks like it  goes down to the river at a different place than the Chisholm Trail. The  Chisholm Trail actually crosses about two and a half, three miles east of  here, is the way everybody tells me.  They met up in a place in Dover where I was born and raised, basically,  called Red Fork Station. Red Fork Station   s got an interesting history  because there were people there already with trading posts, and that was  before the opening. The cattle trails were, like, 1870 to 1875. It wasn   t  very many years, but it was before the opening, so people who already  had businesses here had to get out. Nothing could lay claim. They didn   t  own it. Then they opened, and these people, they might try to get back to  their same premises. Red Fork Trading Station was right there in Dover,  and that   s basically where the trails met up and then headed north to  Caldwell, Kansas. We   re not that far from the Chisholm Trail. We are  right on the Reno Trail.  Where I was raised, on that twenty-seven acres, is only about half a  mile, three quarters of a mile from the Red Fork Station, so I was on the  Chisholm Trail, basically. People think the Chisholm Trail is a one-lane  road. No. (Laughter) Cattle don   t herd that way. Sometimes it might be a  mile wide. Most of the time they probably tried to keep it to about an  eighth or a quarter of a mile wide. Probably where I played on the creek  behind our house at Dover was a place where the cowboys camped out  because there was water there usually. In fact, that   s probably one of the  most steady water supplies in that whole two-square-mile area.  I haven   t checked the authenticity, but I found an old bean pot. I go  down, found buffalo bones. That   s another thing. They probably had a  buffalo jump. I started digging up buffalo skulls a few years ago off the  place in Dover. Anyway, this place is just full of history. Before we  broke in this ground up here, there were buffalo wallows. Buffalos  would just kind of start gnawing in the dirt, you know, pawing in it.  Then they   d get down and roll their shoulder, and before you knew it  there were huge, about fifteen-, twenty-feet-diameter, shallow puddles  where they would take a dust bath or a mud bath to keep the flies and  stuff off of them. Now that they   ve broke that ground out, you can   t see  those, but there still may be a couple down on this pasture land north of  us on the old Boeckman place.  Can you talk about the elevation here?  Well, I   ve always been told that this was the tallest place in Kingfisher  1 2  Finchum  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  County. There used to be a geophysical marker out here, but it   s not here  now. That   s what we were told. I was told as a kid. I look around on the  horizon, and I see other places that are almost as high. I   d have to get a  topographical map to see, but that   s what I was always told, that this was  one of the highest places in the county, or the highest place. Now, if you  get on top of my roof, I   m almost sure it   s the tallest place in the county.  (Laughter)  And the wind always blows.  Yes. I had a friend come up and stood on my porch, and he said    This is  the most unlikely place you   d ever need a ceiling fan.    (Laughter) We  were building, and I thought,    I want something to kind of stir   .    We  don   t have to worry about that but once a year maybe.  It wasn   t our best decision was it?  No. (Laughs)  Can you talk about the 1906 train wreck?  Yes. It   s interesting because my grandparents, Helen, my grandmother,  and great-grandfather and great-grandmother were living here at the  time, and I   ve even got a recording. Let   s see. She died in    81, and I  think I recorded this in about    79,    78. I had it on a cassette. I know that  they can go bad, so I finally got it transferred to a CD. I had to bait her.  She   s not going to just come out and tell this story, so I had to bait her  with a lot of these questions and stuff.  The end result is, apparently it happened at eight o   clock, eight thirty in  the morning on September 18 of 1906. It had been raining a lot, and she  even says on the tape that her sister Amelia saw the train. She was  probably just kind of staring out the window, and saw the train go in.  I   m sure there were a lot of trees because remember the highway bridge  wasn   t there, only a railroad bridge. There was no right-of-ways and  stuff that were kept clean, so I   m sure there were trees on both sides. She  said she saw the train go into the trees, or go in, and never come out.  That   s when she, according to my grandmother   s story, told her dad,  which was John Kremke, and took him and young John and went down  there to kind of start investigating. I don   t have any first-person reports.  I don   t have anything else of what he saw when he got down there, but  because they were here, they saw that. I can   t remember what day of the  week that was. I think it was a Friday, but the following Sunday, after  church, everybody is out here rubbernecking (Laughs), trying to figure  out what happened, and looking. They   re on buckboards and surries. She  1 3  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  said the place was just congested with all the people coming out after  church the Sunday after the wreck.  And the train still comes through doesn   t it, or comes near the property?  Yes, in fact I think that   s kind of cool because I know a hundred years  ago, my great-grandfather was listening to trains go by, and now here I  am hearing the trains. According to the book, the National, I guess,  Transportation Safety Board, the Chicago, Rock Island  and Pacific  Railroad  rebuilt a trestle across this river in something like twelve days.  They said,    Gosh, it can   t be safe.    The first train that tried to pass, the  sheriff went out and stopped.    You   re not going to cross the trestle  because we don   t know if it   s safe.    Built a bridge in ten or twelve days,  (Laughs) and here it takes us years to build roads. Anyway, apparently  this accident and the way they tried to rebuild it so fast had something to  do with a national movement to make sure that highways and bridges  were safe. At least that   s what the book says, that it stimulated Congress  and everybody involved to say,    Hey, we   ve got to have somebody to  inspect these, got to make sure the passengers are safe.    I thought that  was pretty interesting.  Any stories of hobos coming through or     No, no.  No one from the farm, hopping on the train and going into town and  back? (Laughter)  No, no. It   s kind of interesting to me how the other side of my family got  down here, W. D. They were in Missouri. They were around the  Mansfield/Branson area. His family, that would have been my Great-  Grandfather Gerber, was Sam Gerber, and they were over in Missouri in  about 1903. I think they   re listed on the 1900 census over there.  Everybody except my grandfather and his brother, Sam Gerber, went to  Canada to homestead in about 1910. I figured my great-grandfather was  like fifty-five years old and went to Saskatchewan. I   ve got a friend  that   s from Canada, and he says,    Oh, man, that   s one rough province.     (Laughs)  So at fifty-five, my great-grandfather is going up to Canada to break out  sod. It   s like,    Guy, couldn   t you semi-retire?    Anyway, W. D. and Sam  came thisaway. I don   t know if they thought it was because of the run,  but business was booming. They were actually muleskinners, is what  they called them. They were horse trainers, and I learned later that my  great-uncle Sam, he preferred mules. He preferred working with mules,  and my grandfather preferred working with horses. That   s how they  1 4  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  even got down here. I don   t know exactly how he and Grandma met, but  I   m sure he probably was looking to settle down. (Laughs)  Church, maybe?  Yes.  Any ideas of how the family weathered the 1930s?  Again, John Kremke had moved to town in   17, and by 1927 and 1929  both he and his wife had died in Kingfisher. That means W. D. and  Helen and my dad   I remember him telling me about building the road  down there in the   30s, but I didn   t really get a lot of stories of the  Depression. It may be that everybody was supported, one day seemed  like the other. Didn   t have a whole lot. Had to scrape for your food. If  you survived, that was the main thing. If you had a roof over your head,  food in your belly, water to drink, that was about all you expected to do.  You really didn   t expect to get much more ahead than that.  Did they participate in soil conservation efforts later?  You know, this is what kind of burns me a little bit. The guys who built  my road were old-timers, and they had to help build terraces on this  place in the   60s, long before the government said they would help pay  for it. I can remember standing in ravines down here that were over my  head because of the erosion. You can see, I   m on a 30 percent grade  here, and when you run cattle, you compact the soil. They have their  own little path that they take every day, and that washes even worse.  They took money out of their pocket, and Grandpa got a lease of oil on  this land. He made a lot of improvements, an indoor bathroom in the  house and all that, and I imagine he used some of that money to build  some of the terraces. But it was like that was common-sense farming.  You either let it wash away, or you did something about it. The people  who were unwise and let the stuff wash, now gets compensated by a  government program to build the terraces they should   ve built in the first  place. Don   t get me started on that. (Laughter)  How do you really feel? No, I   m just kidding. (Laughter)  Well, you know, it   s like people who use their brains and spend their  money to protect their land are not rewarded. People who are dumb  enough to try and cultivate a 30-degree grade and see it wash down to  the river, they get compensated by the government to build. You tell me  where the sanity is in that.  1 5  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  So there   s oil on the property?  There   s small stripper wells.  And so approximately what year did they start digging? Any idea?  Oh, that   s a good question. I think he leased the land before he died.  That was in about    51 or    52. He made improvements to the house. That  probably would   ve been the late   40s. They leased it, but I   m not sure  they ever drilled on it for several years because I can almost remember  the two wells and when they came into production. They were never  barn-burners, so that was probably early   50s, mid-  50s.  But enough for them to notice the difference in their income situation?  No?  I don   t think so because we didn   t see much difference. (Laughs)  There   s a cell tower?  Yes.  Is that also on your property?  Yes.  How did that come to be?  Well, when the cell technology started, they came to my dad. That was  put up probably   he passed away in    96, so it was probably   70s when  cells first started coming out. The guy approached him, and I happened  to be over at the house. I said,    Well, you know that   s the tallest place in  the county. That   d be a great place for a cell tower.    So they rented it,  and they continue to rent it. They put more services on it. That   s  probably going to be a permanent source of finances to pay the taxes on  this place into perpetuity. (Laughter) We may not make any money, but  we   ll be able to keep it in the family because it pays the taxes.  And you get a good signal.  Yes. Well, I can   t really   not all the time. (Laughs)  We   re supposed to, through AT T.  You would think, but that   s not the way it works sometimes.  1 6  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Well, tell me about some of the improvements y   all have made to the  land since it   s been in your hands.  Probably haven   t been much except keeping the renters. (Laughs)  Well, tell me how you decided to live here on the land.  Well, mainly because of the location, the view. It   s family land. I believe  that   s what makes the Midwest different: we have anchors. We have  relatives. My family is buried in Kingfisher. My wife   s family is buried  in Okarche. I mean, we have anchors to this area, and it keeps you  stable. It   s a place to come home to, and it   s just something   I think part  of it was family values, and the other was view. We weren   t that far  from Dover. When we built this house, my mom was still alive at the  place in Dover, so I would run over there and do some things. It was just  real handy to be here and there. It was kind of a combination of factors.  Outside of the new house, what are the other structures that are still on  the property?  We have the barn. I told you about the original barn. The one that   s still  standing was built in 1947. Again, it may have been some of his lease  money that helped him build a new barn. Again, he liked horses. There  was a loafing shed that blew down, actually about the time we were  building up here. It was huge. It was, gosh, probably eighteen feet wide  by something like thirty-six feet long, gabled roof, and it was a neat  structure because we used to work cattle out of there. It blew down, so I  had to replace it with this loafing shed that   s brand new.  The chicken house is old. The chicken house, when I went to try to re-do  it, inside you could tell the stem walls were out away from the slab floor.  It was almost like when they poured the stem walls that the forms gave  way, and you had this big ol    gap. Well, I   m enough history nut that I  don   t want to tear things down. I want to try to rebuild them. I bumped  that stem wall with my tractor one day, and it gave. I thought,    Hmm,  that   s fixable,    so I wedged it over and put big ol    buttresses or pylons  there to hold the stem wall. Then when I get back and look at it, I   ve  actually over-corrected. It   s not exactly level like it was. It yawed one  way, and now it yaws the other way.  When they built it, I think the forms gave, and they just left it that way  because I could see on the inside, they kind of put a little fudge factor in  there to make the stud wall go straight up. Anyway, it probably wasn   t a  1900 structure, but it was probably built fairly early. Like I said, the  house was bulldozed down because it got in ill-repair and kids were  coming out here and partying. The sheriff warned my dad that if  1 7  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  somebody got hurt it would be on his shoulders, so he just had it  bulldozed and burned.  How many ponds are on the property?  Well, only two. It   s kind of interesting. I think part of it is we haven   t  run cattle up here to compact the soil, so after all your winter freezes and  thaws, the water just soaks in much better. We haven   t had water in the  ponds for probably two or three years. They   ve been dry. Of course, the  drought didn   t help, but they were actually dry before the drought.  So what   s going on on the land today?  Wheat. They haven   t run cattle. We offered to come fix up the fences,  electric fence and stuff like that, but the farmer who is renting it is just  not interested in having cattle that far away. He   s got enough irons in the  fire that he didn   t want to run cattle. It   s just wheat right now, wheat and  gardening.  And is it still 160, or has it expanded over time?  One sixty.  Okay.  Original boundaries.  Is the garden in the original place?  No, no. This is a new place. Not a good place so far, either. (Laughter) I  still can   t get tomatoes to grow up here, but I have a soil test this year, so  I   m going to have tomatoes. (Laughs)  Any idea on bookkeeping during the early days?  No, no I don   t. I get the feeling that John Kremke was probably pretty  secretive. Wouldn   t want to call him paranoid, but probably a lot of  immigrants were that way. They just kind of kept everything close to the  vest. Their books were probably in their overall pocket, and that was it.  Have you walked over every acre, at least, of the property?  Yes, basically. Basically. My uncle said that there used to be springs on  the place, and so I keep looking for natural dips. Hopefully, without the  compaction, we   ll have more water soaking in. I pray that one of these  days the springs will start running again. That would probably be fresh  1 8  Finchum  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  water, good water.  Or the wind will keep it dry. So in your youth you lived on the twenty-seven  acres. Is it still in your possession, too?  Yes, I was fortunate enough to have some money ahead, and so I bought  it as my folks   kind of reverse mortgage. They had money to do a little  bit more on it and not worry about finances as we bought it over about  ten years. I   ve got some pear trees over there. Did have apple, but I   ve  lost most of those with that last drought.  How long was your father a postmaster?  From    49 until   this is one of those things I couldn   t understand.    Dad,  why would you take a promotion and go to the rural route?    From    49 to     63 he was postmaster. From    63 until he retired in    79 he was a rural  route carrier. Of course rural route carriers, it   s more intense, but you got  off earlier. You started at seven, you ran your route, and if you could get  in at one or two   and it was probably less callback hassle than the  postmaster.  How many miles was his route?  About seventy-some, all rural. I think he took what was Route Two, east  out of Dover, for the first eight or nine years, and then he wound up  carrying, I think it was Route One out west toward Loyal.  Did he do anything unusual while he was delivering mail other than just  deliver it?  Well, you know this is something I didn   t really understand. They would  have postal inspectors come in, and I know it always keyed him up  because that post inspector would sit in the back seat of his car. I don   t  know what they did if they had a pickup, but he would actually ride the  route and time him. You didn   t have time to make friends and shoot the  breeze. You were on a schedule. I know it really tore him up. It really  caused a lot of anxiety when the postal inspector would come. You hear  the term    going postal   ? (Laughter) Now I kind of understand why.  Like I say, he kept a small farm. We would have wheat, and our FFA  projects were either hogs, sheep, or cattle. He had small projects. In fact,  he and I would usually work this. I rented this area when I was in high  school for FFA, and I put wheat on it. He did get active in Scouts about  the time we were in Scouts, and we went to Kingfisher for a while. Went  to Hennessey for several years. He was active. He was also active in the  Masons. I think they had even an Elks chapter there.  1 9  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Finchum  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  My mom   you   ve got to remember in a small town, who pays for the  streetlights? My mom would actually go through the businesses and the  cafes and collect money for streetlight funds so they could keep the  streetlights on. They were both active outside their work. Mom was  clerk at the post office, so when Dad needed off, all he had to do was  call his wife and say,    I need you to come up here for two hours and  work while I go over to the farm and chase cattle,    or whatever.  That was convenient.  It was  It was almost mandatory. He could   ve had other clerks, but they  wouldn   t have come in at the drop of a hat.  Was she involved with homemaker clubs?  No, Eastern Star, she was kind of active in that. They enjoyed going  dancing on Saturday night. They grew up in the Big Band era, and they  loved to go to places and dance. Socially, they were always looking for a  place to go on Saturday night. As far as other organizations, like I say,  the streetlight fund. She also worked part-time at cafes. She waitressed  before she got to be a clerk in the post office, and so she waitressed part-time  after that. When she got older, she made   all the time she was  going to the nursing homes to visit. She lost her mom. She lived back in  Tennessee, and she always felt that she didn   t have a chance to be with  her mom, so she visited all the elderly people in the nursing home. They  loved it. She loved it.  Do you remember any interactions with county agents?  No, not really, (Laughter) unless you call the game ranger an agent.  (Laughter) No, I know that Dad probably availed himself of all those  courses when he came back from war. By the time he was in the post  office, we were in FFA. We had our FFA instructors, so we probably  didn   t have much. Like I say, they   d already built the terraces. There  wasn   t a need for that, so I   m not aware of a lot of exposure to the   .  Game rangers, yes, but not other agents.  Why would the game rangers come around?  Oh, you know, they just had this nose for trouble. I   ll never forget, we  were headed out to Loyal   I mean, one of the two times that my dad and  my brother and I got to go hunting at all, we were heading to Loyal. We  happened to pass a game ranger. We didn   t have guns showing or  anything. There   s a place we used to own northeast of Loyal, way out  there, and before we could pull into that place to go hunting, he pulled in  2 0  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  right behind us. How did he know? Doesn   t he have something else  better to do? I mean, we were all hunting on family land. There was no  problem with it, but it was like   . (Laughs)  Where did you and your brother go to school?  We went to Dover. I graduated there.  And then what did you do after you graduated?  Went to OSU and was in general ag for   I   d have probably graduated  general ag. I didn   t have any guidance as what to do. My brother, three  years older than me, saved money to go to college, so all I knew was you  work in the summer, save money to go to college.    What are you going  to do?       I don   t have any idea.    They said    Take some general courses.  Get your English and stuff out of the way.    I was just thinking about this  last night. One of my acquaintances over there, either a guy from El  Reno or Okarche, he said one time, he said,    You ought to get into  physiology.    I don   t know why he even said that, but I was good at my  courses. I can   t remember exactly, but I had like a 3.86 or something. I  had a four point one semester. I could   ve had a four point the next  semester, but I failed to write one paper that would   ve got me an A.  (Laughs). Anyway, it was like a 3.96 or something for that semester.  I didn   t have any trouble with studies. The guy said,    Hey, why don   t  you think about physiology,    so I went and talked to physiology and  junked my major. What I didn   t know was that most of those people  were pre-med. As I go to check out, all I know is I   m getting married  August of    71. In January    71, not graduated until May, I   m looking for  a job. Seventy-one was a terrible year for jobs. I mean, I hit the  pavement everywhere. I remember interviewing with Dr.  Petar   Alaupovic at OMRF  Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation  to do  anything in medical. He   s just retired, still looking for apolipoprotein A  and what it does for us, or against us.  Anyway, I knew I was getting married. I go to check out in, like, April,  and my physiology guy, (I   ll never forget Jerry Hurst, PhD in  physiology, great, great instructor, difficult but very good) he says,     Where   s your med school application?    I said,    I don   t have any  money.    He said,    That   s not the deal. You get in, and you get loans.    I  thought,    I got to get a job. I   m getting married.    See, in med school  what you do is you apply when you   re basically getting out of college to  get in from May to August. Then you start med school.  Well, I was already a year late, so this October after we got married in  August, I slide my application under the door on a Saturday after a  2 1  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Finchum  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Friday deadline. They were not impressed. (Laughter) They did call me  for an interview, but I didn   t get in. The next year, I got it in there when  I was supposed to. I got an early acceptance then, so in    73 I started  medical school.  I had one year of nursing school left when we got married.  Yes. Yes, we lived downtown not too far from Saint Anthony   s  Hospital. Then when I started med school, we lived there a couple of  years. Bad part of town now. Then in    73, (Stephanie was a year old)    72  maybe, we moved. She was born November    72, so it was about March  of    73. We moved out to     Fifty-second and Portland.     around Deaconess Hospital...  I worked at Deaconess.     and went to med school. Did a year of internship, came out to  Kingfisher, opened a solo practice. A year later in    79 went into practice  with a group in Okarche. That group has dwindled to where I   m back in  solo practice now, since, what,    04.  Do you make house calls?  Yes, yes he does.  I have. I have. You can   t make your overhead and make house calls.  Okarche used to have a hospital until    93, and it was a joke because I  would go by and see this elderly lady. Oh, what a jewel. This lady was  blind from glaucoma. She cared for her elderly uncle. What was his first  name?  It was Carl.  Carl, who was a World War I veteran who hated Nixon. (Laughs)  That   s all he talked about.  I think he was exposed to gas, or he had friends that were exposed.  Anyway, we would talk about those days. I would go see her after he  passed away. I would go down and see her, and she was in a flood  district of Kingfisher. At least two or three times when I made the house  call, she was sick enough to go to the hospital. We would lock up the  house, (she didn   t have any pets or anything) make sure the heat was     2 2  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Finchum  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  and we would put her in my Volvo station wagon. I would pull in front  of the hospital and we would admit her. (Laughs)  You would make house-calls with our kids in the   .  The nurses accused me of just, kind of, picking up people off the street  and bringing them to the hospital. (Laughs)  Yes, well and then we went out to     We used to go to the Nices.     Nices, and we   d take the kids with us.  Clyde was blind from diabetes. I   d love to be able to do nothing but  house calls, but you can   t make your overhead that way. Cost is too  expensive, malpractice. You couldn   t make it by. I mean, I love it, but  it   s time consuming. You spend a lot more time than you should, but it   s  great.  You really know your patients?  Oh, yes     Very rewarding.     and he still makes house calls, and nursing home calls. Anybody that  calls, we take care of them.  I can   t remember the very last house call I made. Like I say, you have to  be careful because you spend a lot of time, and     They like to talk, too.  Yes.  And how many children do you have?  We have three. Stephanie, who   s a CPA with InterBank.  She just turned forty.  Joel is a fireman at Norman. Lives at Piedmont. Jacob is a lighting  designer down in Dallas. In fact, one of his big projects was the Dallas  Convention Center where the lights chase themselves around.  2 3  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  E. Gerber  He did all the inside.  He had a big deal to do with that. And then we lost a little boy at  eighteen months from epilepsy. He was our second child. Born in    76,  and we lost him in    78.  You   d just got out of med school.  He   s buried in   yes. In fact, we had just moved. I   d had a surgery  residency. We do rotations on a monthly basis.  You were in the ER I think.  I was just starting the ER. I think I   d just left cardiology, I think it was.  In that week, (I had a week of vacation) we moved to Kingfisher, lock,  stock, and barrel. And I do mean lock, stock, and barrel, because   it  was   in a stock trailer. (Laughs)  It looked like The Grapes of Wrath going down the street. (Laughs)  We   d just moved in. Our little boy was having seizures, and he was  having fever. I didn   t have my license, so I took him up to the local  emergency room twice in about three days. Then he died at home,  actually the Monday that I was supposed to start my ER rotation. So that  was our welcoming to Kingfisher.  Well, looking at the farm and this 160, what do you hope happens to the  land in the next one hundred years? I don   t know if any of your children  have expressed interest in maybe coming back home?  We have the son that   s a firefighter. He loves the land and hunting and  fishing and that type of stuff. When he has days off, he brings up the  girls (this is his two daughters) here. I have high hopes that he will be  able to come and stay here, live here, to work on, and keep it in the  Gerber family.  Yes, that   d be our hopes but, like I say     Who knows. Jacob won   t come back.     we   re not going to be here. (Laughter)  It   s for them to figure out.  Yes, exactly, as long as we have the mortgage paid before we go.  (Laughter).  2 4  Finchum  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  E. Gerber  And the cell towers here to pay the taxes.  That   s exactly right. (Laughs)  We actually built this house with a lot of handicap stuff because at that  point our kids were still having kids, and we didn   t know what   they  may have a challenged child, and they may need the facilities. When we  built this, all of our parents were still   but one. My dad was gone, but  the other three    and so we built it. We   ve got a shower that you can roll  a wheelchair into.  This is our retirement home. (Laughs)  We   ve got a tub that we can get a lift and get people in and out of the tub  if we needed to. We kind of built it with those things in mind, and  hopefully one of the kids would feel anchored to the land enough they   d  want to come back. They certainly enjoy four-wheeling and things like  that. When it comes to work, that   s different. (Laughter)  Well, is there anything else you   d like to add that we haven   t spoken  about today, haven   t touched upon?  We   d like to get the new chicken house.  Yes.  Every spring is another spring with no chickens. I   d love to have  chickens, my own eggs, but we have a lot of coyotes out here.  Really?  Oh, yes, and I   m not going to run a Kentucky Fried Chicken for the  coyotes, so it   s got to be very secure. I   d like to do that.  I   d like to have more livestock, but no matter how good your fences are,  cattle always get out. My job as a physician, I can   t just pick up and say     Elaine, here, see these people. I got to go chase cattle.    That doesn   t  work, so until I have a few more hours off, I don   t see us running the  livestock. These horses down here are actually some friends   , and they  pay a little rent to keep their horses here. I   d like to be more active, have  a better garden for sure. (Laughs)  Maybe in retirement?  Yes, in our retirement years we can have chickens.  2 5  J. Gerber  E. Gerber  J. Gerber  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gerber  And, like I say, as far as little things that have gone through my head, I   d  love to have foreign visitors over here because I think a lot of them,  especially Germans, seem to be interested in the Oklahoma history  especially. We   ve got bedrooms downstairs. Sooner or later if we had  horses or something, that would really make an impact, but just sight-seeing,  seeing the Chisholm Trail, the Chisholm Trail Museum in  Kingfisher. I   m biased, of course, because I think so much of the history  of this area. I think maybe this is where Oklahoma has kind of missed  the boat. Everybody   s got    sight-seeing this, sight-seeing that.    Cripple  Creek, Colorado, if you   ve been up there, they   ve got buses, and they  tell the history right on the bus. It just keeps you enthralled. We could do  the same thing, but, you know, we have casinos. (Laughter)  Well, we could drive buses by the casinos.  I would like to be a part of that, maybe, the tourism trade. I think that   s  something we need to push statewide.  Well, we definitely appreciate your time today and giving us a little  glimpse into your farm here.  I hope I didn   t bore you. (Laughter)  -------  -------
