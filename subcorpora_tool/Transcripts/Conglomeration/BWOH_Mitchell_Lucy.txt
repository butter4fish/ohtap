Lucy Miller Mitchell:
Good morning, Mrs. Mitchell.
Good morning, Cheryl, may I call you Cheryl?
Please, please do. You said that you wanted to start off by talking about your family; and we'd love to hear about your family very, very much.
Well, the earliest stories about my family were gained from conversations with a great-grandmother, who was born in 1816 and lived to be ninety-four. At the time of this close relationship with this great-grandmother, I was about five years old. She had come to live with her daughter, who was my grandmother from Atlanta, Georgia. Since my great-grandmother had arthritis, she could not get around very well, so it gave her lots of time to sit and tell stories to this great-grandchild. She liked to tell about the stories which her mother told to her about the beginnings of our family. It seems that her mother, whose name I cannot recall now, was brought over from Africa as a child and was sold to a slave master who had an adjoining plantation to George Washington's. This was in Virginia. Because she told this great-grandmother of mine how she could remember gathering with all the slaves on this plantation and watching this man ride off to take charge of an army, and that his name was George Washington; we know that he was going at that time to take care of the Continental Army. Some years later, this adolescent who'd had this experience was given to the daughter of her slave master as a personal maid at the time of her marriage.
This was at the time of the marriage of the daughter...
Of the slave master. And this daughter, the mistress, shall I say, of my great-great-grandmother, was marrying a sea captain who came out of Marietta, Georgia, and who owned quite a huge plantation. But his wife traveled with him on﻿2
LMM: (cont.) many of his seafaring journeys,and this great-great-grandmother of mine, of course, traveled with them. This mistress of hers did not believe in all of the slave practices, and so she taught this personal maid to read and write; and when they would be in the various European seaports, she took her with her on her tourist trips. And so this grandmother could tell her children about being in London, and the things she saw there, and being in Paris, or being in Casablanca, and apparently was a person with an unusual memory and a fairly keen mind.
At the death of her mistress's husband, his widow returned to Marietta, Georgia, to take charge of the huge plantation which had been run by managers at that time. Again, her feelings about the injustices of the slave system showed itself in many practices that were contrary to the prevailing customs of the area. For instance, if one of her slaves married someone outside of the plantation family, she would buy that slave. Or she built a little school where her slaves could at least learn to tead and write, not very much beyond that, but at least it was a skill that was frowned upon by the surrounding slave owners of that area. She was compassionate about her slaves not being confined just to the plantation area; and so she would give them passes and they became known as Mrs. Wigby's "free niggers." Also in this Marietta, Georgia, area there was a large tribe of Cherokee Indians, and apparently considerable interaction between the black slaves and the Cherokee Indians, because at some time my great-great-grandmother married a Cherokee Indian. Now whether he was full breed Indian or not, I have no way of knowing, but my great-grandmother's picture shows that she has distinct Indian features.
CG= Is this the lady's picture that you showed me?
LMM: Yes. That's right. But she had the kinky hair of her black heritage.
This great-great-grandmother of the George Washington episode was given a house when she married, and she and her husband developed a bakery business, and her bakery products were so famous that they were sold to all of the plantations in that surrounding area. She had four children, one of whom was this great-grandmother of mine who was born, as I have said before, in 1816.
CG: Now what was her name, the one that was born in 1816?
LMM: Lavinia Clayton was her name.	The original great-great-grandmother
died, and whatever happened is lost in memory now. The great-grandmother who told me these stories also married a half breed Indian, which showed up in the skin color of her children, who were light skinned but had the Indian features and more of the Indian hair than she had. How long after Emancipation she continued to live on the plantation, as to dates, I have no record. And what eventually happened to her husband...I remember a story she would tell me, that at the coming of Emancipation, she was told that her children were illegitimate because slave marriages were not legal.
CG: She was still in Georgia at this time.
She was still in Marietta. She and her husband went to a local preacher and went through a marriage ceremony so that her children would be legal,﻿3
LMM: (cont.) which was the term she always used, and which showed the value that they placed on the legality of the birth of their children. I do not have any record of when this half Indian husband died, or what happened to him. I only know his name was Clayton. And at some point, this great-grandmother came to Atlanta. She had had four children, two of whom were boys and two girls. The boys had left the plantation soon after Emancipation and lost contact with the family. But this great-grandmother came to Atlanta because they had been told that there was more opportunity for employment as domestics in the Atlanta area. This great-grandmother was a skilled domestic because she had been a house servant on the plantation. She came with two daughters named Lucy and Rose. Lucy became my grandmother. Great-grandmother Lavinia obtained a job in a hotel, working as a chambermaid. I have no record of the educational opportunities for blacks in the Atlanta area.
CG: Plus there was Mary Church Terrell who made the point that, you know, she
liked the word "colored" because it covered all of the spectrum of our colors as a group, and she had a point there.
LMM: At that time the word "colored" was used. What educational resources were for the colored population of Atlanta, I have no way of knowing, but judging by the later years of educational opportunities offered in many other Southern places, I would say that it was limited. My grandmother however did learn to read and write, but not much education beyond that level, and at some time in her late adolescence, she went to work in an Atlanta hotel with her mother Lavinia.
CG: This is Lucy Clayton that we're talking about.
LMM: This is Lucy. My grandmother went to work in the hotel. While working there, there developed a very serious romance with one of the permanent white guests of that hotel. My grandmother had two daughters by this white man. This apparently was a serious romance because this white man, and surprisingly I never knew his name or heard his name called, assumed support for this black woman and his two children, and for several years she did not have to work because he supported her. I have heard this great-grandmother tell me many times that this white man begged my grandmother to come North with him and marry so that his daughters, of whom he apparently was very fond, would become legitimate. My grandmother, who had a very limited experience beyond her family environment, was fearful of taking such a journey and would not accept his offer to have her come North. On one of his journeys North, however, he was killed. My grandmother would only tell me that he came from the area of Syracuse, New York, and that he was of Scottish ancestry.
At the time of his death, she had to return to work to help support her two children, and at that same time, there was being established, or had been established in Atlanta, Georgia, a school called Spelman Seminary. And it was established by the Rockefeller family. My mother and her sister went to that school, and it was a school which offered a varied education—academic education to the level, I would suspect, of high school at that time, and vocational opportunities. Now my mother took the academic course and my aunt, nurse training. And one of the cherished, cherished documents which﻿4
LMM: (cont.) I have, Cheryl, is the license giving my mother the qualification to teach in the rural schools of Georgia. Would you like to see that?
CG: You know, you showed me the license before... LMM: I did?
CG: I remember that teaching license. That meant so much in those days
because really so few people could read; many people don't realize just how widespread illiteracy was in the South, both white and black. It was quite an achievement.
LMM: That's right. At a Christmas party given by one of the friends of my
mother, to which she went, she met a very dashing man from Daytona Beach, Florida, who was considerably older than she was, some fifteen, twenty years older. But a romance developed between them, and after some time they were married, and sue went to Daytona Beach, Florida, to live. This was my mother Laura Clayton. My father, although with a limited education, seemed to have natural business talents because he had gone into business with a white man in the area of Daytona Beach and they had an orange grove, and a thriving orange shipping business. So that my mother went to a house much above the standard of the surrounding community, with land around it; and my father was able to provide many of the services to his family that was not the usual practice. For instance, when her children were born, she always had a doctor attending her instead of a midwife, which was the prevailing practice. She was able to have a woman come in and help her with the laundry, which practically none of the families around could afford.
In the meantime, because of the good life she was having in Florida, she persuaded her mother and her sister to come, but my great-grandmother stayed with her other daughter for a while. Both this grandmother and my aunt after a short period of time made very good marriages. My grandmother married a man who had a supervisory job in the hotels, because the hotel business was the thriving business, being a tourist section of Florida. And my aunt married a construction builder who built her a beautiful home for that time. And he built one for my grandmother, but all of the yards were adjoining, so that was a close family unit of mother, aunt, and grandmother. It was to this family unit that the great-grandmother came from Atlanta to live, and provided the opportunity for this great-granddaughter to have these conversations with her.
CG= She came to Daytona Beach, your family was all together there. That's nice.
LMM: After ten years of marriage, my mother and father separated. The only
reason that I have ever heard given was that he had a very serious drinking problem. I believe I mentioned previously that when my mother and father married, he was in partnership with a white man and owned an orange grove. Some years after his marriage there was a bad freeze and the orange grove was destroyed. Soon after that business failure he opened up two barbershops in the white area catering to white trade. There was one barbershop in each area of the town. At that time black barbers had a monopoly on the barbering trade in that community. My father manned these barbershops with﻿5
LMM: (cont.) black barbers, of course. Although of limited education, he had keen business talents and these shops were very successful, and provided his family with what would be a comfortable income for that time. Although my mother was given custody of the children, a warm relationship with the father was maintained. His birthplace was in Rockhill, South Carolina.
My mother left Daytona and went to Columbus, Ohio,	to live, where she
had very close friends, and obtained a fairly good job in a corsetiere's shop to help support her children. She had taken the two younger ones with her and left the two older ones in Florida with her family to keep.
CG:	That means you have three brothers and sisters.
LMM:	I had three brothers and I'm the only girl.
CG:	I see, so you stayed...
LMM: No, she took the two younger ones. I'm the youngest.
CG:	Oh, you're the youngest.
LMM: Yes, I'm the youngest girl of the four children. She took my young brother and myself with her and left the two older ones.
GG: Do you mind if I ask you what year you were born?
IMM: When I was born? 1899. After two years my mother decided that the
informal separation should be legalized by a divorce and so she came back to Daytona Beach, Florida, and instituted proceedings for a divorce. In a small town such as Daytona Beach, among the black families, this was an unheard-of procedure, and I found out later that this divorce was one of the first divorces among blacks within that town. My father hired a team of lawyers. My mother, with the help of her family, had her team of lawyers. It took some time to effect the legal procedures, but eventually she obtained a divorce and the custody of the children.
During all of this period, we were living in my grandmother's house, and my father was living in the homestead, but with the back yards all together we saw my father daily. There was a congenial relationship between my mother and father. He would often come and have Sunday dinner with us, but he did not live very long after that, within a year he died and my mother and her family moved into the homestead house. During this period and some years after, a black woman came to Daytona Beach, Florida, after having surveyed many places up and down the East Coast...
CG= Can I ask you a question? I have a feeling you're going to tell me about somebody and I wanted to ask you some questions before you go into that.
LMM: All right.
CG: First I wanted to ask you what church was your family going to at this time?﻿6
LMM: My mother and aunt and grandmother became a part of the life of the
community. They all joined the Mount Bethel Baptist Church; they joined the fraternal organizations that were a part of the Masons and the Knights of Pythias and the others; they became a part of that life. And the social life in that community was identified a great deal with church activities. You were president of the missionary society, or you taught in the Sunday school; your friends were people with whom you came in contact in that context. You joined these fraternal organizations and you got an intermixture of denominations on a fraternal club basis. So that we were very much a part of the life of the community. These were families in that community that had ambitions and valued education. I remember, and we all know the name of, Howard Thurman, who lived two blocks away from us and with whom we grew up.
CG: He was one of your playmates?
LMM: We all were...
CG: So you were telling me about the fraternal order and some of your neighbors...
LMM: They were a part of the life and the ambition that the blacks in that community had for their children. Daytona Beach at that time was a typical southern community. One would think that we had more liberal practices than many other Southern communities that were cut off from the influences of the influx of liberal whites from the north that became a part of our tourist population in the winter. In the summer, what we would call our stable population was four or five thousand. In the winter, the population would increase to perhaps about forty thousand, between the hotels, the tourists coming and going, and those who had permanent winter homes in the Florida area. The town was very typical in the educational offerings to its black citizens. At the time that I was growing up•• • one of the things, the big needs, that Mrs. Bethune discerned was how little educational opportunities the municipal governments of the cities and towns of Florida provided for their black citizens.
My family had to pay to send us to a private kindergarten that a black woman had started. She had gone to Spelman Seminary and had come back to Florida and opened up this kindergarten. And she supported herself by the very small fees which parents sacrificed because they put such a value on education. The public school for blacks had a term of about four to five months and only went through the sixth or seventh grade at that time.
Someday I hope a history of the black church's supplying the void of educational opportunity in the Deep South will be written. Because any family who could afford even a meagre tuition had to send their children to church-supported schools, and practically all the denominations had their schools. The Methodists and the Baptists primarily, because the Episcopal church had very limited activity within the South among blacks. It was to meet this lack of educational opportunities provided by municipal governments that we found the private schools being established, primarily by the black church.﻿7
LMM: (cont.) The school to which my brother and Howard Thurman went was a Baptist school, supported by the Baptist denomination of Florida and located in Saint Augustine, Florida. Edward Waters College, another well-known school, was supported and maintained by the Methodist church in Jacksonville, Florida, and there were schools of that type in the various areas. In the whole state of Florida as late as the early teens, 1912 or 1913, we had not more than three or four public high schools in the whole state of Florida; one in Jacksonville was a fairly famous high school, and one in Miami. So it was to meet this void of education that Mrs. Bethune was inspired to found a school for girls.
Coming back to the life of the community, there were the oppressive practices at that time of the extreme efforts that were made to keep blacks in their place. I remember at eight years old, standing in my yard, seeing a black man who had dared to stand up for his rights and had been lynched as a result of it. His body on the back of this wagon was being drawn through the black community to intimidate these citizens so that there would not be any effort on the part of the blacks to get out of their place. This was the social climate. There were the practices that blacks could not try on shoes in the stores, or dresses, they had to be taken homeland we were not permitted to take them back if they did not fit. These are just examples of the restrictive practices that were a part of the life of blacks in the southern community at that time. Did you have other questions you wanted to ask about this before we go into the greater educational experiences?
CG: I was just curious about...you obviously went to the kindergarten there...
LMM: Oh yes, then I would take up as to where my education started after that, because that is intertwined with Mrs. Bethune.
CG: What were your impressions, how old were you when you went to Columbus, and when you came back...
LMM: I was about three years old.
CG: So you don't remember Columbus that well.
LMM: No, very vague memories of that period in Columbus. While in Columbus,
my mother boarded us with an elderly couple in one of the suburban towns} and she had a room in the city and came back and forth to see us.
CG: One other thing I wanted to ask you, what kind of games did you play with your playmates, with your brothers and sisters and your playmates in the neighborhood? Can you remember from when you were small?
^MMj I can't remember games other than lots of interaction between the children in the neighborhood. I can remember games of hopscotch, some of a kind of baseball playing that went on between the children within the neighborhood. With the girls, there would be lots of doll play. This great-grandmother would be very helpful in helping us get our dolls dressed or glueing a head back on a doll, or helping when my favorite canary died- We went out into the bushes near the house to bury the canary and put a little stick at the﻿8
LMM: (cont.) top. These are the kinds of experiences that we had.
CG: Those were the things I wanted to get some idea about. It sounds so familiar. I don't think childhood changes that much.
LMM: I went to the church Sunday school at that period. There was very warm neighboring among the citizens; if a person was sick, somebody came in. There was always concern if there were deaths in the family. A very warm neighborly relationship,as I can recall, existed between the people who lived in that neighborhood.
CG: When people passed away, would the neighbors bring food?
LMM: Yes, they had many of the same practices that you have up here, they'd sort of just take over the household from the grieving family.
We also had in our home town many small stores run by blacks. We had a black business area in one of the main streets of the town, in the black community. The black community and the white community would be divided by a street with all the white people on one side of the street where no blacks ever lived and all the black people on another side of the street. Very interestingly enough, my house faced that dividing street and not only was there the street, but then a few feet away there was a canal also that acted as a division. And all the people on one side of this narrow canal were the white residents, and all the people on the other side made up the black community.
We would have in our Baptist church, a time of baptism when we would be...
Just where I interrupted you, you were describing conversion experience at church?
LMM: oh yes. We would have these revivals of people joining the church and being converted, as you would say. I must have been around twelve or thirteen, and following the conversion we would have a baptism. Now, this baptism would take place in the river. We had a huge river running through the town called the Halifax River. It divided the mainland from the beach area, with the bridges running over to the famous Daytona Beach and hotels. So that on these occasions, we would dress up in these long white flannel robes which parents would make, and we would march, led by our minister and the deacons of the church, down to the waterside. And there you would stand as you may have seen it in pictures, and the deacons would assist the minister and we would walk out to our minister and be submerged as a part of our baptism ceremony. This is just a little picture of the kind of life that I had in those early years in this small southern town.
CG: I'm glad you mentioned that. Church is so important.
UtM:
I could also relate some of the experiences that I had with my grandmother. As you know in the black community, in these small towns, we had no street lights and so people going places at night would carry lanterns to light their way. And I would go to these, Cheryl, what are these meetings where.﻿9
CG: LMM:
CG: LHM:
CG:
LMM:
CG: LMM:
Were they religious meetings, oh, revival meetings?
Revival. We would go to revival meetings with my grandmother. The church would always have ministers who traveled from church to church to conduct revival meetings, and he would preach these fire and brimstone sermons. I would sit there as this impressionable child, I must have been about ten then, and he would describe in a most dramatic fashion as many of those revival ministers would, describe the devil with all of his horns, and his long tail and his arms coming down to grab a person who would not take on God as his Saviour. I don't think any of them realized the kind of impression that this made on children, so that I would come home from the revival meetings and lay in my bed looking up at the ceiling, hoping that the devil would not break through to come and take me away. [laughter] Now, is that important?
Yes, T think it is because it was such a major aspect of social life.
Oh yes. My grandmother would hear me thrashing, because I had a bedroom ^ next to hers, thrashing about and she would say, "What's the matter, Lucy? And I would say, "Grandma, don't let the devil come and get me and carry me
away."
Oh, that is so important. You know, Grandmother took you and she realized, and she was there to comfort you also. It's very important. I can remember the first time I ever went to a church where people were shouting, and being quite frightened and wondering what was going on, and having to have it explained to me.
Yes. I think that that aspect of my life flows into my educational experiences. Now, my education from kindergarten to high school was obtained in one place, and from one school, the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Girls, founded by Mary McLeod Bethune, who, as we all know, has been claimed as one of the greatest women, not just black women, but one of the greatest women that America produced. Now since all of my educational experience has been intertwined with her from the primary period through high school, I would like to do some quoting from an article which I prepared some years back about my life as a student in Mrs. Bethune s school and the profound influence that her personality had on all of my subsequent endeavors.
Oh yes.
Well Mrs. Bethune came to establish a school. I am not sure of the exact date but it's between 1904 and '05. One of the first families, when she came'to Daytona Beach, that she met and with whom she formed a very strong friendship, was my mother and my aunt. My aunt subsequently, after a few years, went to teach in her school at the primary school level and taught there for many years. I had had some kindergarten experience, m the private kindergarten referred to earlier, but I also entered the kindergarten there in Mrs. Bethune's school. I can even now recall this house which she had rented to start her school in, and the crude benches and tables which the husband of my aunt, my uncle, had helped build, along with other black﻿10
(cont.) carpenters within the area, out of orange crates and cast-off wood that had been found here and there in lumber yards. They had built this furniture to help furnish the classrooms for this school that Mrs. Bethune was going to start.
I can almost feel today, Cheryl, the warmth that flows over me as Mrs. Bethune dissipated my fear on the first day that I went to her school. It was located in a two-mile area from the part of town in which I lived, but my aunt with her horse and buggy would take me there each morning. As I try to think about Mrs. Bethune, perhaps it was the rich, mellow quality of her voice that would give assurance and quiet anxiety in one, and the phrase that I can never forget as she would begin each day's classroom activity, "And now children, we shall begin with prayer." "We shall begin our day's work with prayer." That was the phrase that she always used.
For a while T went as a day student. There were a few of what we would call boarding students, until Mrs. Bethune had raised enough money to build a building. The school was started with just one building, the upper floor dormitory rooms, the middle floor classrooms and then the lower floor for offices, rooms of that kind. The colored families in that community supported Mrs. Bethune in many, perhaps unpretentious, ways. To help raise money, they would give chicken suppers. Many times, the money raised from these modest efforts helped to carry the grocery bills or to pay some of the teachers. Many times my aunt taught for nothing for a long period of time, but it was her and her fellow teachers' way of showing support for the endeavor of this woman.
Another aspect of her character which I remember very well was the boundless energy that she had. In the early years, she would get up at five o'clock in the morning, and she would be going well after midnight. I heard her describe the variety of experiences that a day encompassed: such as teaching classes, going to beg money for the school, speaking before groups in order to interest them in her work. Each year a grade or two were added to the curriculum until the school reached the high school level. I was, in retrospect, amazed at the way she understood the adolescent behavior of black girls. She had an uncanny way of knowing when things were not going well on campus. She knew when something was bothering one of her students, and although she was held in awe and respect, she was the person to whom the students always turned with their troubles. There was a sensitivity about the understanding she would be able to project.
As a part of all our training, we were assigned to certain duties, because all of the practical tasks related to housekeeping duties had to be done by the students. These assignments would change each month: some months you would be in charge of cleaning the classrooms; another time you would be helping in the kitchen; another time you would be helping with the laundry; but it was all a part of your training. And I remember one incident when I was charged with helping to wash the table linen. Now remember in those years, Cheryl, Mrs. Bethune insisted that the girls learn what we would call the social graces. So that we had tablecloths on our tables and napkins which we had to wash. But you were taught these social graces, which one carries with you. They developed your attitude toward the good things in﻿11
LMM: (cont.) life which you carry all of your life. I remember that washing the table linens was one of the things that we found most difficult to accept to do. And one thing Mrs. Bethune insisted on was that the table linens be boiled. Now boiling the table linen meant in this big black pot out in the yard under which you had to make a fire and you boiled your water and you put the linen in. Well, many a time when we could skip that step in the process, we did... I recall one day when we thought we'd been very smart, we were about to hang up the tablecloths on the line, and Mrs. Bethune said, "They don't look like they've been boiled." So down they had to come and into the boiling pot.
CG: She could tell.
LMM: But you see, it was this insistence on thoroughness that became a part of the value of your life, and to this day I cannot depart from. Whatever little thing I am going to do, I'll do it as thoroughly as I know how to do it. But you see, the value was placed in those early years through these experiences.
Through a benefactor of the friends that she had made, and I'll tell you a little more about that later, she was able to buy a large tract of land across the street from the campus. And she hired men to grow sugar cane, because that was a product that could bring money and we would have to help in one process of that. There were big vats and roller machines where you would feed the sugar cane into the roller and the juice would flow out of it into the big vats, where it would be cooked, and that's how you got your cane syrup. And today I imagine, in a more sophisticated way, you get cane syrup. But we each had to take turns at some time during the season—it was a very short season—of standing there feeding the sugar cane into the rollers. That was another very interesting experience.
How hard was it to work with the sugar cane?
LMM: Very easy, because sugar cane stalks are very small.
CG: I've never seen sugar cane, I've just heard...
LMM: They grow in small, what do you call it, stalks, like this, small stalks,
and they grow four or five feet, you pick up one or two stalks at a time and just stand there and put it right into the rollers- It wasn't an arduous task.
CG: The leaves had already been taken off by the time you...
LMM: Oh yes. The men would do that, and they would just have these piles of stalks there.
CG: I have come to understand that sugar cane was a difficult crop to harvest.
Yes, you see the men would do all of that, but it didn't seem difficult in Florida, maybe the climate was the right place where it could grow. Mrs.﻿12
LMM: (cont.) Bethune used to sell the syrup as another money-making resource for the support of her school.
With Mrs. Bethune, there were just no short cuts, and another part of the character training, shall I call it, would be through these phrases that she would use, like "Whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability." Over and over, you would find, "Whatever you do, do it to the best of your ability." And so this feeling about the thoroughness—to this day, any kind of sloppiness disturbs me greatly. I think another contribution that I would say she made to my life, Cheryl, was her attitude toward work. For instance, she would say, "Any work is honest however humble," and "In whatever you do, strive to be an artist." Wasn't that a concept? To have it drilled into you, that whatever you do, strive to be an artist.
Orderliness was another concept that became a part of my life, and even as I grow to be almost eighty years old, I cannot bear to be disorderly. It may be just a tiny thing, but it does become a part of the expression of your living. I can remember many times, as adolescents will, we'd be tired at night and we'd sort of just drop our clothes anywhere. This is when I became a boarding student at the school, and she would come around and look in our rooms at night, and we had these clothes just strewn all over the place. Gently we were awakened, we had to get up and put those clothes in a neat way on our chairs. I give those little incidents because it does show a facet of this woman and the influence that she had on these students.
CG: As busy as she was, she took the time to pay attention to these little details.
These were the things that made her school unique. It was my privilege as I got nearer the end of the high school period to be a part of the entertainment group that went into the hotels to give concerts, as a way of raising money to keep the school going, and also, it offered an opportunity for meeting wealthy friends and influential friends who gave support to the school. We had very wealthy influential people living in the area. Rockefeller's place was just five miles from Daytona at Ormand, Florida. We had James Gamble, of Proctor & Gamble. Gamble had a beautiful home in Daytona and for twenty-odd years was chairman of her board of trustees. See, at that corporate level he could influence many corporate executives. She also made friendships through the access that the hotels gave to her, to bring in and give entertainment to their guests. And then Mrs. Bethune would always make a speech about her school and her goals and for the achievement of her people. If you were a part of that group, you could watch her charm, her ability to just hold an audience spellbound as she told the story of her life, just as I am now trying to project experiences here of the things that went into her desire for education: the five miles that she walked daily to go to the little missionary school to get her education. These were inspiring things to her students.
This was a woman of strong religious beliefs. We all had to gather once a day—and this was a small group of 150 girls—for her chapel talks. And I say here that she wove into the warp and woof of our personality and character her philosophy of life, her inspiration, her deep religious fervor; it was all there. And she gave to us a feeling that through God's power all﻿13
(cont.) things are possible. But it was also a time, and you'll see the relevance of this a little later, Cheryl, but it was also a time when she drilled into her students our obligation to help the less fortunate of our people. Again one of her constant expressions was, "You are being trained to serve, go out into your community and be an example of what education and training can mean to an individual." We heard this over and over again. "Help your fellow man." And to me those admonitions became a part, again, of my character development and in whatever community I have lived, I have always engaged in activities that meant community improvement. And so ingrained was this concern and feeling of individual responsibility for the less fortunate of my people, that all of my adult life has been spent in work with the underprivileged of my race. Maybe this is why you haven't heard so much about me, because it's been the unspectacular things...
CG: But those are things that matter most, sometimes.
LMM: Yes.
CG: Those tasks that don't get heralded about, but make a difference.
LMM: That's right. Mrs. Bethune was a woman of extraordinary courage, and I
recall an incident that occurred when I went back to teach after graduating from college. There were two candidates for mayor of the town: one who had promised to erect a new high school in the black community, and another candidate, who was a candidate of the Ku Klux Klan. Mrs. Bethune and many other prominent citizens, both black and white, backed the candidate promising the high school to the black community. On the eve of the election, I had taken a group of students on one of these entertainment missions to one of the hotels to give a concert and a talk about the school. This was in 1922. And I received a telephone call from Mrs. Bethune saying, "Lucy, bring the students home immediately." We had to cross a bridge because, as I mentioned earlier, the Halifax River divides the mainland from the beach area, and we were stopped on the bridge for maybe a half hour. Mrs. Bethune didn't tell me why I had to cut short the program, and I leaned out of the window to ask another person in another car, "Why the hold-up?" They said, "Don't you know, the Ku Klux Klan is marching tonight?" Well, finally the traffic moved and we got on the road out to the black community and the campus without encountering the Klan. When the three cars arrived on campus, Mrs. Bethune said, "Get the students into the dormitory, get them into bed, do not share what is happening right now." We, that is the faculty, all gathered and she said, "We have been informed that the Ku Klux Klan is marching on our campus, and that they intend to burn some buildings." She said that the black men in the community had been advised and they are on this campus, hundreds strong, with ammunition, and if there is any move by a Klansman to set fire,: there will be violence. She said, "But God is not going to let that happen." She said, "I am going to be there to protect this campus."
Well, we had barely time to man our stations; my station was in one of the dormitories, the door of one of the dormitories. By that time there had been several buildings built on campus, it wasn't just the one-building campus of my earlier years. Mrs. Bethune, as I've described her before, stood out in the quadrangle with her arms folded, as the message came down to her that the Klan was coming. It was a bright moonlight night, and you could see the﻿14
LMM: (cont.) Spanish moss hanging from the trees. It just made a perfect arch for the marchers> but it was an eerie scene. Evidently, the presence and courage which Mrs. Bethune exemplified, as those men marched in their white robes, coming down that street, must have intimidated them, because all that they did was to march in one entrance around the quadrangle and out the other entrance of the campus. They never broke ranks. But the courageous part was that by six o'clock the next morning, the black community was mobilized to go to the polls and vote for that candidate. They went in one huge group. There were five hundred blacks eligible to vote in that community; they were there, led by Mrs. Bethune to the polling booth. Wasn't that something? They voted their man in and they got their high school.
The experience that my family had with the Ku Klux Klan occurred just before I was to go back to Daytona to teach at Mrs. Bethune's school. It was related more to my aunt's family. She and her husband had a very beautiful home, because as a builder he could add many things that other persons would not be able to have. My aunt had an unusual, beautiful yard, with many shrubs and flowering plants. She spent hours and hours and hours there. So it was a showplace not only for the blacks, but many of the white tourists would hear about this beautiful yard in the black community and they would actually come out to see it. My uncle at that time was running a business. In addition to his building, he had, in cooperation with some other businessmen, built a movie house,since there was no opportunity for blacks to go into white movies. So he had a movie house and he had one restaurant in one part of town and another restaurant in another part of town. His prosperity was just too much for the Ku Klux Klan to take, so they began harassing him and warning him to leave the town.
They came back from a church meeting one night and discovered a small fire on their back porch with a warning that you had better give attention to this because the next time it would be your whole house. One night they woke up and sure enough, the house was burning, another section. They had a porch off of their bedroom and they ran out on the porch* The neighbors all came and there was a ladder put up on the porch and they came down on the ladder, but the fire department would not respond to their call. With just a few hoses and things that the neighbors had, they contained the fire to some extent. The next day a message came in the mail saying that the next time they would not have an opportunity to escape unless they got out of town Tight away. This uncle was a very stubborn man: he said he just wasn't going to leave. They moved over, again, across the street, where my grandmother's house was.
The night that I arrived to teach at Mrs. Bethune's school—that year I'd come down several days earlier to spend some time with my family—my aunt met me. She had written to say get to Daytona in the daytime. She met me with horse and buggy. We were still doing some horse and buggy in 1922. I was taken to my grandmother's house. I walked in and she hadn't told me all of the circumstances; all the window shades were drawn; the rooms were dark; and it was a kind of shocking experience. About five o'clock in the afternoon, I noticed that men were beginning to drift in, and they all had firearms. There was a man manning every room in my grandmother's house with a gun. There were about ten to fifteen men surrounding that house, and for weeks and weeks﻿15
LMM: (cont.) these black citizens protected that house from the Ku Klux Klan,
and when the Klan found how determined this man was not to leave town, the harassment began to taper off. He finally rehabilitated the inside of the house and they moved back into it and lived there until each one died.
CG: Did the men who came...
LMM: These were my uncle's friends. He was a very prominent Mason, Elk, Odd
Fellow, and Knight of Pythian. He was a "joiner"; and these were the men who gathered and showed their courage, through their defiance of the Ku Klux Klan.
CG: Now, I had heard that the Masons protect each other. This is the first time I've had someone describe an incident where the fraternal orders have done this; and this is a part of the activities of the fraternal orders that's never ever talked about, the way they protected the members of the community.
LMM: I would like to relate another aspect of Mrs. Bethune's endeavors to change the social practices in the community. She always had, as part of her community involvement, what we called Sunday afternoon community meetings. These were public meetings to which all the townspeople were invited to come, and the students gave a free program to them and it usually consisted of spirituals and folksongs by the student body, and the recitation of poems. I shall always remember one of my favorites, "Let me live in a house by the side of the road where the race of men go by. The men were good, the men were bad, as good and bad as I." That was one of my favorite, among many others, poems. And then Mrs. Bethune would give a talk to the townspeople. The auditorium was usually crowded every Sunday, and it was at these meetings that our townspeople were told how they might improve their standards of living, how they learned about contributions that their people made to American life, so that when I came up here and found out what limited knowledge the people had about their black history, I was astonished because I had been brought up on it. Mrs. Bethune would exhort them, "Hold your heads high! Look every man straight in the eye and make apology to no man because of his race or color." That was a favorite expression of hers.
At first only colored citizens came to these meetings, but the word got out, as often happens in a community, what lovely meetings they were having up there at Mrs. Bethune's school, singing spirituals and all of that; many of the tourists began to request an opportunity to come. Mrs. Bethune's reply was that all citizens of the community were welcome, but there would be no segregated seating, and so the whites came on those terms. And in the auditorium of this colored school in the Deep South, whites and blacks sat side by side, in spite of the policies of segregation in other areas. Together they enjoyed the beautiful folk music of America, and they heard an inspired Negro woman share her deep religious experiences with them, and they heard her tell of her hopes and ambitions for her people; her students were also moved by her great commitment and inspiration. And I think I've said enough about this period of my life.
I finished high school in 1918, and I had won a four-year scholarship to college, given by one of the school's benefactors. This was also the same year that my brothers, who had been coming back and forth to work in﻿16
LMM: (cont.) hotels in New Hampshire during summers, had decided that they
wanted to stay in Boston. They wanted to further their education. One brother had finished high school at this Baptist college that I talked about. And he had heard about Northeastern University. This brother graduated from Northeastern University. He persuaded my mother to come up here and keep house for the family.
Northeastern, at that time, was under the sponsorship of the YMCA. Students could work days and go to school nights and Saturdays. And this is how my brother got his college education.
There wasn't any doubt at all that I was going to go to a black college in the South, although my family had moved North. I was given an opportunity to pick the college that I wanted to go to. I had thought about Howard and Spelman, and I'd heard about Talladega. But I hadn't met anybody from there. I'd met people from these other places. In the spring of 1918, x went to a YWCA conference in Atlanta, Georgia, and there was a woman who was on the staff of the national YWCA. She was conducting this conference for the students from the black schools in the South. And, she was a dedicated "Talladegan."
cr •
Do you remember her name?
LMM:
CG: LMM:
Her name was Juliet Derricott, a well-known black woman of that era. She was one of the national YWCA student secretaries. She was very highly respected among the student groups of the country. Juliet Derricott worked out of the national YWCA headquarters in New York City. Do you know how she died?
No.
It was a very tragic event. She was going to conduct a conference for students. The incident occurred in South Carolina where she was in a bad automobile accident. She was rushed to a nearby white hospital where she was refused admittance. By the time she reached the black hospital some distance away, she was beyond help and died soon after admittance. It was said that if she had got help sooner her life could have been saved. The incident received national news coverage, with universal condemnation of the white hospital. She was the person who persuaded me to go to Talladega. She was a very ardent alumna.
I've never regretted going to Talladega College, a small liberal arts college located in Talladega, Alabama, and founded in 1868 by the American Missionary Association, an arm of the Congregational church. The enrollment was about 300 students and there was a small teacher-student ratio. Because of this, the close interaction between student and faculty was very good. During my years there, 1918 to 1922, the faculty was approximately seventy percent white and thirty percent black. This is only a guess. As more blacks became eligible for college teaching, they joined the staff. The excellence °f its liberal arts curriculum was recognized by many prestigious colleges. Talladega's graduates had very little difficulty gaining admission to graduate and professional schools. In 1913 my husband graduated from Talladega and was admitted to the Harvard Law School on the same criteria as﻿17
LMM: (cont.) other students. This mobility of Talladega graduates is one of
the things it has been famous for. Its graduates have always done well in our best colleges.
I think my college years were very average. I participated in many college activities. I was on the debating team; I belonged to arts and scholastic clubs; I sang in the church choir; I was president of the YWCA. Those were the kinds of extracurricular activities I engaged in.
There were, even in those years, a few rebellious students. And I guess I was a bit of a rebel. Many students resented some of the strict rules relating to the dress code. We had to wear black cotton stockings all the time and, of course, we had to wear uniforms. So one of our rebellious acts was related to the cotton stockings. At that time they were putting on the market black drop lace cotton stockings. Now the drop lace, I can't describe...Well, I was just going to try to describe what I meant by drop lace.
CG: Most of us wouldn't know what it is unless you describe it for us.
^MM: Suppose that you were crocheting a shawl and it was loose crochet, with all kinds of fancy stitches and designs. Well, these drop lace cotton stockings would be similar, and more spectacular than the silk stockings. So a part of our rebellion was, since we had to wear cotton stockings, to wear the drop lace cotton ones. We went in town and bought out the supply of drop lace black stockings and wore them to church one Sunday. Needless to say, they attracted attention to our legs. Well, our dormitory matrons were horrified. They went to the dean and the president about the incident. We very innocently said, "Well, you said we couldn't wear silk stockings, you didn't say we couldn't wear black lace cotton stockings and these are cotton." Of course, our message was clear. After much negotiating with the administration, we were permitted to wear silk stockings once a week to church. Eventually with other little rebellious acts we were able to get out of the uniform business. But I relate that incident just to show that even in those years, fifty-odd years ago, we had our rebels on campus.
CP •
Oh yes, definitely. And you all did it together, that is beautiful.
The dean called me and said, "Now Lucy Miller, we know who's the leader of this." I said, "Well, everybody participated." He said, "That's it, but we know who started it."
I finished college magna cum laude, with the highest class honors for that year. Now during my college years, Mrs. Bethune of course kept in constant contact with me, and she did not hesitate to convey to me, Cheryl, what her plans for my future should be. She would say, "Lucy, I want my mantle of leadership to fall on you, you are being given this opportunity to go to college to prepare yourself for this role." I was not allowed to forget it.
You have been selected to give service to your people."
Now, on coming to Boston, I had become involved in a serious romance with a young lawyer who had other notions for my future. I felt, however, that I did have some responsibility for the investment that had been made in my﻿18
LMM: (cont.) education, and so I went back to teach for at least one year in Mrs. Bethune's school, to satisfy her expectations. ' It was a year of many pressures being put on me, not only at her level, but at the level of the board of trustees of the school. I recall one board meeting which I was asked to attend.
CG: Oh, you were placed on the board of trustees?
LMM: No, I was brought in to have the trustees express to me their disappointment that I was not willing to give my life to that school. It was a difficult decision, in the light of these pressures, for me to break away from that plan to transfer the leadership from this great woman. But I felt that I had my own life to live, in my own way, and that I still could make contributions to my people, as she would say. This decision was a great disappointment to Mrs. Bethune. In later years, she confessed to me—because we kept contact constantly over the years—that she never could quite forgive me for aoing this. In the spring of 1923, I returned to Boston, and that fall I was married and entered into another phase of my life, the phase of marriage and parenthood, and that's where we will begin next time.
Number one, I want to know what you majored in when you went to college.
I majored in science, although my talents were all in the social studies. I did it as a discipline to myself; social studies came easily to me. Science, I had to work hard on, and in order to sharpen my intellect and focus discipline on challenges, I selected that area. That's another part of my personality.
CP •
I see you just don't take the easy road to doing things, do you?
I find that a part of my character building, I develop with challenges. It's very interesting, Cheryl, to go from the year that I taught as a science teacher, to having all of my educational and professional activities focused in the area of early childhood education.
cr •
So you taught science at the school. When you were a student at the school, where did your fellow students come from? Do you have any famous fellow students that you remember?
LMH:
Cg:
No, the student body wasn't famous. These girls didn't have to be recruited, they just came from all over Florida. At the time when I went back to teach, the primary grades had been eliminated. But the secondary and the high school grades had been strengthened. And so the student body had increased to three hundred day and boarding students. The improved curriculum still offered two choices—academic and vocational. But, all of the girls were still expected, as ladies in the 1920s, to take domestic science and sewing. They introduced clerical courses and a couple years of Latin and one modern language. Many of the girls were ambitious to go to college, so the school had to offer those courses that were a requirement for college admission.
They gave a very well rounded education. If a person didn't go to college,﻿19
CG: (cont.) they would still have skills when they came out.
LMM: That's right. Because at the time that I graduated from high school, it had very good clerical training for those who wanted to go into clerical work of one kind or another. Many high school graduates, who took the academic courses, became primary schoolteachers. Many of the schools were anxious to get primary schoolteachers, right out of high school, because the number of normal school graduates was very limited. You did not need higher education, as you do now, for a teaching certificate.
CG: There were so many people who wanted to learn to read and write.
LMM: That's right, that's right!
CG: One of the things I wanted to ask you... You mentioned some of the benefactors for the school and that you took the girls around to the hotels to sing. Do
you remember some of the things that they sang?
We sang Negro spirituals and the folk songs, primarily. We did not go into classical music at all. Therefore when I came up here in 1918, and found the attitude of the black community toward Negro spirituals, I couldn't understand it. People did not want to hear them because it reminded them of slavery. Very rarely did I hear Negro spirituals being sung anywhere as late as the 1920s in the Boston area. Therefore, people who came up from the South had cut their eyeteeth on Negro spirituals. We would often sing these songs and We were really looked down upon. Later on, when the Fisk Jubilee Singers became famous, the attitude began to change. But nothing that reminded blacks of slavery was accepted up here.
CG: That's frightening.
LMM:
LMM:
LMM:
That was right. Well, look at the conflict that went on between Booker T. Washington, Monroe Trotter, and W.E.B. DuBois. You know the saga of that story. Each had a different point of view.
CG: That's right. DuBois did not learn to appreciate those things till he went South.
That's right. That's right. And now we can put it in perspective; then, it couldn't be put in perspective.
cc •
You know, I found it very hard. Students would ask me, well, which one was right, and you say in this instance, they were both right. Both kinds of education were important and we must understand the different groups of people, and how the arguments may have been used...
As a young adult at that time, I, too, was confused by the varying points of view.
I would like to continue the discussion of the marriage and parenthood phase of my life. Over the years I've done some thinking about this phase and have tried to sort out those aspects which make for success or failure in this area of human relationships.﻿20
CG: Good. Good.
LMM: And this is not to be...oh, before we go into that. This was something I
came across in some of my daughter's work which she had done. [See Appendix].] I don't know whether it was high school level, it may have been freshman year, but I didn't know whether it would be something, it reflects the parenthood philosophy of her family.
CG: Because this is the kind of socialization that, you know, this part right here that says, "My mother has told me to leave any man who strikes me." That is so important because nowdays, have you noticed the different articles about battered women? We, black women, have been socialized not to accept that kind of treatment, and then they criticize us for not accepting it, and then...This is beautiful.
LMM: ,She wrote that not knowing that it would reach my eyes.
^C: She was in high school when she wrote this?
LMM: Either that or a freshman in college.
CG= That is beautiful.
LMM: What I was thinking it reflected the home atmosphere... The peace and harmony... ...and the way we try to...
CG: LMm
^I was going to ask a question about what would you tell young black women anyway, give you a chance to give us some instruction, [laughter]
LMM:
LMM:
Well now, where do we begin now?
Cr •
Last week you told me how you would stay a year with Mrs. Bethune because you felt the obligation, she had wanted you to take her place, you met Mr. Mitchell and you fell in love. And you also mentioned your shock at what confronted you, in terms of people refusing to accept their heritage in terms of their music.
CG:
Now, that was before the marriage. It was at the time when I came up, I remember every summer, when I would be in college in the South, then I would come up here with my family for the summer. During that period, before I went to college, after graduation I came on up here because my family was making that transition from the South. And it was at that time I was so astonished when they didn't want to hear the hymn, "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." What do you want to be humming a song like that for. You know that up here, we don't want to hear those spirituals. They remind us too much about slavery. Now that was back in 1918 and 1919, Cheryl, I had made a comment on that, hadn't I? During the early years of my marriage, now that's where we begin.
You got married in 1923?﻿21
LMM: September 8, 1923. During the early months of my marriage, I lectured considerably around New England on race relations. I spoke before church groups and church conferences; sometimes, I conducted seminars and workshops for them, working primarily for the Congregational denomination. After I became a mother of two children, I devoted most of my time to my family, with only an occasional lecture engagement. When my little daughter was about two years old, I heard through another parent about a nursery school that had opened on a nearby street and was being run by a Dr. Abigail Adams Eliot, who eventually became one of the outstanding authorities in early childhood education, and after whom the Eliot-Pearson School of Child Study, Tufts, is named.
Can I just interrupt you and ask you where you were living at this time?
LMM: I was living on 3 Warwick Street in Roxbury, in the heart of Roxbury.
This nursery school was the practice school of the Nursery Training School of Boston, which a group of civic-minded citizens of Greater Boston had established and of which Dr. Eliot had been appointed director. Dr. Eliot had been sent to England to study under the McMellan sisters, who were pioneers in the area of early childhood education and who ran nursery schools in various sections of London. The majority of children who went to this nursery school were black since the school was located in a primarily black neighborhood of Roxbury.
On investigating the school I found that it was not only a place where teachers were being trained, but that the nursery school was considered a demonstration school. I felt sure that it was just what I wanted for my little girl, which would give her an opportunity to mingle with other children in a safe learning environment. It was fortunate that my mother was living with me and could look after my twelve-month-old son while I was adjusting the sister to the nursery school. Parents were required to spend time with the child until she was adj usted to the new environment.
CG*
Can I interrupt again and ask you what year were they born?
LMM:
CG: LMM:
CG: LMM:
My children -were born at the beginning of my marriage very close together, within thirteen months of each other.
Yes, I have two brothers who are closer together than that.
Should I interject here that there was an illness that accompanied the pregnancy with the son, where I developed a kidney condition and had to be in the hospital for two months prior to his birth, which gave his father and I considerable worry that my having another child would be endangering my life, so at that time we began to look into this burgeoning development of birth control?
Oh, you were in contact with a lot of movements.
I did not want to get off of the thought related to my parenthood, but﻿22
LMM: (cont.) I will come back to this whole involvement in the early efforts to establish birth control clinics in the Boston area.
CG: My goodness, I'll remember that.
LMM: Okay, we'll get back to that. Repeating, I felt sure that it was just the
place I wanted for my little girl. She was two years old at that time, and they were taking children quite young into that program. Since it was the policy of the school that parents stay with their children until they felt comfortable, it was at this time that my mother was able to be helpful to me.
A few months later, Dr. Eliot asked if I could arrange to do some volunteer work as a helper for two days a week. I was always impressed by the warm, friendly, personal relationship between parents and teachers and the director at this school. Not everything was done then as it is now, because research and experience have taught many of us many things about children, and their needs and their growth and development. There were variants in attitudes about adult-child relationships. There was an attitude projected by one of the universities in the New York area that adults should not develop, in the nursery school situation, close personal relationships with the children, but they should put emotional distance between them. At one lecture that I attended in Boston at the time, the lecturer spoke of the adult's being like a fly on the wall when it came to interacting with the children. This was not the educational theory accepted by the Nursery Training School. They felt that there had to be warm relationships as an essential in the care of young children. This again was one of the appealing features of why I felt I would like to put my little girl there.
I found out that Miss Eliot was always on the watch for people who were suited to this work with young children and with this relatively new profession of early childhood education. After my daughter had been there some months, she asked to have a conference with me at which she indicated that she thought that I had a natural talent for working with young children, and would I consider training for the work, on a piecemeal basis, because of my family responsibilities. Because I'd had an opportunity to discover from my volunteer work that I enjoyed working with young children, I gave serious consideration to this suggestion and talked it over with my husband, as we did every important decision which had to be made by the family. Because of the importance and priority that I gave to my family responsibilities, I did begin to study on a limited, part-time basis, taking one or two courses each semester.
Now you were taking these courses at other schools in the Boston area?
No, at the Nursery Training School. At that time, there were no other colleges or universities offering a concentrated study in the child development or the child care area of education, later called early childhood education. Eventually, this area of education became very popular. By 1934 I completed my work for a certificate, which was being awarded at the time from the Nursery Training School of Boston.﻿23
LMM: (cont.) Before going into the professional aspects of my life, I would like to project some ideas that guided the attitudes that I had toward marriage, parenthood and career. The decisions which I made as to the priorities in these three categories in a woman's life, I feel must be on an individual basis, and based on the personality characteristics of the individual involved. During my early years, I felt strongly that marriage and parenthood came first, but that career drives had a place whose needs could be met with skillful planning and cooperating of the spouse. Cooperation of husband is most important in meshing these three aspects of a woman's life, if the love relationship between the male and female is to be maintained.
My husband soon discovered that just home duties and child-rearing activities did not meet all of my needs for self-development. And so he encouraged my doing the part-time study that had been suggested by Dr. Eliot. From the beginning of our marriage, there had been developed a pattern of shared household responsibilities and of the care of the children. As a struggling lawyer, trying to establish a practice in the Boston community and to make identification with many community groups of a wide variety, night activities were essential; however, there was always some time reserved for me to have nights away from the home. Baby sitting arrangements were made so that occasionally we might do things together; weekends, we tried for family activities. This was done on a planned basis. During these years there were deepening ties of affection between this man and myself.
My brother's leaving Boston caused my mother to come to live with us. Because of the type of person that she was, this was quite acceptable to my husband, and he developed a mother-son relationship with her that was always warm and loving.
You mean the kind of mother-in-law your mother was to him. Can you remember any specific incidents?
I have things that were said about her in an obituary, which at some time, perhaps, we could interject here, that would describe her personality. To, again, give an understanding of the strong love relationship, I would like to describe an incident that happened. My husband's mother lived in Cleveland with her daughter. There developed a problem in her daughter's family which made it not possible for my mother-in-law to remain in her daughter's household. The only solution to the problem was for her to come and live in our home.
Here I'm sure you can understand what a basis for conflict there could have been, with two mothers-in-law having to live in the same household. Well, my mother and my husband and I talked together to try to come up with an arrangement that could be acceptable to the two mothers-in-law and the other family members. A day or two after my husband's mother had arrived, the four of us sat down for a very frank and open conversation about the need for all of us to exercise as much understanding, sensitivity, and forbearance as we could in interacting with each other, so that this would be an amicable living arrangement. In talking with the two mothers-in-law, the first thing that we established was that we would not listen to complaints of one mother-﻿24
LMM: (cont.) in-law about the other, that as two adults they had to settle
their difficulties between them, because nothing that they did or said could alter the relationship between my husband and me.
We tried to make it easy by allocating certain duties.to each one. My mother, who had been living with us and had established a good working relationship with the children, would be the person held responsible and to whom the children could go for permission in our absence. The other mother-in-law would help with some of the household tasks which she had been doing in her daughter's house. My mother, who always got the supper for us, would continue to do that, and make the grocery lists. My mother-in-law had to live with us for some six or eight months. However, in all of that time, those two women worked together to resolve their differences, and we never had one explosion. Sometimes, we would come into the household and being, we hope, the sensitive people that we were, my husband and I would know that this had been a day when things hadn't gone well between them. But to the credit of these two women, they never pulled the two of us into their differences.
CG: That's beautiful, because, I mean, this is another thing...
LMM: This was an unusual kind of experience in extended family living.

But this is a thing that is so important for other, especially other black people to know about because they're starting to get away from taking care of relatives and bringing people into the household.
This was a family crisis, and this was an extended family way of handling it.
CG: Because I can remember when I was a child, at one point we had my mother's mother and my father's mother living with us.
Oh, you had that experience too, so you know what is involved.
Right. My mother's mother was only here for about a month, but they got along beautifully. It was understood and you know American culture jokes about mothers-in-law contribute to a lot of what happens in white families, where grandmothers and grandparents get pushed away, and children don't know them at all. And I knew all my grandparents, plus my grandfather's third wife, who was my stepgrandmother, and they all knew each other and talked on the phone.
Yes.
Cr •
And they would trade me back and forth in the summertime.
Well, I think we always looked upon this, and my husband and I talked about it, as achieving a pinnacle in our family relationships.
And it's so beautiful. They were so willing to help you with your goals.﻿25
LMM: There was, during that period, an understanding that there would be times when my husband's mother would want to be with him and do things. He always took her to church on Sunday, and there might be some kind of gatherings that he took her to; I took my mother, at times, other places, and there were times the four of us went places together.
CG: You said that you were lecturing, when you first got married, under the auspices of the Congregational church?
LMM: See, that was before the children were born.
CG: Did you change to the Congregational church at this point, or were you still going to the Baptist church?
LMM: No, I went to the Congregational church. My husband went to Baptist church for a while, and then transferred to the Congregational church, since it
was in the neighborhood where we lived. Remember, we both went to a Congregational college, so the transfer was not difficult.
CG: j see.
^MM: I think that in thinking again on this whole matter of marriage, parenthood, and career, that flexibility has to be exercised in the kind of work that the mother does. To me, being involved with my children was important, and because of that, I went into the type of work that did not have long hours so that I could have time to guide my children in their school experiences, and to establish a relationship so that I could share their growing-up problems, anxieties, uncertainties, activities. I wanted to be accessible to them when needed.
I'd like to relate an episode in which it was very important for a confused, frustrated little daughter to have access to her mother. She was perhaps in the fourth or fifth grade, and they were studying about Africa. They had studied about how the people dressed, and what kind of houses they lived in, and how they celebrated their holidays and whatnot. But this particular day my little daughter came home for her lunch, very pensive, with a puzzled expression on her face and not as talkative as she usually was. I said, "Laura, what happened at school today?" And she looked at me with a great deal of hostility and said, "Why didn't you ever tell me that my ancestors were cannibals?" I said, "Tell me, where did you find that out?" She said, "Well, in our school, we had been studying about people in Africa and how they lived. Today, the teacher said, 'Now these are the ancestors of your little colored friends. These ancestors of theirs were cannibals and cannibals are people who eat other people."' Well, that was an indication that immediate action had to be taken, on two fronts, immediate action on the effect of a statement like that on the attitude of the white children in this class, and the damage it had on my child's self-image. Two actions had to be taken, immediately.
I give this incident as an example where job responsibilities must not take priority over the child's needs. At once my husband and I went up to the﻿26
LMM: (cont.) school; we had an interview with the principal and the teacher.
We discussed the whole effect that the statement had on the feelings of my child and her self-image, but also the effect that it had on the attitude of white children toward their colored friends.
We had moved into the neighborhood of upper Roxbury during a transition period of population change from a predominantly Jewish population to increasingly large numbers of blacks.
CG = Oh, you'd moved from Warwick Street at this point?
Yes, we moved after seven years on Warwick Street. It was understandable that many of the teachers who had had complete Jewish class enrollment were finding it difficult to adjust to and accept the increasing number of black children moving into their classrooms. I think while we discussed the issues J-nvolved in this incident, that the concept was changed of the caliber of black parents who were soving into the neighborhood and with whom they would have to deal.
I haven't related why we moved from the apartment in lower Roxbury to a single family house in upper Roxbury. It was to improve our general living conditions and so that my children would have a yard in which to play. There were varying reasons why families were moving to that area. I relate the school incident as an example of why it is important for parents to be accessible to and able to respond to the many problems children encounter in their growing-up years, whether they are related to school or other areas of their children's lives.
CG: I'm just curious, what was the reaction of the teacher when you confronted her?
She was very surprised. She didn't think that it was of any importance. And I said, "Do you know what my little girl had to endure from the children with whom she walked home for lunch? They made all kinds of snide remarks to her. Children can be very cruel to each other. They said things such as 'Don't play with her because her parents may eat you,' things like that!" And the teacher was shocked that her remarks had had that effect. So sometimes the damage is done with the teacher's not knowing the terrible damaging effect of a statement like that.
I can give another example of why parents must be involved in their children's school experiences. My daughter went to the Boston Latin School, you know how selective the schools are, it's one of the what they call the examination schools. She entered at the seventh grade and was there for six years. It was during the time of when they were having quite a debate on the civil rights issues in Congress,and this was in one of her social science classes. The teacher had the children prepare presentations to the class on what was occurring in Congress, or in other areas related to the social situation in the country.
Would this have been the late thirties?﻿27
LMM: No, this must have been up in the forties, wasn't it, at that time. CG: When your daughter was at Girls' Latin?
LMM: Yes. I think this was 1941, her senior year of high school.
CG: Well, she would have graduated from high school right around 1940. She was born in '24, right? She's the youngest.
No, she was the oldest.
She was born in 1924, that should be right before...
^MM: Before...no. Now wait, she graduated from high school at sixteen or
seventeen, so that would take her where...in 1923, around 1940 and there was this debate and discussion on civil rights at the time in Congress.
I didn't realize that. Somehow that's skipped over because right at that area is where historians don't consider it to be history yet. That's sort of the dividing line, so that historiography has not caught up with that.
LMM:
Several of the students made presentations on some aspects of the debate that had occurred in Congress the day before, that came out in the papers. At the end of their presentation...I might interject here, there were two blacks in that class, there weren't very many blacks going into Boston Latin School at that time, one or two in a grade. Their teacher had this comment to make, because most of the presentations, two or three presentations had been for the civil rights bill that was being debated, the civil rights issue, should I say. She said, "I think that we ought to get some comment from the southern point of view, the white southerners' point of view." She said, "I know, I have some southern friends who do not think that it's time for the southern blacks to begin to vote," and of course, there was no discussion of integrated education at that time, it was on the voting issue. And she said, "Because some of those colored people," and that was the term used at that time, "have practically no education and they live in a very primitive fashion, and it is believed that some of them are just little more than an animal in the way that they live."
My daughter and her friend sat there crushed, because at the end of the class, when they were going home, none of their classmates, all of my child's white classmates, with whom there had been warm, friendly interaction, withdrew and had nothing to do with them. Again, this was time for parent activity and again we went through the same process of seeing the principal, getting the teacher in for a conference, and projecting our point of view as to the effect of these remarks upon the children. Going back to the cannibal incident, the other point that we made was that a child is the sum total of his intellect, his emotions, and his social interaction, as well as his physical well-being.
While we were having these conferences with the school personnel, we were gathering books about all types and kinds of people, with stories which she﻿28
LMM: (cont.) could read and which we could discuss together. We made the point to her that the incident of cannibalism was a part of the history of all people at some time; it wasn't anything that was just related to Africa and the African culture, so that she got the broader view. I think the point that I'm trying to make is that there is need for parental time to meet the developmental needs and experiences of children at their various levels and, that, whatever the career ambitions for the parent, this needs to have consideration also.
It was at this time of the children's growing up that I was running the nursery school located at the Robert Gould Shaw Settlement House. There was flexibility enough in carrying the work responsibilities to also encompass the parental responsibilities. This I think is very important. At the time, I was offered a job as administrator or "head worker" of the settlement house, which I declined because the head worker's job had to be a complete career commitment. There would have been no definite hours, I would have to meet all of the work demands, day or night, and for me this was not the thing that I wanted.
With my son, his father was a scoutmaster and involved in the athletic activities related to the growing up of the male persons in the family. During the high school years, he went to the English High School. He was on the track team, and my husband never missed seeing him at the time that he was running, or taking him to the baseball or football games. This was their outside interest.
I think one of the mSSt gratifying experiences that his father and I had occurred after he had done his army stint—three years in the army. Following his freshman year of college, he was drafted. He was barely able to complete his freshman year before they took him into the army. He had his army experience in the Pacific area. On the day that he returned and we met him at the door, he put one arm around each of us, and he said, "Mom and Dad, I thank you for the kind of parents that you were, and the kind of values which you gave me, because in all of my exposure to all of the vagaries of army life, there were just certain things I couldn't do because of the way I had been brought up." Cheryl, to me that was one of the most gratifying parental experiences of my life.
So the time invested in giving values to children is most worthwhile. I like to think of these values as guideposts for their behavior and their reaction to various life experiences. One day we were talking about the family life we had, and he said, "I have to thank you and Dad—I've been married almost twenty-five years now—for the model which you gave of what family life can be." My daughter is into her thirtieth year of marriage. They have both made very successful marriages, which I think had something to do with the quality of home life in which they grew up. I get emotional...
I don't blame you at all. Considering the crisis in black family life today, at least the perceived crisis, the crisis that a lot of people perceive, in a way it would tell...
When you think that one out of three marriages ends in divorce now.

CG: The statistic is approaching one out of two. It's gotten worse. I know

PP
It's been devastating, it really has; there's a high degree of disagreement between black men and black women.
^MMs And of course now they say that the whole aspect of marriage is changing.
I get many magazines that come in here that I read, and the points of view expressed give a feeling that maybe we're entering a stage of not having this form of marriage.
cc •
People are renegotiating values...
That's right.
CG •
This is such a good lesson, because people tend to forget how much of what you learn is from a model of how you go about treating people, or in some cases, how not to treat people. But to me your life is a beautiful lesson. And also many times people don't realize that people who have raised successful families took the attitude that it was work, and that it was important work, and you got your rewards, in a sense, for working so hard at it, at being a parent. One of the complaints today is that people don't see parenthood as a vocation, as legitimate work.
I think that if you commit yourself to saying you want to be parents, it is a commitment. And that's the way I feel about it, because you don't have to be if you don't want to. And I don't think any set patterns can be set down for it, but I think that what is right for that particular family...the child has a place when you say you want one.
During the years of marriage, parenthood, and study, I kept close ties with the Nursery Training School. For one year I was part of a research team which was collecting data for a study dealing with the influence of nursery school attendance on a child's later adjustment and success in school.
In 1931 there was a survey made by an organization called the Boston Health Association. This survey focused primarily on the lower Roxbury area of Boston. A high incidence of tuberculosis was uncovered by the survey in the area, among young and school age children. The organization making the﻿30
LMM: (cont.) survey believed that emphasis should be on prevention as an effective control mechanism for the spread of this disease. It recommended the establishment of a nursery school in a settlement house which ran an effective program for school age and adolescent children in the area. The concept was that if a nursery school program was provided with a health education emphasis and intensive work with the parents of the children attending the school, the disease might be brought under control. So a nursery school was established at the Robert Gould Shaw House and I joined the staff as assistant director. In the beginning, I worked only part time because my family was moving to a new location in Boston and my children would be adjusting to a new school situation and a new neighborhood. After one year of the school's operation I was asked to become director.
During the thirties, at the time of the establishing of the school, there was great concern for improving the standards of child care. This concern for improving standards often took the active form of extending the services of an established agency, extending it to help Improve the standards in other agencies. In the area of child care, there were many settlement houses and day nurseries who were giving little more than custodial care to young children. Because of my close identification with the Nursery Training School, and as director of what came to be known as a model nursery school in that area, I worked diligently in the program of improving standards of child care. During these years, I led seminars and discussion groups with teachers and parents in an effort to share the new insights and research findings in the area of child development and care.
CG: These were lectures to families in your neighborhood?
In that neighborhood and in other neighborhoods such as the South End, Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, South Boston, and East Boston.
CG: So you were teaching not only black parents but white parents as well?
LMM:
Oh, yes, oh yes, because many of these were white groups.
During World War II, I participated in a community-wide program of child care volunteers, because at that time mothers were being urged and needed to participate in the war industries, and somebody had to take care of the children. So those of us in the child care field took on this responsibility for organizing volunteers in institutes so that they became more informed in the work that they were volunteering to do. The Robert Gould Shaw House Nursery School almost from its very beginning became what was known as a model school in the greater Boston area, and for that reason all colleges that had departments of early childhood education, as well as those giving courses or majors in early childhood education, sent their students there for field training. Colleges such as the Eliot-Pearson School of Child Study at Tufts, Wheelock College, Boston University, and Garland Junior College were a few colleges who sent students. These were the schools from which I drew my teachers and this was the place to which they sent their students. There was close interaction with the supervisors of these students. In 1951, a community survey was made of all the agencies and hospitals and social agencies supported by the United Community Services of Boston. That's the equivalent now to our United Way agencies. As a result of﻿31
LMM: (cont.) this study, a significant recommendation was made relating to
agencies giving care to preschool children. It recommended the establishment of an agency to operate what was later called Red Feather Day Care Centers.
CG: I was going to ask, was that also called Red Feather, I remember the Red Feather...
LMM: Yes, they became the Red Feather Day Care Centers. Now these recommendations coming out of the survey said that, "In order to achieve more effective overall . planning of day care services for the Boston area, to avoid unnecessary fragmentation and duplication, and to raise the level of educational programs in these centers, to insure the providing of better qualified teachers, and to effect more efficient business operation, a unified agency should be established." I was one of the committee of five charged with preparing a structure of this new agency.
Many months of very intensive work went into the reorganization of the existing nursery schools and day nurseries that we had all over the metropolitan area, and after these many months of work, the Associated Day Care Services of Metropolitan Boston (ADCS) was brought into existence, as a participating member of the United Community Services of Metropolitan Boston. There were eight operating units of the central body. This was a mammoth undertaking, since the programs were located in widely scattered areas of Boston, such as East Boston,	West End, North End, South
Boston, Jamaica Plain, Beacon Hill area and Roxbury. These programs cared for about three hundred children a day.
A year after this was established, I was asked to become educational director of the agency. That's when I moved from being director of the Shaw House Nursery School which became a member of this association. In accepting this new position, I looked upon it as a challenge and an opportunity for an expanded range of service, and for thirteen years I was educational director and for one year, 1964-1965, was acting executive director of the agency. Again there was a decision to make. I was asked to become permanent acting executive director but turned it down, because at that time I was moving more into the retiring years and felt that the organization needed a younger executive with more vitality and new ideas. These are the kind of decisions that one makes and in this instance it wasn't my career needs that were important, it was the needs of our agency. It was important for it to keep on growing into the model that it is today as one of the outstanding child care agencies in the whole area of Massachusetts .
CG: During these years that you were working for the Red Feather, it was highly unusual, I think, at this time for a person of color, and particularly a woman of color, to be an executive in any agency. Did you ever run into problems, comment, opposition?
LMM: No, I think not...and surprisingly, because I had to interact on a very
deep level with all of the agencies and personnel, which were a part of the association. I think there were times when it was a little difficult for the other persons, who had been directing their own programs and were the﻿32
(cont.) persons who made all of the decisions and judgments as to programming and program changes. But this is where the art of learning how to interact successfully with varying types of personalities is important. I spent considerable time in trying to develop that skill and that art, and therefore sometimes people were surprised that I was able to establish working relationships on the basis of improving the standards, whether it was in their facility or wherever it was. It was to their credit that the standards were improved.
CG: I was also curious, you mentioned all of the different areas that came under your authority, that meant you had to work with different ethnic groups.
LMM: oh, all kinds of different ethnic groups. One of the large settlement houses in South Boston, Saint James House, was, I think, the only settlement house there. They had had what they called a day nursery and I had to go in there to change the whole concept of the program, to introduce new standards of operation, to take over the supervision of the staff which the head^orker of the settlement house had been doing until that time. This headworker was known to be difficult, but eventually a good working relationship developed between us. In this instance, I knew that I could never work with the person who was running her day nursery program without coming through her, because she could be a disrupting influence. So whatever decision as to changes was preceded by a conference with her as to reasons for the changes and also to give her an opportunity for her input. This method assured her support instead of her opposition.
CG:
LMM;
So in a sense you were a politician, as well as an executive...
No, I wouldn't call that politics; I would call it learning the art of human relations. And isn't that what it is? You learn how to work with people of varying personality makeup.
CG: Because politics implies manipulation more than...
I think it does, there's a very large element of manipulation in working with people. What you want to do is to evolve what is the best plan to achieve your goal, and the goal in this instance was always better child care.
CG: I see what you mean exactly. That has a lot to do with your attitude and I think people sense that.
Now, there you see we had a large Irish Catholic population, there wasn't a single black child in that day nursery. Over in East Boston, you had a largely Italian ethnic group and again these programs were located in settlement houses. We had to deal with a host agency; that and you had the problem of here was a program housed in my place. Now what was your authority, what was my authority, what was the goal that we wanted? I focused on the goal to be achieved, which was better care for the children. Down in the West End you worked with another ethnic group, there was a day nursery, supported by a group of old-line philanthropic Yankees, called the Sunnyside Day Nursery Center,located there on Hancock Street on Beacon Hill. That served another kind of child, and you had to have another approach. Here﻿33
LMM: (cont.) was a group of trustees, of the philanthropic Yankee group, with the kind of social dedication and devotion that they would take to what they called their charities. And they had always had the authority to hire the director of the day nursery which they ran. Now we had to move in and work with them, as they released authority to the central agency in the area and functions which formerly they had performed.
Working on a different level, there was the South End Day Nursery, established way back in the 1860s. Here you had a group of children that was a mixture of new and old immigrants. There was a need for a place to care for them.
This new job proved to be far more challenging than I had envisioned. Not only did one have to be involved with the immediate responsibilities of the job, which covered staff development, educational programming, finding facilities, setting up educational programs for parents,but also reaching out into the community to convince other social service disciplines of the viability of day care and what was entailed in a high standard, quality day care service. The concept of day care as only baby sitting had to be changed. The multidisciplinary character of day care service had to be sold to other social service disciplines, that day care encompassed components such as education, health and social service if the total development needs of the child and his family were to be met. The value of the child's learning in groups at such a tender age had to be established. Understanding the scope of the service came slowly and meant intensive work in the community. During this period I did considerable lecturing to college classes, professional and social service and health organizations on the desirability of the interdisciplinary approach to child care. It had to be emphasized that the skills were needed of social workers, health workers, nutritionists, pediatricians, and psychiatrists as well as teachers.
What else did this new job involve?
We opened the first day care center ever in a housing development. We were involved in all of the technical development and negotiations with the housing authority, worked with the architects and the construction company concerning the design and the facility needs of a day care center. The other day I went to a meeting and learned that things have come full circle. It has come to the point now that populations in housing developments have changed so that we ask if it is worthwhile to have a day care center in a housing development. We used to make a survey of the preschool population to determine if there were enough children within that area to populate a day care center program. Now, people with young families are not moving into the housing development. The deterioration of the facility conditions and the security problem contribute to a difference in attitude. At the time when many young families were moving into these huge housing developments, we made a survey of what was the preschool population to make it worthwhile. The day care program was designed not only to service the housing development children, but also the surrounding community, therefore it wasn't supposed to exclude children from the surrounding neighborhood. But now the way it's developed, only children living in the housing development are eligible for service. So there've been many changes since this Pioneer work that this agency did.﻿34
CG: I was also curious, when you finally got all of the day care services and the administration of them centralized, what other kinds of problems did that eliminate? You talked about increased services.
■LMM: It meant that here was a body concerned with raising the standards of
child care. This was done because the survey revealed the very poor standards that were being maintained in these various isolated places.
CG = What were some of the problems that you ran into, the poor standards?
LMM: There was overcrowding since there were no space requirements for licensing;
the ratio of teachers to numbers of children was unacceptable; the educational materials were poor; there were inadequate outdoor facilities, in some places there was no outdoor play space. Children would have to spend six to eight hours a day without any outdoor or big muscle exercise with occasionally a walk around the block. Teacher qualifications left much to be desired. In some places, people were in charge of programs with less than a high school education. One could understand why such programs were tolerated. It was an effort to meet needs of families living in certain neighborhoods where competent personnel was in short supply. These were some of the conditions which it was hoped would be alleviated under a centrally administered operation. And then, there was the whole matter of more efficient financial management. That's why a centrally administered agency was established.
CG: You were part of the movement that was the reason that when we went to
day care or, you know, nursery schools, that the schools that I've worked in have always had enough space for a child so they could play.
LMM: That was the result of the state licensing law which came some years later. We'll get to that in a few minutes.. See, up until this time it really was more of a baby-sitting service. There was some skepticism about this new program called day care which was being established by Associated Day Care Services. We had to sell to the community that day care was a service concerned with the total development of a child, his physical, emotional, intellectual and social growth. And therefore it wasn't the job of just one professional group. It was the multiprofessional concept that had to be sold. The value to the child of learning in groups had to be established; understanding of the scope of the service came slowly and made intensive work on the few of us who were involved in the task of changing community attitudes and concepts. That's why we had to do all of this work with parent groups and with social service groups and health groups. Believe it or not, in the early fifties it was very difficult to sell the concept that day care performed two roles: helping the young child achieve his potential and helping to strengthen family life. One had to work with parents to sustain the things that the child was learning in school; one also had to work very diligently to try to improve family living conditions.
Therefore, the interdisciplinary approach was very essential to make this day care service really viable. It needed the skills of many professionals, such as social workers to work with the family, psychiatrists to handle at a very early age the child's behavior difficulties that people were discovering, and then teaching teachers how to handle these problems.﻿35
M: (cont.) It meant also a lot of involvement with the health services such as pediatricians and nurses. At the Shaw House Nursery School from its very beginning, we had a part-time social worker on the staff. We had a nurse who came daily to "inspect" the children for the onset of childhood diseases. We had a part-time pediatrician on staff, and also the consultation service of a psychiatrist. This is why it was considered that we were demonstrating the interdisciplinary professional group that was needed to give adequate service to these children.
During the forties and fifties there -was a thrust for better standards of child care generated by federal child welfare legislation from the 1950
White House Conference on Children. The war years had revealed serious child care conditions of abuse and neglect.. These reports- had come in from all over the country. During the period of the depression there was a demand for the government to establish nursery schools as a resource for providing jobs for unemployed teachers.. In a short span of time, nursery schools expanded from around 35Q nationwide to 2,500k There was much ferment to adjust the skills of grade and high school teachers to programs that required work with the preschool child. The professional preparation of these teachers had been for a much older child and at a different grade levels This group of teachers had very limited knowledge about the functioning of the preschool child in groups; the understanding of their developmental stages, behavior characteristics at certain age levels, their interests, and program designs to meet their needs..
In this state I recall being a part of a small group of early childhood-trained personnel who went into action and took on the task of preparing grade school teachers for their work with the very young child. The team went on a statewide circuit, holding in-service training institutes, workshops and seminars with these teachers. The aim was to try and give them skills in how to interact with preschool children; hov to set up an environment suitable to their developmental level; how to present the learning tools of blocks, paints, clay, storybooks, science and manipulative materials.
*
During the war years the Lanham Act provided matching funds for providing nursery schools for the care of young children so that their mothers would be freed for work in the war industries. Again, there was a crisis need for personnel to man these child care centers. Again, poor standards of care were tolerated and compromises made in order to have places to put children's bodies while their mothers labored to build ships and produce war materials. Nationwide there were reports of horrible child care conditions, when children's lives were made to adjust to the demands of work schedules and twenty-four hour swing shifts. These were conditions which were damaging to children's well-being.
The Lanham Act was passed by Congress in 1942. Under it, t;he federal government
sPent more than $5 million to establish 3,102 child care centers during World War ii.﻿36
LMM: (cont.) From these experiences early childhood educators and workers learned
the need of more careful planning, the setting up of safeguards for children's protection and the preparation of personnel to help meet a crisis need. We learned to make sure that the next time public money was used to provide care for preschool children that at least minimal standards were established through legislative acts.
Between the fifties and the sixties, much of my professional life was focused toward passing a state licensing law, setting up standards of child care. This was not accomplished until 1962. Until this time we did not have a state law establishing basic standards for group child care. Licensing was done on an individual city and town basis. Many of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, at that time, had no regulations for the group care of young children. Some of the larger cities and towns had under the Department of Health established minimal rules and regulations.
As I traveled over the state, I found terrible conditions under which children were being cared for. This 1962 day care licensing law climaxed ten years of intensive effort on the part of many agencies, organizations, citizens' groups, and individuals. I do not say this with any feeling of bragging, but I was in the forefront of this effort.
Several years before the filing of the legislation, we had to develop statewide support. A few of us who had been in the struggle for a long time undertook the task of mobilizing this statewide support. It entailed covering the state to expose the conditions under which children were being cared for, so that we could authenticate the need for a state law. We found small rooms crowded with children who were required to sit in chairs for long periods of time; rooms poorly lighted and ventilated, located in basements next to furnace rooms; limited play materials and outdoor play space. Another task in mobilizing statewide support was to convince different types of groups that these child care conditions were damaging to children's well-being. For instance, in those cities and towns which had some form of licensing regulations, such as Boston, New Bedford, and Springfield, sanitation workers or nurses were the licensing agents. It was such people who needed to be convinced of the need of more effective regulations.
CG: LMm:
Can I just ask you a question in the middle? During this campaign, what was a typical day like for you?
Well, I worked for the Associated Day Care services; they were committed to the need for a state law. Now, remember that my children were in high school or college and my husband was cooperative. In the late afternoons, about three o'clock, I would set up a meeting with a group of sanitarians or nurses. I've already put in a day's work at the agency. I would then travel to perhaps Springfield, New Bedford, or down on the Cape, and talk with a group. Sometimes, my husband and I had dinner at seven or eight o'clock. This was the kind of thing that needed a lot of dedication. Twice, legislation failed because we didn't have enough pressure behind it. It got to a study commission, which is the graveyard of much legislation, or was sent to Ways and Means; they have various ways of doing it. But all﻿37
LMM: (cont.) the time more organizations and agencies were seeing the need
for support of the effort. The Associated Day Care was taking...and some of the professional groups, such as the Boston Association for Nursery Education, I'll tell you about my involvement in that. We had to get a state agency that had contacts all over the state: the western part, the Cape, as well as the eastern area, to become the sponsor of the legislation and to share in the community education efforts. The agency which we selected was the Massachusetts Committee on Children and Youth, an organization which was highly respectable, and knowledgeable about the legislative process.
<-'G: Didn't they later become another agency?
No, they're still in existence. They had a big annual meeting here the other day. It's changed its program focus.
In 1961, a resolve was passed by the legislature for the appointment of a special commission to investigate and study conditions relative to the licensing of agencies giving day care to children. I was one of the governor's appointees on that commission. This meant a whole year of work. I was the person most informed on the need for this law. My role on the commission was to feed information to the group, so that we would have a base of support from the members.
CG:
LMM:
CG: LMM; CG: LMM:
LMM;
That's fascinating. So you were not only educating the public, you were also educating your commission colleagues...
Well, they had given the commission about a year to do their work, and they had to extend it because we had so much material to accumulate. That was a very intensive involvement that I had. We had to provide commission members with materials upon which they could make sound decisions.
Maybe we can't finish all of this.
No, it's been an hour since the last time...
All right, and then we can go on as to how we got this law.
*
I started to read this article, and the first sentence is just beautiful.
CG: "The development of standards for day care services in Massachusetts is of interest as an example of the pursuit of the ideal by means of the democratic process." I think that's beautiful.
That's right.

CG: So we can explore that next week.
CG= Okay, last week, we discussed generally the progression of events that brought you from the Nursery Training School of Boston to the special commission. Now, let's go back and look more specifically^ We talked about the special events that kept happening, but we didn,st get a chance to talk about your education per se. Can you go back to that?
LMM: After becoming director of the Shaw Hous« Nursery School.
CG: Okay, now which year was this?
LMM: 1932. I soon recognized that if work in my chosen field was to be most effective, further study was necessary. With the encouragement of my husband and Dr.. Eliot, I enrolled at Boston University as a graduate student in their School of Education^ Again, this study had to be on a part-time basis. In 1935, I received the degree of Master of Education, with a major in early childhood education. At this period in my life, I was firmly launched on a professional career in that area of education. I would like to insert here that this study and part-time work was possible because my mother had come to live permanently in my home.
CG: Okay. Now, you have received a master's degree from Boston University,
and you've trained many people during this depression epoch. We mentioned quickly last week the need for day care during World War II. Would you care to elaborate on your work during the war years, because this is a very important period in the history of women in this country?
LMM: During the war years, the Lanham Act provided matching funds for the
establishment of nursery schools all over the country, thus freeing women for work in the war industries. Again, the crisis need for child care arose. Poor care was tolerated and compromises made in order to have a place to put children's bodies while their mothers labored to produce war materials. I can remember the horrible conditions under which many children were cared for. Conditions which were hazardous to their health, safety, and damaging to their well-being. But women were needed to help build ships. It was then that we learned how children's lives were scheduled to meet the demands of work schedules. Twenty-four-hour day care centers were opened to match the working hours of their mothers' swing shifts. From these experiences, those in the field of child care learned the need for careful planning and the setting up of safeguards for children's protection, and the preparation of personnel to take over the family's job when the members of the family were engaged in needed pursuits.
Would you care to elaborate on some of these conditions that you found during this period?
There were conditions of overcrowding because of limited facilities for child care. Babies had to be placed in group care, if their mothers' work schedules required. There were poorly qualified caretakers, and limited equipment and play materials.﻿39
CG: You're talking about little infants.
LMM: Yes, and preschool children. So that leaders in the field of early
childhood education learned, during these war years, of shoddy care for children. What a price was paid by the children in their developmental needs. We came to the conclusion that the next time public money was used to provide care for very young children, we must have at least minimal standards through legislative acts. This was not accomplished in Massachusetts until 1962, which meant that the passing of this law climaxed ten years of intensive efforts of agencies, citizens' groups, organizations, and individuals.
CG: We just managed to get back to your organizational efforts here in behalf of the law. So becoming political, and engaging in a political process to advocate for children came out of your experience, seeing what children were going through and working with parents.
LMM: It also demonstrates, and Massachusetts stands as a striking example,
that achieving even minimal standards of child care is no mean undertaking. There is great gratification on my part that I was in the forefront of this effort.
CG: Last week you mentioned that part of your political effort, mobilizing people and covering the state, had to do with convincing people of the damage that was done by not having the standards.
LMM: Yes. We found that mobilizing support meant basing our facts on conditions under which children were being cared for, which we exposed through personal investigation. It meant covering the state to see the conditions: crowded, small rooms, basement facilities next to furnace rooms, no outdoor play facilities, inadequate personnel. We uncovered a condition in the western part of the state where an eighty-year-old woman was being left to care for twenty three-year-old children during the morning period.
The task meant traveling the state and talking to groups of nurses and sanitarians who were the licensing agents in the cities and towns. It meant talking to teachers' associations of the need for a state law, stimulating organizations such as the Boston Association for Nursery Education to set up workshops and seminars and to offer lectures around issues of better standards of child care.
Twice during this eight-year period, legislation was filed and failed of passage because we did not know the processes and techniques of effective political action. More organizations were beginning to see the need and support the effort. The committee from which this activity was taking place was a committee of United Community Services known as a day care committee. After two failures to pass legislation, it became clear that this small Boston-based committee was not adequate to do the job needed for legislative passage; that if we were going to get a state law insuring standards for day care in Massachusetts, it had to be applied on a statewide basis. For these reasons, the United Community Services Committee asked a statewide organization known as the Massachusetts Committee on Children and Youth to undertake a sponsorship of this effort. This was a highly﻿40
LMM;
CG: LMM:
CG: LMm:
(cont.) respected organization with a statewide program, dealing with the issues and projects related to children and youth. Much to the credit of the Massachusetts Committee, they consented to undertake this task and committed themselves to assume an active role in broad statewide planning for day care services in the state, including legislation.
In May 1961, the resolve was passed by the state legislative body for the appointment of a special commission to investigate and study the need for licensing of agencies giving day care to children. The composition of this commission was as follows: two members of the Massachusetts Senate, three members of the House of Representatives, commissioners of Health, Public Welfare, Education, Mental Health, and Public Safety and four persons having special experience with the problem of children, to be appointed by the governor. I was one of the public members appointed by the governor.
Which governor was that?
Governor Volpe. Now this commission was charged with investigating the need and making a report to the General Court of the results of its investigation and study, and its recommendations, if any, together with drafts of legislation necessary to carry out its recommendations. This report would be filed with the clerk of the Senate on..." before January 1962. This gave the commission six months to complete its work. It was a hard-working commission and intense. Being the only one on the commission with actual experience in the day-to-day operation of day care service, my job was to inform and orient many of the members of what was involved in a day care service. This meant constantly feeding them with material and information on which they could make sound decisions. We were given an extension of time to April 1962. The report of this special commission was filed with the Senate and House of Representatives. Following the filing of the report with the legislative action indicated, there was a new task: to mobilize support for the passage of the legislative bill which had been prepared. This is where the assuming of the sponsorship of the passage of this legislation by the Massachusetts Committee on Children and Youth was helpful. Because the organization conducted a most effective campaign of mobilizing statewide support of enactment of the measure.
May I ask you a question at this point? Was there organized opposition to this bill?
Absolutely. By what we call proprietary owners of these programs that had not been required to maintain effective standards and who were making a living out of providing what they called child care services. That situation has continued to this very day, and child care people have to be always on the alert for the loosening of these standards, because child care work is not a cheap service, and in order for people to make a profit on it, standards of good quality care must be lowered.
A demonstration of support to the legislators had to be made and,therefore, it had to be preceded by much hard work throughout the state. Hundreds of pieces of material describing the need for the bill had to be distributed﻿41
LMM: (ccmt.) to organizations and individuals. Hundreds of letters had to
be sent by citizens to their legislators, to public service organizations, and especially to the public welfare committee which was the committee handling the bill. There was a feature article in the Boston Sunday Globe relative to the measure. There were reports in all of the Boston newspapers, TV and radio stations on the day of the bill's hearing before the state welfare committee. This mass media coverage was followed by newspaper and TV editorials.
The bill was reported favorably out of the 'Public Welfare Committee and sent to the House Ways and Means Committee. This was a very difficult committee from which to obtain a favorable response since an appropriation of money was requested. It is generally Tecognized that Ways and Means Committees are notoriously difficult hurdles to surmount when appropriations of funds are involved and therefore more intense activity was put forth by the Massachusetts Committee on Children and Youth Organization in an effort to obtain a favorable report. Every member of this committee was sent a copy of materials which described the need for this legislation and why it should be enacted. Again, letters were sent to the committee in increasing numbers by interested individuals and organizations. So that when the Ways and Means Committee was about to make its report, every member of the House of Representatives was sent material about the bill, and citizens from all over the state were urged to contact their representatives. The effectiveness of this kind of intense effort was demonstrated when the bill was not only reported favorably out of the Ways and Means Committee, but was passed by the House of Representatives without a dissenting vote.
CG: Wonderful.
LMM: And was sent to the Senate. And was passed by the Senate with a large majority.
CG: That's almost unheard of.
lMM: On July 20, 1962, this bill was passed and signed by Governor John Volpe. The act was to take place, that is, become effective, January 1963. Activity related to the passage of this act, I consider one of the highlights of my professional career, together with the ongoing activity involved in opposing efforts by proprietary groups in the state to weaken some of the protective provisions of the rules and regulations developed by the implementation of this law. In the light of implementation experiences of the rules and regulations, there have been changes and modifications and revisions. Under the Office for Children, a task force had been set to work on these issues. Just within the past two years, in 1976, I was a member of a task force group engaged in the task of revising the rules and regulations. My role was to give a long view of the intent of certain issues.
CG:
Yes. What were some of the things that the Office of Children, or people wanting modifications, questioned that you were able to give input...﻿42
LMM: Some of the modifications were space requirements. We required thirty-five square feet per child. This offered hardships for many operators of day care services to provide this, especially those who had tried to turn their homes into places for group care. There was___
CG: This is the total area of the school, right, you're talking about, thirty-five square feet per child?
LMM: That's right, the total area. But it had to be enough space to allow for the variety of activities that young children engage in. This was the indoor space. There were many complaints that the requirement of outdoor facilities, which amounted to about seventy-five, if I remember now, square feet, because there were many places that had no outdoor facilities, where young children might go out for the vigorous play necessary for exercise of their big muscle activity. The educational requirements of personnel... Some of these people thought of it as a hardship. Many of the people conducting half-day group service, where children were taken more or less for socialization rather than long day care, felt that the teacher educational qualifications were too strict. Some were not even high school graduates, and the rules and regulations required that any person operating a group care for children must have at least one course in child development.
CG: That's all?
LMM: That was at the beginning of the implementation of the law, but as time
went on, more educational requirements were added. But these were some of the concerns for many of the people we call "proprietary owners." Some of these requirements made making a living through day care more difficult. This was a community attitude that had to be changed by positive action... by such positive action as through the providing of low-cost extension courses by the state Department of Education in many aspects of early childhood education and program management . These courses would meet the licensing requirements for all personnel. Licensing agents performed a dual role of helping the operator to meet requirements of the law.
CG: xn other words, the agency would send someone to them to teach them.
The state and local health departments would send out their licensing agents to perform a dual role of showing these operators of child care programs how to change and improve their programs in order to meet licensing requirements as well as licensing the facility.
CC: That's an incredible accomplishment in terms of providing help for people, too...
LMM: it wasn't the negative approach, because here were children who had to be cared for, and consideration went into that. . To, the credit of the licensing authority which had been put under the Department of Public Health, very few places had to be closed down because of the failure to meet licensing requirements.
CG:
Because I was thinking, you were talking about the space requirements; actually thirty-five square feet is only six feet by six feet.﻿43
LMM: Per child. When you put thirty-five square feet per child, that would mean that you had to lower, in some places, the numbers of children that could be cared for in a given space.
CG: But it's still not that much space.
LMM: No, it was adequate, and an accepted national standard.
CG: Now these sixty-five square feet outdoors, was that per child?
LMM: Yes, that's right.
CG: That's a space of eight by eight. Did they eventually change those requirements or do they still stand?
LMM: Recently, within 1976, new revisions have gone into gffect. The new requirements are seventy-five square feet per child.
CG: That is quite an accomplishment. I'm just curious, because when I'm
listening to the philosophy of the way the licensing agency is established, I can't help but think it's just so humane. Many people, when they engage in crusades to change a wrong, do not identify with the problem of the opposition, the way you and your group did.
LMM: Because the care of children was our target, and better care of children was our goal,	it didn't matter how perfect a licensing agency was
set up, we had to be concerned with the people who would be giving the care. And this was all a part of one package of improving standards.
During the early sixties, I was beginning to play with the idea of retirement. In 1963 I had submitted my resignation, after acting as executive director for the last eighteen months of my identification with the Associated Day Care Services. During these years, between '50 and '60, I was guest lecturer before classes at the various teacher education colleges, the departments giving majors in early childhood education. In the fall of 1965, I was working part time with Associated Day Care while they were looking for my replacement. I was asked by Wheelock College to join a faculty which they were trying to establish, to train Peace Corps volunteers who were going to work with young children in Tunisia. This would be a three-month intensive training program. The volunteer personnel to be trained would be college graduates or late college dropouts. The part that made this such a challenging and stimulating experience was the working with the Tunisian teachers who had been brought over to help orient this group to the customs and lifestyles and educational procedures of their country. The student and faculty interaction with these nationals gave a very meaningful dimension to this training experience and better prepared the volunteers for the job they were to do in the foreign country.
Office for Children, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 1976 Rules and Regulations: Licensure or Approval of Group Day Care Centers. {LMM]﻿44
LMM: (cont.) It was during this period in my professional career when I was in great demand in the northeast region as a speaker before teacher association groups, child welfare conference groups, as well as participating in panels and discussions and radio and TV appearances. But it was in 1965, when I thought my professional career was being terminated, that a new program for children was launched by the federal government, known as Project Head Start. This was a most exciting...
CG: In 1965, the new program was Head Start.
LMM: Yes. This sounded like a most exciting and innovative program in early childhood education. It was a program designed to meet the needs of thousands of children in our country who were living in impoverished, depressed, poverty conditions which prevented them from profiting by their school experiences. And it was thought that if there could be an intervention in the educational development of these children prior to their school experiences, their efforts would be more successful. And it was in 1965 when a group of experts in child development, early childhood education, social welfare, and health sat down to conceptualize what Head Start would be about.
There had been considerable evidence through research findings to validate the facts that children's deficiencies could be due to disadvantaged environmental backgrounds and home conditions, and that these could contribute to student failure. There was also adequate evidence to support the view that special programs could be devised for four- and five-year-olds which would improve their chances for achievement at the school level. It was clear that if the program devised was to be successful, it would have to be comprehensive, again involving activities in the field of health and education and social service. Those of us who had been involved in child care work, some twenty years before, had recognized the need for interdisciplinary professional efforts if children's potentials were to be developed. And so, as many of us know now, the goals of this program were to achieve improvement in a child's physical health and abilities, to help the social and emotional development of the child, to develop the self-confidence, spontaneity, curiosity, and discipline, as well as to improve his mental process,and conceptual and verbal skills. I was one of the team of educators who helped to launch the Head Start program in Massachusetts. I was a part of the team that organized the seminars and workshops, again, to train the additional personnel needed to man these programs.
After the program was launched, I worked in the ongoing development of the program for two or three years* Although appointed a national Head Start consultant, I confined my activities primarily to Massachusetts and the northeast region under the direction of Dr. Alice Keliher, famous scholar and educator in the ECE field. During this period I participated in organizing and coordinating ten-week training programs in Fall River, Roxbury, Dorchester, Framingham, Springfield, Falmouth, Boston, Cambridge, and 'Mashpee, as well as in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. The work entailed organizing seminars and workshops with teachers, and traveling over all parts of the state and northeast region. It meant monitoring, on a regular basis, some programs that needed considerable help.﻿45
LMM: (cont.) Looking back over more than five years of operation of the program, what we didn't really appreciate was the kind of effort and the amount of knowledge that it takes to intervene effectively in a young child's life; and with this program as with many others, there have been successes in some areas and failures in others, but in the overall I think it has been a good program. I engaged in this kind of work up until 1968, when I felt again I should begin tapering off my professional activity.
I was asked, however, about that time, to become coordinator of an eight-week course being sponsored by Wheelock College and the welfare department of the city of Boston. This was a child care aide training program, for a group of mothers receiving aid to dependent children. I shared coordinating responsibilities with a Miss Martha Chandler, formally on the faculty of the Eliot-Pearson School of Child Study at Tufts. This course was organized at the request of welfare mothers who wanted to obtain training in an area that would provide employment opportunities in day care centers and other child aide areas. The motivation of these mothers was eventually to become self-supporting and to get off the welfare rolls. At this time I was convinced that there should be an end to my professional work and turned down any other request for involvement, professionally, in the early childhood programs.
CG: I was just curious...you did teach the course, though, for eight weeks at Wheelock?
LMM: Oh yes, oh yes.
CG: And this was in 1968, this was during...
LMM: You see, I was almost seventy, then.
CG'- I know. I was just wondering, I was going to ask you something for the
record. I was just curious. During that period there was a lot of conflict and there was a lot of campaigning about welfare rights. You worked in a program with welfare mothers; what was your impression from your own experience working with welfare mothers?
^M: I would relate my impressions of the group that we worked with at Wheelock College. These were highly motivated young mothers who felt the restraints of living at such a low income level and wanted to acquire skills that would permit them to go out into the labor market and increase family income so that they could live at a higher standard of living than welfare permitted. I also found the other welfare mothers with whom I came in contact, as parents in day care center programs, to be fairly highly motivated for additional training, but needing considerable professional help in gaining insights in how to cope with many family problems that can be very debilitating and depressing. The role of the social worker on the staff of a day care center is critical in helping these mothers who are living with conditions of poor surroundings, low income, and all the problems that this combination of factors can produce. The help for those parents to cope with these kinds of conditions was very essential and an important part of the services of a day care center.﻿46
CG: So in a sense it was not just the child that you wanted to help.
LMM: The child attending a day care center is only one part of the service component. The essential work of a day care center is with the total family situation.
CG: Again, this reflects your philosophy of comprehensive care.
1-MM: It does, I think it reflects the philosophy about the comprehensive
character of the service of day care and that any organization seeking to carry on a day care program must have those comprehensive concepts as a part of that service.
CG: One other question, do you remember the Moynihan report?
LMM: The Moynihan report.
CG: Yes.
LMM: Yes, dealing with the black family? I remember, I have not studied that in depth, but I have a layman's reaction to it.
CG: Would you mind telling us what that reaction was then, or if it's altered, what it is now?
LMM: I cannot recall instantly all of the ramifications of that report. I only know,at that time, that I had a most negative reaction to it.
CG: But I really was curious about your reaction.
1>HM: Very negative. It did not meet with my experiences in dealing with families who need help. Certainly, well I'll put a period there.
CG: Last week when we ended, you were trying to retire, and Head Start came alongt
LMM: Yes. It was in 1965 that a new program for improving the life of the
disadvantaged child was launched and this program was called Head Start. For me, it meant again intense involvement in a very significant program. Motivation for this effort had grown out of accumulated evidence that many of these children who were having difficulty achieving at school were children who came out of an impoverished environment. Research was beginning to show that school failures among the children of the poor could be traced to the impoverished environment in which they were forced to live. There was also considerable evidence that the early years of childhood were the most critical point in the poverty cycle. During these years, the creation of learning patterns, emotional development, the formation of individual expectations took place. In some areas in the country there had been experimentation and research designed to improve opportunities for the child of poverty, and these experimentations had been effective in improving the school achievement of these children.﻿47
LMM: (cont.) So it was in 1965 that a panel of experts worked out the concepts of the program. This program was designed to meet several specific goals, to create an environment in which every child would have maximum opportunity and support in developing his full potential. The program was designed to be comprehensive in nature,and this would require extensive activities in the fields of health and social service and education. It was a program designed for the valuation of the child's abilities and deficiencies in order to correct these deficiencies and strengthen his abilities. Finally, it was a program designed to focus on the parent, as well as the child, in helping him with his school achievement, and a program that would give some attention and would be tailored to help improve community conditions.
The need to get this program implemented as quickly as possible was obvious. So there was considerable effort to recruit personnel and to train this personnel in order to meet the designs and goals of the program. As usual, the number of health and social service and educational personnel trained to work with young children was relatively small; the number trained to work with the disadvantaged child was even smaller. So in this area of the northeast region, and Boston in particular, the college personnel was asked to take the leadership in the training of the teaching personnel to work in the program. Since most of my professional life had been in work with families and children of the depressed areas in the city of Boston, I was at once recruited by the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study at Tufts, Wheelock College, and Boston University as a special lecturer and consultant to the training program being designed by these institutions. Early childhood educators were asked to give intensive training in eight and ten-week courses to personnel charged with the task of working with these children. Emphasis in designing these curricula was placed on the physical health and abilities of the children, their social and emotional development, and the development of self-confidence, spontaneity, curiosity, discipline, and self-control. Our aim was also to help the children's mental processes by encouraging their acquiring of certain skills: the ability to conceptualize as well as verbal ability.
During the summer of 1965, thousands of children in the Massachusetts area were enrolled in these Head Start programs. As one looks back on this era, one is apt to come to the realization that there have been successes and failures, but I think in the overview, the program has been a productive one. After the initial training period of that first summer, I became a national Head Start consultant and worked in the ongoing development of the program for another two or three years. I confined my activities primarily to Massachusetts and the northeast region under the direction of Dr. Alice Keliher, director of the program for Massachusetts. Dr. Keliher is a very famous scholar and educator in the early childhood education field. During this period, I participated in organizing and coordinating training programs of eight to ten weeks in various communities such as Fall River, Roxbury, Dorchester, Framingham, Falmouth, Boston, Cambridge, Mashpee, Lowell, as well as taking on consultation assignments in New Hampshire and Vermont.
In thinking about the Head Start program, I think of two basic contributions this movement has made to the role of early childhood education. We have﻿48
LMM: (cont.) learned that children cannot be compartmentalized into health and social services and education, and that programs for young children must be comprehensive in scope and coordinated in implementation. The Head Start movement has also taught us how to mobilize resources and involve a total community in the care and education of a child. I felt that was an important contribution of Head Start.
CG: Yes, it is.
CG: Oh, okay, I was going to ask you a question...now that we've talked in more detail about Head Start. It really exemplified your synthesis of your community work and your professional work. Can you go back and go over your career as a community person, as a person working for her people?
LMM: Well, one does have reflections about life's patterns of endeavors: I have discovered that many of my community activities have been at the beginnings of events, such as laying foundations, helping to build structure for programs, helping to change oppressive practices in organizations, helping to initiate meaningful programs in social agencies, and helping to establish standards of operation and guidelines for their implementation.
In an article that was prepared by a person for publicity of my activities, I found they used another word, "pioneer," "initiator," "establisher of structure," "catalyst." I began to realize that this was a very apt description of my activities, because as the programs were established, the philosophies that would undergird their operation accepted, and the basic principles that would be followed in their implementation settled, almost inevitably I would be asked to move on to another area, leaving the development of the program to other people.
I think of the five years which I served on the board of directors of the United Community Services of Metropolitan Boston. This was a new central planning body, not only for the monitoring and planning of community activities, but also for the appropriation of the funds which now are raised by the United Way. I was one of the first board members of the James Jackson Putnam Children's Center and the secretary of that board for several years, and that is, as you know, a child guidance clinic for preschool children. I was seven years a board member of the Boston YWCA, and we are going to talk about that in a little more detail. It was during the crucial period when that organization was being fully integrated and this program of activities made what was called completely "inclusive." I was a member of the small project committee which worked out the merger of the South End Federation of Settlements. Today we look at the beautiful new building called the Harriet Tubman House. This was the beginning of the unifying of several community agencies. I was among the small group of Roxbury citizens who helped establish Freedom House, and we'll go into that in a little more detail.	I gave many years to the support﻿49
LMM: (cont.) and development of its program. And then of course, the years as
president of the Boston Association for the Education of Young Children... and so on and on, with many involvements which we won't take up in any more detail.
I think the Boston YW demonstrates what we mean by being in the pioneer category of happenings in that organization. It was during the late forties and early fifties that I served for seven years on the board of directors of the Boston YW. I came on the board at the time when the winds had changed, they began to blow in regard to the racial practices of that organization; the YWCA practices were changing at the national level, influencing the changes at the local level. I had had a long time interest and identification with the YW, dating back to my college years, where I had served as president of the college campus body. During those years, the racial policies left much to be des ired. The separation of the whites and blacks was strictly followed by the national body. I remember the first national conference that T attended as a high school graduate was for colored students, and convened in Atlanta, Georgia.
So on joining the Boston's Y's board, I found that even in supposedly liberal Boston the national practices were fairly strictly followed. At that time black clubs of their own could freely use the facilities of the building except the swimming pool. But a change in attitudes and practices at the national level was beginning to take place, and the word "inclusive" was being used as a desired practice to be implemented at the local level. So the first step, when I came on the board, was to encourage racial mixing of the club groups, the craft groups, and the gym groups. The last program activity to become "inclusive" was the swimming pool. I took leadership in helping to effect these changes. The process was slow but steady,and the pressure never let up. I chaired the public affairs committee for several years and was eventually elected as one of the vice-presidents of the local board. These were the kinds of activities I engaged in that were not spectacular nor received publicity but were meaningful and had impact on community attitudes and practices. At one point there was a room in one of their buildings dedicated to me in recognition of the work that I had done for the organization.
CG; Can I ask you a question at this point? What kinds of opposition did you run into?
^HM; it was always very subtle. This was an arm of the national body. The national body set down the policies by which their local organizations would operate programs. Their justification was that they carried out national policy. But change was taking place at both levels for it to be affected.
How did you manage to get people to support you in making these changes?
LMM: Because the changes were beginning to take place at the national level, we had support there, and therefore we could bring more pressure, saying that there were these changes, that this was not the democratic way to do it, and not in line with national policy. And we used another argument: this was a Christian organization.. So we could appeal to Christian principles as another underlying reason for action.﻿50
CG: How do you feel now about them, because the YWCA is known now for having a national policy to eliminate racism?
LMM: More liberal policies have been constantly growing from those years.
Remember it has been nearly thirty years now, and there has been a constant change in attitudes and practices. And as one of the most influential Christian bodies in the country, both at the student and community level, there wouldn't be any other stand that the organization could take other than to be in the forefront of eradicating racism in this country.
CG: What do you think will be the future of a meaningful organization like the YWCA? In other words, the YWCA represents a strong, organized women's group.
LMM: I have not had identification now with the Y for some ten or fifteen
years, but I think the tendency now is for a mixing of the sexes in all areas of their program. So that we are finding in the YMCA women being admitted in all aspects of their program at both the board, staff, and constituency level. At the YWCA, males are coming to participate in program activities. The need for separation of the sexes is being eradicated, I think.
Mrs. Mitchell, how did you become involved with Freedom House?
LMM: I became involved through the interest of Otto and Muriel Snowden, the founders of Freedom House. They were getting a small group of citizens from the upper Roxbury area together to present to them some ideas that they had for the need of a program in that area dealing with community problems of a wide variety, such as housing, schools, police protection, and living environment. We gathered in a small room on Humboldt Avenue,where we would sit for hours listening to the dreams and ideals of Otto and Muriel Snowden, who wanted to develop a unique community program in what was known as the upper Roxbury area. This was to be a program that was different in focus and innovative in direction and approach. It would be a program focused on many aspects of community betterment, using the technique of involvement of neighborhood people in this effort of environmental improvement. We organized ourselves into what was known as a board of directors, and in those early years this group of local residents in the upper Roxbury area would meet. I think we might describe those early meetings as brainstorming sessions, where ideas were poured out by these two young people to this neighborhood group listening hard to see how their ideas might become realities. This board of directors recognized that it did have an important role to play in helping make the right decisions which would develop into a successful implementation. And again, as you notice, I find myself involved in the beginning of a program. And if I, in those early years, might identify one quality that that group of neighborhood citizens, known as the board of directors of Freedom House, had in those beginning years, it was faith. Faith in the ideas of these two young people, and faith that these ideas had viability and that their goals could be attainable. I remember when the momentous decision was made to erect a new building and the zeal with which the board and many friends went to work to unearth the funds to bring this new building into reality.﻿51
CG: This is still at the beginning of Freedom House?
LMM: This is a part of the beginning, because this would give the base from which the active program objectives could be implemented. One recollection of those years was the effective way in which the Snowdens could articulate their program philosophy for this institution. They were able to sensitize, I would say, and inspire large groups of concerned citizens to carry out specific activities. I think of one program aspect that was very appealing: it was a focus on upgrading the living conditions of the area. They also worked at inciting initiative and inspiring confidence so that people themselves could do something about improving these conditions. It was a philosophy of self-help, that the people themselves had power to change their environment.
CG: What were some of the specific problems...
LMM: Yes, it was exciting to be pait of a block organization that was needed to implement the drive for better housing and that resulted in what was called the Washington Park Urban Renewal Project. It was a superb demonstration of community organization. This was but one of many ways in which Freedom House has attempted and has continued to attempt to meet the varying needs of the area. Another area was improvement of the schools and organizing the community to bring attention to the conditions in some of the schools. I think the basic tenets of the operation of this organization was its ability to combine administration and community input to become a team which encouraged community members to pool their resources. I'm sure as we moved into this activity of the desegregation of the schools, Freedom House has played an important role by taking the initiative to help mobilize community support for many of the desegregation efforts. Perhaps one of the most gratifying experiences that I had, when I decided to move on for other community efforts, was that my son went on the board of Freedom House, and has continued to be a productive member of that board. Again, it is gratifying that the need for the involvement of residents of the community in the betterment of their environment can be passed on to one's children, from observing their parents as models in these activities.
CG: Oh, I was going to ask you, do you remember how you and the rest of the board raised the money to get Freedom House off the ground? What did you do?
LMN: There were applications made to various funds and foundations, fund-raising drives, and appeals to the affluent members of the white community. As the board developed, it became an integrated board of whites and blacks. That was how the money was raised for the erection of the building, and the use of the state and federal and organization funding programs. Very interestingly enough, Freedom House has never become a member of the United Way organizations. At the very beginning of the organization there was discussion of this. It was felt that some organizations in the community should be free from the restrictions that are an inevitable part of United Way funding, and Freedom House has retained that freedom from those restrictions.﻿52
CG: Can you give me some examples of how Freedom House's freedom, in the
sense of freedom from ties to things like the United Fund, has enabled it to really get things done, because that's what Freedom House is known for.
LMM: When I think of the first big project, of becoming a part of the housing development efforts. ..this was an area in which United Fund organizations at that time were not encouraged to take on activities of that scope. Agencies and programs supported by the United Way dealt with specific programs of human services.
CG: But not large, all-encompassing projects...
LMM: Not projects focusing on city services such as street improvement, housing, street lighting and cleaning, refuse pick-up, and police protection— that area of community activity.
CG: Do you think that Freedom House would have been able to do all that it
did for students in the Boston public schools if it had been tied to the United Way?
LMM: I think at this time that there's a liberalization of the activities in which United Way supported organizations can take part. I think that their work could be just as effective because there have been organizations within the Roxbury area, such as the Multi-Service Center and Lena Park, both have had very meaningful roles in the school desegregation issue, although they are also United Way agencies. United Way has to be careful about taking sides on controversial issues, since their financial support comes from people of varying points of view.
CG: How has Freedom House changed since you first started working there?
LMM: I wouldn't call it change, I would call it progress and a willingness to alter and moderate directions of program to meet the changing social needs as they have evolved. At one time those were the environmental conditions of that area, the need for new housing, the need for street...
CG: Municipal services...
LMM: Municipal services, and all of that, and when that was begun, there had to be continued monitoring. Then the need for an improvement in school conditions showed itself, which was even prior to the present desegregation effort, such as the improvement of the school facilities, and the attitude of the School Committee toward the staffing of the schools. We know of a period when in some of the schools there would be eight, ten, or fifteen temporary teachers during the year within one class. Those kinds of practices There had to be an organization which took the initiative to push for change in those kinds of practices. These are just examples. Freedom House takes a very large role now in helping to improve the conditions of the elderly in the area. They have an organization there of over three to four hundred senior citizens called the Goldenaires. There are weekly meetings at which one to two hundred come out for varying types of programs.﻿53
CG: That's wonderful. So in a sense Freedom House's freedom and flexibility has contributed to its ability to respond to community needs.
LMM: That's right, to whatever community needs there are to be addressed.
Continuing on these community activities... in 1956, I was elected president of the Boston Association for Nursery Education, and in accordance with the organization's constitutional provisions, I served two two-year terms. This election came after I had been on the executive committee of the body for several years. But on becoming president, I had several objectives which I wanted to attain during my administration. One of the goals was to increase the membership; another was to have the constitution revised and certain important provisions brought up to date; another goal was to improve the program activities of the organization by offering seminars, workshops, and lecture series in an effort to provide resources to the membership and to keep them up to date on what was happening in the area of early childhood education. Up to this time, this organization had been quite academically oriented, with membership confined primarily to the academic community.
One of the first things that I did was to get Dr. Winifred Baine, President of Wheelock College, to undertake the task of revising the constitution. A committee was appointed to concern itself with an active recruitment campaign for new members. This effort was very successful, since during the first year of my administration the membership was increased from about 85 to 175 members, and within a two-year period, that membership was doubled. During my administration, program offerings for the members were provided through public meetings, seminars, workshops and teaching clinics dealing with specific aspects of programming and parent-teacher relations. One workshop, on "What is a therapeutic community?" wus put on by hospital staff members of the Boston Floating Hospital. Then there was a ten-session course on tlhe influence of culture and environment on child development with leaders from the Harvard faculty.
To have been a part of the development and unfolding of the potential of this organization was a most gratifying experience. During this period, the organization began to fulfill the designs for growth, as laid down by the aims and purposes of the new constitution. So it is my feeling that an organization's design for growth is reflected in the meaningfulness of its activities and the impact of its influence on the community. And that the quality and the rate of growth of an organization is directly related to the amount of energy which is exerted by its leadership. Many expressed the feeling that this organization during my administration had achieved a measure of maturity and had been put on a level of professional growth.
I have a question. When you recruited new members...
LMM: We recruited the membership to include personnel in all sorts of young children's programs—in those proprietary centers, in nursery schools run in connection with colleges and in social agencies. We included kindergarten and health personnel in the membership. We included social﻿54
LMM: (cont.) workers who worked with young children and personnel doing research with young children. So that a wide variety of members was coming in with varied backgrounds and work experiences, but all dealing with young children. We encouraged parents to become a part of the organization.
CG: You democratized the organization.
LMM: Yes. That was one of the goals.
CG: Do you feel that being president of that organization, not only were your ideas and philosophies from your professional training involved, but also being a member of a community which required being constantly organized in order to help itself, do you think that was part of it?
LMM: Yes, that's very well expressed. There was need to include all kinds of people who were working with young children, not just those of the academic community. In such a mixed membership of persons from varying backgrounds and training,there could be an exchange of information, knowledge, ideas and experiences which would contribute to better quality service to the children. These were people who needed to be included so that they could have more professional growth and not be isolated.
I think of another community involvement that I had, which continues to the present, the Family Service Association of Greater Boston. I have had a longtime identification with this organization. My association with the organization began back in the middle of the thirties when one of their social workers came to provide social services to the Robert Gould Shaw House Nursery School. At that time, I was a member of their district committee. This was a group who represented a grass roots connection with the organization and helped to make service policy for the local district. There was a central office and then satellite district offices in various areas of the city. After some years, as a result of recommendations of a survey that we referred to earlier, this organization was merged with another family agency giving family service to the community, and it became a unified body known as the Family Service Association of Metropolitan Boston. Some years back I was asked to come on the board and since then, over a period of years, I've served on many of the committees of this agency, covering several areas of their work. At present I am vice-president of the board of trustees and a member of the executive committee, the long-range planning committee, and the homemakers' services committee. In 1964, I was given a citation by the agency for the years of service I had given to it.
I think there are many factors which have sustained my interest in this organization. First is the quality of their service that they give to families who come to them for help, the high professional standards they expect from their staff, and their emphasis on helping to relieve those social conditions which are damaging to family life. There is their flexibility in changing the focus of their services to meet changing social needs and family lifestyles. Recently, they added, as a new department, a strong advocacy program to change social conditions damaging to family life. As a family agency, they are interested in what is happening in﻿55
LMM: (cont.) the school situation because that has a direct bearing on the
quality of family life. They are interested in what is happening to the elderly in the community. They are interested in legislation that has an effect on housing and health services to the community, and they will give effective support to legislation in those areas of services.
CG: So in a sense they play a dual role, in other words they try to change the social structure.
LMM: But you cannot just meet the patient after he's ill, you try to prevent the illness, and the prevention is as important as the cure. These two things must go together, being able to meet crisis situations as they arise, as well as trying to alleviate those social conditions that precipitate crises. I've got some more. [laughter]
Well, the Boston Center for Adult Education is another organization to which I have given considerable time since my retirement. I am enthusiastic about this organization because of the unique service which it provides the community. Their program focuses on offering adults an opportunity for continuing education and self-enrichment. This is done through offering courses covering a wide variety of interests for short periods of time at a very reasonable cost.
The educational philosophy of the center is committed to the concept that educational needs and learning patterns of adults, many of whom are earning a living, raising a family, or have been retired, are different from those of college students. Experienced adults require different methods of teaching, they enjoy nontraditional classroom settings and supportive activities. The viability of this program is brought out by the fact that during the past year (1976-77) over 13,000 people have registered for their courses at this institution, and they offer over 200 courses in many areas of interest. In fall 1978, they had 5,000 registrations. These are noncredit courses. I served on this board for over six years and have been a secretary of the board of directors for four years. I've been a member of its executive and finance committee, and chairman of the nominating committee. I found it very rewarding to be identified with an agency which meets the needs of so many people in the community. But another appeal is that the executive director is a black woman who, as a member of the staff, has been responsible for the excellent course offerings.
CG: I was just curious...what year was it that you joined the Boston Association for Adult Education?
LMM: I didn't get the date down, did I? I'll have to look that up, I know it's
been six or seven years since...but I'll look up the date for you. However, I was just thinking: I've served two three-year terms on the board, and then I was elected to an office. Therefore, it must have been around 1970.
The Boston Association for Adult Education, was it not the first place that really provided education for adults?
^M: The Boston Center was established in 1932. But whether that was the first, I don't know.﻿56
CG: That's forty-four years.
LMM: Yes, that's when it was established, to provide continuing educational opportunities for adults. That was the purpose and it has continued to focus on that area of the adult population. For many years my husband was treasurer at the center and used to give a course there called "Law for the Layman." Very interestingly enough, many of the working population take courses there. The center offers courses that can start at seven or seven-thirty in the morning for a person coming to work. They offer courses in the middle of the day for a person that would want to come in and take an hour course during lunch time, as well as late afternoon, evening and weekend course offerings. And it's just a spectacular demonstration of the need of people for ongoing learning, growth, and self-enrichment. Now there's one in Cambridge that has a more spectacular record of at-- tendance than the Boston Center. So that what this says to us is the need for that kind of opportunity in our population.
CG: I think you get cross-registration between the two, also, because...
LMM: You do, yes you do.
CG: I'm going to take one course in the fall.
*
LMM: Several years after my retirement from the staff of ADCS, I was invited to join the board of directors. This was, I think, one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, because my association with this agency had come full circle. I had been one of the committee of five who designed the structure of the agency and helped to bring it into being. I had been a staff member for fifteen years and now was to have another identification with the agency on a policy-making level. Since becoming a board member, I've served on the executive committee and was urged to become an officer, which I declined. I have chaired many important committees, such as personnel practices. I was chairman of a committee for the revision of the constitution and bylaws, and set up a structure for more meaningful involvement of parents in center programs.
In the early seventies, I was asked to become a board member of the Massachusetts Association of Mental Health. The appeal in joining this organization was the opportunity it offered to become involved in a program that had relevance to some of the social problems of the Roxbury community. I immediately became a member of the local affiliate chapter known as the Fort Hill Mental Health Association of Roxbury. This group of local citizens had for some years been engaged in an uphill fight to get a mental health center built in the Roxbury community and after much struggle, many years, and much effort on the part of many citizens, a beautiful center was erected two years ago, known as the Solomon Carter Fuller Mental Health Center. Have you ever been there?
Associated Day Care Services of Greater Boston﻿57
CG: I've never been there, but I have heard of it.
LMM: You have? Oh, you must go and see it, because many meaningful programs
in the mental health area are being conducted there and your friend, Mrs. Dolores Good, is assistant director. She, before taking on this job, was a member of this Fort Hill chapter, and that's where I began to know her very, very well.
CG: So you were a part of the group that...
LMM: Not a part...I came in at the time to be a part of the community pressure that was needed at the time to get around all of the bureaucracy that was holding up the construction of this building. I think of one woman who deserves more credit than anybody for her continued effort, and that is Barbara Elam. Do you know the Elams?
CG: All I know is Judge Elam.
LMM: That is her husband. She was an inspiration for everybody. I declined very recently reelection for a third term on the state board, but I continue involvement with the local chapter.
Some years ago, there was the reorganization of the administrative structure of the executive branch of the state government, and a new bureau was established, known as the Office for Children. It became a bureau in which many services for children on the state level would be unified. This was in 1972. It was designed to meet the need for a coordinated system of services for all children up to age sixteen, and up to age eighteen if they had special needs. This agency would not only coordinate the services, but it would monitor existing services for children. On the state level, this bureau would be responsible for the development of comprehensive services to all children and their families. One of the functions of this office would be the licensing of all day care programs, group residential care facilities, and agencies that placed children in foster care. The office was also charged with setting up standards for the services in these areas.
At that time it was recommended that there be a statewide day care advisory committee. There were two state departments involved in the day care program, the Office for Children and the Department of Public Welfare, which was the actual funding agency. The purpose of this committee was to serve in an advisory capacity to these two departments, especially as it related to the issues of day care for children in the Commonwealth. I was asked to become a member of this state advisory committee, and I have served on this committee dealing with many complicated issues that we would not want to go into in this discussion of my participation. But it is an ongoing committee. Recently I resigned from it, as I am curtailing many of my activities now as the years go on. But I think the contributions made during the first few years of its existence have been meaningful ones.
CG: Before we finish...I'd like to ask you what you'd see as the most important area that you did work on while serving on that advisory committee, the most important accomplishment?﻿58
LMM: During that period, we revised the day care rules and regulations. A task force was assembled for that, and I was on that task force that spent several months revising the rules and regulations giving licenses to day care centers. There was a project dealing with the acquiring of an executive director for a day care licensing unit. I served on the search committee to get just the right person. That was very time-involving. The committee worked diligently screening people and then screened it down to three applications from about over a hundred, and submitted those names for appointment by the executive director of the Office for Children. That's two of the things that I did. I worked as a part of the advisory committee on setting up standards of what we call family day care, which is another aspect of day care that we won't have time to go into, but that is some of the work that I did as a member of the advisory committee.
Much of my work within the black community has been done through two women's organizations, the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and the Boston chapter of Links, Incorporated. The Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority is the oldest black women's sorority group in the country. It was founded in 1908 by a group of women students at Howard University. The purpose of this organization was to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards and to improve the social stature of the Negro woman—we used the word "Negro" at that time—and to promote unity and friendship among college women. There are now more than 400 chapters throughout the United States, the West Indies, and West Africa with more than 50,000 members. I was a charter member of the Boston chapter which celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1976, at which time I received a citation for my contribution of service to the Boston chapter.
CG: That was in 1976.
During the years as a member of that chapter, I held every office. For the purpose of this statement, I am concentrating on the program activities of the local Boston chapter. I think that these activities have been very, very meaningful. During those years we have given more than $50,000 in scholarship aid to undergraduate students. We have sponsored tutorial programs, guidance seminars, reading programs, clinics and what is known as black heritage programs. Individual members have done volunteer work in many black social agencies and encouraged black women to develop their talents in art and in music. On the national basis, the sorority has given to the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund over a half million dollars each and large sums of money to the Urban League. I have found working with this group gratifying. There's a variety of professions represented, lawyers, doctors, social workers, teachers, college professors, administrators for organizations, and women who work in the area of television and on important Boston daily papers such as The Globe and The Herald, so that it has been a stimulating group with which to work and to be a part of their activity.﻿59
CG: You were one of the founders of the Boston chapter.
LMM: I was one of what we call the charter members.
CG: One of the other things I wanted to ask you was, did you join the sorority originally when you were in school?
LMM: No, I did not join at an undergraduate level. At that time, many of the campuses of the predominantly black colleges did not have sororities. They were just beginning to be established when I graduated. This chapter that was started here was of graduate members. There had been two years earlier an undergraduate chapter established, because at this time in the Boston community, blacks were not admitted to white sorority and fraternity groups in the area. This was why black students established their own sororities and fraternities. I can get more material...
CG: Well, we can get some of that. One of the things which is so important... many people think that fraternities and sororities are social groups that help students when they're in school to study and get by on exams and to provide party time. And a lot of people don't understand the importance of sororities and the Greek letter association, things like that. I wish you could comment on that, why is AKA so important?
LMM: I think that it gathers the talents, the skills, and the abilities of large groups of women together in an organized group, where they can be more productive in giving of these skills and abilities to the community, perhaps more effectively than just as individuals. Although the giving of the individual effort is important, the organized effort can be far more effective in helping to effect change and to be useful in the community. College groups of black women such as the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority have made very meaningful and important contribution to the life of black America. I think I gave the statistics of the membership and the number of chapter groups within the country.
The local programs that the group has sponsored have been varied and very meaningful programs. In addition to raising some money for scholarships, they sponsor a tutorial program connected with one of the settlement houses, where the members of the Boston school teachers will go in on a regular, planned basis to tutor students who are having difficulties in school. Many of our students are having difficulty with reading and one of the members of our chapter is a reading specialist who has just been recently appointed principal of an elementary school in Boston. She heads up the committee that conducts these reading clinics. The black heritage program is a program designed for young people to help foster self-respect and confidence, and to teach something about the historical background of their racial group, and its achievements. There is a program that is conducted each year by the sorority for girls thirteen to sixteen years old,and they are concerned with their grooming and lessons in the social graces. Ongoing contacts are maintained with each group of teenagers in an effort to motivate them to continue their educational endeavors beyond the high school level. The money raised for the annual event, at which the girls are presented as "calendar girls," is given for scholarships.﻿60
CG: That is nice.
LMM: On the day that they are presented, they put on their long dresses and...
CG: Oh that just sounds so neat, something nice to have happen to you.
LMM: That's right. At this early age. We encourage career ambition so that these girls will be followed, going up through the high school.
CG: In other words, the sorority will keep after...
LMM: Will keep in contact.
CG: And will ask them how they're doing in school, and what kind of problems they have...
LMM: ...and maybe at some point we will give them a scholarship. You can see what this does to increasing pride in their self-image.
CG: Also a commitment toward professional objectives and goals in their education...
LMM: All of that.
CG: That's one of the reasons I wanted to ask you the importance, you know, some questions about the importance of AKA...
LMM: Well, I don't know where I left off, concerning the various professions that are represented?
CG: Yes.
LMM: I'd like to mention also that Elma Lewis is an honorary member of our
chapter, along with Marian Anderson and Coretta King, and Ella Fitzgerald... and several others whose names I can't recall.
CG: Of this local chapter?
LMM: No, Elma Lewis is one of our honorary members, both of the national and of our local chapter.
CG: I see.
LMM: Does that answer to some degree your question? You might be interested
to know the reason why we felt it necessary to get this chapter together. This was back in 1926. There were certain social conditions in the Boston community which indicated a need for the chartering of a graduate chapter. In Boston during the late twenties, there was considerable political, social activity within the black community. The population of blacks formerly residing in the West End had moved to the South End and was slowly spreading into the area known as lower and upper Roxbury. At this time, the number of black students attending the colleges was relatively﻿61
LMM: (cont.) small,and there was no participation of these black students in the sorority or fraternity life in white colleges. So feeling this lack, seven women at the graduate level came together because of mutual interests and concerns for what was happening, and formed an AKA graduate chapter in the Boston community. I had mentioned before, that two years earlier an undergraduate chapter had been formed.
The seven women who came together and were initiated as charter members of the chapter were Lois Allen, who was the wife of the secretary of the Boston Urban League; Edna Robinson Brown, who was a dentist and a graduate of Columbia Dental School, practicing dentistry in Cambridge; there was Carol Morrel Bruce, who was a graduate of the Boston University Law School, the second black woman admitted to the Massachusetts bar and the first black woman ever to earn a B.U. law degree; then there was Jessie Garnett, the first black woman to graduate from Tufts Dental School; there was Lucy Miller Mitchell, a day care agency administrator and a graduate of Talladega College, Tufts University and Boston University; Alice Turner Walton was a graduate of Howard University and a journalist at the black paper called the Boston Chronicle. And, there was Beatrice Berson Miller, she was initiated in the Alpha chapter of Howard University, married and living here at the time. Although she hadn't graduated from one of the local colleges, she had been a member of the chapter in Howard before coming here.
The group became very involved in many community activities and,in addition, there was an effort made to continue to develop the talents and the skills of the members of the chapter. At one of the first public meetings that we had, all of the program offerings were by the members; the poets, the essayists, the musicians, the painters, all participated on this program to show the accomplishments and talents of the group. We sponsored what we call vocational guidance programs over the years for high school students. That was continuing, back in the thirties when we had one of the first of those programs and every year since we've always had a vocational guidance program, once a year, for high school students. This first one was held at the Phillips Brooks House at Harvard and Richard Cabot was our first speaker on that occasion. On and on we might go, going through the various programs that have been a part of the ongoing activities of the AKA sorority.
I have another question. How important has the sorority been to you and other members in terms of your sharing strategies for having both professional and family life at the same time? In other words, remember you talked about your philosophy before concerning raising children and being concerned about family life and also professional commitments. And the other members also have professional commitments and families. Was the sorority important in sharing information on how people managed?
LMM: I don't think that we discussed that aspect of our lives. There was sharing of experiences in more or less an informal kind of way, but not in any focused effort. Most of the women within that group were women who were carrying on careers as well as families.﻿62
CG: I could see another consequence coming out of the training of teenage women. Do you ever get any feedback from women who have gone through the youth programs, regarding the sorors being role models for these younger women in terms of managing a family and a career?
LMM: No, I don't think I have observed a conscious effort to work with undergraduates on that aspect of family relationships. As graduate members, we interact on many ongoing meaningful issues with black undergraduate students in the Boston area.
There is a chapter at Northeastern University; one at M.I.T. which draws membership from Radcliffe and Wellesley; and a city chapter, drawing membership from the various other colleges in the area who do not have a large enough black female enrollment to form a chapter. This indicates a very interesting trend, that at one time we had only a city chapter because there were not enough black women enrolled in any one college in large enough numbers to have a chapter. Now we are at the point where we can have what we call campus chapters in addition to city chapters. This does indicate the larger college enrollment of black women on specific campuses, thus making new campus chapters possible. And in campus chapters, only students attending that college belong to that particular chapter.
CG: The other thing I'd like you to comment on, what is the relationship between Alpha Kappa Alpha and the other black women sororities?
LMM: At one time in the Boston area, we had what was known as a Pan-Hellenic group or council. This was a group whose members included all the sororities and fraternities in the Boston area. For some years the organization was dormant. I understand that in the past year there has been a revival of this body known as the Pan-Hellenic group. At the time when there was an active, flourishing group, once or twice a year there was a benefit put on by the unified body. The funds raised went for scholarships. This was a very meaningful kind of interaction.
CG: Could you tell me about your activities with the Links?
LMM: There is a national organization of black women known as the Links, Incorporated, with 162 chapters and a membership of 3,000, which was organized in 1946. This is another organization of black women with whom I work and whose activities are focused on the black community. The purpose of this organization is to improve the quality of community life through cultural programs, civic activities, and support of existing organizations such as the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), the NAACP, the Urban League, and the Sickle Cell Anemia Program.
Membership is drawn from women of varying backgrounds which is different from the sorority memberships. The Links organization is composed of women of what you might call the upper middle class of the black group. Many of these women are college graduates, but that is not a requirement of membership. Among the members are women of many skills, talents, abilities, and professions.﻿63
LMM: (cont.) It was formed at a time when the country was facing new concerns over human rights and social justice, at the time of the civil rights movement and movements. For more than a quarter of a century, this organization has expanded its program aims and goals. Currently, the focus of the program is not only a chain of friendship, but activities concerning meaningful social issues.
In the early years, its efforts were focused primarily on the support of those existing organizations I just mentioned earlier. The Links, Inc., has given thousands and thousands of dollars through their money-raising efforts to these organizations. For example, the organization just completed its $500,000 pledge to the UNCF. In the Boston area, through a very successful benefit that the Boston chapter conducts every year, we are able to give from $2,000 to $2,500 in scholarships to graduate students. Now the reason that we confine these awards to graduate students is because we found that that student had fewer resources from which to obtain scholarship help. This year, 1976 to 1977, we awarded three scholarships, two to two medical students at Tufts and B.U. and one to a law student at Boston University. During the years substantial donations have been made to local institutions and organizations, such as the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts, the Crispus Attucks Day Care Center, Concerts in Black and White, and of course the NAACP. We are beginning to give support to the revival of the Eastern Massachusetts Urban League here.
Each year we have a program known as "Freedom in the Arts." We put on an art exhibit at which we have an art auction of the works of local artists. This is an area you do not hear very much about, but it's one that is very meaningful. We have a program called Services to Youth,and on an individual basis we become very involved in the drug issue and teenage employment. In the area of national services,we are interested in what is happening in housing and of course in the whole health picture of the black population.
So you see here is an organization, again, that is meeting the needs in various areas that are not covered by many other organizations. We try to move in on those areas in which there seems to be a lack of effort. I think there is a place for the work of all of these organizations. We have two chapters around Boston, one in the Middlesex County area and then one right in the Greater Boston area.
CG: You mean two Links chapters?
LMM; Two Links chapters, yes. But in our chapter we have various professions
represented: lawyers, doctors, college professors, school administrators, social workers, teachers, psychiatrists, psychologists, women with various business backgrounds, agency and educational administrators—as well as the woman who does not have that kind of advanced educational background, the woman who has a lot of abilities to give to the community. There's a meshing of these women.
CG: These are all women...
IMH: These are all women. I remember there was an article prepared on the Links organization, a feature article in the New York Times, this was back around 1973, 1974, and it caused a lot of discussion because the﻿64
LMM: (cont.) reporter who wrote this article spoke about the "society-type" women who are a part of this organization.
CG: What kind of a stereotype did she project?
LMM: Well, I think if I get that article it would be very interesting for you...
CG: [after looking at the article] What is your reaction to the use of the term "aristocratic" to describe the organization?
LMM: I think that my reaction is that it can be used in a negative way. This group, not unlike many other ethnic and racial groups in the country, has persons who have been fortunate to have privileged opportunities and talents, thus acquiring the means to maintain what you would call the cultural ways of living. The impression might be given that these people withdraw themselves from their less fortunate racial members and are not willing to share what bounties have been a part of their life. I don't think that this is very true among the blacks. There is, however, this reaction when the word aristocrat is used. It implies isolation from the life experiences of the total black community.
CG: In a sense, do you think that if people weren't members of a group like the Links that brings together professional women and cultured women who are very concerned about the plight of black people, that people who had been privileged in the way that you describe would be even more distant?
LMM: I think that it's a role...this is one organizational effort. I feel very strongly about the meaningful role that fraternal organizations, fraternal, not fraternities. I mean groups such as the Masons, the Odd Fellows, the Elks, and the women's organizations related to them who come together for various purposes, such as fellowship, exchange of experiences, and the pooling and combining of efforts to help meet community needs. All of these organizations are equally important in the whole life structure of the black community, and they all play a very meaningful role.
CG: What you're saying is that using the term aristocratic implies distance. However when you get to the other half of the article, here are all of these programs.
LMM: That's right___and the first reaction from many of the chapters over the
country to that article, because it came out in the New York Times, was what was the reporter's aim in using that word aristocrat? Because I surely don't consider myself anybody's aristocrat, I'm just a human being.
CG: I use the society pages to teach my students sometimes about social class in America, and one of the things that strikes me about this article is that the women mentioned use their own names. They are talking about themselves and their own lives. This is so much different from the white women described in the society pages.
LMM: That's not clear.﻿65
CG: Usually, instead of saying Hermin, wife of Dr. Clarence Quepair, it would say Mrs. Clarence Quepair, it would never mention her own name.
LMM: Oh, I see, I didn't get the point that you were making.
CG: It strikes me as a very different kind of organization, that you have people who have achieved as well as people who have had privilege.
LMM: All coming together in an organization for interchange of fellowship, as well as constructive action.
CG: The members are aware of some of the inequities of American society, much more aware than other "aristocrats," if you use that term, would be.
LMM: I think that among the black group we are never permitted to forget the inequities of this society. We can never rise to a level at which you
are hot aware of what's going in the black community. I think this is something that is very characteristic of the life of the black person in this country.
CG: How did you happen to join the Links?
LMM: It's very simple, there was a woman who had a friend...was very friendly with the group down in Philadelphia, who started the organization, and the woman in Philadelphia said we are wanting to organize more chapters, would you try to organize a chapter of Links up in the Boston area? So this woman was a friend of mine and asked me to join. It was just as simple as that. And so I did, after hearing something about the aims and goals and purposes and activities of the organization.
CG: What else did you do after the State Licensing Law was passed?
LMM: I think one of the things that a person learns in being involved in
legislative action is that one's activities do not end with the passage of a law in whatever area of social action it takes. Much of my community activity for several years following the passage of this licensing legislation for day care was concerned with various aspects of implementation of the law.. There was the community interaction of citizen's groups with various state departments, in this instance the Departments of Health, Education, Mental Health, and Public Safety. The interaction of these departments needed backing from effective community committees and organizations. Many of my community activities-, related to the implementation of this law, went well into the 1970s, and involved work on various committees.
The Health Department was the department officially given the licensing authority, but it also entailed very close cooperative work with the Department of Education and Public Safety. Immediately on the passage of the law, the Health Department itself recognized the need for involving as much community action as possible, since one important aspect of implementation had to do with education. And so one of the first requests from the licensing authority, which was the Health Department, was to ask the colleges to cooperate in designing courses which would help day care﻿66
LMM: (cont.) personnel to meet the requirements of the law. Therefore, a committee was set up, known as the Advisory Committee for Day Care Service Education. A committee was assembled by the Department of Public Health. It included the cooperating colleges—Boston University School of Education, Eliot-Pearson School of Child Study at Tufts, Wheelock College, a representative from the Associated Day Care Services (which was Lucy Miller Mitchell), the University Extension, and the Massachusetts Private Preschool Association...
CG: Was that the University of Massachusetts extension?
LMM: No, it was called the Division of University Extension under the state Department of Education. Now the function of this committee would be to set up courses and find resources where courses already existed for personnel working in day care centers. The concern centered around the content and administration of the classes, suitable and available for day care personnel who did not qualify under the state regulations.
The committee dealt with the issues of noncredit courses, with fees, with the recruitment of personnel and day care programming, even to the careful wording of the titles of courses so that they would be attractive and appealing to the rank and file of day care workers. Contacts were developed with home economic departments of the University of Massachusetts and the state colleges. Boston Association for Nursery Education was asked to plan and set up a series of institutes and seminars in various parts of the Boston area. The Department of Public Health was interested in the cooperative effort in the direction of the health needs of day care center personnel. The need for training on a basic elementary level was soon apparent as the content of courses had to be simplified, because many of the people who were working in these day care centers did not have even elementary basic schooling. You see, this was a social condition we discovered. I thought that was...
CG: Was this before or after you had expanded the membership base of the Boston Association?
LMM: Yes, but that was only within Boston. Now, we're dealing with the state level here.
This advisory committee on in-service education, to meet the needs described above, designed training courses to cover the following areas: adequate physical facilities, teacher qualifications, child development, program administration, parent-teacher relationships, and day care educational programming. All of this was to meet the needs of many untrained teachers in the field who were doing child care work. This committee also had to set up some courses for the instructors who would be teaching the day care personnel, because it meant dealing with a type of mature, adult student, but on a very elementary level, for which many of the instructors had not been trained. That was very interesting. When it came to dealing with these instructors, we were fortunate in obtaining the services of Dr. Malcolm Knowles, a specialist in adult education and at that time identified with Northeastern University.﻿67
LMM: (cont.) But in the space of ten months, the committee had provided more than twelve series of courses in varying parts of the state, which provided opportunity for many day care workers to qualify for the teaching in day care centers under the rules and regulations of the law. With a few additional meetings to evaluate the plans which it had established, the committee considered its work finished and a staff member of the Department of Education took on the task of supervising and monitoring the program.
In 1968, it was apparent that an official standing committee was needed. Accordingly, an advisory committee was appointed under the Department of Education. Dr. Kiernan, the commissioner of education, asked me to be a member of that committee.
CG: What made them realize that they needed to have a standing committee?
LMM: Because having just one staff member, not accountable to, again, a community backup committee, there were complaints that courses were not being effectively administered and monitored. It appeared that a committee of community people was needed to give support to the staff person and to monitor the effectiveness of the program. This committee was composed of the following people: Dr. Abigail Adams Eliot, founder of the Nursery Training School which became the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study, Tufts, was made the chairman; and a Miss Martha Chandler, professor at the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study; a Mrs. Marjorie Maynard, who was chairman of a home economics department of the David Hale Fanny Trade School; Mrs. Margaret Joy, executive director of Lowell Day Nursery; Dr. Alice Keliher, consultant to the United States Office of Child Development; Lucy Mitchell, former educational director for the Associated Day Care and former educational consultant for the national Head Start program; and a staff person of the Department of Public Health.
This committee helped to develop guidelines for the various course offerings, it helped to recruit personnel for the courses, it helped to monitor them and to make surveys as- to the geographic distribution of requests for courses statewide. The committee wanted to know why requests were not being made from certain areas, because we knew that there was personnel in those areas that needed these courses. It was a backup for the licensing authority to have a committee of this caliber working with them. And so we stayed in existence until 1974. With the expansion and demand under the university extension...because these courses had to be reasonably priced and they had to be enticing enough that the personnel, even after they had complied with the elementary or the minimum educational requirement of a course in child development and day care programming, would want to go on in the developing of their skills.
CG: In a sense you can look at your activity here and look at all your other
activities and say that you've always been working to educate people and to bring people together around issues of education.﻿68
LMM: Well, the work has been education as it related to child care.
In 1972, this moves on to another instance of backups...of an implementation of a law. The licensing law then had almost ten years of implementation to demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses and its needs for revision. Once during that period, a minor revision of the law had been made, but nothing that essentially changed the legal provisions through legislation. But in 1972, another bureaucracy was created called the Office for Children. Do you know about that one?
CG: Yes, I've heard of it.
LMM: And it was formed in response to the need for a coordinated system of
services for all children up to age sixteen. The office's function covered the coordinating and monitoring of existing services for children and documented the needs or the gaps in between. Coming under this Office for Children was the licensing function, which up to this period had been under the state Health Department. Now that function would be transferred, the licensing and standard-setting function as it related to day care, would be transferred to the Office for Children. Licensing all day programs, group residential care facilities, agencies that placed children in foster homes: all of these types of functions required standard setting and licensing and would be administered by the Office for Children. At the time the day care advisory committee went out of existence, and its functions were taken over by the Office for Children.
CG: This is the committee that existed until 1974.
LMM: That's right. When the Office for Children was established, another
statewide advisory committee was set up. The purpose of this committee was to serve, if I can quote from one of their bylaws, "in an advisory capacity to the Department of Public Welfare and the Office for Children and the State Advisory Council concerning day care issues concerning children in the Commonwealth." I was asked to come on that statewide advisory committee with these very important functions. This committee was asked to continue not only program development in the day care field, but fiscal policy, and legislative mandates. They would review and respond to and make recommendations regarding all new policy to be promulgated by the Department of Public Welfare, the Office of Children, as related to day care. So that was another involvement.
CG: It's funny, if this is after the time when you were trying to retire, you were just as busy as ever!
LMM: [laughter] Well, this day care advisory committee was not a strenuous assignment for me. My primary role, as I look back on it now, was to provide historical perspective to the general committee, explaining why, at a given point, certain actions were felt necessary and giving perspective in the light of changed social conditions, needs, and demands for standards. We examined changing attitudes toward standards, both those that ought to be rigidly maintained, and where flexibility could be exercised. This was the role, more or less, that I played on that committee. Very recently I felt I had made my contribution and I did not accept the request for reappointment to that committee.﻿69
CG: In general, I guess what I would like is an opinion of some of the current thrusts in day care...
LMM: Well, one of the important functions I think that I had during this period, as a member of the statewide advisory committee, was a very recent revision of the rules and regulations relating to licensing, not only of day care as it related to the preschool child, but also to the toddler and programs known as family day care. Now I worked on all three of these revisions, each of which would be different in certain aspects. Task forces were set up and we would meet on a weekly basis over a long period of time. Some revisions I agreed with,and some I felt very depressed about. However, I am two generations removed and I have to take into account the change in attitudes and emphasis in many areas of child care. I'm willing to accept the need for the flexibility that we did not see at the beginning, when there had to be more rigidity written into the law, in order to make the spectacular change that was necessary for improvement of standards.
I think that the one area of regression, as I see it, has been in the requirements for the educational preparation of people who take care of young children. I think that I was very disappointed with this aspect after the task force had finished its work. There was a process of having hearings in various sections of the state, testing the reactions to the revisions suggested by task force job before the final promulgation would take place by the Office for Children. These hearings revealed that because there had been such an expanding demand for day care in every area of the state, that more flexibility should be exercised in the area of teacher qualifications. Only minimal educational preparation beyond high school is required. Space requirements were made more flexible.
CG: Just how minimal was this new educational requirement?
LMM: Teaching credentials were reduced considerably. Formerly, where we required at least some courses in child development and day care programming, some workers can now participate in day care centers with no special education for the job in dealing with young children. I must confess that I was very depressed because the one aspect that we worked very hard at was raising the educational standards and preparation of day care personnel. This was done in order to increase their understanding of the developmental needs of the young child. This is a trend that is not just confined to Massachusetts. It has been quite nationwide. The university extension courses that we labored so hard to make possible in all areas of the state were eliminated because of costs. So that in many instances there is a rationale now which says that a person not in the administrative area only needs love for children. Well, we know that that has its limits. Being warm and loving is a very essential quality, but you need to back it up with some educational preparation.
CG: LMM:
So in a sense, you're saying.
Well, I've seen a regression in that area, and I don't know what will be the result, but there is that trend.﻿70
CG: I'm wondering if some of that regression could be a reaction to the attacks made by academics against various programs that were part of the poverty program?
LMM: It could be, or it could be that the demand for the service is great and
that there is not enough adequate personnel, adequate in the sense of educational preparation. And so, we took what we had to meet the need.
CG: Do you think that if the people who are demanding day care services would
take more of an interest in seeing that the people who are caring for their children were educated, that some of this regression would be stopped?
LMM: I think it may be tied up with that as a social force and some other social forces. I think that the whole direction which we can talk about a little later of the women's movement—to get the woman out of the home and give her an opportunity for fuller development than just being involved with childrearing and iiomemaking, that is moving out from the home into the workaday world—certainly created a need because somebody needed to take care of these children. I don't think there was recognition of the fact that there was a limit to the number of personnel available to give quality care to these children. And there again we go off on a tangent in one direction without giving balance to what effect it's having in another direction. The emphasis was on getting the woman out of the home and into the workaday world if this was what she wanted. Little consideration was given to the reality of the limitations on child care resources and personnel. There were private and nonprofit day care service of various varieties: infant and toddler care, family day care, as well as group preschool day care. With the expanding need, there was the willingness, as I've said before, to cut corners. Quality had to be sacrificed.
We had another interesting phenomenon developing. We always had what was called the profit-making day care centers and nursery schools, but recently we've had a spectacular increase in the profit-making area. Not only is it quite profitable for individuals to set up this service, but corporations have begun to move into this area. Many of these programs meet the very minimum of licensing requirements,but the minimum do not always provide the best quality of care. There doesn't seem to be as much community pressure as we had some fifteen years ago, when the licensing bill was first passed. There is now the political pressure of the people who belong to what we call the proprietary group,and they can bring pressure on licensing regulations that they find too difficult to meet.
CG: And still make a profit.
LMM: Yes, so that not only do you find your day care people having to bring
pressure to continue improved standards, but they also have to be on the alert for pieces of legislation being filed that will weaken certain aspects of the law so that profit making can be increased. I also wanted to mention that the Massachusetts Committee on Children and Youth (MCCY) had an ongoing role in the implementation of the law. By 1968 this statewide organization felt that it needed to monitor legislative bills. The﻿71
LMM: (cont.) organization set up a committee with people from all parts of
the state with interest and concern in the area of child care. This committee monitored and gave close attention to legislative bills that might be introduced that would weaken provisions of the existing law. It worked with the state departments involved to develop a comprehensive plan for day care on a statewide basis. This meant the reorganization of the committee to give a wider base of support. This committee was to be expanded to include not only day care educators and health personnel dealing with the program, but labor, industry, public relations, Head Start, mental health and public safety representatives. I was asked to chair a subcommittee of this group, called the Functions Review Committee of the MCCY. This Functions Committee brought in a set of recommendations that reorganized this statewide committee.
I have here a letter that corroborates the involvement, and it's from the "chairman of the day care committee. It says, "Dear Lucy, I'm sorry to have been so delinquent in not thanking you sooner for the wonderful leadership you gave to the Functions Review Committee. Perhaps I should cast some of the reasons for the delay in your direction. If you and your committee had not been as innovative and creative as you were, the reorganization would not have created such interest as it has here at MCCY and throughout the state."
CG: Again in that involvement you see the theme of your working to include more people around the issue. It's almost as if you've worked all of your life to get the world to understand that caring for children is a very, very serious and important work.
LMM: And it means a wide community support of all aspects of what we consider our societal makeup.
CG: Oh, I think that was very important, because again you see the theme that through organization you work to include people who have a basic interest in children and you've never used your professional contacts to exclude people. That's very important. Because many people do, when they become professionals. They will go to the point of excluding people who aren't quite as educated»and you've worked to include those people.
LMM: There is need for that total community involvement to give strength to whatever you want to do, for the improvement of the care of children. I was just thinking, again you see the kinds of things that I did were not the spectacular or the ones that would hit the headlines, but I feel that they were very essential community activities.
CG: It's interesting, because in looking at some of the material that's in the National Council of Negro Women which was started by Mrs. Bethune, the motto was "Lifting as We Climb" and in a sense,even though you never took over from Mrs. Bethune, you kept that ethic in all of your work.
LMM: It was part of what I grew up with as the value that was imparted during those years. The whole aspect that if I did not directly receive the mantle from her, there were contributions which I could make within whatever context and environment that I lived and worked.﻿72
CG: That was what struck me about your activities.
LMM: I think then we...
Does that cover most of the community activities?
CG: Earlier when we talked, you had also mentioned that you were involved in the birth control movement in Massachusetts...
LMM: In a very limited way. I do not want to take credit that I did a very extensive kind of job. My interest in it really grew out of a personal need, and with my second baby I developed a condition that kept me in the hospital for a long period prior to his birth. Then after he was born, about six months, I became pregnant again and as a result the kidney condition returned and my gynecologist recommended that I have the pregnancy interrupted. I went into the hospital and that was done. On coming out and talking to my internist about this, I asked what he would re-commend to keep me from getting pregnant again because it was a recurrence of ill health related to pregnancy. The only suggestion that he had to offer was abstinence. But to a young married couple in their early twenties and thirties, that did not really seem a practical or viable alternative. In a short time I heard about the Margaret Sanger Clinic, which was a clinic being developed in Boston to provide birth control information to the area. My involvement in the movement took the form of having meetings of neighborhood women in my home who wanted to receive information relative to the various devices coming into use at that time. Staff members from the Margaret Sanger Clinic would come and talk to these groups. I cannot pinpoint the year, but at sometime during this period the birth control activity by the Margaret Sanger Clinic became illegal in Massachusetts,and many women wanting to be informed about birth control devices on the market had to go to Rhode Island. In my early forties I developed a tumor and during that operation it was thought best that I have a hysterectomy. I did not pursue further activity in the birth control movement after that.
CG: Do you remember what prompted the legislature to pass such a law?
LMM: I think that was very obvious. I think it was the whole religious influence against any movement or action that would curtail the birth of children. It was related to the religious beliefs of this community where the Catholic Church influence was very strong. At this time, even the rhythm method was not acceptable to Catholics. It was later that it became an acceptable method to the Church.
CG: So, there were no Catholic women who were going to the Sanger clinics...
LMM: I was not identified that closely with the clinic to know the religious identification of the women using their services.
CG: That is just...it seems so incredible now! But then you look at what is happening today around the politics of women attempting to control their own bodies___it doesn't seem so shocking, but still it's outrageous!﻿73
LMM: Well, you know I did use birth control devices in those years. It was
not very popular; we users were in the minority in the Boston community.
CG: I had wanted to ask you your reflections on the different movements and
organizations you've seen arise in the black community with the objective of social change, freedom, and liberation?
LMM: My activities with predominantly black organizations, and I presume that is what you are referring to, and the programs designed primarily to meet the needs of blacks have been more or less the traditional ones: the NAACP, the Urban League, the United Negro College Fund, the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and the Links. I think the program emphasis and direction and focus of work have changed in all of these organizations to meet the changing needs of the times. I think particularly of the Urban League, if you remember in its early years of programming, it focused primarily on the economic and industrial conditions related to blacks, job opportunities, and getting black people involved in a wider span of employment. You find now they are expanding into many other fields. They are now in the area of civil rights which for a long time we thought was the exclusive preserve of the NAACP. That's just one example. I'm not an expert in all of the goals, but I have always supported, through membership, both organizations.
CG: The Urban League and the NAACP...
LMM: Oh yes. I have not been active in the sense of being on committees and
all of that. Mine has been more of a monetary support. As it came to the Martin Luther King civil rights movement, I worked on the fringes of that. What I mean by that is my activity was primarily in supporting the local protest marches and the rallies and helping to raise funds to send people to Washington to the big protest march that they had there. That was the form of my activities. I have never been a part of what was known as the militant movements, such as the Black Panthers. But I don't think women were in the Black Panthers?
CG: Yes, they were.
LMM: Or those movements spearheaded by the younger groups.
CG: Yes, I was going to ask you what your reaction was to the era that was ushered in by Stokely Carmichael and other urban militant groups.
LMM: And also the...what's that other one, not the Martin Luther King...
CG: SNCC. Student Non-Violent...
LMM: Coordinating Committee... and all of that. There were aspects of these organizations' work that I felt were very needed at that time. I felt that sometimes I did not approve of the violence involved, but I think the dramatic thrust of certain things can be a useful device to call attention to a crisis condition.	I think that those young people
played a role there in calling attention, in this dramatic way, to very deep needs of the black community.﻿74
CG: What was your reaction in the sixties when these militant urban movements that you mentioned, such as the Panthers, also gave rise to a lot of nationalism? That's another thing I wanted to ask you, do you remember the Garvey movement at all?
LMM: Oh, the Garvey movement I remember very much, because I had a husband who was very sympathetic to the Garvey movement. I do not relate this to add a sense of humor to it, but when Garvey was organizing and buying the boats to take the large contingent of people to Africa, my husband not only was a fairly good contributor, monetary-wise, to it, but he was at that moment trying to convince his family that we ought to pull up stakes and go to Africa, so that he had a very strong feeling of support for Garvey and what he was all about.
CG: In the light of your remembering that, what did you think in the sixties
when people came out again pushing for the population to look toward Africa?
LMM: Well, not being sympathetic toward the Garvey movement which I did not embrace, in later years, I still do not embrace this drive to Africa.
CG: How are things, in the way that people work within the community, how are things different now, than they were, say, when you first started your work, when you first started working with the Links, and Alpha Kappa Alpha, and the NAACP?
LMM: I think the direction and the focus of activities are different. Action now is designed to meet the current needs of our racial group. As you will recall, our more militant civil rights thrust during the Martin Luther King time was to attack conditions and issues from outside of the system. Now there is a tendency to effect change. There is one very spectacular change from tactics used by the student movement, to protest the war and other social conditions some four ox five years ago. Look at the difference in the strategy of then and now. I think, from what I can read and from what the younger people are writing about, that the tendency now is to bore into the system and use the system from the inside rather than attacking the system from the outside.
CG: In a sense we've exhausted that mechanism and now it's got to be...
LMM: Yes. Well, we know how quiet the campuses are now. And sometimes I
think that we are apt to forget too soon. I think an excellent example of that has been our Kent State situation right now, when we shouldn't be allowed to forget something that was as tragic as that was. But isn't it human nature to try to put unpleasant things behind us, to hide them?
CG: I was wondering what your reflections are on the women's movement?
LMM: Well, I really heartily support it. I guess you might label me a feminist, if one can be a feminist at my age. I heartily support the aims and the goals of today's thrust of the women's rights movement. I certainly support the Equal Rights Amendment.﻿75
LMM: (ccrat.) I do not always agree with the militant tactics or strategies that the younger leaders use at times to achieve their goals. I think that they, as a result of the unusually agressive methods that they use, arouse more opposition than support for their cause. I am opposed to the effort of some of the leaders of the women's rights movement to downgrade those women who find the role of homemaking and parenthood rewarding and have no ambition to join the outside workaday world. They find this fulfilling. I question the thrust and the drive, the agressive activity toward getting women out of the home, whether they want to move out or not. It's very interesting. In the past few months, there has been this organization started to support homemakers and housewives who find it fulfilling and rewarding to stay home.
CG: In a sense, when you talk about your feminism, your feminism really is expressed in the movements in which you involved yourself, that looked
upon the work of caring for children as a dignified calling.
LMM: That's right. Absolutely. And at the time when we were into it, the
feeling was that it was just advocating another baby-sitting kind of cause. That's why we had to elevate it to a professional status, with as much training and education required to carry it on effectively as you would have in any other field. So that is my feeling about the women's movement.
CG: Also, to go back to your involvement in the Margaret Sanger Clinic, that's another aspect of feminism which is being forced to emerge again these days, in our demanding the right to discuss it with our doctor without the state interfering.
LMM: Yes, yes. I think this is a healthy trend. Whatever interaction that the woman has with other professions,but especially with her physician, as it relates to certain operations on her body, especially do we find now, as you know, a lot of discussion on the rights of women concerning breast removal. It is the same basic principle as to whether a woman wants to have a child or not.
CG: Yes, here we are again at these pivotal points in history.
LMM: Yes, yes.
CG: I also wanted to ask you about your reflections on the black family
and also your reflection on the role of black women, because the two are quite linked. First, I'd like to hear your reflections on some of the problems confronting the black family?
LMM: Well, I think at this moment in our social history, there is confusion about even an appropriate definition of what is a family. I think that as a part of the social environment of this country, whatever those forces are at work in any area will reflect on the black family as it would on any racial or ethnic group. So that whatever is obtaining now as to an adequate definition to cover all of the arrangements between men and women and children would apply to the black family as it applies to all﻿76
LMM: (cont.) the other families. There may be some special aspects related to the black family. Of course we know the traditional family of the mother and father and the children. We have many family arrangements today.
For instance, a couple of two singles that's what I'm trying to say, who live together and have children without benefit of marriage, that would be called a family. Again, we have the unmarried mother who lives with her child, that is a family. Or the single married or unmarried father who has the child now and rears his child without the benefit of a mother. Would you call that a family? We would. The single woman who adopts a child is another arrangement. The father who has custody of the children, where we've always thought traditionally the mother was given custody, is a family without a female influence, just as in the other you have a family without a male influence.
So all of these groupings are referred to as families, and I think that we have those within the black family as we have in other families, although perhaps not to the same extent. I think, however, that between the nuclear family, as it relates to blacks, and the multi or extended family household, including not only mother, child and father, but also grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins...I think we may have more of that extended family pattern, I'm not sure of this, not being a sociologist, than we do of the strictly nuclear family.
CG: We have a larger proportion of extended families.
LMM: That's what I thought. Some time ago, and maybe you know more about this, I read an article about an anthropologist from the University of Illinois who made a study of the black family, and their findings showed that the traditional black family is not "structurally derived from white family patterns necessarily, but rather the black family has a unique cultural form, involving its own inherent resources." That was a quote from that. I think they found that in the American family, the structure of families is quite variable and as we've said before, with the extended family structure being perhaps in larger numbers. What I would like to say about the black family is that whatever problems are affecting families in this country today, also affect the black families. The family with not enough income cannot maintain good family conditions. Poor schooling affects children and their behavior and makes it very difficult for parents to have the controls that they used to have. Such social influences have their impact on the black family, as on other families in the country.
I have some strong feelings about the role of families in children's lives, and I think that the influences that enter into a family's childrearing practices may take many faces. Chief among them is the parents' own childhood experiences and the values they received from their parents. It is generally agreed that, in addition to being a source of care and nurturing, a family is the primary source of values which influence a child's conduct, behavior, and attitudes toward life's experiences. I think of the values of integrity, honesty, affection, sensitivity, compassion, dependability, respect, appreciation, a sense of responsibility— these kinds of values—values that are transmitted in the family group.﻿77
,MM: (cont.) I don't think there are any other forms that can do as effective a job in transmitting those kinds of values as those from the family. Children must see these values being lived and practiced, as well as preached, and it's only in that family context that children can get that kind of experience: interaction between mother and father and children and grandmother, if she's in the picture. When they see this practiced, they know that it is possible to achieve. It is my strong feeling that there are certain important responsibilities which the family cannot delegate to other institutions. By that I mean schools, the churches, the community. The family just cannot delegate those basic tasks because other institutions cannot do this value transmitting. This is just a point of view about which I have very strong feelings. I think these other institutions have a role to play, but that the primary influence in a child's life is the family. And through the method of action rather than preaching, parents may also pass on to their children a feeling of obligation and responsibility to become, as they grow older, involved in community activities, and to contribute fj the better life of their fellow man.
In my married life, one important ingredient was that of communication, a willingness to share one's time and interest, thoughts and attitudes toward one's spouse—a need to be interested in whatever the endeavors of the partner. It was just as important for the wife to be really involved in the career of her spouse, as the male to be involved in a similar way in the career of his wife.
In my case, my husband became very active in the political activities of the Republican Party. He unsuccessfully at one time ran for state representative from the predominantly black district of Roxbury. Over the years he headed up the organizing of the black vote in several Republican campaigns of the state and national elections. This meant my traveling with him to attend conventions, state and national, local political meetings, and rallies. On many occasions he accompanied me to my parents' meetings or seminars which I was leading.
My husband died in 1966, after forty-three years of married life. The basic philosophy and attitudes which guided the practices we used in rearing our children must have had some positive effects on their lives. They both finished college; my daughter got an undergraduate degree from Talladega College and a master's degree from Radcliffe College. My son graduated from Bates College and Boston University Law School, and after a few years of law practice and government position, he was appointed as an associate justice of the Superior Court of Massachusetts, the second black man to receive such an appointment. They both have successful marriages: my daughter, thirty-two years, and my son, twenty-five years. Their children have graduated from or are well into their college careers.
CG: Mrs. Mitchell, I get the impression that you are also a very successful grandmother. Would you care to tell me about your being a grandmother?﻿78
LMM: I don't know that I would use the word successful, but having the opportunity to play the grandmother role has added another dimension to my life. I think there are several significant contributions that grandparents can make to the rounded personality development of their grandchildren. And the fortunate ones are those children who have opportunity for this kind of meaningful interaction with grandparents. I think one aspect is that children have an opportunity to watch and appreciate the graceful aging of human beings who are close to them. As one writer has so well expressed it, "Children with grandparents can watch them evolve from highly productive contributors to their chosen professions to exuberant pursuers of meaningful leisure activities in a well-earned retirement." As grandparents experience the joy of watching their grandchildren grow and develop, the children can learn about the effects of time. Many authorities on aging agree that the persons who have the least anxiety about their getting old and even about death are those persons who lived or had frequent visits in a multi-generation household, or those whose ties with all ages of relatives are firm.
Three times in my lifetime I had the experience of living in a multi-generation household. Once, as a young child, and twice as an adult. During the childhood years, there were four generations living in my grandmother's household: great-grandmother, grandmother, my mother and myself. This great-grandmother was for several years a constant companion of mine. It was she who would tell me stories about the family beginnings and from whom I have been able to recall facts about the family roots which I have already related. It was this great-grandmother who helped me make my doll's clothes or repair the broken toy or helped me bury the treasured canary. And when the final stroke rendered her unable to speak, I would sit by her bedside and tell her stories although she was unable to respond and perhaps not even able to comprehend.
When I became a parent, because of family circumstances, my grandmother migrated from Florida and came to Boston to live in my household, where my mother had been living for several years. Again, this was an experience of a multi-generation household which my children had the opportunity to experience. Again, four generations living under the same roof. The relationship between my daughter and her grandmother was a positive one. It was she to whom she went with many of her growing up problems, which she did not want to share with her parents, or to whom she could unload her feelings about her parents, especially when she disagreed about the child-rearing constraints which had been imposed upon her. This grandmother, who had an unusual capacity for the understanding of human frailties, played an important role in the way she related to her grandchildren, in contributing to their rounded development of their personalities. As they grew into adult life, my children's relationship with their grandmother expanded to that of friend as well as relative. They could discuss many issues with her; they shared with her many of their expanding life experiences. I remember the time when her granddaughter married, this grandmother was in a sanatorium and unable to attend the ceremony of this treasured granddaughter. So sensitive was this granddaughter to the disappointment of this treasured grandmother that a few days after her wedding, she took her wedding dress and all her accessories to the hospital, dressed herself in them so that her grandmother could see how she looked as a bride.﻿79
LMM: (cont.) I am sure that the quality and kind of relationship that I have had with my grandchildren has been influenced and colored by what I saw from watching what was possible in my mother's interaction with her grandchildren. My daughter and son and my in-law children have been more than generous in allowing me access to my grandchildren. From their infancy to young adulthood I've been permitted to share in the interaction with them at all of their developmental stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence and young adulthood. That experience has been one of the joys of my life and a source of much of my happiness. To have five grandchildren who are now in their late adolescence and young adulthood who can communicate with their grandmother on many levels of their concern is something to be treasured...from discussion of issues that are significant concerns to young people today, such as values relating to conduct, male-female relationships, issues relating to our society, racial matters, young people's attitudes toward sex and marriage down to sentimental Valentine cards, personal messages at birthdays and Mother's Day, long distance telephone calls when away from home. This gives an idea of the quality of the relationship. I'm unable to identify the ingredients which go into making such relationships possible. Perhaps it was accessibility for interaction with my "grands" during all of their growing up years: having care of them during parents' trips or vacation periods, being a part of meaningful events in their lives such as athletic events, special school programs, plays, concerts, holidays and birthdays and graduating celebrations. Rich indeed has been my experience in this phase of my life.
CG: Now how many grandchildren do you have?
LMM: Five. Here is an insertion, something that one of these grandchildren
wrote when she was about seven or eight years old. I cannot recall just the occasion for this, but I would like to insert it as an example of what is possible for grandchildren to express about their grandparents. One part of this is an address to grandmother, and this is what it says: "There's something about my grandma that is very special to me, she's very kind and understanding and sweet as sweet can be. She fixes me cold drinks whenever I am hot, and gives me hot drinks whenever I am cold. So I would say my grandmother should never be so old."
The poem to the grandpa was so significant in what it conveyed about the quality of relationship that it was read at his funeral as a part of a tribute to him: "There's something about my grandpa that is very special to me. He tries to do everything good and to be as helpful as can be. He tells me what I should know, to make my life grow. He is sweet and also nice. He is kind and gives me good advice." That's it.
CG: You're also very proud of your family, aren't you?
LMM: Yes, I am, I think I have reason to be proud of the success which they have had in pursuing their professional life. My daughter graduated from Talladega College and then did her graduate work,earning a master's degree in psychology from Radcliffe College. She had a teaching career in three predominantly black colleges: Dillard University in New Orleans,﻿80
LMM: (cont.) and Fisk University and Tennessee State College in Nashville, Tennessee. After marrying, she taught for several years at Tennessee State College. When her husband became president of Delaware State College, her professional life was given up then, and she focused her activities on being a wife and mother and on giving support to her husband's professional career. This she has done most successfully, serving in that capacity when he was president of Delaware State College and then when he went on for a ten-year stint as president of Hampton Institute, one of our very well-known, outstanding predominantly black colleges, and then when he was appointed as ambassador to Sweden. The success of his services in that professional phase of diplomatic life was enhanced by and received great support from his wife. Currently, my daughter gives a lot of her time serving on boards of directors of many meaningful social agencies in the New York and Westchester area where she lives.
My son, alter a two-year stint in the army, graduated from Bates College in Maine and Boston University Law School. He then went into the practice of law, which was his father's profession, much to the delight of his father. For a while he did general practice in his father's office and then was asked to come on the law staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, where he served for several years. On returning to Massachusetts, he joined a prestigious law firm. He was asked by Governor Volpe, John Volpe, to come on his staff as an attorney for the Department of Administration and Finance. When the first black judge at the Superior Court level in Massachusetts died, he was appointed to succeed him.
CG: Which judge was that?
LMM: Judge Edward Gourdin. Governor John Volpe appointed my son as the second Superior Court justice in Massachusetts. He has been very successful and evidently has carried out his duties with competence. Both of my children married very competent and career-minded spouses. My son's wife, after her children had reached a certain age, served as assistant dean of students at Radcliffe College for four years. After leaving that position, she was asked to come on the staff of ABT Associates, a social policy research corporation. A year ago she was elected as one of the vice-presidents of that corporation and is doing, from what we hear, an outstanding job as director of personnel.
The five grandchildren are still in their educational preparation years. This year of 1977, two of these grandchildren graduated from college. My daughter's oldest, Lucy Holland, graduated from Smith College and received a full expense fellowship from the University of Michigan in her chosen field of theater arts. The oldest son of my son's children, Joseph Mitchell III, graduated with high honors from Stanford University. During his junior year, as a transfer student at Hampton Institute, he was selected as one of ten black students nationwide and given a scholarship by AID for six months in Kenya, Africa, to study the social conditions. Although his parents had given him a rain check on graduate education, he has chosen to take this year off from study to reflect very seriously on what area he wants to go into and where he wants to put his efforts for the rest of his life. This he will be doing this coming year.﻿81
LMM: (cont.) The son of my daughter, Joseph Holland, graduated cum laude
in June 1978 from Cornell. He was an outstanding athlete on the football team there and in addition was elected president of one of the most prestigious scholarship organizations on the campus in his senior year. He found time, in spite of this activity, to give some time to community activities in the town of Ithaca, New York. He received an award citing him as one of four in his class to make the most outstanding contribution to the quality of student life. An outstanding student, he wants also to go into law, the profession of his grandfather. He will enter Harvard Law School in the fall of 1979.
My son's middle child, Michael Mitchell, chose to go to a predominantly black college. He wanted a closer identification with the black community. He chose one of the again outstanding predominantly black colleges in the country, Morehouse, in Atlanta, Georgia, an institution which has perhaps produced more outstanding black leaders than any other black college.
CG: It produced more black college presidents than any other college...
LMM: ...and black college presidents. This grandson will be a junior there next year, and enjoying his college years and deep associations which he has made with the black community. He had an exciting summer as one of Senator Brooke's interns in Washington. He said it was most exciting to be exposed to government at its operational level and to be a part of the life of a politician at the senatorial level. The fifth grandchild has just completed high school and been admitted to Brown University. That completes the achievements to date of grandchildren.
CG: That is wonderful, that is really wonderful. They've continued the tradition of getting involved in community activities and also being excellent at what they do. That says something about the traditions of the family.
LMM: Well, it makes a grandmother looking at it over two generations feel very proud. I think in this family there has always been a feeling that it is worth the effort to try to make a marriage and a family work, with all the implications.
CG: Yes, I see the implications. You had mentioned at one time the way in which you kept family times such as birthdays and, even though you love your independence and you live alone, you keep in contact. You mentioned the long distance calls between you and your grandchildren and how you attempt to be with them on their birthdays...
LMM: All the important events that have happened in their lives. This was my oldest granddaughter's (Lucy Holland) twenty-second birthday. And it was important so I went down to New York to share that day with her. These are the little ways you cement the strong feelings and family concerns at all stages in their life. While this granddaughter was at Smith, participating in some very important dramatic productions, there was always time that I kept to go up with her parents to see her. This is an example of the things I do.﻿82
LMM: (cont.) Another example: this summer my granddaughter Marcene was
participating in a musical her high school was giving to raise money for winter activities. Marcene had choreographed the dances for the production. Just before I was leaving for the event the telephone rang. It was Marcene saying, "Gram, I hope you are coming to the musical. I want you to see my dances." Of course all the family was there. Even her Aunt Laura who was in Boston. It's this kind of... constant communication that I think the family must always have and it has to be a sincere feeling, it cannot be celluloid.
CG: Also, I get the impression that it's not just big events, but also little things...
LMM: That's right, that's right. We never let a birthday go by that something special is not done, if nothing more than all of us getting together for dinner at home, going through the ritual of opening the little remembrances that you've got and reading the cards, these simple things. Sometimes I try to identify what components make the quality of this kind of relationship possible. I think from very young children in both of these families, in my daughter's and my son's families, however juvenile the comments were, the comments that they had to make on any discussion within the family were respected. There was respect—they were listened to, not always accepted, but they got the feeling that they were an important part of whatever decision was being made about a given issue. I think that oftentimes not enough time is given in family interaction to these small matters.
Does that cover pretty much what you wanted about the grandparent role? I think in this we could also spill over a little bit into the total family context of living, but it has to be a part of the whole—you can't isolate grandparenting from the family; it's the interweaving of all of these experiences that produces the quality that you want.
CG: It's interesting, even though you're not living in an extended family household, that your family and your grandchildren still will call you and ask about errands and things, that sort of thing___
LMM: That's right, that's right. For example, last Friday before this Michael grandchild went down to the Cape, he called. "Granny, I want you to get your grocery list ready, and is there something else I can do?" and I said, "Yes, I need my mattress turned over." And so the grocery shopping was done and my mattress was turned over before he went on his weekend on the Cape.
CG: And those are the little things that make...
LMM: Oh yes, they make the weave and warp of whatever the pattern is that is established.﻿83
CG: You've had a chance, really, to have a somewhat longer view of black
history than some of us do, and I would like your reflections on the role of skin color in black life.
LMM: Well, I think I observe a decided change in attitude toward skin color on the American scene as it relates to blacks. I remember in my high school years attention was called to skin color and it varied with the environment in which one lived. There were light skinned families in my hometown that tended to socialize together. I wouldn't say that it was a rigid hierarchy of light and black, but in the high school years, in the school which I attended, there was a predominance of dark skinned students who used to badger me with the phrase, "Black is honest." I was in the minority as to light skinned students. At first I was puzzled at what was meant, as my family had friends of varying colors and hues, within their social interaction. My mother's explanation helped me to meet this challenge.
On coming to Boston, I found that there was a predominant attitude about color in the black community; that there were black women's social clubs where the majority of members were all light skinned and men's clubs whose social affairs were attended by a majority of light skinned women. You, as a sociologist, well know that there has been a spectacular turnabout' in this. The dark skinned black woman, I think, has come into her own. A recent article in the New York Times dealt with this problem as it related to the entertainment field, and this article related the experiences of a light skinned actress who was finding it difficult to find work because the producers and directors were all out for dark skinned women. On campus, the dark skinned women are being sought after by black men, so I'm told by my college-aged grandchildren.
CG: That's good to know.
LMM: So you, I'm sure, with your interaction with your students, have observed that there is a change toward skin color.
CG: I can remember reading Saunders Redding's book and my mother's reflections on growing up in Philadelphia; and you mentioned that it varies from community to community, it's so true.
LMM: Yes, it does.
CG: And I never stopped to reflect on that, the attitudes in one city are not the attitudes of another city.
LMM: That's right.
CG: Which is interesting. How did your mother explain it to you?
LMM: Well, she told me that there were some families that had white fathers and grandfathers and that reflected in the skin color of the children. And that not to feel badly by the implication of this phrase, "Black is honest," which was saying that you are illegitimate or you have a white﻿84
LMM: (cont.) father because you're light skinned. And she said, "You see, your father and I are married and you are just as legitimate as they are, with a dark skinned mother and a dark skinned father," so I could accept it.
CG: Mothers are great that way.
LMM: I'm interested that in your bringing up you never heard that phrase, "Black is honest."
CG: No, I had never...the only trouble I ever had was when I said to my father, I wanted to go to Howard and he said, "Well you can't go. You're too dark." This was before the "Black is Beautiful" movement...
LMM: And Washington had a very strict hierarchy of color...
CG: And he had experienced it when he was at Morehouse, going to play games
on the campuses in the way the girls would treat the dark skinned fellows. The only other time it came up in my life was when my little brother came along and I asked why my little brother was so much lighter than the rest of us. They sat down and explained the whole color spectrum of our ancestors so we would understand...
LMM: That's it.
CG: And in dealing with other groups of people, where you have a huge color
spectrum, this understanding helps because then one can understand that when people come from other cultures the skin color issue becomes an issue when it never was before.
Mrs. Mitchell, in an earlier conversation, you mentioned your travels in Southeast Asia. Would you care to tell me about that trip?
LMM: Yes, that occurred in...began in November 1958 and ended in January 1959.
The primary destination of this journey, which covered seven Asian countries and several European, was to Tokyo, Japan, to attend the International Conference of Social Welfare. Following that conference, opportunity was given to make a study tour of six other places, with a Dr. Donald Howard, Dean of the School of Social Work of UCLA, as our tour leader.
The seven south Asian countries visited were Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, India, and Pakistan. I shall confine my response to your question to the experiences in these southeast Asian countries. Just a remark or two about the social welfare conference. There were over 300 Americans who attended this conference. This was the largest number who had ever visited Japan as a delegation. The study tour which followed was well organized. The group was the official guests of the social welfare workers, public and private, of the respective countries. Under the auspices of these groups within the countries, opportunity was given to meet social welfare leaders, to be oriented to the social conditions and problems of that country, and to see social welfare programs and projects.﻿85
LMM: (cont.) However, the conference in Tokyo had some significant aspects to it also. So much importance did the State Department attach to the visit of this large delegation of social welfare workers to Asia, that a representative from the State Department was sent to San Francisco to give the group a briefing on the United States foreign policy, and to emphasize the contributions which this delegation of Americans might make through their conduct and attitudes while visiting in these countries, which we would like to consider as friends and allies. Remember now, this was back in 1958.
As expressed by the State Department representatives, the basic overall policy in Southeast Asia by our country at that time was to deter and neutralize Communist aggression, and through our help to give these people an opportunity to determine their own destiny. At that particular period, there was a feeling of hostility toward Americans, due largely to lack of understanding of the motivation of our foreign aid programs. So we were told by the State Department representative to be understanding and accepting of the people's criticisms which we would hear often in the hope that through our attitude of understanding, these nationals would come to feel that behind our apparent materialism there were spiritual values which also motivated our giving.
And so armed with these admonitions, and with a firm determination to be pretty Americans instead of ugly ones [laughs], we flew to our destination, which was first Hawaii. To me, the charm of Hawaii were the people with their varying ethnic backgrounds, which were composed of Japanese, Caucasian, Chinese, Filipinos, Portuguese and Polynesian. Leaving the United States at a time of interracial turmoil, it was a refreshing and novel experience to see the multi-racial complex that is Hawaii, where there are no fewer than sixty-four crossbreeds of humans living amicably together with less worrisome racial tensions than in the United States. Back in 1958, mixed marriages were increasing; one-third of the children born at that time were of mixed parentage. I found the culture of Hawaii is bolstered by a high literacy rate. One-fourth of the population at that time was in high school, and eighty-six percent of the children above compulsory school age were still in school. After a day of orientation by the faculty of the University of Hawaii, and an opportunity to visit some of their welfare agencies—in my case, the day care centers which they ran— we left this lovely island, feeling that true democratic living was becoming a reality.
Prior to the conference in Tokyo, some of us were fortunate enough to have the privilege of journeying to Kyoto five days prior to the Tokyo conference. This was indeed an exciting experience. Not only did we have an opportunity to get a thorough orientation about Japan by faculty members of several universities, but we also had an opportunity to visit some of the historical places in Kyoto. This city has retained its ancient culture, since it was the capital of Japan for a thousand years. It is claimed that Japanese culture originally was reared and matured in this city, and that it continues to be the repository of Japanese art and treasures. As you will remember, there was an agreement between Japan and America during the war that Kyoto would not be bombed. It was here that the tea ceremony and flower arrangement and the Noh drama started and flourished.﻿86
LMM: (cont.) So Kyoto again was a fitting setting for the orientation seminar, dealing with the social welfare concerns of our group. There were several discussions and seminars held for this group, dealing with the various aspects of Japanese life. Some dealt with aspects of Japanese culture, and a faculty member from the Kyoto University gave that. Another was on the agricultural situations and policies, and a professor from the social work department gave a psycho-social review of social problems and social welfare work in Japan. It was a professor from Tokyo University who pulled the whole picture together with his psychological review of the social problems. He felt that social problem -number one of Japan was how to raise the general standard of living of the people. He said that the average Japanese earns only about twenty dollars a month. This low income is one contributing factor to the problem of malnutrition. Another significant aspect that he emphasized was that all Japanese children of school age and of normal intelligence are in school, and that in Japan it is almost impossible to find any entirely illiterate person, persons who are unable to lead and write, and at least sign their names.
But one cause of concern of the social welfare work is the feeling of insecurity of the Japanese people. This professor felt that this was related to the dynamic character of present Japanese society and the rapid changes and growth which were taking place following the war. In the wake of these changes, he said, many traditional values and mores had been discarded. This can be seen in the breakup of the traditional mores of family life, which was based on filial piety, its central pillar, and the first son's privileges, which had collapsed- This type of family life, he went on to say, closed the ties with an agricultural economy, but as Japan was becoming more industrialized, there had been a great flood of population to the cities- And he felt that the democratic system under which this new way of life was developing appealed only to the intellect and did not have roots in the emotional life of the people, hence their feeling of great insecurity.
The status of the Japanese woman was another concern. Under the present family institution, the wife faced problems of relationship with the mother-in-law, who still has great authority in domestic affairs. The responsibilities of bringing up children and house chores were very heavy at that time, and the wife did not even have the psychological support of the husband when there were difficulties, because he usually identified with the mother. A divorce was not an escape, for a divorced woman was criticized by neighbors and family. Her occupational skills were limited and she faced a rather hopeless future. He went on to say that many times among these divorced women there was a high rate of suicide. At that time, it was the ninth highest cause of death in Japan. He felt that Japan was attempting to meet these psychological problems through many social welfare programs- There was a social security system being set up to counteract the psychological sense of insecurity. There were child welfare programs, foster home systems, juvenile delinquency and child guidance clinics and a helping with domestic relation problems through marriage counseling bureaus, and problems of the aged through social insurance.﻿87
LMM: (cont.) We found the comments of this particular person very illuminating, but from every side one heard the cry for more and better-trained social workers. The Doshisha University was the only institution at that time which had a graduate course in professional social work.
CG: I guess social work was a new occupation in Japan.
LMM: Yes, I would think so. One of the highlights of the tour for me was a visit to Ujidawara town...
CG: Ujidawara town, is that it?
LMM: Ujidawara town, located twenty-five miles from Kyoto, with a population
of about 7,000. The significance of this was that it gave an opportunity to see a farm village in the center of a rural area. And if one is to get a Tv^lrmr.ed Mature of Japan and gain an understanding of its economy and industry, it is essential to see something of this rural and agricultural area, since this is a country where agriculture occupies an important position in the national economy.	The people engaged in agricultural pursuits
constitute forty-three percent of the population. Agriculture is carried on by small farm households of unpaid family labor with an annual income per family of about $661. So a visit to Ujidawara was significant.
We were given an opportunity to visit some of the big tea-growing farms, because this was a tea-growing area. The one house that we visited was a house in which the same family had lived for 500 years. There was a charm about the rooms which we saw with the tea tables and also the other sparsely furnished places, but with a charm and beauty about it. And then one goes into a room, another room, and there was a television set. A mixture of the old and the new.
CG: Sounds fascinating. You only went for that one day. What impressed you most about that town?
LMM: The warmth of the people, the desire to impress the visitors who came, the demonstration that the schoolchildren put on for us with their dances. But then there was another aspect that I found very impressive, and I shall remember, and that was the incident of one of the members of the tour whose pocketbook was lost. She did not discover that it had been until we returned to Kyoto, you remember the town was twenty-five miles outside. At ten o'clock at night, the tour leader received from the town, this pocketbook, which had been returned to the member. I shall always think of this as a demonstration of the character of the people of this rural community.
CG: That sounds fascinating. What happened next?
LMM: After the five days in Kyoto, we went back to Tokyo, to the conference. The conference content was a challenge to deepen one's knowledge about people and their needs and the coordinated planning on a world's basis for the solution to the problems. I think there were sixteen countries represented in this, to this conference. And it was divided into commissions;﻿88
LMM: (cont.) there were over 1,600 delegates attending also. It was my reaction that the most noteworthy accomplishment of the conference as a whole was that people with such varied and divergent backgrounds could understand each other's many and complex problems, different as they were in origin, and come to rather dignified solutions and helpful recommendations which were mutually acceptable to this diverse group.
CG: I take it they had translating apparatus, so that people could give speeches...
LMM: Oh yes, they had translators in several languages because... English happened to be one. So that was helpful to those of us coming there.
CG: What were some of the commissions that they divided the group into, do you remember?
LMM: There was a commission on leadership, one on social policy, and I do not recall the other two commissions that they had.
CG: Were there a large number of women there?
LMM: It was very well attended by both men and women from all the different countries.
CG: That's fascinating. Since it's a leadership conference, it's nice to know that there were a lot of women there.
LMM: Yes. At the end of the conference, our first destination was Hong Kong.
And as you know, it was the British crown colony of Hong Kong, It is a study in contrast, with its population of over two and a half million people. There are 6,400 persons per square mile, and at that time it was considered the most densely populated area in the world. And Miss Gilkes, I have to keep reminding you, I'm speaking of the perspective of twenty years ago. But it was here that one came to understand what is meant by the phrase, the "veritable sea of humanity." The greatest free trading port in the world had a ninety-nine percent Chinese population in 1958. With about 25,000 non-Chinese of fifty different nationalities.
CG: What was your impression of all of this?
LMM: Well, there are two sides to the coin that is Hong Kong. There is the
Hong Kong known as the shopping paradise of the world, the center of commerce and trade, of the beautiful, luxurious homes on the hillside, overlooking the beautiful bay harbor. It is the other side of the life of Hong Kong which leaves one with a complete feeling of helplessness as one comes face to face with the massive and ferocious poverty of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese living there in 1958.
One cannot shake easily the memory of being beset night and day by child beggars... the hillside squatters living in shacks and caves, the miserable living of the people in their junks and sampans. These were the people, thousands of thousands, with members ranging from infants to aged﻿89
LMM: (cont.) grandparents, who spent their whole lives on sampans or junks,
tied up in the harbor-- cooking, eating, sleeping, washing. From day to day, at that time, and I hope the conditions have improved, one could see mobs of children wandering aimlessly in crowded streets all day, while both parents engaged in coolie labor. You could see six-year-olds with a baby on his or her back, and two or three between them, to look out for them all in dirty rags, many with skin sores and running eyes. One area of the city we had to close the automobile windows and lock the doors so that we would not make any personal contact with the beggars on their knees, following these sightseeing vehicles.
Now the government was attempting to do something about these horrible social conditions. They were attempting to make permanent resettlements through the housing. I visited one of these housing developments in which 65,000 people were housed. Of these lucky families, five or more lived ^in a twelve-by-twelve room. And those with fewer than five shared their rooms with another family. Something was also being done about the families who were ill-fed. America was sending large amounts of food, such as powdered milk and canned vegetabl es, but it was very difficulty we were told by the social workers, to get these people to eat this food that was coming in, because it was alien to the kinds of food which they were used to. It was very difficult for me to get used and adj usted to the status of women as related to us in this country. From my hotel room, I could see the many construction workers, lifting heavy baskets of cement and wooden beams and iron pipes. Little wonder that the life span of these women in 1958 was twenty-six years.
We were told by the social welfare workers with whom we came in contact that the basic social problem of Hong Kong was obviously overpopulation and unemployment. Pyramided on these are the problems of poverty, malnutrition, disease, lack of housing, and drug addiction. These conditions were multiplied by the 400 refugees from Communist China who swarmed across the border almost daily. In the language of an outstanding American social worker who was a part of our party, Lester Granger, former head of the National Urban League, he had this to say: "Let me state the problem of Hong Kong in recipe form." And these are his words, "Take a half million refugees from oppression and starvation in Red China, mix them with three times their number of Chinese already living in Hong Kong under crueler conditions. Soak these in continuous poverty and ill health. Pour them into a city container that strains away their self-reliance, shake them up with a sprinkling of 25,000 non-Asian business people and a few hundred thousand of their Asian white-collar employees, strain out the financial profits to be shipped to Great Britain and the United States and Portugal and India, and you have Hong Kong."
CG: He was such a perceptive man.
LMM: So that Hong Kong was for me as a bargain center of the world for shoppers, but one wonders at what cost and at whose expense have these goods been produced.
CG: Who else was in your party besides Lester Granger?﻿90
LMM: Oh, I can't remember.
CG: Where did you go after Hong Kong?
LMM: We went to Bangkok, Thailand. Thailand, meaning the land of the free, is a southeast Asian country with a population of about 20 million, and density of ninety per square mile. So overpopulation is not one of their problems. It is a country, as you know, rich in natural resources. At the time of our visit, the country had just come under a military dictatorship. None of the nationals with whom we talked seemed to be disturbed by this, and many were outspoken in their view that this was a good thing, since the government officials who had been deposed had been exploiting the country for personal gain. The Thai people are a mixture of Chinese and Indian, and the culture of the country has been greatly influenced by both countries. Buddhism is the national religion and almost every important event in their life is associated with a religious ceremony. The architecture of their temples to me was breathtaking, and even more so when I learned that they dated back thousands of years. The temples serve not only as the church halls, but as recreation centers, schools and homes for the abandoned and the poor. One of the arresting sights of Thailand was the Buddhist monk in his saffron robes, with his begging bowl, getting in this fashion his meal for the day. The five precepts of Buddhism, as you have learned, I'm sure, are to forbid destruction of life, theft, un-chastity, renouncing falsehoods and use of intoxicating liquids or drinks, rather.
Since the fundamental culture in Thailand is based on the Buddhist faith and the first commandment is benevolence, social welfare services stem from the religious principles of charity. We found that the public welfare services were well organized and administered, and that there were many private and volunteer social agencies. Housing was being improved, health standards raised, and educat ion... These were some of the primary welfare concerns of this country. Their family and child welfare services were based on the belief that whatever can be done for children can best be done by parents. Therefore, their goal was to strengthen and support family life. We have a feeling that the children, these children, will have a fair chance to have a good life, since the welfare emphasis is to give parents needed help, economically, in order to enable them to maintain their homes. With the enlightened social welfare programs in Thailand and the awareness of their responsibilities to meet them, there was a feeling in our group that solutions will be found to meet their problems.
CG: Did you visit any day care centers there in Thailand?
LMM: Yes, we visited, I visited a day care center in Bangkok, run by the YWCA for a group of about thirty children. There was a small fee charged to cover the cost of food. The hours were 7:30 to 5:30.
CG: Oh, those are nice hours.
LMM: And the facility was a recently renovated building and was quite adequate. The program apparently was set up to meet the needs of the culture of these children.﻿91
CG: In Thailand you didn't see any of the sights comparable to the kinds of poverty that you saw in Hong Kong?
LMM: No. No, I did not, although we spent a day on the river. In Hong Kong it was very interesting, observing from the trip down the river, the life of the village people as we went.
CG: Oh, so you saw the agricultural people as well as the city people.
LMM: That's right. And we saw the famous floating market of Thailand.
CG: Oh.' Where did you go after Bangkok?
LMM: We went on into Rangoon, Burma. Burma, as you know, some twenty years ago,
was comparatively unknown to the western nations during the British domination and colonial rule until the opening of the famous Burma Road, considered the back door to China. Our visit to Burma was confined to Rangoon and the
surrounding countryside. This country had a population of around eight million. My first reaction to Burma was that it was a country of run-down pagodas, filthy streets, thousands of hungry dogs and swarming crows1— with the people's standard of living at the lowest level possible. One remembers that here were people whose city was bombed by the occupying Japanese, and bombed all over again by the British when they retook Rangoon four years later.
When one considers that, one is apt to stop being critical of the Burmese people for being where they are in terms of income, literacy, and economic development. But to pay homage to them, they are a tough, smiling, friendly people, who refuse to lose heart at what might have been a hopeless struggle. They are indeed a people with a talent for living.
There's one factor that stands out in initiating social change in these countries, and that is how much there is an uprooting of traditions and cultural practices. I mentioned the thousands of starving, flea-bitten dogs roaming the streets in Rangoon, and the swarming crows. Now this condition is related to one of the basic precepts of Buddhism, not to take life. One has to remember this. But this was being broken as the military officials had just decreed that the dogs and the crows must be killed. Burma does not accept grants and aid from the West, at least in 1958, but only loans. This is based on the suspicion of Western motives and memory of the British exploitation.
The social welfare effort in this country is called the mass educational movement. It is a movement designed to raise the level of health conditions, community living, economic betterment and literacy. This movement will give a fresh sense of purpose and new hope to this people. Self-help is the base on which they are building their crusade.
In observing the relationship between Burmese parents and their children, one is impressed with how relaxed and easygoing they are, as most American parents wish that they could be. They speak of their children, to their children—they speak to their children in soft voices and do not force or coerce their offspring into this chore or that duty. Early in life, the child becomes "other-centered," so that he can mature as a Burmese. We were told that on his birthday, he does not receive gifts, he gives﻿92
LMM: (cont.) them. The child rapidly gets an exact idea of people's behavior.
Crying, for example, is most improper behavior. Probably the secret of success with their children is that each parent has a clear-cut, important place in the family. The other individuals are all respected, he is given respect, learning to respect each other. The child therefore is certain of receiving loving attitudes from those who are older than he is. And he develops respect and appreciation for those who are younger.
CG: Were there any special sights in Burma...
LMM: Other than the temples, which were not very impressive after one had seen the ones in Thailand, by comparison. No doubt it is unfair to compare the two...
CG: Because you make the point that Burma was coming out of a war.
LMM: That's right.
CG: Where did you go next?
LMM: From Burma we went to the Philippines; Manila was the center of our
visit. And we arrived in the Philippines in 1958, at a time when their economic repression had further depressed the value of the pesos, and... is that the correct pronunciation?
CG: Pesos?
LMM: Pesos, yes. And there was much talk of the country's financial crisis.
We were there when feeling was running high in resentment against Garcia, the president of the Philippines, for his visit to Japan. Memories are still vivid of the Japanese occupation and the atrocities committed in the heat of war. One could hardly engage a Filipino in conversation very long before he mentioned his great feeling, the loss of a relative in the war. The bitterness toward the Japanese in 1958 was still fresh, deep, and strong.
There were two separate Filipino aspects, two aspects of Filipino life which I found arresting. One was their fanatical attitude toward getting a college education. To gain a college degree seemed to be the goal toward which one had to strive. Families would make extreme sacrifices in order that their children would receive a college education. Great pride was expressed in the large number of colleges located in Manila, that twenty-five percent of the population was in school. The other aspect was the strong feminist attitude of the Filipino woman. She had an aggressive drive to all of the activities concerned with life in the Philippines. I found her at times a bit overpowering. They had positions of power in every part of the life of their country and seemed to be the spark plug for many of the progressive social welfare programs of their country.
CG: International Women's Year... They used to call Emelda Marcos, President Marcos's wife, the Iron Butterfly.﻿93
LMM: [laughs] They visited a day care center or nursery school, as it was
known there. This was run by a women's organization and cared for about 114 children a day. We discovered that there were over a hundred day nurseries for working mothers in Manila alone, primarily in the underprivileged areas.
CG: Umrn. A lot of day nurseries.
LMM: We were able to visit only one, which was housed in a rather dilapidated building and cared for seventy-five children there in two rooms. They had the usual equipment of tables and chairs, but very little playground space and we would think of it more as custodial care, rather than care provided in a day nursery or a child care center in this country.
CG: I'm curious. They had a lot of custodial day care nurseries and women were very advanced in... Was it middle-class women who were occupying very nice positions also?
LMM: We were unable to discover what the primary employment resources were for women. But one got the impression that many, many women were in the workaday world.
CG: Looking back now, you're saying, this is 1958. Looking back now, are
American women as far along now as the Filipine women that you observed then?
LMM: I don't think I would be able to make a viable comparison between the two because you're dealing with two completely different cultures.
CG: But it was impressive to see the...
LMM: To see their aggressiveness and to see the activity in all aspects, both governmental and educational aspects of Filipino life.
CG: Were there any special sights in the Philippines that you noticed that...
LMM: Not that were any more outstanding or characteristic of Manila. We
visited certain of their farms, farmland that they were developing. At that time the bitterness was so strong toward Japan that the sights which seemed to occupy the guide were to show you all of the atrocities that had been perpetrated on the Filipino people by the Japanese. They were just preoccupied with that at that time.
CG: Is the Buddhist culture as strong there as in the other countries which you visited?
LMM:	I did not observe that aspect.
CG:	Where did you go after the Philippines now?
LMM:	Well, from the Philippines we went to India.
CG:	Ohh.﻿94
LMM: And New Delhi was our destination there. Of course, so much is known, Miss Gilkes, about India and the life and culture of the people, that I shall make only a few observations and they would be related to personal impressions. The group was given a day of orientation in the social conditions of India by two of its very brilliant young men, who head the social welfare planning commission for the country. This was a real privilege to get this background. From listening to them, one is impressed with what a stupendous task this is, when one realizes that 392 million people are involved in a change of conditions, of living conditions, and that this population is growing at the rate of five million a year. Of course, there may be an improvement now, I am thinking of 1958. When one further realizes that at that time planning had to be done for fourteen states, six million territories and fourteen different languages. The day-to-day problems in the functioning of the democratic administration were magnified to enormous proportions. In addition, eight million people who were uprooted from their homes as a result of the partition of the country were in the process of being rehabilitated and assimilated into the national economy.
In spite of the enormity of their country and its problems, it seemed that they had set goals of accomplishment. There was awareness that economies may be necessary in many areas of their national economy, but that they must not economize on services to their children. This was declared by one national leader. He said that all our claims to being a cultured and civilized people will sound hollow if we cannot give a better deal to our children.
The prime needs relating to children, as one discussed it with these leaders here, were only in a matter of degree from the same kind of problems we have in our country. One heard much talk about protective legislation relating to licensing of institutions, day care centers, the regulation of adoption, the coordination of government and voluntary agency programs. So that they could all be strengthened in order to work more effectively. And there was emphasis on research and evaluation of methods and programs to determine their progress and effectiveness. The leaders who were a part of this orientation expressed concern for children and mothers through their social welfare boards, whose primary concern was improving the conditions of women and children. The health needs of the country were emphasized and recognized as being enormous. The problems of malnutrition were widespread and complex, and a school lunch program was to be one approach to this problem. But this involved the need to change deep-seated dietary patterns and acceptance of new food. The same kind of problem, as you recall, that I observed in Hong Kong.
CG: Oh, yes.
LMM: In many school situations, we found that older children helped younger ones, such as helping them to wash their hands and when there were no towels, the sun always was helpful in drying clean hands. Nutrition workers noticed that children needed more vitamin D in their diet, so the government could provide cheese, but the children didn't eat it until someone had it mashed and mixed with raw onions.﻿95
CG: They wouldn't eat the cheese until it was mashed up with raw onions?
LMM: This was always a problem with our introducing some foods into their
country with which they were not familiar. But the Indian children liked onions, so they mixed the cheese to get their vitamin D. Of necessity this vastness and complexity of programs—both political and industrial, economic, agricultural, health, welfare, which make up the five group plans that they have set themselves to implement—vary in the degree of successful achievement to this point from province to province, community to community, and even village to village. After an evening with five young men planners of India, I came away feeling that the almost impossible will be accomplished in the years to come.
While in India, I visited a day care center called the Happy School. The entire set-up of this school was much like our own in pattern and program organization. Here were the same type of toys; here the teachers -were experimenting with new techniques of guidance. The children were being permitted more rreedom of choice, more opportunity to pursue their own interests. Many of the teachers had been trained in American schools.
Ahh.
If one might venture a few generalizations about these child care programs, I would say that the large group seemed to give security to these children. There was an activity being directed toward the establishment of creches and nurseries for children of working mothers in rural areas as well as in the cities, where women's labor now is needed on the farms. Few primary schools for children of working mothers are being given priority now and these are charged in relation to income, although scholarships are given in deserving cases. I received the impression that recently the study of growth and development has come to be assigned its proper place in what are called home science institutions, and in the addition of early childhood education departments in their colleges. In these instances, nursery schools serve a double purpose. They serve the need of the community for preschool centers for children, especially those of working mothers, and they also serve as a nucleus for a child study laboratory in a rapidly expanding scheme for establishing research work in child growth and development.
While you were there did you see any other spots, did you do any of the tourist spots?
In addition to seeing many of the urban city problems, we also had the relief of seeing some of the outstanding historical sights and accomplishments with the temples that they had and of course, the supreme Taj Mahal. We spent an entire day there. We saw it in the daytime, we saw it at sunset and we saw it in the moonlight.
Oh!
To see the Taj Mahal in the moonlight is something one carries as a precious memory. We had on our return trip from the Taj Mahal, which was quite a way out from New Delhi—and our car broke down in the middle of the night, and
CG: LMM:
CG:
LMM:
CG: LMM:﻿96
LMM: (cont.) we had...while it was being repaired, the privilege of seeing all of the animals' night life in the rural area. The camels going by and the other vehicles that are used by the native Indian, which again was another slice of Indian life that gave excitement to the trip such as ours.
CG: It's funny because so much of our view of that part of the world comes
from the press and it's only if something terrible happens so you never get that other part. In New Delhi there's been a lot of poverty and...
LMM: Yes. This is another aspect of life in New Delhi. I could look out of my hotel window and see on the hillside the people who had no shelter and would sleep out in the open, prepare their food over fires that they built, and had no other kind of shelter. If one moved into what we would call the inner city of New Delhi, then we saw the most abject poverty. People who were practically starving to death and calling, begging those of u? riding in automobiles, to observe their misery.
We had the opportunity of also visiting the places where you see these beautiful saris being made. And this again will have a lasting impression on me because of the kind of working conditions under which those people live as they weave these beautiful designs that you see on saris— in very dark surroundings. We were told that many of the people doing this weaving would soon lose their eyesight. So that I at this time can never see a person wrapped in a beautiful sari, especially if it's one of the handwoven kind, without remembering that vision of how they are made. These are memories that follow one, when we have sensitivities to things like that.
CG: From New Delhi where did you go?
LMM: From New Delhi we went to Karachi, Pakistan. And as you remember, Karachi is located on the Arabian Sea.
CG: So that's West Pakistan.
LMM: Yes. A visitor had an opportunity to see in Pakistan a new state in the making in 1958. As you recall, Pakistan came into being as a result of the partition of India, with its two geographical areas separated by a thousand miles. Karachi, the capital, in 1957 had a population of a million and a half. It was a city with a variety of races, languages, dialects and dress. Eighty-five percent of the people are Moslems, but there are also Hindu, Buddhists, Hebrews and Zoroastrians. The Moslem religion, of course, influences to a very great extent the daily lives of the people, and was also a unifying factor. There was considerable diversity in the way of life according to religious communities and to economic and social strata.
Karachi was a strange mixture of the old and the new life. Life there was not fully urban. A great deal of the rural influence persists strongly. Housing ranges from the most modern concrete structures to the village hut. It was not uncommon to see 1958 Buicks, camels and donkey carts all plying together. The latest industrial techniques and ancient indigenous methods of craft existed side by side.﻿97
LMM: (cont.) At the time of the partition, eight million people migrated to Pakistan from all areas of India. The resettlement and rehabilitation of these people had been the chief welfare preoccupation of Pakistan. Many of the traditional cultural values and modes had begun to change. Perhaps in no area were there more changes taking place so rapidly as in the family life of Pakistan. The joint or extended family as was known in India was to be found in Pakistan only among the Hindus. The average family of the Moslems is a mixture of the joint family of the Hindu and the nuclear family of the West. Children in such families grow up with a sense of camaraderie with their kith and kin. The elder members of the Pakistan family play the role of maintaining the social and family traditions and prestige. They were greatly respected. The average marriage age for boys at that time was sixteen to twenty-four years. For girls, eleven to eighteen years. Although a man might marry more than one wife, this in 1958 was becoming increasingly difficult to do, due to economic pressure. One observed that in a majority of cases, little attention is paid to the training of the child. Very little restraint is placed on him, we are told, though they are expected to obey the social code. The male child is given more opportunity for self-expression than the female at that time. The majority of the children lend a hand in their parents' work at a very early age. We are told that it is not uncommon to see a child five or six helping with light work in the home and the field. Girls six and seven take care of younger children and help in other household tasks, such as cooking and tending the cattle. While this reduces the period of carefree childhood, it brings about a sense of responsibility in the children of that culture.
As in many under-developed countries, we found modern facilities very inadequate. Mass programs for the purification of drinking water were being put into place. Malaria control and vaccination, inoculations are being carried out by the government with the assistance of UNICEF and WHO.
CG: Oh yes, the World Health Organization.
LMM: That's right. The poor standard of health of this group of people is due to ignorance of basic health principles and food values. But their community development programs, being instituted in the urban as well as in rural areas, have as their objective the education of the people in the advantages of modern technique for the. improvement of their own conditions.
CG: Did you see any special sights that struck you in Pakistan?
LMM: Not any of the historical sights. We had a very unusual privilege, through a friend,of being entertained by one of the non-Moslem family groups in Pakistan. I think they would be known as a Parsi family. Not only were we able to be entertained and meet other members of the family, but we had the privilege of observing the religious ceremony that they go through, introducing the young boy into manhood, similar to the bar mitzvah ritual which the Jews have in this country.
CG: That's fascinating. If you could go back again, which place would you like to go?﻿98
LMM: I think I would like Kyoto. That was fascinating. But one leaves this glimpse of Southeast Asia with a feeling that democracy, as one person has expressed it, cannot be sold like cigarettes. To be effective, it must be identified with the life of the people and it must be attached to the prevailing customs and cultural mores. In addition, I left with a feeling of optimism, that in spite of the enormity and complexity of the problems in that part of the world, solutions were to be found and remember, this was 1958, perhaps not wholly in technical pre-cociousness, but in the minds and hearts of mankind throughout the world, and in each man's spirit of friendship and sincere concern for his fellow man, as we join hands to build a world in which all men may enjoy the abundant life and share the benefits and the insights which come through different cultures and customs.
CG: I can't help but note, more or less for the record, that again here is this pattern of your sharing what you get, because you mentioned to me that
you gave speeches after you came back and you went around and lectured to people and talked of what you had learned, of this wisdom that you had acquired through your travels.
LMM: I don't think I could use the word talked, I think I was sharing my reactions to a very exciting experience.
CG: Well, I'm glad you did. You also mentioned going to Sweden. Could you tell me about that?
LMM: I made two trips there during the period that my daughter's husband was
ambassador to Sweden. Being a part of a diplomatic household at that level provided opportunity to observe a very interesting lifestyle. Living at the ambassadorial level has many very unique qualities. One of the aspects that particularly intrigued me was the opportunity which one has to meet and interact with persons from many different countries around the world. These opportunities came primarily through social functions which are a very significant part of diplomatic life. I think of the diplomatic dinners which were given in the residence of the American embassy, where on one occasion there must have been, and this is just a guess, perhaps eight or ten different ambassadors and diplomats from different countries at the table, plus some businessmen, persons from the arts and the education community, such as a representative of the Nobel Prize Committee. This gives a little indication of the kind of opportunities that were afforded to talk with people from this broad spectrum of the world community. That aspect I thoroughly enjoyed, and as a member of the family of the ambassador, I participated in all of the social functions to which they were invited during my period as a guest in their household. The only functions that could not include me, and only included the ambassador and his wife, were functions at which the King of Sweden was either a guest or a host.
The other aspect that intrigued me about diplomatic life was the emphasis on protocol. I wish I had been more familiar with all of the practices that had to be observed. For instance in table seating, there was always a rank kind of procedure that had to be observed, a rank related to the length of time that one had been an ambassador in the country. One who was there for five years outranked the person who was there for four years or﻿99
LMM: (cont.) three years and that rank procedure obtained in the sitting arrangements at the table and in the way that the guests were received. I was intrigued by the formality that had to be observed at all times. It was a part of diplomatic life. I feel a measure of great satisfaction looking back at what my son-in-law was able to achieve over there. This I should not go into in any detail because my facts may not be accurate and these would only be impressions. My trips there also gave me opportunity to see other parts of Europe, such as Finland, and then Norway and to spend some time there as a part of the diplomatic experiences of my family. I have had four trips to Europe and covered most of the countries that are part of the tour circuit. I've been to England twice and to France, Holland, Belgium and Denmark as well as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Greece and Italy.
CG: Do you remember...which country impressed you most?
LMM: Well, of course the other visits were more on a tourist level to the other countries. Therefore I would have more impressions in depth about Sweden where I had longer periods of time that I spent there. So those were the countries.
CG: Have you forgotten any?
LMM: Oh yes, oh yes, Greece and Italy I have been to and traveled quite a lot in that area of the world. If I don't become too feeble, I have ambitions, if there would be opportunity to do it, but I would like a trip to Africa and to China. And if there's energy left at some time, to Russia.
CG: One of my questions asked you what advice you would give, both to young black women and young black men.
LMM: I would do it in very general terms, and not in great detail, and it would apply to both the male and female. I think that the young black person in America today should strive to be herself or himself, to try to develop his or her potentials, talents, and skills to the highest degree possible. Try to develop not only those ambitions related to self-advancement, as important as they are, but to couple that with a sense of responsibility to the contributions which they are obligated to make, not only to themselves, their profession or line of work, but also to their community and to an improvement in the human condition. That's what I want to say.
CG: I think a lot of students are getting away from that these days; they
can't see why they should help out, and they don't understand all that has gone before...
LMM: Ah , yes. That is right. But I feel strongly about that. I think there
is the need to satisfy the drives and the ambitions that are a part of one's total personality makeup, but this shouldn't preclude this broader view of their obligation to society. So I think I've done fairly well, Miss﻿100
LMM: (cont.) Gilkes, by answering most of your questions...
CG: Oh, yes. The answers have just been so very, very beautiful.﻿101
Appendix 1
The most important thing in determining my own marital happiness, probably would go back to my own family life and the marital adjustment of my parents. I was raised in a home that offered probably one of the best examples (as far as I could see) of good marital adjustments. Of course, my parents had their petty arguments and quarrels which one must expect in all marriages and which I expect in mine, but there was no swearing, no continual bickering, and no beating, smashing of dishes, etc. Thus, I have become conditioned. I feel as if I could not abide or live with a man who did any of those things to me. Over and over, my mother has told me to leave any man who strikes me. I would not be happy, either, if I married a man who was not thoughtful, understanding, and gentle, for my father is such a type. He and my mother always discussed everything (as far as I could figure out)—keeping no secrets from each other. They enjoyed certain pleasures together, and certain activities and certain pleasures apart. They had a certain amount of children whom they were able to give everything they desired. All in all, I might say, my family life at home has given me an outline upon which I wish to base my own marital life.﻿LUCY MILLER MITCHELL
