About Linda Wade…
Linda Wade was born in 1948 in Enid, Oklahoma, and grew up in Wakita, Oklahoma, where she
worked with her three younger sisters on her family’s hundred-year-old farm. She graduated
from Wakita High School in 1966 and then enrolled at Oklahoma State University to study
biological sciences, with a lifelong interest in science and medicine. Having some family
members who were OSU alums, and having visited Stillwater on occasion, Linda already had a
well-developed love for the school. She was a Woman of Willard, living in Willard Hall all four
years of school, and spent a lot of time studying in the Library. In her spare time, she enjoyed
eating pizza at Hideaway or going on dates at Willard Pond or Sonic Drive-In. She also built
relationships with other students in the medical classes during her time at OSU, and still today
keeps in touch with them when she can.
Linda graduated from OSU in 1970 and then spent one year at the University Hospital in
Oklahoma City, becoming a medical technologist, registered with the American Society of
Clinical Pathologists. From there she got married, and she and her husband moved to Europe
where they lived and traveled for a year and a half. When they returned to the States, they moved
back to Wakita where Linda continued her work in local hospitals, staying in the medical field
for nearly forty years before retiring in 2011. Linda still lives in Wakita these days, where she
manages the Twister Museum, which showcases memorabilia from the movie Twister, since part
of it was filmed in town. During her visit with us, Linda shared memories of her time at OSU, as
well as how Wakita was affected by its taste of Hollywood.

Linda Wade
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Juliana Nykolaiszyn
September 26, 2016
Wakita, Oklahoma
Nykolaiszyn

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University
Library. Today is Monday, September 26, 2016. I’m in Wakita, Oklahoma,
Grant County, Oklahoma, to interview Linda Wade as part of our Cowboys
in Every County Oral History project. Linda, thank you for joining us today.

Wade

You’re welcome.

Nykolaiszyn

Let’s a learn a little bit more about you. Could you tell me the year you
were born, and where you were born?

Wade

I was born in 1948 in Enid, Oklahoma, which is just south of Grant County.
Grant County does not have a hospital at this time, and so that was the
closest.

Nykolaiszyn

Tell me a little bit about your parents.

Wade

My parents were both raised in this area. My great-grandfather made the
Cherokee Strip run in 1893. My father’s family came shortly thereafter and
settled in the Wakita-Manchester area of Grant County.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and when they came to this area, what was their occupation?

Wade

They were all farmers. They did some grocery business because of eggs and
meat and things like that, but for the most part, they were farmers.

Nykolaiszyn

Tell me the names of your parents.

Wade

Mary Jane and Leroy Miller are my parents.

Nykolaiszyn

Grandparents?

4

Wade

Edna and Guy Miller are my father’s parents, and Mary Lee and Leonard
Long are my mother’s parents. My father is still living in Wakita and is
ninety-six years old.

Nykolaiszyn

Oh, wow! Tell me how your parents met each other.

Wade

After the war, my dad was back, sitting in the barber shop, and my mother
walked by outside the window. He said, “Oh, I like that lady,” and it went
from there. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

When you were born, where did your family live?

Wade

They lived here in the Wakita area.

Nykolaiszyn

Did they live in town or on the farm?

Wade

On the farm.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and kind of describe the farm to me, what you remember, what you
can recall.

Wade

What can I recall? My father still lives in the second house that he built for
the family. Once I was about five years old, they built a newer house
because they had a couple more siblings after me. They needed a larger
home, and so they built the final family home. The farm that my greatgrandfather homesteaded is actually still in the family as a hundred-year-ormore farm.

Nykolaiszyn

Tell me about the schools you attended growing up.

Wade

Okay, Wakita Grade School and High School is where I graduated in 1966.
Then I went to OSU, graduated in 1970, and then I attended a one-year
internship at the University Hospital in Oklahoma City and became a
medical technologist. I am registered with the American Society of Clinical
Pathologists as a registered medical technologist. I just retired about five
years ago from working several hospitals, and now I have finally taken over
the running of the Twister Museum in Wakita, Oklahoma, as my afterretirement job.

Nykolaiszyn

Let’s take you all the way back to attending school here in Wakita. Was it a
big school? Was it a small school? How many students?

Wade

Wakita is a relatively small school in the scope of things. My class was
actually the largest in Wakita history, and we had forty-five students in our
graduating class. We have just celebrated our fiftieth reunion this year, and
about three-fourths of us were attending. We did celebrate here in Wakita.
5

Nykolaiszyn

Were you active in many activities in school?

Wade

Just a few, not a whole lot. I was more of the brainiac at that time, going into
the science field, so I didn’t do much in sports. I did do the plays and things
like that, home ec.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you always wanted to attend college? Was it encouraged?

Wade

My family has a history of college attendance, so it was a given. I became
interested in the medical field when I got a microscope for Christmas one
year, and it just kind of went from there.

Nykolaiszyn

How did you choose Oklahoma State?

Wade

Family had gone to OSU prior to my attending. I had family at the time I
was going to school, so it was the most comfortable choice, and it did offer
the science classes that I needed.

Nykolaiszyn

Prior to attending OSU, did you spend any time in Stillwater?

Wade

Yes, I visited family there quite a bit.

Nykolaiszyn

What family did you have in Stillwater?

Wade

Mostly cousins that were attending the school. Of course, my father had
been there many years ago. It was a little bit different after that. I was the
oldest child in our family, so I got to break the ice for the rest of my siblings
who went to OSU some parts of their lives. Some of them moved on. Two
out of four girls graduated from OSU.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, so how did you get from Wakita to Stillwater when you were moving
in for the first time as a freshman?

Wade

The family drove me the first year. I actually had Dad come get me to go
home a lot. By the next year, he let me have a car because he farmed and
didn’t have the time to take off to come bring me home every week.

Nykolaiszyn

Where did you live on campus your first year?

Wade

I was in Willard for four years.

Nykolaiszyn

You were a Woman of Willard!

Wade

A Woman of Willard, and don’t ask me for the cheer song. (Laughter)

6

Nykolaiszyn

Describe your dorm room for me.

Wade

Small room, two people. I don’t know that it had any significance at all.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you know your roommate?

Wade

No, I had a new roommate every year.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and when you went to OSU did you have an idea of what you wanted
to major in?

Wade

Yes, I was strictly a biological science major the whole way. I did want to
get my degree just in case that I didn’t like the medical profession once I got
into it. I could come back and have a stepping stone to another profession if
I needed it.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, you were very focused going into college.

Wade

Well, for a while, anyway. (Laughter) I won’t say that my grade point was
great when I ended, but yes, I knew where I was starting. I did branch out a
little bit.

Nykolaiszyn

Tell me a little bit about what you remember from your classes.

Wade

I had some very hard classes, some pretty easy classes. I had a Saturday
class, which I didn’t like. I did have one class that I had three different
teachers in. You’d just get used to one teacher, and then another one comes
in, and you have to get used to a new one.

Nykolaiszyn

Any professors stand out in your mind?

Wade

No, not particularly. (Laughter) Not in the good frame, anyway. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Did you work while you were on campus?

Wade

No, I had a Regents Scholarship my first year. I worked in the summers on
the farm to earn the money to go back in the fall. Not while I was in school,
but yes, I did work.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, now, tell me what you did for fun.

Wade

Mostly going out and dating and meeting people.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you always live in Willard?

Wade

Yes.
7

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, so you lived in Willard all four years?

Wade

All four years. It was the best dorm at that time. It had the best prestige at
that time, if you were going to stay in a dorm. Of course, they built the new
ones shortly after that, but while I was there, it was a good dorm.

Nykolaiszyn

Were you involved in any on-campus activities while you were at OSU?

Wade

I’m sure I was. (Laughs) I was nominated for a dairy princess. One of a
group I didn’t win, but I was nominated. I don’t know. Science, you kept
pretty busy with labs and things. I did run around with a lot of medical
students because we studied together a lot. Went to the Hideaway a lot.
That’s about all I remember. It’s been fifty years; it’s been a long time.
(Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

A long time! Did you attend many sporting events?

Wade

Of course, all the football games, a few of the basketball or wrestling games,
yeah. Depended on if you could get a date or not. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Can you tell me how the women dressed when you were in college?

Wade

Wool pleated skirts and sweaters was the main…. I remember freshman
shopping to go to school.

Nykolaiszyn

This is going to sound a little odd, but how’d you get your laundry done?

Wade

The basement of Willard. You went down and did your own. Of course,
wool skirts (I’m not sure) had to be dry cleaned, but I don’t know. That’s
where we did laundry was the basement of Willard.

Nykolaiszyn

You lived in Willard. Did you have curfews?

Wade

Yes, we did, definitely.

Nykolaiszyn

At that point, did you still have housemothers?

Wade

Yes, we did.

Nykolaiszyn

Tell me about your housemother. Did you have any run-ins with your
housemother?

Wade

(Laughs) No, I was a good girl. I did date a few sorority boys, so I met the
housemothers of the fraternities. I ended up marrying a fraternity boy that I
met at Stillwater.
8

Nykolaiszyn

How’d you meet your husband?

Wade

He was actually working on the farm here in Wakita. He was from Little
Rock, Arkansas, and is an OSU graduate, as well. We met here in Wakita
and then dated once we got back to school.

Nykolaiszyn

It’s a small world.

Wade

It is. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

Do you recall any campus traditions?

Wade

Homecoming for sure. We all did everything we could for Homecoming.

Nykolaiszyn

Did Willard do decorations out front?

Wade

No, I don’t think so. I didn’t participate, anyway, if they did.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you attend the parade?

Wade

Yeah, the parade and viewing all the fraternity setups and everything. I
guess we did have a revue, acting comedy revue, every year. We went to
that. I hadn’t really thought about school in a long time, so I don’t really
remember, not much.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, is there a place on campus that you loved to visit, hang out at?

Wade

We hung out at the Hideaway pretty much all the time. Sometimes Swim’s,
but mostly the Hideaway.

Nykolaiszyn

Was that the first time you had pizza?

Wade

No, but probably the best. Then again, my husband worked there, so that
was an easy meeting place. He prepped for the morning pizza making. He
made the dough. He did the cleanup of the place and stuff like that. Of
course, we all liked the collages on the wall and everything.

Nykolaiszyn

You had a good in.

Wade

I did. (Laughter) It worked great.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you have a favorite pizza?

Wade

Everything. I liked the…. Eventually, oh gosh, in 2000 or so, Hideaway got
the Volkswagens that they painted up, and that was cute. I followed that.
9

Nykolaiszyn

Were there other places in town you liked to eat? Did you visit the Strip?

Wade

We did. There was a place that had a fireplace. What was the name of that? I
don’t really remember. I know there was a dry cleaner on the Strip, so that’s
probably where I got my dry cleaning done. What was on the corner? I don’t
know. I’m not good at memory, not good at remembering. I was in class all
the time…

Nykolaiszyn

That’s a good thing.

Wade

…yeah, and that’s what you remember. Then the Willard Pond, we spent a
lot of time sitting around Willard Pond…with guys, of course.

Nykolaiszyn

I see a theme.

Wade

Yeah. (Laughter) Okay, yeah, I didn’t have a lot of free time unless I was on
a date.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, it is college. What are your memories of the Student Union?

Wade

It was quite a bit smaller when I was there. The bookstore was your biggest
memory. I did spend a lot of time on fourth floor in the…. There was a, not
a lounge, but a place where everybody met to have sodas and stuff. I guess
there was groups on fourth floor, and everybody had their own little group
that they met. That’s about it. There were some good shops down below.
Some of it is going back afterwards, too. I remember from fifty years ago,
maybe being sixty or seventy, not sixty or seventy, forty or thirty, (I was
going the wrong way) when you went back afterwards, you notice things
changing, and I’m not sure when it all happened.

Nykolaiszyn

Was the bowling alley still in the Union, when you were going to school
there, in the basement?

Wade

I don’t know if it was or not. I didn’t ever go bowling. We had to get our
IDs on the second floor. I remember that.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you spend any time in the Library?

Wade

A lot of time in the Library. You learned how to use the card files. There
wasn’t any automation at that time, but yeah. Course, being in the medical,
you had to look a lot up for your classes and things. Maybe not as much
time as I should have, but I did.

Nykolaiszyn

When you think back on some of the classes you took, what buildings were
your classes in? Any stand out for you?
10

Wade

I took a humanities class, but that was on the east side of the campus. Then
most of them were in the science, in the center behind the Library. I don’t
remember the names of them, but…. What’s the one they tore down? I had
one class in it. Then my humanities was in a huge, big…. No, it wasn’t
humanities. It was Introduction to something where if you went every day,
you got an A. I went every day and got a C. It was terrible. I said, “How
could I do that? I think they got me mixed up with somebody else.”
Anyway, the Israeli War, the [Six]-Day War was when I was in that class. I
remember that. That’s all. I don’t remember much about college. I’m sorry;
you picked the wrong alumni. (Laughter) I got a good start. That’s what
happened.

Nykolaiszyn

You graduated in 1970, and so you’re on campus during an interesting time
period. We’re at the tail end of the 1960s. What was the campus culture like
while you were attending?

Wade

There was a lot of Vietnam War stuff going on, people not wanting to go or
discussing it. That was a critical topic at that time.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you notice any protests happening on campus?

Wade

Not a lot. Mostly, people would not be encouraged by it, but they didn’t
really make any concrete, together protests. There was a lot of talking and
discussions that were kind of protesting. I think it was mostly more of the, “I
don’t want to go over there and die” kind of protest. They weren’t…. Most
of ours were not anti-American at any point because Oklahoma was pretty
patriotic. It was the fear of dying, I think, was a lot of it.

Nykolaiszyn

You mentioned that your father eventually got you a car. What did he get
you?

Wade

An old, blue Chevy. I drove my grandmother’s ’55 Oldsmobile for a little
while, and then I got a blue Chevy. Then I went to a red Chevy. I think I got,
periodically, new, faster cars.

Nykolaiszyn

You mentioned that you went on many, many dates…

Wade

Well… (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

…several dates.

Wade

…several dates!

Nykolaiszyn

Where would you go for a typical date, outside of the Hideaway or maybe
Swim’s?
11

Wade

The Sonic Drive-In and sit in the car. That was probably the most popular at
that time. If you don’t have money, which you didn’t a lot when you were in
college, that was the cheapest date you could go on was drive the car. A lot
of times, it was my car. (Laughs) Guys didn’t have cars, so we would go to
Sonic.

Nykolaiszyn

As you were leading up to graduation, did you have an idea of what you
wanted to do with your life?

Wade

At that point, I knew I was going to medical technology school. That was
the whole focus of the four years of college, but I didn’t know where exactly
I would go. There were only three or four schools in Oklahoma that you
could graduate with medical technology, so I chose the biggest and the
closest and actually got in. Several of the people that I went to OSU with
actually got into the same class as I did in school. There was about ten or
eleven in our medical technology school at that point.

Nykolaiszyn

Tell me about graduation day. What do you remember?

Wade

A lot of people graduated.

Nykolaiszyn

Your parents come up?

Wade

Yes, of course, yeah. You have the whole cap and gown thing. I got a little
plastic whatever, booklet, with my diploma in it.

Nykolaiszyn

Where was the ceremony held?

Wade

In the stadium. I was already focused on my next step or getting out. It got
harder. Each progressive year got harder and harder.

Nykolaiszyn

You finished up your schooling in Oklahoma City for your—it took you
about a year?

Wade

Yes, took a year.

Nykolaiszyn

Where did you go after that?

Wade

I stayed in University Hospital in Oklahoma City for a couple of years. Then
I got married, and we spent a year and a half in Europe, working and
traveling over there. Then I came home to Little Rock, Arkansas, in the
bicentennial year and spent a couple of years there. Then we moved back to
Oklahoma to start farming. I worked in Enid, Cherokee, Wakita, Enid, all
the different hospitals.

12

Nykolaiszyn

You were commuting out of Wakita?

Wade

Most of the time, yeah. It was about an hour any direction you go, but it’s
pretty easy. Pretty light traffic.

Nykolaiszyn

In general, tell me what your career entailed. What was your role? What
did you do?

Wade

As a medical technologist, you would basically draw blood from any
patients or outpatients. Then you run all the testing on them, and you advise
doctors on the results that you obtained. My very first job in OU Medical
Center, or University Hospital, was not computerized. They got a computer
the first year I was there. They got a brand new computer. It was about a
room-sized computer, and it was underneath the main lab. They had to run
wires up from the computer room to the lab to run our instruments with.
That was quite a new challenge was learning how to use a computer on
medical instruments. I had a computer course at OSU, but at that time you
were still using punch cards. It took a whole year to make one program at
OSU. Then to jump right into University and get their first automated
machines was pretty interesting.

Nykolaiszyn

You were right there with the change of technology, wow.

Wade

Yes, it was amazing. It was really the first step in automating all the labs.
Now every instrument that you run is automated to a certain degree. It’s
almost a paperless system now in hospitals. Every couple of years, you had
to learn a new system, and that was quite a challenge, too. To not grow up
with computers and then to have it the main focus of your job, it was quite a
bit of learning.

Nykolaiszyn

Was the ultimate goal to move back to this area?

Wade

No, at the time, I didn’t have any preferences to moving back to this area. It
just…what came around. Knowing my husband farmed when I met him was
probably a pretty good indicator, but I enjoyed spending a few years
overseas, too. We still travel a lot, so that’s a good benefit.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you have time to help out on the farm in between your day job?

Wade

No, I tried not to. (Laughter) Once I became a full-time medical
technologist, I tried not to help too much. You still, “Take me to this field
and chauffer me back to this place,” or whatever. I still understood
everything that was going on, but I didn’t work as much as I did growing up.
I drove tractor and combine and trucks and pickups, the whole shebang.
Indoors, air-conditioning was a lot better than outdoors on the farm.

13

Nykolaiszyn

Did you have children?

Wade

No, no kids.

Nykolaiszyn

So you had no extra help for the farm. (Laughs)

Wade

No extra help for the farm, right. Just this last weekend we had a celebration
in Wakita. I was in charge of the bounce house, and I learned why I didn’t
regret not having kids. (Laughs) Now, grandkids, I would like grandkids. I
don’t mind pampering my nieces and nephews and great-nieces and nephews now. I didn’t miss having kids. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

You moved back to this area, and I want you to tell me how Wakita has
changed over the years.

Wade

When I was in high school and living here, there was a farmhouse on every
other quarter or so, so quite a few of the farm community was here. As we
have progressed over the years, the farms have gotten larger and larger, and
the families…. Once the older generation passes away, fewer people are
able to farm because of the economy. It’s quite an expensive profession,
actually. You put everything you make back into the farm, so the farm
community became smaller and smaller. Wakita still is a major farming
town. It’s just we have big family farms now that has taken over as each
family left. The families that are still here incorporate the farms that were
there. There’s a farm every five or six miles, miles now rather than quarters.
It has gotten smaller.

Nykolaiszyn

How has downtown changed over the years?

Wade

Not a whole lot of change. We’ve lost a few stores that we had, but we still
have the newspaper and the grocery store and a post office and bank and city
office. That’s the major businesses, the co-ops. We once had a movie
theater, and we once had a laundromat. We actually had a clothing store at
one time. We had two grocery stores at some point, and they’ve
consolidated down. The grocery store now incorporates what used to be the
drug store, also, so they combined the two stores. We have the basic
amenities. We still have to go out of town to get the entertainment and the
clothes, things like that, but you can survive in Wakita pretty easily.

Nykolaiszyn

When you go to town, what town do you go to?

Wade

Generally Enid because that’s where I worked, so you did all your shopping
while you were there before you came home.

14

Nykolaiszyn

I can’t have a discussion with you about Wakita without talking about the
movie Twister, especially since we’re in the Twister Museum. (Laughter)
Could you talk to me about how the movie Twister impacted the town?

Wade

It was a great impact on the town. A couple of years prior to the movie
coming, Wakita was hit with a big hailstorm, like softball-size hail. We lost
all our roofs, our cars, everything. It also happened in June, so we lost our
harvest income, as well. At that point, the town was pretty down. We had a
lot of buildings at that point that were empty, and being empty, they were
uninsurable. With that loss of income, and buildings that were uninsurable,
they didn’t get repaired. The town, a couple of years later, was in the
process of urban renewal, so to speak, tearing down some of these buildings
that hadn’t been fixed. The movie came in and said, “Let us do it for you.”
They did a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of demolition work for the
town, used it in their movie, and then cleaned it up for us.
That was a major benefit to the town. Then, of course, the inflow of people
at that point, they bought things from our grocery stores, our filling stations.
They rented facilities; they leased property. After two years of low income,
then to have all this come in, it was a great benefit to the town. Pretty much
everyone was okay with it. There were a few people that were depressed
about the tear-down of the buildings. Course, it was going to happen
anyway, but it’s sad to see some of your older buildings torn down. That
was probably the most adverse part of the movie coming. They let everyone
in town become extras in the movie. They fed us and paid us, and we got to
meet all the stars and everything. Everybody enjoyed that.
Anyone in town had the opportunity to have some benefit from the movie if
they wanted to. If they didn’t, it was their own decision at that point. They
were in Wakita from April through August, so quite a lengthy amount of
time. You got to know people from Hollywood. It was interesting, talking
taxes and houses and cars and all the usual stuff growing up. It’s been
twenty years now, so it’s still amazing the number of people, a lot of
Oklahoma people especially, that the movie made an impact on. We get
visitors here in Wakita. The museum’s open April through August, and we
have daily visitors, which is still amazing. After twenty years, you wouldn’t
think that. Visitors to the museum come from all over the world.
We’d have visitors from every continent. Even Antarctica, we’ve had
someone visit. Wakita is more or less out of the way for visitors. You don’t
come to Wakita unless you’re intending to come to Wakita, so to have them
come here is really super. Of course, that impacts the economy a little bit, as
well, and for twenty years. We had no idea that it would last this long. Even
in making the museum, Warner Brothers said, “You’ll have this just for a
couple of years, and that’s the normal movie impact.” I’m sure they were

15

thinking thousands of visitors. (Laughs) Nevertheless, I get a dozen or more
every day, and that’s 100 percent more than we had before-movie.
Nykolaiszyn

How did the idea for the museum come about?

Wade

The Garden Club of the town started it because Warner Brothers said,
“You’ll have visitors for a couple of years.” We put up a walking trail and a
museum. We felt like if they came all the way to Wakita, it would be nice
for them to have something to see and visit. We were counting on the two
years, but now, twenty years later, there’s a lot fewer volunteers to the
museum. There’s a lot fewer people that actually lived through the movie to
volunteer, so it’s a challenge now to keep it open.

Nykolaiszyn

This is your post-retirement?

Wade

My post-retirement job, myself and another lady. The post mistress of town
retired a few years ago, also, so the two of us keep it running April through
August. Then we kick back and relax in the wintertime. We still make
appointments and things during the winter. We just don’t keep it open
because the utilities get a little high in the wintertime for sure because
there’s tall ceilings. We have, actually, lots of storm chasers. I think the
movie has really elevated the profession of meteorology to the point where
they have trouble getting into meteorology school. You really have to fight
for your class position to get into meteorology, and a large part of that is
because of the movie. It’s the best tornado movie ever made. I’m sure of
that. The storm chasers all tell me that. I mean Sharknado, go figure.
(Laughter)
They did try to make the movie as accurate as they could. It’s still a movie,
but it is a great movie. Storm chasers, especially the ones that take people on
vacations to find storms, they come here a lot. If the weather’s fair, then
they come here. If there’s a tornado somewhere, then they’re out there, but
they do visit here a lot. That’s where I get a lot of my foreign visitors,
China, Japan, Australia, a lot of those. They have little tastes of tornadoes in
their countries, but they don’t get the big tornadoes and the number of
tornadoes that we have in the United States. I guess because there’s (I don’t
know) smaller countries, different heating and cooling. I’m not sure why.
They do like to come to the US and chase.

Nykolaiszyn

What’s your favorite piece in the museum?

Wade

I have the Dorothy from the movie, the one that got beat up. It has character.
There are other Dorothys out there, but they’re all pretty. Mine’s the one
with character. Going through making a movie like this gives you a whole
new perspective of the movie industry, to see how much work they have to
go through to make each detail correct. Now the computer, here again, they
16

do CGI a lot more than they did twenty years ago. I’m sure it’s all different
than what it was then, but it sure did open your eyes to go through one and
see everything they had to do. We were only one area of five in Oklahoma
used for filming, as well as Iowa and Hollywood.
Wakita’s ambulance actually got to go to Hollywood for retakes. We’re the
star; Wakita water tower is the star. Now, Bill Paxton was actually our
favorite movie star while he was here. He’s from Texas originally, so
Oklahoma was pretty much at home for him. He showed up in boots and
jeans and brought a football and played catch with everybody, signed
autographs, took pictures and things. He donated a pinball machine to the
museum. He donated the football to the museum. We have lots of his
autographs. Everybody else was nice, but he was particularly outstanding.
Nykolaiszyn

When you’re watching the movie, can you see where you were an extra?
Can you tell where?

Wade

Most of my parts were off-screen. Here they are, walking down the street,
and I would be in the next scene that was cut. One of my scenes is actually
on there, but pretty much we’re a little dot in the background. They were
filming in Wakita for a month and a half for about fifteen minutes of the
movie, so they did cut a lot of stuff. We were fortunate, being twenty years
ago, they let us take home movies. We have a big DVD of about three
different people’s home videos, mostly schoolteachers who were off for the
summer. We do have pictures of all the stuff they built and tore down that
didn’t end up in the movie. For the movie, we were actually five blocks of
sidewalk-to-sidewalk, head-high debris for a while. It was like a real
tornado. They had armed guards around the town to keep people from
coming in and getting hurt. It was the real thing at that point. They were
trying very hard to make it realistic.

Nykolaiszyn

Who knew it would have such an impact twenty years later.

Wade

It’s amazing. Still, we get phone calls all the time to make appointments
while we’re closed. I had someone from San Antonio yesterday, no, day
before yesterday. Have someone from Canada coming tomorrow. Those are
appointments since I’m closed.

Nykolaiszyn

Thinking back at your time at OSU, how did attending college in Stillwater
impact your life?

Wade

Coming from a small town, the fact that I went to a larger university
broadened my view of people and of the world. When you’re growing up,
you really don’t have much knowledge of what’s going on out in the real
world, and so attending a college is definitely a plus in that aspect. It helps
you meet people, makes you open up. I was pretty shy growing up, and so it
17

helped me converse with people. You have to learn a lot of different
cultures, different professions, all this stuff when you go to college. You
learn a whole lot more.
Nykolaiszyn

Have you kept in touch with any of your classmates, roommates, fellow
medical school students?

Wade

Mostly I’ve kept in touch with people from Wakita that went to school with
me. There were several Wakita students that went to OSU, and so we were
pretty close. We would ride home together, share rides and everything, so
that definitely kept us closer together. As far as people I met, not too many
of them. There’s a few, but it seems like life keeps you from doing anything
more than Christmas cards. Now internet, Facebook, has made it a lot easier
to connect with people that you knew then.

Nykolaiszyn

Have you been back to Stillwater much since you graduated?

Wade

After I came back to Oklahoma, we went quite a bit. Now that I’ve gotten
older, I don’t do as much as I used to. We do go to Eskimo Joe’s often, and I
do get my t-shirts from Eskimo Joe’s. We go back to Stillwater some but not
as much as we did when we were younger. Now, if I’d had kids, probably
they would’ve gone to school there, so I would be back more, but since I
didn’t…. I do have a niece that went to school there, actually two nieces,
and I have a great-nephew going to school there now. Yeah, we go back a
little more now than we did. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

It’s a good excuse for cheese fries.

Wade

Yes, exactly. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

What advice would you give students today?

Wade

Gosh, go to school, pay attention but have a good time, I suppose. Get your
degree. I think going to college is pretty important. Take advantage of doors
that you need to open once in a while. It’s not always what you know but
who you know. Make some friends.

Nykolaiszyn

It seems that many OSU alums feel very loyal to the school. What is it about
Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty?

Wade

That’s a tough one. I don’t know, I guess. I’m pretty sure every college
student is pretty loyal to their alum. It’d be nice if the football team really
got better, I guess. I think we beat OU a couple of years while I was in
school, and that probably really helped make the loyalty, I guess you’d say.
A lot of my fellow classmates went to OU, also, and so we kept up a rivalry

18

going all the time. I don’t know. OSU was a good school, gave me a good
education, so you’re just loyal.
Nykolaiszyn

You mentioned that there are several OSU alums in Grant County. Do you
find that a lot of folks in this part of the state go to OSU, or maybe more
Alva, or NOC-Enid?

Wade

In my growing up, my era, we did. More of us went to OSU because it was
farming related in this area. Now that farms have become larger, it’s not
quite as important for the younger kids to go to OSU because they’re not
going to be involved in farming. Anyone who is in farming definitely needs
the college education because everything is computer operated. You have to
understand all the government programs, and it takes a good, intelligent
mind to do farming in today’s generation. Most of the farmers that I know
have gone to OSU now. The college has definitely helped the state of
Oklahoma as far as farming has gone. They’ve helped organic farmers.
They’ve helped in the setting up corporations and businesses, and learning
how to do bar codes and how to promote your industry and everything. It’s
definitely been an impact on the farming community.

Nykolaiszyn

That’s definitely still a big part of Wakita.

Wade

Almost all of Wakita. If you’re farming, you’re…. Yeah, if you live in
Wakita and your parents are here, you’re a farm family.

Nykolaiszyn

I noticed you still have your post office. Are your schools still in operation
here?

Wade

We lost our school about five years ago; we consolidated with Medford,
which is about fifteen miles away. That is not quite as big farming, but a
large part of it is also farming community.

Nykolaiszyn

How many grain elevators do y’all have in town?

Wade

We have two. We have a farmers co-op, and then a commercial, Johnston’s
Grain out of Enid.

Nykolaiszyn

Looking back on everything, you’re still in Wakita. You’re here at the
museum. What keeps you here in this part of Oklahoma doing this postretirement work?

Wade

I get to meet a lot of fun people, and so that’s probably the most enjoyable
part of running the museum. The fact that my father is still in the area, so
I’m here for him a lot. I don’t know how much longer I will keep the
museum open. I’m looking for someone else to help me out, but as long as
I’m here, I’ll have it. Someday I’d really like to retire, I think. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Linda, it’s been great talking with you today. Is there anything else you’d
like to add that we haven’t covered today? What have I missed? (Laughter)

Wade

My memory isn’t very good anymore, but when you hit almost seventy, it’s
like, “Okay, you remember….” I can remember twenty years; fifty years is
another story. I enjoyed….

Nykolaiszyn

We appreciate your time.

Wade

Thank you. I enjoyed growing up on a farm. It was quite an experience to be
outdoors all the time and have siblings to play with all the time, learning
how to run equipment. I learned to drive in the middle of a field. It’s a whole
new, different life than growing up in a city. That’s for sure.

Nykolaiszyn

Very different.

Wade

It’s a good benefit in this day and age. There’s very little crime in Wakita.
We don’t have excellent healthcare, but we do have a nursing home that is
very good, and we have all the basic amenities. It’s a good place to live,
Grant County.

Nykolaiszyn

There we go! That’s a good way to end. Thank you, Linda.

Wade

You bet.
