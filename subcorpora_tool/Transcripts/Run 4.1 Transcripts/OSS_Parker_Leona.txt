About Leona Cissie Parker…
“Cissie” (Maria Cecilia Leona Louise Crixell) Parker was born in 1928 to parents of ScotchIrish, English, Spanish, and French descent. As a teen, she moved to Oklahoma and attended a
co-ed school for the first time, after attending all-girls schools in Texas. Her brother arranged a
blind date for her with one of his friends, which turned out to be a huge success. Cissie and
Eugene (Gene) were married in 1945 while Cissie was still a senior in high school. Gene was in
the Navy for aviation training since it was wartime, but before he finished his training, World
War II had ended. Now able to attend college on the GI Bill, Gene enrolled at Oklahoma State
University (then Oklahoma A&M College). The couple lived in a trailer that measured sixteen
by thirty-two feet at OSU’s Vet Village, a housing area made specifically for the thousands of
military veterans and their wives returning to school. Vet Village was a town within a town,
providing its own fire station, post office, and even a mayor.
Gene earned thirty dollars a month on the “sewer crew” at the village, and Cissie earned money
babysitting and doing odd jobs she found, as needed After Gene earned his bachelor’s and
master’s degrees at OSU, he took a teaching job in Hinton, becoming superintendent in less than
six years, and while still in his twenties. The couple, now with a family, moved to Killeen,
Texas, where Gene opened an elementary school and assisted with the junior high and high
schools. He served as an educator for forty years, touching hundreds of lives. In her interview,
Cissie selflessly gives her late husband most of the focus but deserves just as much of the
spotlight. She also reminisces about living in Vet Village, the ways they kept busy and had fun,
and the challenges they encountered and overcame.

Leona “Cissie” Parker
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Juliana Nykolaiszyn
June 23, 2014
Killeen, Texas
Nykolaiszyn

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn, and I’m talking with Leona Cissie Parker
by telephone as part of the O-STATE Stories Oral History Project. Cissie is
in her home in Killeen, Texas, and I’m in the library at the Oklahoma State
University Campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Today is June 23, 2014. Cissie,
do we have permission to record this phone interview today?

Parker

Yes ma’am, you sure do.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, well, let’s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you begin
by telling me your full name and the year you were born?

Parker

My full name is—you really want it? It’s Maria Cecilia Leona Louise
Crixell Parker. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Parker

I know, and Crixell is spelled C-R-I-X-E-L-L. It’s Spanish from Spain.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and what year were you born?

Parker

Nineteen twenty-eight.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and tell me a little bit about your parents.

Parker

My parents, my mother was a Yankee from Ohio, Scotch-Irish and English.
My father, his parents came from Spain and France. His mother was from
France, and so he was born in Corpus. He was half Spanish and half French.

Nykolaiszyn

Wow, and how did he end up in Texas?

Parker

Well, my grandfather and his brothers came from Spain. There used to be a
little town (it was a port, actually) below the Rio Grande in Brownsville.
4

That’s Texas, of course. It was called Baghdad, and that’s where the ships
landed. They came up into the States from there, and his folks went to
Corpus, and that’s where he was born.
Nykolaiszyn

And what did your parents do for a living?

Parker

My mother was a homemaker. My father was an entrepreneur. I’m getting to
the age where I’m having difficulty pronouncing things. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

And what type of business did he engage in?

Parker

Well, in Mexico at one time, he had, I guess you’d call them bars,
restaurants, you know, that type of thing in Mexico. Then in the United
States he ran one of the first trolleys across the border from Matamoros to
Brownsville. He was a very interesting person, and he lost all of his money
when I was about three because Pancho Villa’s lieutenant, who was called
Caballo Blanco, (that means “White Horse”) Daddy wouldn’t serve them,
and they burned him out. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

Very interesting. And do you have any siblings?

Parker

I had four half-siblings, and one full sibling.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and how did your mother meet your father?

Parker

I’m not sure. They met in Brownsville, I’m sure. My maternal grandmother
and grandfather had a farm. They lived in Oklahoma, and they had this farm
down in Brownsville. I think they came down to check on it, and Mama was
with them or something and met Daddy then.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay. Well, let’s talk a little bit about your early life growing up. You grew
up in Brownsville, I’m assuming?

Parker

Yes ma’am, until I was thirteen, when my mother died.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and tell me a little bit about the types of schools you attended as a
young girl.

Parker

I attended the convent, Incarnate Word Academy, and then Villa Maria,
which was the high school, until I went to Oklahoma.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and what circumstances brought you to Oklahoma?

Parker

Well, my mother passed away, and my older sister, Ardoth’s mother, was
fifteen years older than I, and she became my little sister’s and my guardian.

5

So we moved to Oklahoma where she was, and my grandmother lived in
Cleveland, which is about sixty miles east, I think, of Stillwater.
Nykolaiszyn

So when you came to Oklahoma, what were some of your first thoughts?

Parker

Going to a public school for the first time, and there were boys.

Nykolaiszyn

That was a big, big change?

Parker

Oh yes, I went to an all-girls school. That was a shock, believe me, a culture
shock.

Nykolaiszyn

And in Oklahoma did you live in the city or on a farm?

Parker

We lived in the city. Cleveland is a very small town, until I went to
Oklahoma City to live with my sister and my brother. Of course, that was a
large town.

Nykolaiszyn

So as you’re growing up and you’re in Texas and then you came to
Oklahoma, what would you do for fun? What’s an ideal time you would
have?

Parker

Well, we went to Christian Endeavor on Monday evening. That’s the young
people organization in the church there, and for fun we’d go get in the back
of one of the boys’ pick-up and go in and drive through the graveyard. That
was a big no-no, but we did it. We got caught, too, and so I was in big doodoo then. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

Well, how did you meet your husband, Eugene?

Parker

My brother and Gene apparently worked together in a gas station while in
high school in Brownsville, to my knowledge. I never saw him before. My
sister and I, when we lived in Oklahoma together in the city, my sister and I
went to a movie one Sunday afternoon, Gene was stationed in Norman. He
was a—no he was in Purcell then because he was in gunner’s school then.
Believe it or not, the Navy was in Norman and Purcell. He came in to visit
my brother, and Katie and I got home from the movie, and he said, “I made
you a blind date for next weekend.” I was so mad I could’ve killed him. Of
course, then, the end of that story is we were married sixty-two years when
he died, and this coming January would be seventy.

Nykolaiszyn

So where was your first date to?

Parker

We went with my brother and his fiancée, whom he later married, and we
went to a night club of some sort. There’s a picture in there of Gene and I

6

sitting at a table with beer bottles in front of us, and that was our first date.
(Laughter)
Nykolaiszyn

Would you do much dancing?

Parker

No ma’am, we didn’t because my husband, God love him, he had two left
feet. (Laughter) He liked to try, but, you know, that’s the way it goes.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and what year were you married?

Parker

January 21, 1945.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and so while you were courting and dating, he was in the service?

Parker

Yes ma’am.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, and did you travel with him to the different locations, or did you just
stay put in Oklahoma?

Parker

Only after we were married. I was still a senior in high school, (I hate to say
it) and I was going to a Catholic school. I didn’t dare let the nuns know I
was married. Then as soon as I graduated, he was sent to flight training in
Iowa City, Iowa. I was going to go out there. Well, I had an attack of
appendicitis, and I had to go to the naval hospital and have my appendix out.
That was delayed, but as soon as I got out of the hospital, I went out to Iowa
with him.

Nykolaiszyn

And was he ever, did he ever serve overseas?

Parker

No ma’am. What happened was he initially got in the—he was a cadet in the
aviation training. All of a sudden they had too many pilots, so they put him
in gunner school. He received his gunnery wings. He was in Jacksonville,
Florida, getting ready to ship out, and all of a sudden too many pilots were
getting killed, and so they called him and others, naturally, back in the flight
program. He was the only married cadet, but they needed them, so they took
him back in. Then the war was over with before training was finished.

Nykolaiszyn

I see. I see. So after World War II, what happened next?

Parker

Well, back then, you didn’t receive a discharge immediately. You had what
you called a separation, and so that meant that they could call you back any
time they wanted. We were in Oklahoma City. That’s where my brother and
my sister—my sister was married by that time to Dr. Hassler, Ardoth’s
father. Gene had gone to junior college in Brownsville, but he wanted to go
back to college. He could have the GI [Bill]. It was hard to get in, but Dr.
Hassler, he kind of paved the way. He was able to get in Oklahoma A&M,
7

and so that’s when we moved there. I became pregnant while we were in
Stillwater. We initially were in a little sixteen-foot trailer. Fortunately the
married ones, when they got—I’m getting ahead of myself, aren’t I?
Nykolaiszyn

Well, let’s back up just a little bit.

Parker

Okay.

Nykolaiszyn

What were your first impressions of Stillwater?

Parker

It was a small, sleepy town at that time, and coming from Oklahoma City, it
was fine. Of course, we stayed in the Village most of the time, except when
we went to work.

Nykolaiszyn

And so Vet Village was kind of like a city unto itself.

Parker

Oh, yes ma’am.

Nykolaiszyn

Could you describe it for me a little bit?

Parker

Well, my understanding is that all of a sudden, the college was inundated
with, I think they said ten thousand vets going to school. Maybe there
weren’t that many. We had our own post office, our own mayor, our own
fire station, everything. We were a little town, all on our own.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, so let’s talk about the first place you lived in Vet Village. Could you
describe that for me?

Parker

Yes ma’am. As I started to tell you, it was a little sixteen-foot trailer, and I
was pregnant. I’d go in to the little stove—the stove was coal oil, kerosene,
and you’d have to pump it. I’d be at the stove, and if I wanted in the little
fridge, I’d have to go out into the living area and turn around and come back
to get in the fridge. There wasn’t enough room for a pregnant woman to turn
around. (Laughter) Then they started building the hutments. The married
ones without children had a single hutment which was sixteen by sixteen,
and those with children had a double hutment. They put two of them
together. It was sixteen by thirty-two. We, fortunately, were able to move
into a double hutment.

Nykolaiszyn

And did you make any additions to your hutment?

Parker

Oh, yes. Do I tell her? (Laughs) Okay. Gene, he was a fix-it person. I mean,
he could do anything. He and one of our neighbors—his last name was
Solomon. I can’t remember his first name. Gene called him by his last name.
The school had some lockers that they’d received, and they were in
cardboard boxes, and so they went and told the school they’d unload them
8

for them if they’d give them the boxes, which they did. Then they did some
midnight requisitioning and came home with some tar paper, and they put
the tar paper—you understand the hutments were just the outside wall and
the studs, and that was it. They put the tar paper on the wall, and then they
put the cardboard from stud to stud, taped it, and we Kem-Toned it. Then I
raided, my grandmother in Cleveland, raided her basement for all sorts of
curtains and things, and we fixed it up really nice. We had the nicest one, I
think, and Gene planted flowers out in front and put up a little fence.
Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Parker

Yeah, he was always fixing it up. That’s working, going to school full-time.
He worked on the sewer crew, and studying and keeping up his grades.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you add a garden?

Parker

No ma’am, we didn’t have a garden.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay. So what was your husband studying while at A&M?

Parker

Well, he started out as a chemical engineer, and he was a junior when all of
a sudden, engineers were coming back to school to use up their GI because
there were no jobs. He took tests, and he came home, and he told me that he
was going into education. I nearly died laughing. I couldn’t imagine him as
an educator. He was one of the best ones ever.

Nykolaiszyn

And so while he was working on his degrees, he was also working, you
mentioned, the sewer crew?

Parker

Yes ma’am, that’s what we called it. He made thirty dollars a month, which
paid our rent. What they would do is, they’d go around in the village only
and fix any commodes or any type of plumbing that went wrong.

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Parker

The sewer crew. (Laughs) I guess you’d call them the plumbers.

Nykolaiszyn

And so while he was working and studying, you were pregnant.

Parker

Yes ma’am.

Nykolaiszyn

Did you do anything else around the village?

Parker

Well, I babysat one couple’s little boy. Then when my little sister got out of
school in the summers, she’d come down and stay with our child, and then
I’d work at whatever I could find.
9

Nykolaiszyn

What were some of the jobs you did?

Parker

Well, I worked at a drugstore for sure, for a couple of summers. Then there
was a gentleman at this college. His name was Andy Anderson. I’ll never
forget him. He’s gone, isn’t he? I’m sure he is. My brother-in-law, Dr.
Hassler, knew him, and they had what they called Series A and Series B for
the students. They’d bring in—Series A was classical musicians. Series B
were the, like, big bands. Another lady and I, we were able to get jobs
ushering at those things. We made fifty cents an hour, and that was great.

Nykolaiszyn

That’s good money back then.

Parker

Yes ma’am, it was great money. It helped, too.

Nykolaiszyn

Was it difficult raising children in Vet Village?

Parker

You know, we were so young, I don’t think we realized just how bad off we
were. I think you just go with the flow. You do what you have to do. All of
us had children. Very few people didn’t have children. There’s one picture
of my daughter’s first birthday party, in that bunch, (I think she sent it) all of
the little village kids around us.

Nykolaiszyn

What would the kids do for fun in Vet Village?

Parker

Just play, yeah, just play together. They didn’t have any type of playground
or anything. They’d just play together.

Nykolaiszyn

Would there be any types of family gatherings?

Parker

Oh, yes, we’d get together. My grandmother would come periodically to see
us from Cleveland, and everybody on our street knew her big ol’ (what did
she have, a Packard?) Packard or a Buick or something, a great big ol’ car.
They knew it when she drove in because she always had food in the car.
(Laughs) Everybody’d come running out to see Grandma Sadie.

Nykolaiszyn

Would you visit much with your neighbors?

Parker

Oh, yes, yes. Yes, some of them became pretty good friends, and the thing
of it is, most of them are gone.

Nykolaiszyn

When y’all would get together, what were some things you would do with
your neighbors?

Parker

Well, play cards. Gene, once he decided he was going to make some hooch,
some moonshine. He had a great big water bottle, one of those ozone-like
10

water bottles, and he put canned peaches and I don’t know what all in there.
Well, we had a party, and one guy went to the hospital. That was the last of
his whiskey making. (Laughs) No more of that.
Nykolaiszyn

Would you do all of your shopping in vet village?

Parker

No ma’am, we didn’t have a commissary there. We had to go to town.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Parker

We used the bus.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, I was going to ask you how you got around.

Parker

Yes, there was a bus.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Parker

Gene walked to school, mainly. That’s how Nina, our daughter, got her
name. One day, I think he was running late or something, and he took the
bus. This lady got on, (this was before she was born) got on, and she called
her daughter Diana. He loved it. He came home, “That’s what we’re going
to call her,” and we did.

Nykolaiszyn

Were there any popular places in Vet Village that y’all would go?

Parker

No ma’am, we didn’t have any particular place.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, what about off-campus?

Parker

Well, we didn’t do much. We went to ballgames some because the vets got
tickets, you know. Gene liked the basketball games, so we went to a couple
or three of those. Otherwise, we just kind of entertained ourselves.

Nykolaiszyn

So your husband not only finished his bachelor’s degree but also his
master’s degree at A&M…

Parker

Correct, yes.

Nykolaiszyn

…in a real short period of time…

Parker

Three and a half years.

Nykolaiszyn

…which is quite impressive. So both were in education?

Parker

Yes ma’am.
11

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, so what happened after graduation?

Parker

Well, he got a little—have you ever heard of Hinton, Oklahoma?

Nykolaiszyn

I have not.

Parker

Well, it’s west of El Reno on [Route] 66, a little south of 66. Anyway, it’s a
small consolidated school, and they ran big buses. In ’49, he was able to get
a job there teaching. I think she took pictures of his certification thing. Then
in ’50, he became secondary principal, and in ’55 he became superintendent.
There again, he was the youngest—no, in ’57, I’m sorry. Wait a minute. In
’50 he became principal, and in ’54 he became superintendent, yeah. There
again, he was the youngest superintendent at the time because he was just in
his twenties.

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Parker

Well, late twenties, but he was still in his twenties.

Nykolaiszyn

And did he move on from that post?

Parker

Well, we came to Texas then because his mother was diagnosed with breast
cancer, and she was here in Killeen. He’s only been to two schools, two
places. He applied down here so we could come and take care of she and her
sister. He was able to open a new elementary in ’56. He opened it, and it
stayed open until this year.

Nykolaiszyn

Oh, wow.

Parker

I know. He opened the elementary, and then a couple or so, maybe four
years, I don’t know—that was in ’56. In ’64, then, they built a new high
school. They wanted the old high school converted to a junior high, so they
asked him to convert that, which he did, but he wanted his elementary back.
He loved that. He was able to go back eventually, and that’s where he
retired.

Nykolaiszyn

How many years as an educator?

Parker

Forty.

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Parker

Yes, and as I said, if you could see some of the pictures and some of the—if
you could have been at the visitation at his funeral, I had never realized how
many lives he touched. I knew he had, but I never realized how many.
12

Anyway, he was a good one. I still have people to this day that tell me what
a wonderful educator he was.
Nykolaiszyn

Well, you raised three children.

Parker

Yes ma’am.

Nykolaiszyn

You had one at Vet Village, Diana.

Parker

Yes.

Nykolaiszyn

Were your other two born in Oklahoma, or in…

Parker

No, here in Killeen.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Parker

We were older, and the good Lord didn’t see fit to give them to us earlier.
Nina was, I say she was fifteen. She says she was fourteen, so somewhere in
that vicinity, we had two more, fourteen months apart, two more girls.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay, wonderful.

Parker

We consider Ardoth ours, too. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

You know, thinking back of your times here in Stillwater with your husband
and with the different families and, you know, having your first child in
Stillwater, are there any memories that really just stick out in your mind
from this experience in Vet Village?

Parker

Well, we had to make our own entertainment, of course. There was a
waterhole somewhere in Stillwater. It seemed like it was by a refinery or
something. Do you remember, Ardoth? Anyway, it wasn’t a swimming pool,
and we’d go there. I made me a swim suit that fit over my fat belly.
(Laughs) We’d go swimming in there. I remember one time we were
standing outside, and I was very tall at the time. I was a little over fiveseven. This one young man, he looked at Gene, he said, “Parker,” he said,
“you’d have a tall wife if so much wasn’t turned under,” meaning my big
feet. (Laughs) But oh, we had a lot of fun.
One year, Vauda Hill, his father worked for Halliburton. He had an old
clunker of a car, and we decided that we were going to go down to Turner
Falls. Three or four of us couples went. He got used oil from his dad, and
we’d have to stop every few miles and put another one of those quarts of oil
in. (Laughs) We got down to Turner Falls, and we just camped out with
nothing. The guys put some stones together for us ladies, you know, for the
13

necessary, and we washed dishes in the stream. We’d get under the falls.
That was before it became a state park. Out in Hinton, well, we did that a lot
because Vauda had a car. He was the only one at the time.
Nykolaiszyn

Lots of good memories.

Parker

Oh, yes, and I’m sure there’s many that I’m forgetting. I remember the little
boy across the street. Their name was Roberts, and I remember the wife’s
name was Delia, but I don’t remember the husband’s name. The little boy
was called Tookie, and he was about Nina’s age. He would run across the
street every time Nina was outside and bite her and then run back home.
One day I told her, I said, “Well, bite him back.” She got her mouth on him,
all she did was get his arm wet, and he went screaming home. He never bit
her again. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

What about, did—was it easy to cook meals in your hutment?

Parker

Oh yes. Of course, everything was kerosene. One year at Christmastime, a
lot of the kids went to their folks’ that could, and it became eighteen below
zero. It was cold, and everything, of course, would break, like commodes.
Those people weren’t there, and so Gene goes out with the sewer crew
trying to help that. Well, we had this little kerosene stove in the middle of
the living area, and the pipe went up through the ceiling, the vent pipe. It
was so cold, and I had Nina’s little baby bed pushed up against it, everything
I owned on top of her. Had a cap on her head and everything. The snow
would come in through that vent pipe and collect around the stove on the
floor, believe it or not. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Parker

It was cold that year. I don’t remember which year it was.

Nykolaiszyn

How would you do your laundry?

Parker

By hand on the scrub board. Gene, the only clothes he had were his Navy
khakis, and that’s what he wore. I’d starch them and iron them.

Nykolaiszyn

And did you have a radio?

Parker

That’s what we moved to Stillwater with. That’s all we had. It was an old,
old upright radio that one of the family had given us, and that was it. Yes
ma’am, we had a radio.

Nykolaiszyn

And what were some of the shows you’d listen to?

14

Parker

Oh, I don’t remember. I was trying to remember. Fibber McGee and Molly
was one, and Amos ʼnʽ Andy. I know there were others, but I just can’t—oh,
The Green Hornet. I can’t remember, but there were bunches of them.

Nykolaiszyn

Would others come over to listen to the radio, or would you go to other
hutments to do something like radio?

Parker

Yes, they would come over to the house. I gave all of the women—I was
fortunate to have a set of Toni curlers, and I would give permanents, as long
as they’d buy the permanent. I would give them permanents and cut their
hair. Now, I know nothing whatsoever about hair dressing, but I did it
anyway. That’s how we got our hair done. That was women getting together
and enjoying. We did all sorts of stuff. There was a phone booth; it was by
our hutment. We lived in, Number Eight Kiowa was our address. I’m sure
there were phone booths situated around the village. It would ring, and I’d
always answer it for some reason or the other. I became the telephone
operator. They knew to call—families would call that phone for different
people, and we’d go get them. That’s how we communicated. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

Great memories of Vet Village.

Parker

Oh, yes. It was something else, I’ll tell you.

Nykolaiszyn

I bet it was.

Parker

Yes.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, let’s learn a little bit more about what you ended up doing.

Parker

Well, I didn’t work in Hinton, in Oklahoma. We came to Killeen, and I
started working the bank in ’57, and I retired from there. I took time off in
between when the little two were in elementary. The bank was—they never
paid well. I wasn’t making a whole bunch, anyway, and I was ruining more
pantyhose than I was making, I think. I finally came home and told Gene
one day, I said—they needed me there to help at the school and all. I told
him that we were going to eat beans and tortillas, and I was going to stay
home for a while, which I did until they were in junior high. I realized we
had college again, coming up. The first one, Diana, she graduated from
[Mary Hardin-] Baylor, and received her master’s at Stephen F. Austin. I
went back to work, and we got them through college and married. All three
of them married, and still married, fortunately. Nina will have her fiftieth
anniversary next September. I mean April, next April.

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

15

Parker

Yeah, she’s sixty-seven now. She’ll be sixty-eight in September. Can you
believe it?

Nykolaiszyn

That’s amazing.

Parker

Yeah, I know.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, looking back on your life, how would you want to be remembered?

Parker

Oh, that’s a hard one. I guess as a good mother, a good wife, good aunt. I
guess just the best person I can be. I have never had any great
accomplishments. That was up to Gene. (Laughs) He had all the kudos.
Now, one thing in Vet Village, I was the Queen at one time.

Nykolaiszyn

You were?

Parker

Yes.

Nykolaiszyn

How did that come about?

Parker

Well, there were different queens in the school. Each club, I guess, had a
queen, and I think it was the Photography Club. I’m not sure. Don’t ask me
how I got roped into it because I was working. All I remember is that I was
nominated, and so were a bunch of other girls out there. I got home from
work one day, and they were going to take a group picture. Well, they
weren’t working. They had time to gussie up, and I didn’t. Anyway, I ended
it by winning. The picture’s in one of the yearbooks…

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Parker

…of my husband and the baby and I. It’s in our hutment. It’s in a chair in
our hutment. The picture was taken, and I can’t remember what year that
was. Probably his last year. That’d make it ’48, ’49 maybe.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, what are we missing?

Parker

I don’t know. What do you think?

Nykolaiszyn

Any other family stories you end up telling about Vet Village when you all
get together?

Parker

Can you think of any I’ve told you, Baby? I told her about Grandma Sadie
coming in, yes. Everybody’d come over, and they knew that big car had
food in it. Told her about how we’d go to Turner Falls, and about the year
that it was eighteen below zero and how I kept you warm. Well, it was three

16

and a half years, and it becomes a blur. I mean, I’m eighty-six years old.
(Laughter)
Nykolaiszyn

But it sounds just like yesterday.

Parker

You’re lucky I remember anything.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, is there anything else you’d like to add or talk about that we have not
spoken about today?

Parker

I’ll probably think of something later, but at the moment now, I can’t.

Nykolaiszyn

Well Cissie, I really appreciate your time today. It’s been really interesting
for me to learn more about Vet Village and your family…

Parker

Yeah.

Nykolaiszyn

…and your husband, as well.

Parker

I’m so glad that you’re going to have at least some kind of a history because
we drove up, not too long before Gene died. We were in Stillwater, and he
was bemoaning the fact that there wasn’t even a plaque to tell where the
village was, you know?

Nykolaiszyn

That’s right.

Parker

Like I said, there were so many veterans there, and the fact is, I think we
made the town grow. (Laughter)

Nykolaiszyn

Absolutely.

Ardoth Hassler

Juliana, earlier she mentioned Andy Anderson and my dad helping get
Uncle Gene into OSU.

Nykolaiszyn

Yes.

Hassler

My dad was an OSU alum, as was his brother. He was Ferdinand Rudolph
Hassler, and then John James Hassler. My Uncle John married Pauline Dark,
and I believe that her sister was married to Andy Anderson, and he was on
the faculty in Stillwater…

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Hassler

…because it was all intertwined. I suspect that if Daddy had a hand in
helping get Uncle Gene into OSU, it was, one, his alumni ties because he

17

maintained contact with a lot of people up there, and also probably Andy
Anderson had a hand in it, as well.
Parker

Yes, the reason you needed help getting in, because so many veterans were
coming back, wanting to go to school, and they were full.

Nykolaiszyn

Right.

Parker

It was hard to get in, yeah.

Nykolaiszyn

And since he was looking at engineering, is that why he came to OSU, or
was he looking at OU or other schools?

Parker

No, no.

Nykolaiszyn

Okay.

Parker

It was just, he was able to get in, and he was just glad to get in a school.

Nykolaiszyn

Right.

Parker

Of course, we were from Brownsville, but my family was there. All he had
left—his father was FBI, and he was killed when Gene was nine. Gene had
two younger brothers in Brownsville. There was really nothing to keep us
from staying in Oklahoma, which we did until we had to move back to
Texas, which we did also, and been here ever since. Like I said, he didn’t go
from school to school. We would’ve probably stayed in Oklahoma, had it
not been for that.

Nykolaiszyn

Right.

Parker

We came here, and at one time I was working full-time, had a teenager, two
babies, two older people, my husband, (Laughs) and did all my own
housework and cooking and washing and ironing and everything. I have
gray hair now. (Laughter) It gave me gray hair.

Nykolaiszyn

You kept everything going.

Parker

Yes, well, we did. Gene, he was so conscientious. We’re a military town
here in Killeen. I don’t know whether you’ve ever heard of Fort Hood or
not?

Nykolaiszyn

Yes, ma’am.

Parker

Okay, well that’s where we are. During the Cold War, he was told that the
Army would send buses in an emergency for the military children. Gene
18

asked, “Well, how about the civilians?” “Well, they can’t get on the bus.”
Gene said, “That’s what you think.” (Laughs) He stayed with them. He told
me I was responsible for getting his mother, his aunt, Nina, Genie, and Paula
all out of town. We had our route mapped out because we had atomic
weapons.
Nina Bible

This is Nina.

Parker

The one that was born in Stillwater.

Bible

In 1963, we lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis...

Nykolaiszyn

Ah.

Parker

Yes.

Bible

…and so we were number four on the list to be bombed. I was a junior in
high school. Mom had, she had provisions in the trunk, and in high school
we were afraid to even go anywhere. We did the practice where we would
get under the desk like if a missile was coming, and, yeah, a lot of good it
would have done.

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Bible

We were probably more in danger of tornadoes than actually being hit by an
atomic bomb. It was very scary during that time. We had a lot happen in a
very short period of time.

Parker

Yeah.

Bible

But I will tell you that Dad, his education really made a difference in this
town because he opened one of the really most favorite—did you tell her
about Fowler?

Parker

Yeah.

Bible

Also, he hired many people who one of them went on to be a very beloved
superintendent, and many people who are still educators or retired educators
were hired by my dad and learned a lot from him. The education he got at
OSU really did a lot for Killeen Independent School District.

Nykolaiszyn

That’s wonderful to hear. We always love to see that impact, right, because
you never know as we have young students in college the great things they
go on to do, and to see that impact is always so rewarding...

Bible

Right.
19

Nykolaiszyn

…ten years, twenty years, fifty years down the road.

Bible

Yeah, exactly, yeah. Something else he did, this is probably kind of
insignificant, but he was very, very proficient in, of course, math and
science, and that was not my forte in high school. He got many a friend
through the higher mathematics and science. They spent a lot of time at our
house on the floor with Genie and Paula climbing all over them, and that’s
how they remember learning, like, Physics and Chemistry and Algebra II.
He helped me a lot. They remember him not only as their principal, but as
their tutor for my class at Killeen High School. One of my classmates, Stan
Schlueter, went on to be a state representative. He said that he owed Dad a
lot for him getting through Baylor and then…a state representative. Dad’s
reach went a long way…his education.

Parker

I was going to tell you about one more thing he was responsible for. He was
responsible for a lot of good things around town, but one of them was he
was—in Oklahoma, he was in the Kiwanis Club.

Nykolaiszyn

Yes.

Parker

He came here and was in the Kiwanis Club, the civic club, and he was
president. Well, Killeen didn’t have a library, so when he was president,
they rented a storage building downtown, and they gathered books from all
of our homes. That’s how our library started.

Nykolaiszyn

Wow.

Parker

Now we have a gorgeous library building, but he was one of the ones
responsible for starting the library here in Killeen. I thought that was—I
came home from work, and all my favorite books were gone. (Laughter) I
was unhappy. That’s all right. They were in the library. He had a lot of good
things that he accomplished, and a lot of rewards and awards.

Nykolaiszyn

It’s a great family legacy. It really is.

Parker

Yes ma’am, it was. All of our children, of course, remember him, and most
of the grandchildren. He didn’t live to see them all graduate from high
school, but he did some of them. Now we have a great-granddaughter which
he never saw. He loved all his grandkids, and he loved to fish. He’d take
them fishing with him, just he and the boys. They’d go fishing and stay a
week or something. (Laughs) He got a lot out of Oklahoma A&M, and that’s
how I still think of it. I know you’re Oklahoma State now, but it’ll always be
Oklahoma A&M to me. (Laughs)

Nykolaiszyn

And that’s just fine.
20

Parker

Yeah, oh, and he had the cowboy, you know, the A&M cowboy?

Nykolaiszyn

Yes.

Parker

He had a little wooden one. He and another principal were always teasing
each other. He had him on his desk, and he’d come in, and the cowboy
would be hanging by his neck. Norman Hall was the other principal. He’d
come in and hang Gene’s cowboy when he wasn’t looking because he was a
Texas alumni. (Laughter) We still have it. That’s one thing that I—oh, I told
you we’d go to ballgames there, yeah. You know what? The student body
really, really didn’t mingle with the vets for some reason or the other. I don’t
know whether they thought they would catch something or what, but they
would not mingle with us.

Nykolaiszyn

That’s interesting, you didn’t have that interaction with others.

Parker

No, no, not at all. Gene, like I said, he wasn’t the only one that had to work.
We ate squirrel and rabbit after it had a frost, and they fished, just to have
meat on the table. Nina was brought up with tough ol’ squirrel, and that was
our meat because we couldn’t afford to go out and buy meat. Then when he
was at graduate school, he got what we called a glory job. He was off the
sewer crew, and he swept out the labs. He went in one time to sweep out the
lab, and there was Ardoth’s brother working in the lab. He said, “Guess who
was in there.” (Laughs) He didn’t care. He didn’t mind working. He’d do it,
and so that was all that mattered. He’d do anything for the family, and he
did.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, what a great life and a great story. Any other memories you’d like to
share before we round her out today?

Parker

Can you think of anything I’ve ever told you, Nina? Ardoth? They’re
shaking their heads no.

Hassler

He was a wonderful uncle. He treated all his nieces and nephews like his
own.

Nykolaiszyn

Well, it’s just been a pleasure for me to learn more about him and you and
your family, and I appreciate you taking time out of your morning to talk
with me today.

Parker

Well, make sure that he’s the one that’s remembered because he’s the one
that did all the hard work and got through school and everything. He went
August intercession and everything just so he’d get through in good time.
He’s the star, and we thank you so much. He’d be delighted to know that
finally Vet Village is going to be remembered.
21

Nykolaiszyn

Absolutely, absolutely.

Parker

Have you found many other vets? Have you found any vets?

Nykolaiszyn

Well, you know, I’ve talked to some people who’ve lived there, but they
weren’t vets.

Parker

Oh.

Nykolaiszyn

They lived there as students because that’s where they placed the families,
but they were non-vets living in Vet Village.

Parker

Oh, okay.

Nykolaiszyn

We’re just kind of starting to interview our veterans now. We’ve started
with our Korean War vets, and now we’re working through several World
War II vets.

Parker

Yeah, well, Kelly Evans is dead. I know that. There was one named Hugh
Smith and Vauda Hill. I was trying to remember some names. I know
Clementi’s dead. He became a lawyer in Chicago, but he’s dead. That’s
going to be your problem. You’ll be lucky to find wives.

Nykolaiszyn

Right, absolutely.

Parker

I wish you luck, and I’m so glad you’re doing this. We appreciate it.

Nykolaiszyn

We do, too, and thank you, and thanks to Ardoth for getting ahold of us.

Parker

Yes.
