About Jamie Dunn…
Jamie Dunn grew up in Perkins, Oklahoma, and is very proud of her five-generation
Oklahoma State University family, a heritage not many can claim. Her mother also grew up
in Perkins, and began the family tradition when she enrolled at OSU (Oklahoma A&M
College then) in the early 1900s, when it was rare for women to be in college. She became a
teacher, and instilled in her children the importance of education. Jamie followed her
mother’s footsteps and her advice, and enrolled at OSU in 1933.
With little money and a lot of determination, Jamie took a job with a local lawyer to help
with college expenses. Primarily, her time was spent working and taking classes in
secretarial/administrative studies, but she made time to date, see movies, go to sporting
events, and go to dances, even winning a Charleston contest. During college, she met her
husband to be, and after earning her degree, they married and started a family. Two of her
three children also graduated from OSU, and the tradition continues. Jamie cherishes her
time spent at the university, and her great-grandson is the fifth generation to attend OSU.
She and her family still get together on occasion and reminisce about their OSU experiences.

Stillwater, Oklahoma
Gill

My name is Jerry Gill. Today is August 25, 2010. I’m visiting with Jamie
Dunn here in Stillwater, Oklahoma, [and we are joined by her daughter,
Gay Lynn Bullock]. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of
the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Thank you for taking
time to visit with us this afternoon. We appreciate it very much. Ms.
Dunn, your family has a proud Oklahoma A&M and Oklahoma State
University tradition, beginning with your mother, Gaione Albright
Clark. Five generations of your family have attended Oklahoma State
University.

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

I understand that your great-grandson Matthew is in school at OSU
now.

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Isn’t that wonderful? Five generations. Is that a source of pride for you?

Dunn

I’m real happy about that. (Laughs)

Gill

Maybe we can start out and talk about your mother. First of all, where
did she grow up?

Dunn

She grew up in Perkins, Oklahoma.

Gill

A big town south of here?

Dunn

Yes, on a farm. She went to Oklahoma State University and became a

4

teacher.
Bullock

Oklahoma A&M.

Dunn

Oklahoma A&M.

Gill

So, she grew up on a farm. Did she have some brothers and sisters?

Dunn

Yes, she had three brothers and four sisters.

Gill

So, she learned about discipline and hard work.

Dunn

You bet.

Gill

Do you remember what year she was born?

Dunn

Oh, I don’t remember.

Bullock

1893.

Gill

Do you remember a little bit about her? Did she ever tell you stories
about her early life, about her mom and dad? Other than on the farm,
did they work outside of the home and outside of the farm?

Dunn

No.

Gill

And they farmed. They had a quarter section of farm around Perkins?

Dunn

Yes, that’s right.

Bullock

Great-Grandpa Albright was county commissioner for that area.

Dunn

Yes, he was county commissioner.

Gill

This was your mother’s dad that was county commissioner?

Dunn

My grandfather was the county commissioner. And my grandmother had
been a teacher.

Bullock

She’s also half Indian.

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

So, did she attend high school at Perkins High School?

Dunn

No, she taught at a country school. Gosh, I can’t remember…

5

Bullock

You’re talking about Great-Grandma Albright?

Dunn

I’m talking about Grandma Albright.

Gill

Okay, did your mother attend school at Perkins High School?

Dunn

Yes, my mother taught.

Gill

At Perkins.

Dunn

Yes, and she attended Oklahoma State University.

Gill

Do you remember what year your mother enrolled at Oklahoma A&M,
Oklahoma State?

Dunn

Oh, I don’t remember.

Bullock

Around 1911.

Dunn

1911, something like that.

Gill

Do you know the story about how she enrolled at Oklahoma State? At
that time not very many women attended college.

Dunn

That’s right.

Gill

Was there a special story about how she decided to enroll at Oklahoma
State?

Bullock

What’s the story about Mom going to school?

Dunn

About Grandma Gay?

Bullock

She just told Grandpa she wanted to go.

Dunn

Yes. There were seven children in that family. One was a doctor, one
was a farmer, and one was a salesperson.

Gill

So, she had some brothers and sisters that went to college also, then?
You said there was a doctor in the family?

Dunn

Yes, she did. She had two sisters that went to college.

Gill

That was pretty unusual…

6

Dunn

Geneva and Iris.

Gill

So, three of the girls in the family went to college?

Dunn

Three of the girls in the family went to college.

Bullock

What about Massey?

Dunn

Massey didn’t go. She got married.

Bullock

Shame on her for getting married!

Gill

This was unusual for three of the girls, back in that era, to go to college.

Dunn

It was.

Gill

Do you remember what her major was?

Dunn

My mother was a teacher.

Gill

So she majored in Education.

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Do you remember where she lived? Did she live on campus? Did she
live in a sorority or in a residential hall?

Dunn

Gosh, that’s kind of hard to remember.

Bullock

I don’t remember.

Dunn

I believe she lived in a residence.

Gill

Did she ever talk to you about any of her OSU memories or OSU
experiences? About the time she was a student at Oklahoma State? Did
she ever tell you about what she did or some of the activities?

Bullock

I don’t think she did.

Gill

After she graduated, did she come back to class reunions and
Homecoming? Was she proud to be an Oklahoma State graduate? Did
she try to get back on campus whenever she could?

Dunn

No, I don’t think she did. We moved to Kansas, Arkansas City, Kansas.

Gill

Can you share a little bit about after she graduated from Oklahoma

7

State, different places where she lived and where she taught school?
Bullock

Didn’t you all live in Kingfisher? I don’t remember where Grandpa…
She married pretty young because she had your brother pretty young.

Dunn

Yes.

Bullock

So, I remember he worked on the railroad. I remember that.

Gill

She got her teacher’s certificate.

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

She was a teacher, and she taught in different places?

Bullock

She taught in Perkins, and then she went and taught in Arkansas City.

Gill

Did she teach grade school or high school, do you remember?

Bullock

Grade school.

Dunn

In those days, they had the…

Gill

Was it eighth grade?

Dunn

Yes, had the whole thing together. She taught all the grades.

Gill

She taught in some of the country schools.

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Let’s talk about you a little bit. Where did you grow up?

Dunn

Perkins.

Gill

On the family farm there in Perkins?

Dunn

Yes. My father had a truck farm.

Bullock

Tell him how you got to college. How you raised money. You did
something to get some money to go to college, because you all didn’t
have much money because you were farmers.

Dunn

Well, I picked cotton and chopped cotton.

Bullock

And you also shooed the crows off the peanuts.

8

Dunn

Oh, yeah. I shooed the crows off the peanuts.

Bullock

And they never minded her. (Laughter)

Gill

You got paid to do that? That’s good! (Laughter)

Dunn

Caw! Caw!

Gill

Were there any high school activities that you remember? Were you in
sports or in drama or band or music or anything?

Dunn

Drama. I was in plays. And I liked to dance.

Gill

What influenced you to enroll at OSU?

Dunn

Well, my mother had gone, so she wanted me to kind of follow in her
footsteps. She was a teacher.

Gill

What year did you enroll? Do you remember?

Dunn

When did I enroll?

Bullock

1933.

Dunn

You remember those dates, I can’t remember the dates.

Bullock

It’s a date to remember.

Gill

You had school during the Depression at Oklahoma State. That was
pretty hard times and so…

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Other than shooing the crows during school, how did you get money to
attend OSU? Did you work part-time as a student, or work in the
summers?

Dunn

Yes, I worked for a lawyer. Secretarial training and went to school.

Bullock

And wore high heels.

Dunn

And I wore high heels, yes.

Bullock

Walked all the way to campus. (Laughter)

9

Gill

What was your major?

Dunn

Secretarial Training.

Bullock

Business, kind of a business/administrative.

Dunn

Business, yes.

Gill

Ms. Dunn, what do you remember about the OSU campus? Can you tell
me about the buildings you remember, and what the campus looked like
when you were there in the 1930s?

Dunn

Well, there weren’t very many. There certainly weren’t many buildings
there.

Gill

Where did you have most of your classes? In Morrill Hall or Old
Central?

Dunn

Morrill Hall, in the School of Business.

Gill

Most of the business classes were taken there at Morrill Hall at that
time?

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Were you involved in any school activities or organizations?

Dunn

I don’t believe so. I worked and went to school. That kept me pretty
busy.

Gill

Kept you out of trouble, too, didn’t it?

Dunn

Kept me out of trouble. (Laughter)

Gill

Did you live on campus?

Dunn

No.

Gill

You drove back and forth from home, or…?

Dunn

Yes. I walked a lot. I walked to class a lot. They did in those days. They
didn’t have so many cars on the campus like they do now.

Gill

Did you go home [to Perkins] every day?

Dunn

No.

10

Gill

So, you didn’t stay in Stillwater at all?

Bullock

Yes, she was in Stillwater. She had a little apartment.

Gill

So, you lived off campus in Stillwater.

Dunn

Yes, yes, yes.

Gill

Do you remember where that was? You probably don’t, but I thought I’d
just ask in case you did.

Bullock

I believe it was on Duncan.

Dunn

I believe it was on Duck Street, wasn’t it?

Gill

What were some of the favorite student hangouts at that time, where
students would go? Did they go to Swim’s at that time?

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Campus Corner?

Dunn

Campus Corner, Swim’s. Actually, I didn’t hang out a lot.

Gill

You were busy working and going to class, huh?

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Was it Pop McGruder who had the food place about where the Student
Union is today? Do you remember that?

Dunn

I remember Swim’s.

Bullock

When you dated boys, where did they take you?

Dunn

Well, they took me to the theater. That’s about all there was for
entertainment. And we went to dances. They had a dance hall over
Swim’s, and we went to those. I loved to dance.

Gill

What was your favorite kind of dance? Waltz or what?

Dunn

Waltz, and the Charleston.

Gill

Oh, you knew the Charleston? Oh my gosh! (Laughs)

11

Bullock

She won a prize for Charleston dancing, a contest. (Laughter)

Gill

Could you still do the Charleston today?

Dunn

Yes!

Gill

We won’t ask for a demonstration, all right?

Dunn

I love to dance!

Bullock

Everybody got that from her. We all love to dance.

Gill

Ms. Dunn, what were some of the favorite social activities that students
did? You said dances…

Dunn

Dances.

Gill

Did they ever get on the train and go out to [Yost Lake], north of
Stillwater?

Dunn

Yes.

Gill

Did you ever go to Horsethief Canyon?

Dunn

I remember that.

Gill

It was by your hometown there, by Perkins.

Dunn

I sure do remember that. I remember that, yes.

Gill

Were there any student traditions then? Like you said, the freshman
beanies you’d have to wear? Did you have to wear a freshman beanie?

Dunn

I don’t believe I did, messed up my hair. (Laughter)

Gill

Maybe it was just the guys that did it then. Did you ever hang out
around Theta Pond? Was that a place?

Dunn

Oh, yes. That was a nice place to be.

Gill

Did they still have the tug of wars? They used to have the tug of war
across Theta Pond, where they put the rope and a team on each side will
pull on it.

Dunn

I don’t think I did that. Oh, I did too. It seemed like I did.

12

Gill

Ms. Dunn, what was it like in the thirties? I guess most students didn’t
have money. Like you said, there weren’t cars.

Dunn

No.

Gill

Was it pretty tough to get by, at that time?

Dunn

It was pretty tough, yes. I didn’t have a lot of money, but I was
determined to go. I worked part time for a lawyer.

Gill

How much did he pay you?

Dunn

Oh, gosh. Well, I could pay my rent with it. I don’t remember how much
he paid me. I don’t remember, but it wasn’t a whole lot.

Bullock

It’s all relative.

Dunn

Yes, it wasn’t a whole lot.

Gill

As you look back on it, are there some favorite memories, some special
times you remember while you were at Oklahoma State?

Bullock

Dancing was one of them.

Gill

Dancing was one of your favorite memories?

Dunn

Well, that’s one of my favorite memories. But I remember one time, I
took speech, and I remember the teacher called on me to give a speech. I
gave one out of the top of my head, and she said, “That was very, very
good.” I remember that. (Laughs)

Bullock

Right, impromptu is hard. (Laughter)

Gill

Did you go to any sports events? Football, wrestling, or basketball?

Dunn

I went to some of those, but let’s see…

Bullock

Did you watch Henry Iba? Hank Iba?

Dunn

Yes.

Bullock

You knew him.

Gill

Did you enjoy wrestling? Did you watch Coach Gallagher and his
team?

Dunn

13

I watched it, I watched it. But I’m not saying I particularly enjoyed it.
Bullock
Not wrestling.
Gill
What year did you graduate from Oklahoma State?
Bullock
She had an associate’s degree, so I don’t know.
Gill
She went to school at OSU two or three years then?

Gill
Did you meet your husband at OSU, or in Stillwater?
Dunn
I did.
Gill
Was he a student at OSU?
Dunn
Yes, he was a graduate.
Bullock
He was a student. Was he a student when you met him? Or he went back
later?
Dunn
Oh, yes, he did. He went back later.
Gill
What was your husband’s name?
Dunn
He was an accountant and his name was Warren Dunn.
Gill
Warren Dunn?
Bullock
They called him Dunny at the golf course.
Dunn
Called him Dunny.
Bullock
He was a big golfer.
Dunn
He was an awfully good golfer. He had his picture in the big book, the
big annual books.
Gill
The Redskin yearbook?
Dunn
Yes, yearbooks. He was an awfully good golfer.
Gill
You were telling me earlier he golfed with some OSU people?
Dunn

14

I don’t believe so.
Bullock
Labron Harris, all those other guys, huge guys.
Dunn
Oh, yes. Labron Harris.
Gill
Was he on the OSU golf team?
Bullock
Yes.
Gill
So he even golfed with Labron Harris?
Dunn
Yes.
Gill
That’s a pretty famous person in OSU history.
Dunn
Yes, that’s right.
Gill
Our first golf coach.
Dunn
Yes, sure was. He was an awfully good golfer. He had trophies.
Bullock
There were a lot of people he played with that I can’t recall.
Gill
Well, can you tell me a little bit about your career and your life? What
did you do after you left OSU? You said you got married, and then…?
Dunn
I got married and had my family. I had three children, two boys and her.
I was pretty active in music clubs, and I gave book reviews. Gave a lot
of book reviews around the state.
Gill
Where are some of the places you lived in Oklahoma?
Dunn
Well, let’s see now. Stillwater and Perkins, and there were other places,
but I can’t seem to remember.
Gill
Your husband was an accountant?
Dunn
Yes.
Gill
Did he work for a company, or was he an independent practicing
accountant?
Dunn
He worked for the government.
Bullock
We lived in Texas for four years.

15

Dunn
Yes, he had a very good job.
Gill
In addition to your daughter, who went to Oklahoma State, did either of
your two boys attend OSU?
Bullock
My older brother, Warren James Dunn.
Dunn
Yes, my older son went. But now, Bill only went a couple of years.
Bullock
Bill is a person in his own way. (Laughs)
Dunn
Bill is my younger boy.
Bullock
He’s an artist.
Dunn
William Clark Dunn.
Bullock
He did not go to OSU.
Gill
But he attended school here a couple years? Just didn’t graduate?
Dunn
He did. He did.
Gill
Ms. Dunn, how has attending Oklahoma State University influenced
your life? Was that an important time in your life?
Dunn
Yes, I liked school. I liked college. I liked English and…
Bullock
The atmosphere.
Dunn
That was my main… I liked history. And I made pretty good grades.
Gill
Do you remember any professors that influenced you, that were
important to you in your student development?
Dunn
There was a teacher or two, but I can’t seem to remember their names.
Boy, there’s a lot I can’t remember.
Bullock
They were old, or I don’t know who they’d be. Your English teacher…
Dunn
I liked history and English. Those were my main subjects.
Gill
How special is it for you that in your family, five generations of your
family have attended Oklahoma State University? Is that a source of
pride for you?

16

Dunn
Oh, heavens. I think it’s great. I tell everybody. (Laughter)
Bullock
Brags to people.
Dunn
Yes, I’m real proud of that.
Gill
In years passed, and maybe even currently, does the family ever get
together occasionally? If they do, do they talk about some of their OSU
experiences through the years?
Dunn
Well, yes. Sure.
Gill
Are there some favorite stories that they tell that you can share with us?
Dunn
I can’t seem to remember.
Gill
Going back to your mother again, Ms. Dunn, did she ever talk about
OSU to you? Was she proud to be an OSU graduate? Was she proud of
the fact that she’d gone to school and got a college degree?
Dunn
Oh, yes. She was a wonderful teacher.
Bullock
Education was very important to our family.
Dunn
Education really was important to her, and she used to take those little
kids—sometimes they’d come to school with dirty faces—she’d put
them on her desk and clean them up.
Gill
That’s great. (Laughs)
Dunn
Of course, she was very popular with their parents.
Gill
How do you feel about Oklahoma State University? The time you went
to school in 1933, was Dr. Henry G. Bennett president of Oklahoma
State University while you were there?
Bullock
Yes, Dr. Bennett.
Dunn
Oh, yes. Yes. A good one.
Gill
It was small, just a few hundred, maybe a couple thousand students or
so. Now we’ve got twenty-some odd thousand students.
Dunn
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Gill

17

Are you proud about how OSU has grown over the years?
Dunn
Oh, yes. I’m very proud of that. I remember Dr. Bennett. He was a good
one. He was a good man.
Gill
Did you ever get a chance to meet him? I understand that he met a lot of
the students personally. Did you get a chance to meet him?
Dunn
Yes, I did, Yes. I knew a couple of his sons.
Bullock
And his granddaughter. His daughter married Joe Preston. Her name was
Liberty or something, his daughter.
Dunn
Yes, oh yes. He was a very friendly man, good with people.
Gill
Did you ever meet his wife Vera? She taught Sunday school class at the
Baptist Church here in town.
Dunn
Yes, she did.
Gill
Did you ever go to one of her Sunday school classes?
Dunn
I don’t think I did. I’m a Methodist.
Gill
No wonder you didn’t go to the Baptist church then! (Laughter)
Bullock
I knew the granddaughter, Vera Alma.
Dunn
Yes.
Bullock
She went to school with me.
Dunn
They were good Baptists.
Bullock
Right, she’s a good Baptist.
Gill
Looking back over the years, Ms. Dunn, what do you remember most
about your time at Oklahoma State University? That was a young time,
an informative time in your life. What did it mean to you? What do you
remember about it?
Dunn
Well, of course, I met my husband. That was a very important time. I
enjoyed people, and that was the main thing.
Gill
Did you go back to sporting events in years later?
Dunn

18

No, I didn’t. I didn’t go back.
Bullock
You and dad didn’t. Dad would go once in a while, but you didn’t go
back.
Dunn
I didn’t go back.
Gill
A lot of people come back, and the family gets together for sporting
events, go to Homecoming parades and stuff like that.
Dunn
Things like that.
Bullock
Yes, I came back.
Gill
Kind of stay connected to OSU.
Dunn
Yes.
Gill
Were you a member of the Alumni Association? I’ve got to ask that
because I used to work with the Alumni Association. (Laughter)
Bullock
I think Dad was. I don’t know, but he took care of all the money stuff.
Dunn
Yes, he did.
Bullock
He was the accountant. So, I’m sure he was.
Gill
What would you like to talk about that we didn’t cover? Are there some
things about OSU that you remember that you’d like to share? Is there
anything you’d like to bring up that we didn’t talk about?
Dunn
I lived in an apartment.
Gill
So after you got your independence established, you were able to live in
an apartment by yourself then?
Dunn
Yes, yes. After my parents told me to behave myself. (Laughter)
Gill
Did you encourage your kids and your grandkids to go to school at
Oklahoma State?
Dunn
Oh, boy, did I? I sure did! I thought, you can’t get a really good job
without an education. You just have to have it anymore.
Gill
So one of the things that you mentioned that was real valuable to your
family, your parents, to your brothers and sisters, and then to your kids,

19

was education. It was the real key…
Dunn
Yes. It’s very important.
Gill
Ms. Dunn, I really appreciate it. It’s great to get a chance to visit with
you and listen to your stories about Oklahoma State. It’s just a privilege
for me to get a chance to visit with someone that’s part of a five
generation OSU family.
Dunn
Yes. (Laughs)
Gill
Thank you very much.
Dunn
You’re welcome.
