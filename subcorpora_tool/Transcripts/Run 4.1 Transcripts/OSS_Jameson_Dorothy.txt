About Dorothy Jameson…
Dorothy Strong-Jameson was born in the Oklahoma panhandle and grew up just outside of
Boise City. She attended school there and later attended Oklahoma Panhandle State
University for two years, studying home economics. She then transferred to Oklahoma State
University (then Oklahoma A&M College) where she pledged with Chi Omega and was
named Outstanding Senior Girl in 1944 by the girls’ athletics department.
After OSU, she accepted a job with the Extension Service which took her to New Mexico
for a few years. From there she relocated to Davis, Oklahoma, where she taught vocational
home economics for the next twenty years. After a short break, she returned to teach fifthgrade science for ten years before retiring. Over the years along with her teaching career,
Dorothy has been very active in her community and her church. She was recognized as
Woman of the Year by the Soil Conservation Board, and as Outstanding Teacher of the Year
for Murray County. In her interview, Dorothy recalls small-town life, the Dust Bowl, and
the influential people in her life.

Dorothy Jameson
Oral History Interview
Interviewed by Mary Larson
June 18, 2011
Stillwater, Oklahoma
Larson

Okay, today is June 18, 2011. My name is Mary Larson, and I’m here
with Dorothy Strong-Jameson here in Stillwater where she’s visiting. I
was wondering if you could take just a moment at the beginning and tell
us a little bit about when and where you were born.

Jameson

When I was born?

Larson

Yes, when you were born and where.

Jameson

Okay, as my mother refreshes my mind, I was born in the oldest house in
the panhandle of Oklahoma. It was an old rock house. Of course,
everything was rock out there, the corrals and fences and everything
because there weren’t any trees other than cottonwood, and they didn’t
last very long. This was the old Z. H. Cattle Ranch, and it was a long
three-room, one room right after another. Of course, there was no
running water, no electricity, and women’s work was really hard. I just
look back on the days and the things that my mother did then, and I
don’t know whether the people today could stand up under it or not.
Anyway, we were a pretty rugged bunch. I lived there until I was three,
and then my two brothers were ready to go to school. Mother had taught
the oldest one at home, homeschooled him the first year. Then we
moved to Boise City, and lived there until I was five. Then we moved
out on the ranch, built a house, and moved out there. I know I’m not
doing a very good job.

Larson

Oh, no, no. It’s wonderful.

Jameson

So then when it was time for school to start, my dad said, “Do we even
have a teacher at the schoolhouse?” Nobody had hired a teacher. Nobody

4

had done anything. There was a young man from Boise City whose dad
was a county agent, had just graduated from college, and was getting
ready to go to law school. My dad talked him into teaching that year so
that we could have a schoolteacher and so he could stay at our house,
which he did. He got ready to go to school, first day or something soon,
and he asked my mother, he said, “Isn’t Dorothy going to go?” She said,
“No. She isn’t old enough.” “Oh, she is old enough,” he said. “Send
her.”
So I went to school at five, and I was really surprised at the number of
students that were there. When we got there I felt like, well, we were late
because there must have been fifteen or sixteen students. It was grades
one through eight. School went along real fine. About myself, I was the
only left-handed one in my family, and everybody teased me about it. I
ended up wondering what I should do because I didn’t like to be teased.
No child likes to be teased. I remembered the directions. I knew my
directions, north, south, east and west. I noticed that everybody picked
their pencil up in their south hand, (the desk faced the east) so I broke
myself to write right-handed. (Laughs)
Larson

You mentioned that you had brothers. Did you just have brothers, or did
you have any sisters?

Jameson

No, two brothers.

Larson

Were they both older?

Jameson

Yes, but they were very close together. One time, we were one, two, and
three. (Laughter)

Larson

So all just right in a stair step?

Jameson

Right.

Larson

Before we go on with school too much further, could we talk a little bit
about the history of the ranch? You mentioned a few things to me earlier
that I think we’d like to…

Jameson

Well, I wish I really knew more about it and had thought about it more. I
could’ve done a little research. The way I understand it was with it being
No Man’s Land, they opened it up for settlement, and it was being
divided up into homesteads, 160 acres. The cattlemen were running the
whole area, large section after section. They couldn’t make any money if
they were going to have to do something like that and put up a bunch of
fencing, so they put it up for sale for homesteading. My grandfather,
who came from Ocate, New Mexico, had sheep and had lots of

5

Mexicans, so he brought sheep and Mexicans and cattle to the ranch, and
they did everyone’s homesteading.
I have often thought every pile of rocks that was a corral or a fence, that
was the Matoya place. And then there was another one that was another
Mexican place. They were all named after the Mexicans that
homesteaded at that area. It was strictly used for grazing. I really don’t
know, as small child, too much about an irrigation project my dad and
his two brothers started on the Cimarron River. It didn’t pan out to be a
great irrigation project to raise the feed that they needed. But there was
an interesting thing to me that I had two of my uncles—my dad had two
brothers. Both of them went to college, but Dad didn’t. One of them
decided that he was going to make soap weed silage.
Most of you know what a soap weed is. It’s bare grass. They have
different names for it, yucca and so forth. During the Dust Bowl there
wasn’t anything for the cattle to eat but soap weeds, anything green. Dad
had a machine that my uncle had bought to chop up and make silage out
of, and it cut those spines about an inch and a half or two inches long. So
he fed those and cake the year around. He had some Mexicans that
would go out, and you can cut one of those yucca plants right out under
the ground real easy with a shovel. You just get under the ground, and it
cuts easy. He’d pile up big piles, and then they’d just pull the soap weed
grinder around, and it ran off a pulley belt on a tractor, and it would cut
it up.
Well, this became very popular with all the ranchers up and down the
river during the Dust Bowl, because they didn’t have anything to feed
their cows, either. So they would cut up the soap weeds and have them
piled up, and they’d pull this machine up one side of the river and down
the other. A lot of fellows got to use it, which was a blessing for
everybody. As time went on, the government came in in ’35 with the
Soil Conservation Service and was able to talk people into putting some
of this grassland into banks and not farm it, not till it, not do anything.
That’s what happened back in ’29 when they were having the
Depression on the East Coast. They were selling wheat at a high market
out here and raising lots of it. Then it got dry, and it was just blowing
away. There was no vegetation to hold it, so they planted trees, and they
planted vegetation, and did everything. Then back in the early ’40s, rains
came. The ground was fertile. The soil was fertile if we just get water on
it, so then with the rains coming and everything, they were able to get
back into the raising of grain and pasture and so forth.
Larson

Did they ever patent that machine that ground up the soap weed for
silage?

6

Jameson

No. It was interesting. I live down at Sulphur now, and Bill Chitwood,
who is a big dairy man, moved down there from Lake Arcadia. The
government came in and bought their dairy, and that’s where Lake
Arcadia is now. He wanted to go out and see the black mesa where I
grew up, and we went out there last fall. I was showing him that, and he
said, “Well, that’s just about the same thing that we have. We call it a
silage grinder.” So somebody else had already patented it or something,
but, that’s how it got started around our place.

Larson

Do you know when your family first purchased the ranch, which
generation in your family?

Jameson

It was my grandfather, and it would’ve been in, I would say, 1893, but I
may be mistaken. I don’t think I am, but...

Larson

How big was the ranch when you were growing up?

Jameson

Well, out there, you have a lot of state land. I cannot explain to you what
certain section was set aside for state land. You have to lease that from
the state. What my dad had with deeded land and state land was about
twenty-two thousand acres, but, see, it takes about forty acres or fortyfive acres for each cow and calf unit in a place like that. Would you like
to hear some about the Dust Bowl?

Larson

Oh, certainly.

Jameson

Oh, my. That was something else. The wind blew continuously for, I
don’t know, just day after day after day, and most of the time it blew out
of the southwest. It blew gravel. It’d sting your legs, and most of the
time, girls then didn’t wear jeans. We wore dresses. It would just sting
our legs and so forth. A car driving between Guymon and Boise City
with one of those hard winds, the sand, it just looked like it’d been
sandblasted. The paint would’ve just been removed. It was really, really
dusty, and a lot of people said they got dust pneumonia. I don’t know
whether they really had dust pneumonia or not. I just can’t say, because I
wasn’t a doctor and none of our family was bothered with it.
I do know that you could not keep the dust out of the house. With the
weather the way it was, a lot of people would put up wet curtains, sheets
and stuff over windows and doors to keep the dust out. That was okay.
My two brothers and I went to high school at Boise City, and we lived in
a little two-room house, and we had those green roller shades. You’d
pull them down, and then we put a chairback against them to keep it
from blowing out. Then about once a week we’d come along with our
fire shovel and fire bucket, ash bucket, and dig out all of that. Oh, it
would be the most fertile dust you could find. It was just silt. That’s the

7

way we cleaned house.
Larson

So that worked pretty well, though, to keep it out of the rest of the house.

Jameson

Right, right, yes. A lot of people used wide paper sticky tape that came
down and just taped the windows and doors and everything that weren’t
going to be opened, closed. That kept out a lot of it, but there was no
way of keeping out a lot of it. It just was going to get in.

Larson

Well, and in the summer, too, especially when it’s so hot, you want a
little bit of a breeze if you can get it. How did you deal with that, trying
to keep the dust out but the air in?

Jameson

Well, most of us learned not to be too good a housekeeper because it
was really hard to keep the dust out. Then as we grew older and the rains
started coming, things got better. People kind of forgot about the Dust
Bowl until all of a sudden it’s coming back. You’re seeing more things
about the Dust Bowl. I think there is even a jazz band of some kind that
calls themselves the Dust Bowl now, down in southern Oklahoma.
The thing about it was that it made me appreciate life. I tell you, I cannot
throw anything away. My children can tell you that if they can’t find
anything, they can go up in my attic and find it. You just don’t throw
things away when you need them and you don’t have money to buy
them. Nobody did. I laughed—I went to a high school reunion one year,
several years after we graduated from even college, and this friend of
mine named Nellie Wells said—we were driving around reminiscing
about high school days. She said, “Dorothy, you were poor, but we were
poor, poor, poor.” I said, “Well, I know that, Nellie. That’s the reason
we always went after basketball practice over to my house and ate toast
and drank milk because I knew you didn’t have it at home.”
Her dad had died. He was a farmer southeast of Boise City in the Griggs
community and had died with, I don’t know whether it was pneumonia
or what, but left a lady with six small children. She moved to town and
worked as a waitress. Well, you know she wasn’t getting too good of
wages in Boise City during the Dust Bowl, but her kids all graduated.
They did well, and several years later, one of them was written up as one
of the largest wheat farmers in the panhandle of Texas. See, if you just
stick with it—it’s kind of the story of Job in the Bible.

Larson

What’s your earliest memory of the Dust Bowl, I mean, your youngest
memory? Are there any specific things you remember from really early
on?

Jameson

Well, they put through a railroad, Santa Fe Railroad, from Boise City to

8

Lamar. It joined up with the other at Lamar. They had an excursion train,
the first train that ran, and we all went on it. It was the worst day you
could have had as far as dust. You couldn’t even see out the windows.
You couldn’t see things, but yet it was packed with people. People had
to ride that train.
One of the scariest things was probably when I was, oh, probably twelve
—I don’t know, maybe not that old. I was visiting my grandmother, and
she lived in a ranch house. It was in a little valley, and you weren’t
aware of clouds coming in. Well, this was Palm Sunday, and it had been
a beautiful day. People had picnics and what all, and all of a sudden, it
just turned dark. Of course, she didn’t have electricity, and she had to
hunt for the matches and the lamp to light it. Then when she finally got it
lit, you could just see that tiny, tiny flame. Well, that was the first black
duster they had. You can read books of telling about the birds going
ahead of the storm.
Well, a year or two later, then, on April 1, my brother and I had
borrowed the pickup from Dad to have a school picnic. We started
home. We saw this big cloud. Now, the black dusters came from the
north, northeast. Most of the dust storms came from the southwest. But
we started home, and we ran into that cloud. Well, it just hits you, and
within seconds it was total darkness. It was like you would go into a
closet and shut the door, and not a bit of light would get in. That was
how dark it was, not for a very long time, but that’s the way it was.
We were sitting there in the pickup. He had to stop, and we were sitting
there in the pickup together, talking, but couldn’t see each other. Then
pretty soon as the dust kind of lifted, kind of like a fog lifting, then we
tried to start the car. It had built up static electricity, so then we had to
find a wire to get rid of that. Then we lost the wire, and finally
somebody came by and took us back to Boise City, and we stayed until
the next day. (Laughs) It was things like that that really—and it bothered
the animals, too. The birds, when a storm like that would come up, they
would just go wild. They’d just fly like... Everybody had it a little bit
different, but I think those two black dust storms were the most scary
things when it’s total darkness.
Larson

How did the cattle and sheep do through those? Did they get away?

Jameson

They didn’t do well. Most of the ranchers had hospital herds where they
had to tail up the animal to get them to get up to eat the next morning.
The government did help them a little bit. They paid a dollar an animal,
and they took the animal, usually, out behind a hill somewhere that had a
big hole and just did away with them. They were too poor and skinny to
eat. They survived just barely. We were kind of fortunate. On our ranch

9

there were spring-fed creeks, and they never did go dry. They got low,
and they quit running, but there was water in those creek holes. We had
a little spring. Our house, we had two windmills, and the wind blew
enough that there was water there, and it pumped. Those things had
these two big redwood tanks that hold about twenty-two thousand
gallons. We’d water the garden and the orchard, and then you have your
chickens and stuff. We didn’t feel the drought and the Depression like a
lot of people did. That’s the Grapes of Wrath people that really loaded
up and lost everything when they went to California.
Larson

I guess that brings back—how many people from your neighborhood or
the surrounding ranches, or even Boise City, how many people did you
know who left?

Jameson

Well, I thought maybe that example of just six kids in a school in ’35
would show you there was only three families that had children, up and
down the river, that should be going to school at the Garrett school.
There were a lot of them left. As a child you don’t pay too much
attention to what’s going on around you like you should, but I knew a lot
of people did go. And then a lot them when they got out there couldn’t
find work, and it really made it kind of worse.

Larson

But none of your good friends or relatives left?

Jameson

No.

Larson

Just speaking of the Garrett school since we haven’t talked about that
too much on the recording, you’d mentioned that when you were going
to elementary school, I mean, it was a one-room school house that used
to be the post office, I understand?

Jameson

Yes, and a lady by the name of Martha Garrett was the first post
mistress. It was a post office for about twenty-one years, but then it was
closed. I don’t know how long it was closed before it was opened up as a
school, but it was always called the Garrett. That was known as the
Garrett Community because there is a Garrett cemetery out on the ranch
where all of my relatives, and everybody like that that’s up and down the
river, have been buried there. Now several people are asked to be buried
there that come in off of the flats out around Boise City.

Larson

Okay. You said it started out, when you first went to the school when you
were younger, when you were starting school, that there were a number
of people there. How many years do you think it took for that population
to dwindle down?

Jameson

Well, several of them had several children. Now, I remember there was

10

one family, the Gillases. They were old-timers there, and his children
lived there. One daughter married a man by the name of Quackenbush,
and they had several children. Esther Quackenbush was my good friend.
She was one I had in my class. I don’t know when they moved away,
because it got to be I was the only one in my class. Right now, I am the
only living alumni of the Garrett school. Everybody else that ever went
through Garrett school has died, including my brothers and everybody
else.
Larson

Did it close after you and your brothers left for high school? Do you
know?

Jameson

Soon thereafter. Soon thereafter, yes.

Larson

Because if you were the youngest of that group about the time they got
through…

Jameson

Yes, because it wasn’t long then until they started running school buses
out into the rural area. See, the school buses didn’t run then.

Larson

When you were going to high school, the school buses weren’t running
out to the ranch?

Jameson

No.

Larson

And you said you and your brothers moved into town.

Jameson

Yes, right. That was an experience. It was good for us to learn to take
care of ourselves and fix food and so forth. I don’t regret it a minute.

Larson

Did that work out pretty well for the most part, do you think?

Jameson

Oh, yes. I don’t know how we would’ve gotten an education at that stage
of the game if it hadn’t have been that way. The first year, my oldest
brother worked for a family that had a grocery store. He would stock
groceries after school and just lived in their house for room and board.
They didn’t have any children. Then the next year, my dad got this little
two-room house. It was just a block from school. Of course, there was
no school cafeteria or anything, and they went to school. Then the next
year, we just put a double bed in and put a single bed in the bedroom,
and we just got along fine. We never fussed until we went home.
(Laughter)

Larson

Well, you were all in it together. (Laughter)

Jameson

Yes, right. Mother said, “I don’t understand how you can get along so

11

well at town, and come home and fuss.”
Larson

Well, when you were in high school, what were your favorite subjects?

Jameson

Oh, my favorite subject was basketball. (Laughter) Lord, I lived and ate
basketball. I loved it. Athletics have been my cup of tea all my life. If I’d
have been a boy, I’d have been a football player. We had a good
basketball team. The year I was a senior, we went to State. We didn’t
win, but we got close to winning. We got in the semifinals, and I made
All State then. That was when all the towns in the state—the big schools
didn’t have basketball, but the little schools, all the smaller schools had
basketball. They were all in one class. Now you have A, B, 2A, 3A, 4A,
6A. Then, it was just all one thing, but it was fun.

Larson

Were there other sports available for girls at the time?

Jameson

No—oh, softball.

Larson

Softball.

Jameson

We played softball, but we just played different people at the schools
around. There were several. There was Plainview, and there was Keyes,
and there was Felt. They were in Cimarron County, and we just had
county tournaments for that.

Larson

Were there any teachers who had a big influence on you in high school?

Jameson

Well, probably my basketball coach. He was just a dear person. He
wasn’t married at the time, and, of course, a bunch of girls loved to
embarrass him. You know how that was. (Laughter) Then when I went
to Panhandle to school, he and the music teacher at Boise City decided
to get married. They came and asked me to be in their wedding, so I
thought that was nice.

Larson

Oh, that’s wonderful.

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

You mentioned after high school you went to Panhandle State.

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

You did that for two years?

Jameson

Right.

12

Larson

What were you majoring in there before you transferred?

Jameson

Well, when I went to Panhandle State I talked to the president and asked
him if he—we were talking about it, and I wanted to be a physical
education major. He said, “Dorothy, you just”—Ed Morrison was the
president. He said, “You just won’t be able to get a job, other than going
into a big city because the smaller schools use men as social studies
teachers, and they use them as coaches.” So, I’d always been interested
in home economics because of an aunt, and so I just went that way.

Larson

Yes, because I was wondering what influenced you in that direction.

Jameson

It was interesting, the home ec teacher that I had at Panhandle was head
of the department at Panhandle. She basically taught foods, and she had
a senior student who taught clothing out there because she didn’t like to
teach the clothing. But in a smaller school, you did the best you could.
Her name was Mary Leidigh. I want to mention that here because she
came to OSU and was head of the foods department. I have been told
that at the medical center here, the little sandwich bar, they still use—she
did a lot of volunteer work at this hospital—that they still use her recipe
for chicken salad and pimento cheese for the sandwiches there in that
little medical center. So, I think that is kind of nice to know.

Larson

After two years you said you transferred to what would’ve been
Oklahoma A&M at that time.

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

Was it hard to get that far away from home at that point?

Jameson

It didn’t bother me. We went home at Christmas. I guess we went home
at Thanksgiving. I don’t remember because everybody didn’t have a car
like they do now.

Larson

Did you get to play basketball at Panhandle State? I forgot to ask about
that.

Jameson

I played with the boys. (Laughs)

Larson

Well, good for you.

Jameson

They didn’t want a bunch of girls, but we’d go down Sunday afternoon
or Saturday afternoon to the gym and play, and it was fun.

Larson

So, you kept in fighting shape for it after. (Laughs)

13

Jameson

Right, right.

Larson

Once you got to Stillwater, though, were you able to play basketball
again?

Jameson

Yes. I played intermural. I could tell you kind of a story, but you might
think I was bragging.

Larson

No, please do tell. It’s not bragging if we ask.

Jameson

Okay. (Laughter) I was a home economics major, but I did well. We had
intermurals and did well and everything, especially basketball. I had
very few on my team that could even dribble the ball, but that didn’t
matter. If they could get me the ball, I could usually make it, that type of
thing. But that’s bragging. Anyway, my senior year, Mrs. [Valerie]
Colvin and a bunch of the athletic teachers, girls’ athletic teachers,
picked an outstanding senior girl and put their name on a plaque. My
senior year my name was on the plaque, in 1944.
So, one time when I was up visiting my children when they were in
school, after they built the Colvin Center, I called her and was visiting
with her she said, “Dorothy, I want to show you the Center.” I said,
“Well, I am going to meet the kids over there.” I said, “They’ll show
me.” She said, “No, I have keys that unlock doors that they can’t get
behind.” (Laughs) So, we went over there, and we had a nice time, visit.
They have remodeled it so many times now that I wouldn’t even
recognize it.

Larson

Well, we’ll have to go see your plaque and take a picture that will go
with the oral history.

Jameson

Yes, I don’t know whether you could ever find it or not because she said
they had a lot of trouble deciding what to bring for a certain era, and that
was what they chose for that period. The last time I was there I didn’t
see it, but that doesn’t mean it’s not there. My eyes are not what they
used to be.

Larson

When you were at Oklahoma A&M, did you have any particular
teachers that made a big impression? You mentioned Mary Leidigh at
Panhandle, who ended up at OSU.

Jameson

Yes, right. Well, I guess Dean [Julia] Stout made a big impression on
me, and Bernadine Brock was her secretary at the time. I don’t know
whether you’d ever heard of her or not.

Larson

I’ve heard her name.

14

Jameson

Some of those people, they kept you on the right track and when you
stayed busy. When I got an invitation to be on, (I can’t even think, now)
well, one of the top ten of the class. I can’t think of the name of the
organization. Boys are in it now. It was just girls, then. I got an
invitation to be in it, and I didn’t even know what they were talking
about. (Laughs) I joined, and I enjoyed it.

Larson

I understand you were a member of a sorority?

Jameson

I was a member of the Chi Omega sorority, and I thoroughly enjoyed
that immensely.

Larson

Did you live in the sorority house?

Jameson

Yes. By the time I got ready to come to college, things had looked up on
the ranch. I asked my dad. I didn’t know a thing about sorority life
except what I read in magazines and books. One of the teachers I had at
the English Department out there had been a Chi Omega from OSU,
A&M, and she asked me if I was going through Rush. So she explained
it to me, kind of. Dad said he didn’t care, so I did, and I thoroughly,
thoroughly enjoyed it. It gave me a nice home away from home. I won’t
say I made better friends there than I made otherwise, but one of the
ladies you may know, Kathryn McCollom, was a Chi Omega with me.
And then another friend I still have here is Bonnie Smith, whom she was
an independent. She didn’t go for sororities, but we all played ball
together. We had a softball team that played the Waves during World
War II. The Waves came in and were stationed there.

Larson

In fact, we interviewed someone who was with the Waves not all that
long ago. She talked about some of that. Now, when you were there
taking home ec, did they have, I think it was called the Adams House?

Jameson

The home management house?

Larson

Right, it was the home management house.

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

I was thinking it had another name.

Jameson

Yes, I think it did. There were two houses, two home management
houses, and I think each one of them had a separate name. Yes, they did.

Larson

What did that entail when you were there?

15

Jameson

Well, there were eight girls that lived in a house at the same time. You
were a cook for a week, you were laundry for a week, you were a
housekeeper for a week, you took care of the baby for a week. There
were eight jobs that you did that week, and then it would switch, and you
would do something else. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Miss [Eva Elizabeth]
Lisk was my home management teacher, and I loved her. She was
encouraging all the time.

Larson

It sounds like you probably would’ve had too busy a schedule at this
point to do anything else, but were you involved in anything else while
you were in college?

Jameson

Just organizations like the Home Economics Club and different things
like that. Off the top of my head, now I can’t remember everything I was
in. I’ll have to get the Redskin out and look.

Larson

Now, you graduated in 1944?

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

What did you do after graduation?

Jameson

Well, I got my first job in Tucumcari, New Mexico, in the Extension
Service.

Larson

Okay. What were you doing with the Extension Service?

Jameson

Well, are you familiar with the Extension Service?

Larson

Yes.

Jameson

Okay.

Larson

I’m a farm kid.

Jameson

Okay, well, good. I did 4-H work, and I did the women’s clubs and
everything. There was a man that had lost his wife fairly recently, and
we had a lot of teenagers there in Tucumcari. They rode horses and so
forth. He was a square dance caller so he wanted to teach them square
dancing. So we did square dancing, and then they put it on their horses
and took it to the state fair. That was a big thing, to go. I carried the
American flag.

Larson

That would be no small trick.

Jameson

No. They practiced and practiced, and they did a good job. It was nice.

16

Larson

You worked for the Extension Service for a while?

Jameson

Yes, and then I got married. Roger went overseas, and then I went home
to just help my mother. She’d had surgery. Then when he got back, we
moved to Davis.

Larson

How did you meet? Did you meet in college?

Jameson

Yes. He never did think education was very important, but his mother
kept pushing him. He had some good friends from Tulsa (he was a Tulsa
boy) that were there. He would come to the Chi Omega house and visit
them.

Larson

Okay, so that’s how you were introduced.

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

So, did you get married before he went overseas?

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

What year was that?

Jameson

Well, it would’ve been ’45.

Larson

What did you do when he got back?

Jameson

Well, we packed up and came down to Davis and started building what
we have now.

Larson

Okay. How did you choose that area down around Davis and Sulphur?

Jameson

Well, his folks—his dad was an attorney. Before I came, he had gone
into partnerships with another attorney in Sulphur and John Powell, who
then later went on and was appointed by [Governor Roy] Turner to the
Criminal Court of Appeals here in Oklahoma. So that’s how we got
started.

Larson

Can you tell us a little bit about that ranch, as well?

Jameson

Yes, it has been kind of interesting. In the beginning I had a few head of
cattle, about twenty head of heifers, that we moved down there and kind
of started a little herd. We were going along pretty good. Roger had
stayed in the Army Reserve, Officers Reserve, and so, of course, he was
called back. Well, he thought I ought to take those two children, small

17

children, and follow him around an army camp. I didn’t think so, so I
just stayed there and kept things going, which was a blessing that I did, I
feel, because once you destroy something that you start, then you may
never get it started again. It’s worked out just beautifully not only for us,
but for my family. John and his wife live out there now and raise cattle
and horses. All the grandchildren enjoy it.
Larson

How many acres on the ranch?

Jameson

I believe there are about fifteen hundred now.

Larson

How many head of cattle were you running back in the day?

Jameson

Oh, when he was gone?

Larson

Yes.

Jameson

When he was gone, just running about fifty, but now we don’t have too
much land. It’s dry down there right now, but he has about 150 now.

Larson

Okay. Your kids would’ve been pretty small at the time?

Jameson

Oh, yes. John was about four, and Judy was about two. Yes, very small.

Larson

Did you hire on help, or did you do most of it?

Jameson

Well, a little bit of help. There was a boy that had just returned from
Army duty, a neighbor boy. He would come up, and we’d go feed every
morning. There wasn’t so much to do that we couldn’t get it done.

Larson

That’s no small thing, trying to get the ranch started and having all
those responsibilities and the kids at the same time.

Jameson

If I hadn’t have grown up on a ranch, I wouldn’t have had a clue what to
do, but it certainly did help me know a little bit about it.

Larson

You said your husband was from Tulsa so he probably wasn’t a farm or
ranch kid.

Jameson

Yes, he wasn’t a cowboy. Spit and whittle. (Laughter)

Larson

Now, I understand you taught school for many years.

Jameson

Yes, thirty.

Larson

What can you tell me about that?

18

Jameson

Well, I taught vocational home economics there in Davis for twenty
years. Then Roger and I divorced after thirty years of married life, and I
felt like the attorney gave me the lion’s share of everything. He really
helped me out. So then by the time I wanted to go back the next year,
they had hired a home ec teacher, so I went into fifth-grade science and
thoroughly enjoyed it and taught for ten years until I retired.

Larson

So you were out of the Davis school system the whole time?

Jameson

Yes. Then I was out for two or three years, and the principal of the
middle school called me and said, “Dorothy, could you come back just
two periods in the day, the first two periods of the morning, and teach
middle school science and do whatever you want to do? The first class
will be eighth-grade girls, and the next is sixth-grade boys.” Well, that
was fun, did my own curriculum, and we kind of did mini home
economics stuff. We sewed on buttons, and we did cooking stuff, and we
did breakfast foods. This one boy, he was a twin. I never had his twin
brother, but I had him, Jeremy. We practiced doing a lot of different
breakfast foods, and then we drew to see how well they remembered
what they were supposed to do and how to do it. He drew making
French toast in a waffle iron. He loved it so. He told me the other day—
not the other day—about he graduated from Manhattan, Kansas, this
spring, and he said, “I’m still making French toast in the waffle iron.”

Larson

That’s not a bad idea.

Jameson

Yes, it makes it nice and crisp and everything.

Larson

I’ll have to try that. (Laughs) We’ll have to think of Jeremy when we do.

Jameson

Yes, right.

Larson

What can you tell me about how you feel the field of home economics
changed over the years?

Jameson

Oh, I wish you hadn’t asked me that.

Larson

Oh, okay. Well, I can take it back if you want. (Laughs)

Jameson

Well, I tell you what. I felt like when I was teaching I taught things that
helped the girls the most, so that’s what they got. So much of the stuff is
not applicable to everyday living. Maybe I’m living behind the times. I
don’t know, but if it is, I still think they need to learn how to sew, sew
on a button, do this and that, alter clothes to fit. Even though you don’t
wash and iron everything you have now, you still need to know that.

19

There’s just so many things. And while I was teaching, we built a new
economics department, and we put in one of these beds that folded up in
the wall and double doors. I forgot what they call them.
Larson

Murphy beds?

Jameson

Murphy bed, yes, because I had been taking a twin bed. I had to teach
home nursing. How can you teach a patient in bed if you don’t put them
to bed? Anyway, I did that, and, oh, the kids learned a lot in home
nursing, just simple things. One little girl said “Well, I’ll never take care
of anybody that’s sick in bed. I’ll either put them in a nursing home or in
a hospital.” I said, “Now, wait a minute.” Later, after I was out of
teaching home economics, I was on the school board and went back to
an open house one night, and the new superintendent was there. I said,
“Have you been to the home economics department?” He said, “No.” I
said, “Well, let’s go over there, and I’ll show it to you.” Well, low and
behold they had taken that bed out and put shelves in. I don’t know what
they did with the bed. I said something about it, and she said, “Well, we
never did use it.” Oh, my. That, and then they took the washer and dryer
out, the dishwasher, and all of that stuff, and turned it into a music room.
They just really—but I think the superintendent we have now, he is
thinking about how important it is for them to come back and have home
economics.

Larson

Now, I know when I was in eighth grade, both boys and girls had to take
half a year of shop and half a year of home ec. Did they do that where
you were, or did you have groups of boys?

Jameson

No. The only way we did that was not half, but for two weeks I would
take the ag boys, and he would take my girls, but that’s a good idea.
Girls need to know how to use a screwdriver and a hammer and all of
that.

Larson

I was going to say, having grown up on a farm, I knew the screwdrivers
and hammers, but it was the woodworking equipment with the lathe and
things like that that used to scare me, but I learned how to use them.

Jameson

Right.

Larson

How do you think the students changed over the years? You were there
for a long time. Did you see any trends?

Jameson

I can see a change now, but I tell you what makes me feel good is when I
go into a store, I may not recognize the person because they’re maybe
bald-headed or gray-headed or something. They’ll say, “Oh, Mrs.
Jameson, how are you?” and come up and give me hug. That’s showing

20

self-respect for a teacher. You don’t see that done very much anymore to
them. I don’t know what it is. Everything is changing. I don’t know if
we don’t handle the drug situation better than we are, we’re still going to
be in it. Sex has gone rampant. You can’t even listen to a TV program
anymore if it isn’t something about somebody exposing themselves or
something.
Larson

Well, now, I understand you’ve been really active in the community, too,
in different organizations. Can you tell me about some of the things
you’ve been involved with?

Jameson

Well, yes. I’ve been very active in my church. It’s the First Christian
Church Disciples of Christ in Sulphur. Then, when I first came to
Sulphur I was a Girl Scout leader. I have served on the Soil
Conservation Board and have received a plaque. Several years ago I
signed up for a five-year program and outlined what I wanted to get
done within five years and got it done. They gave me a nice plaque as
Woman of the Year.

Larson

Ah, excellent. Congratulations.

Jameson

I got the Outstanding Teacher of the Year for Murray County. Just
things like that.

Larson

That made the Boise City newspaper…

Jameson

Oh, did it?

Larson

…when you were teacher of the year.

Jameson

Teacher of the year? (Laughs) Good.

Larson

I found that when I was looking online. I guess to just end up everything
where we started, back on the Strong Ranch, is the ranch still in the
family?

Jameson

Yes. Now, my parents have died, and both of my brothers are gone, but
my oldest brother’s daughter, oldest daughter and her family, have
moved out there on it. Her mother is now in a hospital. They are running
the ranch and doing real well. If it would just rain. It needed that. They
have a house in town that’s a four-bedroom house. When she moved
down from Colorado Springs, they got that house. The kids were still in
school and all, and they needed it. Now she has turned that into the
Branding Iron Bed and Breakfast, and that is the neatest place. If you
ever want to stay at Boise City, stay at the Branding Iron.

21

I had some good friends in my church, and the one that moved the dairy
herd from up by Lake Arcadia down to Sulphur, he’d never been in that
area, so last fall we went on a little trip. We went up there. We stayed
there, and then we went out to Black Mesa and up to Kenton. Kenton is
the only town in the state of Oklahoma on Mountain Time. We saw the
dinosaur tracks and all of that. They had traveled a lot in the Holy Land,
and they were so amazed at how much the rock formations and the trees
and everything in that area of the panhandle looked like what they saw
around Jerusalem and so forth.
Larson

Well, it’s high and it’s dry, I guess.

Jameson

Yes.

Larson

It’s a beautiful area. I was impressed when I was out there.

Jameson

We were kind of surprised when some of the people in Boise City
bought a retirement home in Kenton. (Laughs) I guess you can really
retire out there. There isn’t anything to do. (Laughter)

Larson

Well, are there any things that we didn’t talk about that you wanted to
touch on?

Jameson

Oh, probably tomorrow I’ll think of a lot of things, but right now I just
don’t think of much.

Larson

Okay, if you do, we can finish up. We can do a little more of an
interview later on.

Jameson

Okay.

Larson

Thank you so much for your time and for talking with us and giving us
your stories.

Jameson

Yes. Well, I tell you what. John and Cathy, that is my oldest son and his
wife, are promoters here at Oklahoma State. They are pretty good
donors, and they’re in the Alumni Association and all of this and that
and so forth, so they will probably be giving you tips or something.
(Laughter)

Larson

Well, we’ll see what they’ve got to say. Thank you so much, and we
really appreciate it.

Jameson

Well, thanks for going to the trouble to come down here and see me
while I’ve got a bad leg.

22

Larson

It’s our pleasure. Glad it’s feeling better.
