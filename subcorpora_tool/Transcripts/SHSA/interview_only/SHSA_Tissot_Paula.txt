Hanawalt: This is Carla Hanawalt interviewing Paula Tissot on October 9, 2008 as part
of the 2008 Alumni Stories Project. So, let’s start with the most straightforward details.
What was your major and where did you live on campus?
Tissot: My major was History, specifically Far Eastern History. I lived first at
Branner which was known as “the other women’s dorm,” [laughs] freshman dorm, and
then in Lagunita, and then my last two years at Durand on the Row.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:

So you got around on campus, right?
Right, yeah [laughs].

Hanawalt: In terms of where you lived.
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Yeah, yeah.
And where did you come from when you entered Stanford?

Tissot: I was living in Los Angeles; I came from Los Angeles, West Los Angeles
and that—yeah.
Hanawalt: Very good. And do you remember what your thinking was in terms of
choosing Stanford?
Tissot: It was, I hate to say it but it was pretty casual. I had gone … I grew up in
Beverly Hills and I went to Beverly Hills High for my first two years, and people used to
talk about going to Stanford, and I thought, “Well, I’m just going to pick where I want to
go and nobody’s going to tell me where to go.” And then I changed to a girls’ school
called Marlborough, and one of my very best friends before our senior year said, “I think
we should go to Stanford. It sounds like a nice place, it’s a lot of fun and there’s lots of
boys.” Now remember, this was 1954, and so I said, “Oh, good idea” and I was a good
student and editor of the annual and stuff like that. So, applied and, you know, was one
of the early ones in [laughs].
Hanawalt:
Tissot:

Wow.
Yeah, so.

Hanawalt:

And how did you travel to get here?

Tissot: On the train overnight with five other women. Six of us got on the train
and took the, whatever train that was called—the Lark, I think -- from somewhere in L.A.
or—I’ve forgotten what the starting point was -- and arrived here in the morning at the
train station. And there were, you know, young men to come help us carry our luggage to
our dorms. And I remember a friend of mine said to my other friend, both of whom were
very pretty women, one said, “Now Joan, don’t accept any dates until we get our stuff to
our dorms” [laughs]. But, you know, I mean the thing is, Carla that was kind of the
thinking in those days.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Sure, sure.
As young girls going off to college.
What student traditions or activities do you remember?

Tissot: I remember the football games that, you know, from the morning until
evening, until it was all over. And as the years went on, we had parties before the games.
We partied a lot at Stanford, and the band was always wonderful, and Prince Lightfoot
[the Indian mascot] was always wonderful [laughs]. And, you know, he would dance out
in front of the band as the band came out. It was really very inspiring. And the Stanford
Hymn was very inspiring. And I think we all took that very seriously, that Stanford game
tradition. And I think one of the people who is going to participate in the interviews, I
remember sitting next to her at a football game, Annette Flattery, and the game was close
and she said, “Shouldn’t we give the axe yell now?” as if there were some sort of
[laughs] you know, that was going to do it. So, that was one thing. Also, Spring Sing: I
found the spring sing an event I liked a lot because things were usually very amusing, and
the nice setting there and I guess it was Frost Amphitheatre. And then Gaieties—Big
Game Gaieties, and I primarily ignored it. I have to say I wasn’t much of a joiner; I had a
lot of friends but I kind of went my own way. But I was asked to be in the Gaieties my
senior year, and I did and I thought, “Why hadn’t I done this before?”
Hanawalt:

So, what did you do as part of this?

Tissot: Well, there was a number that where, there were women on stage who
were supposed to look like mannequins. And I’m tall and thin; so I said, “I don’t know if
I can sing very well,” they said, “That’s okay” [laughs]. So that’s how I got into it. But I
met a whole new group of people and that was a great experience, and I’m just sorry I
didn’t do more of that, yeah, yeah.
Hanawalt: Were there any activities, sort of extracurricular activities, associated with
your major then?
Tissot: Nope, nope. I just—no, I mean, I hate to say I was just sort of dull, you
know, and went along and went to class. And I, you know, I had a very active social life

3

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

and good friends. I do remember my very favorite professor would invite, our senior
year, invite the seminar students over to his home there to do the seminar and for
cocktails.
Hanawalt:

Very nice, and who was that?

Tissot: That was Claude Buss. [BUSS, CLAUDE A., Professor of History.
A.B.,Washington Missionary College, 1922; A.M., Susquehanna, 1924;
Ph.D.,Pennsylvania, 1927; LL.D., Southern California, 1945. At Stanford since 1946.]
And he was an inspiration in terms of his insights as to what was going on in the world at
the time and particularly the Far East, Southeast Asia, and before the Vietnam evolved to
what it did; and what we were doing wrong as far as our government was concerned.
And I always remember the things he said, and part of that could probably apply today,
too. But he was a man who had—he knew Mandarin, for one thing, and he spent World
War II in the Philippines in prison. Now, the prison wasn’t ugly for Americans; they
were just in a big camp kind of thing. But he had worked for [General Douglas]
MacArthur, I believe. So it was—you believed him.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Sure, sure.
Yeah.
He had the experience and the knowledge to share.

Tissot: Right, right but I, you know, I really can’t think of any other kinds of
extracurricular activities I did; I didn’t.
Hanawalt:

What was it like to go to his home?

Tissot: It was great, I mean, I felt, it was very opening. It probably encouraged all
of us to try to learn more. He was more than just a professor; he was a friend, and
someone who could provide insights, and someone you wanted to ask questions about,
and someone who also understood you more.
Hanawalt: You talked about having good friends. Was there anyone in particular
who made a big impression on you as a peer?
Tissot: Yes, and many of them are still around, and for me, humor has always
been important. Needless to say, everyone who was here, they were all intelligent.
Hanawalt:

Sure.

Tissot: And some were more outgoing than others, and some were definitely more
humorful than others. But I’ve always been attracted to people who have humor, and I
don’t mean silliness. I mean people who can look, perhaps, on the bright side of life and
whose bottle is half full. And I met a very good friend my freshman year, and we were

4

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

friends all through school. And she remained a friend, not that we saw each other a great
deal, but she was a very good friend, and she died ten years ago and that was...
Hanawalt:

I’m sorry.

Tissot: …yeah, that was a heartbreaker.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

And what was her name?
Becky Johnston.
And you met her when you first came…

Tissot: Freshman; she was a ‘summer freshman’ so I didn’t meet her until winter
quarter my freshman year. So, she and I palled around a lot together. Another woman
who still remains a good friend, who’s brilliant as far as I’m concerned, and again, her
wry humor, Deborah [Bailey] Stone Bush, she lives in New York. She’s a very good
friend and one I like to see. But then there were many, many, many with whom I lived,
particularly in Durand because that was a smaller place. There were only what, thirtyfive of us there or something, yeah.
Hanawalt:
life?

Were there any traditions or things of that nature associated with the dorm

Tissot: Maybe informal—it’s hard to tell. I can’t put a finger on anything else,
but we would have house parties at Christmas, because I ran across a photograph of me
dressed as Santa Claus, you know, so [laughs]. My son says, “That’s great, Mom” you
know. And of course, you know, if somebody got pinned, there were the serenades and
things like that. And the thing that I think is one of the outstanding -- and maybe it still
goes on at Stanford -- the outstanding things about living as we did in those former
sorority houses, number one, they weren’t sororities. You drew numbers to get there.
Hanawalt:

Oh, okay.

Tissot: And for instance, I drew a number with my friend Becky and we got, we
ended up in Durand. And the rule was you did not live with the person with whom you
drew. You needed to spread around more. And as a consequence, it truly was a motley
collection of people, in the best sense of the word. And I think that that experience
enabled me to be more open about people.
Hanawalt:

Sure, sure.

Tissot: We weren’t in the ‘Pi Phi Sorority’ where everyone was blond and blueeyed and had the same, wore the same clothes. We were all very different people; and
when you spend the year living, sleeping, eating with this variety of people, you learn a
lot of new things.

5

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Hanawalt:

Sure, sure.

Tissot: Yeah, and the first quarter I lived there my roommates, one of whom is no
longer living, Barbara Beckwith was her name, and she was someone who liked very
odd, you know, Gaelic folk music and would play these odd songs. Another woman with
whom I still correspond, Mary Starkweather—I think Carver—I don’t know what her
married name is, her new married name is now, studied very hard, she was pinned as
someone who was away, and those women tended just to be in their books but [laughs].
She was a lot of fun, but each one was so --and we were three people who were very
different from one another and when a friend came up from Southern California for a
football weekend she said, “These people are different.” I said, “You betcha they are,”
you know. I think that was a real value that—that Stanford forced us into, if you will.
And then the smaller living quarters, too.
Hanawalt:

Yeah, yeah.

Tissot: I think we learned tolerance, more tolerance. And as I say, I don’t know
what that is like today. I have no idea, yeah.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Huh, very interesting.
Uh huh, I think it is.
So, you mentioned Spring Sing. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

Tissot: Well, usually the way it happened is a men’s living group and a women’s
living group some way would get together. Someone would be—people would decide,
“Okay, let’s do this song” like putting on a little play, and we would get together and
practice, and it was always very jovial, and the numbers were always very entertaining.
One I remember, and I was not a member of the group, but I think it was the Phi Delts
[Phi Delta Theta] did one year something called “Blue Suede Shoes.” It was the time of,
you know, Elvis was just coming out. And they dressed as a piano [key]board, so that
there were some who were in white dinner jackets, others in black dinner jackets and in
fact, I found a photograph of it for the class book that did this year. And so, they sang
this song to Beethoven’s Fifth, [singing] “Where did they go, those blue suede shoes?”
and, you know, then they go up and down like this; it was very entertaining, and it was
just a way of the entire campus to come together whether one was singing or not, and it
was a lot of fun, yeah.
Hanawalt: It sounds like fun; sounds like a good vehicle for all the humor that you
were talking about as well.
Tissot: Right, you know, I think too, I mean I don’t know how others from my
class would feel, but I think we were a very light-hearted group. I think we were all very
happy to be here and we were enjoying it. I mean, it was such—it still is a gorgeous

6

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

place, I mean, it’s gorgeous. It’s just -- I had never seen Stanford until I arrived off that
train. And we were, we were light-hearted. We studied hard, I mean, we did. Getting
good grades was important.
Hanawalt:

Sure.

Tissot: But maybe we just weren’t so wrapped up with ourselves and again, I just
have -- it’s just probably the way the society changes about being so self-absorbed that
you don’t have time for others, and I don’t think that was too prevalent at Stanford, or I
was blind to it or something [laughs]. But that’s my impression. You know, and
certainly people who had lots of fun and were doing fun things, and I’m speaking
primarily of the men because they were able to right away go to get jobs to do things.
For women, there wasn’t much open.
Hanawalt:

Hmm.

Tissot: It was strange; I mean our goals were primarily to get married. I mean,
there were many who married while we were still in school. And it didn’t occur—some
yes, teaching, librarian, nurse.
Hanawalt:

Pretty narrow; narrow choices.

Tissot: Yeah, and the school didn’t do much to change that. I’m sorry to say that
I think they were here to educate the males and not the females, in terms of options after.
Hanawalt:

Mmm hmm, mmm hmm.

Tissot: A very good friend of mine, she was a history major, as was her husband
to be, who she married, you know, the day after graduation as most people did [laughs].
And he was called into his major professor to ask what—because he was getting good
grades—what his plans were for his future after school, you know, after—well, where did
he want to go to graduate school? And here’s some places and ‘ra, ra, ra’ and ‘ra, ra, ra’
and he had good papers and ‘ra, ra, ra.’ But she did better than he academically, and she
was never called in by anyone to find out how she might take her brain and her work to
pursue. So, that’s the situation that existed.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:
changed.

That’s interesting.
Yeah, it is, you know; obviously things changed because…
Yeah, I was going to say that would be an area where things have

Tissot: Oh, yes! And then most women I know from my class then went on and
did something later.

7

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Hanawalt:

And did you?

Tissot: Oh yeah, and I was divorced, you know, the marriage right after school
and then the divorce right after that marriage, although I have to say almost fifty percent
of our class have been married to the same person from, you know, right after—you
know, one marriage for forty, fifty years.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Wow, wow.
Yeah, I think it’s pretty impressive.
Yeah.

Tissot: But anyway, so I needed a job. So I became a teacher because there were
no requirements in Los Angeles; you just had to breathe. And then I went on, and I
ended up working at a pretty high level when I lived in the state of Michigan in the field
of education and became a national consultant in educational things.
Hanawalt:

Oh, very interesting.

Tissot:
but…

And wrote for stuff like that, and went on and got more degrees and things

Hanawalt:

Well, that is interesting.

Tissot:

Yeah, and probably only because I was forced to.

Hanawalt: Hmm, at the same time your education at Stanford sort of laid the
foundation for that.
Tissot: Oh yes, oh yes. And, you know, there’s a kind of subliminal power in
that, I might say; I don’t know how else to word it. But I always felt good by the fact that
I had gone to Stanford. And that meant something; and that meant something that a lot of
other people didn’t have.
Hanawalt:

Yeah, yeah.

Tissot: And I just had to go to that well and get it out from time to time. And I
don’t mean in terms of letting everyone know the first time you meet them that you’re a
Stanford graduate. I can’t stand that when people mention that right away: that little,
“Hello, I’m from Stanford.” I mean, I just keep it quiet because I think that’s just the
way I am. But no, there’s a definite force, there’s a definite pride.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:

Sure, sure.
Absolutely.

8

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Hanawalt:

Sure.

Tissot:

Yeah.

Hanawalt:
Stanford?
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

And what would you—did you have any escapades while you were at

Well, yes [laughs].
Tell me about them, please.

Tissot: Well in fact, when I was doing the class book, I put together a survey and
one of the questions was, “What was the worst thing you ever did at Stanford?” [Laughs]
And lots of pranks -- I would say silly, harmless, pretty harmless, pranks. Okay, for me,
one of the fun things I can remember is [one] afternoon a group of us went up to—well,
we started at the Saint Francis Yacht Club because a friend had, his family had some like
an old Monterey Tug[boat], and we tugged all over San Francisco Bay.
Hanawalt:

Mmm hmm.

Tissot: And went to different restaurants and bars on the bay. I mean, that was
fun, I mean, that was just—you know, we were probably drinking a little too much and
ended up leaving someone somewhere. I mean it’s just a mess, you know [laughs]. But
that was one, just one escapade. I mean, it seems we were always looking for ways to
have fun with whatever we were doing. Someone in our class managed to get up Hoover
Tower and put footprints on Hoover Tower to the … and things like that. Somebody
blew up the SAE [Sigma Alpha Epsilon] Lion that was in the front. I mean, I didn’t have
any part of that particularly but things like that went on. You know, no one was hurt.
Buildings weren’t damaged. It was all in good fun, it was all reparable. It was just was a
lot of fun; but when I gathered this information, and it’s in the class book, I mean, most
of the things had to do with like water fights or [laughs] there were lots of water fights
that went on, I mean.
Hanawalt:

Were there very many fountains on the campus at that time?

Tissot: Not so many. No, I mean, even putting soap suds in the fountain in front
of—it’s Cubberley Auditorium, isn’t it? [Note: probably the fountain in front of the Main
Library.] I mean, that was considered a -- or dropping something from the, you know,
the balcony in a class, things like that; just silly things. Maybe I’ve repressed them.
[laughs]
Hanawalt:

You don’t strike me as the type.

9

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Tissot: Oh, I mean, I was—you know, regardless of the fact that I just had a pretty
good time and went out a lot, and stuff like that, I was pretty ‘straight arrow’ about the
rules.
Hanawalt:

Sure, sure, sure.

Tissot: You know, I mean, I didn’t sneak out of buildings or sneak into buildings
or…primarily because I didn’t want to get caught. Which I think is what morality is.
Well you know, if it works then why not?
Hanawalt:

Were there any visitors to campus that were particularly memorable?

Tissot: I can’t remember, you know. I read that question and I couldn’t
remember, but I do think Kerensky was here on campus. [Alexander Fyodorovich
Kerensky, 1881-1970, Prime Minister of the Russian Provisional Government, 1917]
Here working. But I didn’t pay any attention. I know there were, because as I went
through a lot of the stuff to put the class book together, I realized I’d missed out on a lot.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:

I found even just working here, there’s so much going on that…
Yeah, well now.

Hanawalt: …you would almost like have to miss out on a lot, you know, just to get in
some things. So, how did you celebrate your graduation?
Tissot: Well, there was a party afterward at this friend Becky’s house, and my
parents were there and came up. And as a side bar about four, three, four weeks before, I
had been on a date; and it was possible to telephone where you lived and ask to be signed
out. And my friend who will come to this reunion signed me out. And so I came home a
little bit late, not too late, about a little after two-thirty, and I didn’t have my piece of
paper to be signed out. So, basically I had so many—I was out illegally and I had so
many demerits that all I could do is be kicked out of school. And this is in, you know,
within minutes of graduation and I thought, “Well, now, I think I’ll just let this ride. I
mean, what do I do? I have no piece of paper. If I make out one now, that’s wrong.” So
instead of saying something, I said nothing and, of course, it all came to head; and I had
to go before the women’s, I don’t know, judicial council. [Note: Women’s Council dealt
with social infractions.] Very nice people but, you know, none of them were my friends,
and I always felt they maybe didn’t always approve of me. And so I thought, “You know
this is a time where I have to hold my hat in my hand and just be apologetic” and I was.
And you know, there was a great lesson in learning that when something like that comes
up you just have to be honest about it at the time. But—so I was really happy to
graduate.
Hanawalt:

So that was just before graduation?

10

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Tissot: Yeah, my parents were in Europe, and they were going to come home and
then I thought ‘Sheesh!’ you know, and that wouldn’t have been good. One thing at our
graduation, and gosh it was hot, oh my word, and there we were in our little black gowns,
and [University President] Wallace Sterling gave the commencement address, which he
didn’t always do. And that was another thing I enjoyed about doing this class book,
because I wanted to dedicate the book to Wallace Sterling, because he was probably the
most outstanding president we’d had to date at the university, in terms of getting money
and expanding the world view; because I think Stanford, previous to that point, had been
a California school. And he was just brilliant in his speech, and I included in the class
book, he said something to the effect, “Plumage is wonderful and you should be very
proud of your plumage” and something to the effect, “Just remember a nightingale never
won a prize at a poultry contest.”
Hanawalt:

What a line.

Tissot: And we had a chance to see the class book look in that, because it was a
wonderful thing to say and I think a very important thing to say. And something that I’ve
never forgotten lo these fifty years which has —“Oh yes, we’re pleased we went to
Stanford but we have to do a little bit more.”
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Yeah, yeah, huh, very interesting.
But I mean, we didn’t do any of these—anything goofy [at graduation].
Oh, okay.

Tissot: Yeah, there’s no goofiness; no, straight: go across that, you know, get …
nothing goofy went on.
Hanawalt:

So, do you remember the band from football games?

Tissot: Right, yeah, and the band had not yet morphed into the band that
everybody talked about. It was just the straight band.
Hanawalt:

Oh, all right.

Tissot: Yeah, I think it was at least probably ten years later or so, where the band
began to really perform [laughs]. I was always proud of it, though. I thought it was kind
of neat.
Hanawalt: Yeah, yeah. All right let’s see. As an undergraduate, what would you say
your dream was? Do you remember?
Tissot:
children.

I looked at that question and—no, I was going to get married and have

11

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

That was it?
Yeah, yeah. Isn’t that awful?
Not entirely.

Tissot: No, no it’s not a bad dream. I wanted to read and no, I was always interested in a
variety of things and continued to be, which is maybe why I never could focus on one
area very much in terms of study. One of the reasons I wanted to be a history major, it
was fairly free in terms of requirements: history course requirements said that I could
take so many other courses. So I took a lot of philosophy courses, French courses, [and]
English and American Lit courses. It allowed a student to branch out more, which I
thought was a very good idea, you know, so and good for me, because then I could have,
you know, a big panorama of a lot of information, yeah.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Very good, huh. So, what’s your favorite memory of your time here?
Hmm.
If you could single out one?

Tissot: I seem to—if I think of Stanford, I think of the smells, the eucalyptus; the
living at Durand, walking up and down the row maybe two times a day; the friendliness.
With that I think there -- I don’t know, there’s a sort of honest kind of a sense of safety,
of having people around with whom you could just be free to explore the world in a way,
not necessarily physically because again, there was no study abroad; that began the year
that I left. Just ideas about different things; the variety of people, the interesting—just
being with the people, I think, because—and many people have said that at no other time
in our lives have we had the opportunity to be with so many people as bright as we are.
That’s a little arrogant, but it’s true.
Hanawalt:

Yeah, sure, sure.

Tissot: I mean, and it was true. There was some data about the women—the
women that entered in our class, all of their scores (and scores aren’t everything) but their
scores were ten percent higher than the women who were going to the East Coast schools,
the Vassars, the Smiths, the whatevers. I’m not sure if I included that in the class book or
not, I think I did.
Hanawalt:

Hmm, very interesting.

Tissot:
with us.

Yeah, yeah. We also we had better academic record than the men entering

Hanawalt:

Hmm, very interesting.

12

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Tissot:
Hanawalt:

Yeah.
Now, you lived in four different dorms?

Tissot: Uh huh, yeah, which was fairly typical, because always your freshman
dorm was either Branner or Roble, and then the sophomore dorm was usually Lagunita.
And then—or if you were lucky, when you ‘drew’ after your freshman, you could draw
into one of the Row houses which were considered the … this was before Florence
Moore [Hall] was built. And so that—yeah, that’s usually the way it worked out. It went
to Lagunita because there were few places for a sophomore to be in any of the Row
houses. And then once your junior year you had drawn into a Row house, you could stay
there your senior year, unless you chose to leave, which I don’t think happened too often.
Hanawalt:

And how would you compare the different dorms you were in?

Tissot: I much preferred the row house, the smaller unit. The other ones there
was, you know, large dining facility. Granted, we had corridors or whatever they were
called at Lagunita, and so there was a camaraderie there of sorts. But to me, not the same
as when you had the smaller living unit.
Hanawalt:

Yeah, that makes sense.

Tissot:
anyway.

I mean the corridors were a place where you went and slept, for me

Hanawalt: What do you think about how Stanford has grown and changed since your
time here as an undergraduate?
Tissot: Well, it surely has grown. And I’m all in favor of it. I think that the
planning has been superb; and the attempt to maintain the integrity of the original
architecture and even the gardens: Olmstead’s original plan for the Quad—I didn’t even
know he was the one who’d set out the garden drawings. I didn’t know that until just the
other day. But I think what has been done is wonderful, and some say, “Well, gosh, it’s
grown, it’s grown too much, it’s grown too much.” Well, my goodness sakes, fifty years,
what do you expect? I mean, this is one of the most important universities in the world,
and of course it’s going to grow. And, of course, it has to be a place to attract fine people
to teach and fine people to learn. So, I’m all for—I love it, one way or the other, you
know.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:
Hanawalt:

That’s great.
I can still find the little corner where I used to hang out [laughs].
What do you enjoy most about coming back to Stanford whenever you do?

13

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/PAULA TISSOT

Tissot: Well, when I’m here it’s seeing the people that I knew, but it’s really more
the physical environment. I mean, I could come back here by myself. And in fact, I was
here for a meeting in February, and I spent two or three hours just walking around seeing
old places, old haunts, whether it be Lake Lag or, of course, The Cellar was so important
to us. And The Cellar is there where the Student Union -- it was in the basement of
Student Union. [Note: now called Old Union.] And when we’d go there in between
classes and have coffee, and what I remember, there was an apple machine: big, green
juicy apples. I’d never had big, green juicy apples, and they’ve never been as good since
[laughs].
Hanawalt: So when you were back in February walking around, were there other
things that sort of jumped out at you?
Tissot: Well, where there had been pathways going someplace, those were closed
off. I was overwhelmed by … of course, the number of bicycles is huge; and the other
thing I felt also, and then I drove around a little bit, too, everyone’s running. I know it’s
… but you know, I’m one; I used to run until I realized it was going to break my body in
ten years. And but there seems to be, everybody’s running; and no matter where, you see
people running all the time. And so that was something that struck me. I mean, we
would never run anywhere [laughs]. And again, I may just be putting my blush on what
I see, but it seems that the students seem so terribly intense.
Hanawalt:

How did that come across to you? How did you sort of pick up on that?

Tissot: Well, when I listened to conversations and everything, there didn’t seem
to be any discussion of anything that wasn’t tied to something, some course they were
taking or something academic. I mean, again, probably just my blush on things.
Hanawalt:

Huh, interesting.

Tissot: Yeah, which is why everybody wants to come here and do so well. I
mean, I suppose—you’re here, that’s what you’re here for, you’re not here to go out and
drink beer, you know, as we did. [laughs]
Hanawalt:

Do you have a least favorite memory and if so, what is it?

Tissot: Right. I can’t really think of anything that, you know, like really bothered
me or disturbed me or … I think, I guess I could say what was—and, you know, it has to
work two ways, but I don’t feel there was enough academic, professorial mentoring.
Hanawalt:

Hmm.

Tissot: From the time, I mean, you know, we enrolled and declared a major and
so there was a folder in some guy’s file, and that was that. There was, you know, no
phoning periodic—at least I don’t remember. To say, you know, “Well, how are you
doing? Do you still wish to do this?” or …

Hanawalt:
Tissot:

Hmm, interesting.
Yeah.

Hanawalt: So, is there anything else you’d like to talk about that we might not have
touched on yet?
Tissot: Well, you know, in terms of you gathering, “What was Stanford like
during the fifties?” I think it’s pretty hard to talk about what Stanford was like in the
fifties without, you know, talking about what the fifties was like.
Hanawalt:

Mmm hmm, mmm hmm.

Tissot: And it’s just hard to remember [laughs]. No, but you know, and I guess in
my junior year, that would have been ’56, you know, Eisenhower was elected a second
time; you know, our country was very different. We were growing slowly, carefully.
You know, the Russians were big, bad bears that needed to be, something needed to be
done with them, you know. And so it was a really very happy time, I think, the fifties.
Because we’d been off the World War II, and we were the generation that had certainly
had lived in World War II but had been very young children.
Hanawalt:

Right.

Tissot: And had been—we were not part of the Depression, perhaps; certainly our
parents had been. But the Depression was all gone. It was a time to grow and be free and
be happy and the world was our oyster, kind of. And I think that was reflected at
Stanford, I really do.
Hanawalt:
Tissot:

Hmm, very interesting.
Yeah, yeah.

Hanawalt:

Well, thank you very much.

Tissot:

Well, thank you Carla, yeah.

Hanawalt:

It’s been a lot of fun.

Tissot: It’s been a lot of fun, you know. I’ll be curious to see—and I know
someone, when this first came up, and she said, “I don’t know if I have anything to
contribute.” I said, “Leann, it isn’t to contribute, it’s to just say what you remember.”
Hanawalt:

Exactly, yeah.
