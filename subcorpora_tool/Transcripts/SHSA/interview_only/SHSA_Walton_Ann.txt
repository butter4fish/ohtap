EISENSTEIN: This is Larissa Eisenstein, interviewing …
WALTON: … Ann Walton
EISENSTEIN: class of …
WALTON: …1958
EISENSTEIN: … as part of the 2008 Alumni Stories project. So, we’re going to start with
the most straightforward questions first. So, what was your major, and where did you live on
campus?
WALTON: My major was education, and I lived on campus at Roble Hall, Ventura [Hall],
and Storey House.
EISENSTEIN: What is Ventura?
WALTON: Ventura was an animal lab next to the Medical School, before things changed,
but they made it into a dorm and it was the “last draw:” if you got number nineteen, that was
the absolute last choice. The funny thing about it was that many of the people in my
freshman corridor got the same bad number, so to speak, and so we basically moved from
Roble to Ventura, and had a lot of fun.
EISENSTEIN: So what made Ventura the worst pick?
WALTON: Because it was so far from the rest of the campus, and we ate at Old Union,
whereas a lot of the sleeping places had eating places attached. We had to trek for our meals.
EISENSTEIN: So can you tell me a bit about the “draw”?
WALTON: You know -- how it worked, we just drew numbers, and actually my freshman
roommate in my corridor in my suite, we drew together and so we got the same number
together. And so did other people. I don’t know much about it.
EISENSTEIN: Did you live with your roommate during your whole time at Stanford, the
same roommate?
WALTON: Yes. In the same building, not in the same room.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: So how would you say you made most of your friends? Was it from your
living situation?
WALTON: Yes, and then we got … when we lived at Storey House we were next door to
the Phi Delts [Phi Delta Theta], and just proximity made it easier to “play.”
EISENSTEIN: We’re going to back up a little, and just find out, where did you come from,
where were you before Stanford?
WALTON: I came from New Trier High School in North Chicago area … and that’s where
I came from.
EISENSTEIN: Well, that’s what we want to know! So what made you choose Stanford?
WALTON: My dad was in the field of education, and at the time I selected Stanford, it had
the best education school in the nation. Dr. Paul Hanna [HANNA, PAUL ROBERT, Lee L.
Jacks Professor of Child Education, and Co-ordinator of the University of the Philippines-Stanford
University Contract. A.B., Hamline, 1924; A.M.,Columbia, 1925, Ph.D., 1929; Pe.D., Hamline,
1937. At Stanford since 1935] was part of that group, and so … I thought I had free choice but
I guess my dad was pushing me.
EISENSTEIN: Did you regret that at all?
WALTON: Well, I wanted to go to Bryn Mawr, but my grades weren’t good enough [laughs]
EISENSTEIN: Imagine that! So what did you think of Stanford once you got here?
WALTON: Oh, I jumped right in.
EISENSTEIN: Do you remember any first impressions of Stanford, from freshman year, or
just things that stick out in your memory as unexpected moments?
WALTON: Well, of course, a lot of things: I’m trying to think about the first day, the first
week. My mother flew out with me from the Chicago area, and we had a few days in San
Francisco, and we were amazed at how well the bus system worked, because we just toured.
And then we came down on the train and stayed at the President Hotel, and I remember
how hard the beds were. And then she got a taxi and we came over to Stanford, and she
brought me to Roble Hall, and of course she wanted to see me right to my room. And they
said to the mothers, “You leave them here.” And Jane McCarthy was a Stanford student –
they had student guides for everyone to go to their room – and she said, and I remember my
mother’s big eyes as I walked away, letting her baby go.
EISENSTEIN: Why do you think it is that they didn’t let the parents go with you?
WALTON: Maybe they thought, maybe saying goodbye, or I don’t know. I have no idea. I
know I had to send my mother measurements for curtains for the window. Roble Hall has
really tall windows, and there were no curtains, so I remember sending her, and she made
some curtains and sent them to me.
2

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: Did they expect students, everybody, to have someone who would make
them curtains, or did people go “curtainless”, or …
WALTON: Well, it’s really interesting to think of how different it is now. I came to Stanford
with a trunk and a suitcase. And nowadays, I see people come with a large van with a
computer, refrigerator, all their clothes, their teddy bears … you know we came with a lot
less stuff. I didn’t even have a typewriter. We traveled light in those days. Somehow we made
do.
EISENSTEIN: You want to tell me a little bit more about your freshman experience?
WALTON: Well, let’s see. It was just all new to me: football games and “jolly up” dances,
mud pools or something like that. And senior boys who showed up the first day looking
over the territory. A freshman boy could not get a date. But all the upperclassmen were there
looking over the new group. I know the Encina freshmen boys did show us a lot of
attention. One day they took all the toilet seats off of Encina, and brought them over to
Roble Hall, and spelled “I love you” on the lawn.
EISENSTEIN: I hope they took them back.
WALTON: Well, there were stories from Encina that I didn’t observe. But anyway One B
corridor, which was my corridor, we hung around a lot together.
EISENSTEIN: And you mentioned that the senior boys had an easy time getting dates,
whereas the freshmen boys didn’t – Why was that?
WALTON: I think they [upperclassmen] knew what they were doing [laughs] and the freshmen
boys were just getting a hold of things, getting adjusted. I do remember one funny time we
went out – there were four of us, we were all freshmen – and one of the boys with us said,
“Well, let’s tell what we were all in high school. I was president of my class.” And everybody
looked at him, because we were all presidents of our class. It’s like, “So??”
EISENSTEIN: I think that could be true today. Some things haven’t changed.
WALTON: Well, people come from small towns, and they come from big towns, and so the
adjustment is different. If you were everything in your small town, and you come from a big
town … there were actually twelve people from my high school that came to Stanford in my
class. A group from one high school, and there were about forty of us from the Chicago
area. So going home on the train was a three-day “debriefing” and party. It was very fun.
EISENSTEIN: So did you feel you had a really good, strong support group just from
coming with other people from your high school?
WALTON: Well, actually we didn’t hang out that much together; we were all in different
places. I didn’t have anyone from my high school that was actually somewhere handy. But
you asked did I feel I was prepared or something, to come to Stanford? And that was an
answer to show that it wasn’t an uncommon thing; it was more of a common thing.
3

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: So you spoke a bit about what the guys did, by putting out their toilet seats.
WALTON: That was one of the things.
EISENSTEIN: Was there anything that the women did that you were a part of?
WALTON: Well, I don’t think we did anything like that; I don’t remember. I know one of
the things: in those days there was a lot more control over the students, and we had “late
leaves” and we had “after midnights.” And as a freshman, if you lived in a dorm, you had to
be in by 10:30 [p.m.] and you had, I guess, a few “late leaves,” I can’t remember the number.
That means you could be out from 10:30 to midnight, and you had one “after midnight” if
you got to go to a dance. And in those days, like the Navy Ball was in the City, so just
transportation of itself would add a lot of time with the commuting.
And some of my freshman dates and I, we got lost all the time, none of us being from this
area. So we’d go out in a borrowed car, and there’d be a fraternity party in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, or the Alviso Yacht Club, which is in San Jose, or somewhere in the City – we
would just make a wrong turn or something. So I got a lot of … well, we called them “Con
Home hours.” The Convalescent Home was what the Lucille Packard Children’s Hospital
was before it was that, and if you got [in] late you got Con Home hours. And so a lot of us
painted the play equipment at the Convalescent Home many times. And it was fun: you had
to go over there on Saturday and work, put in your time. And that was fun too, so it wasn’t
such a bad punishment.
EISENSTEIN: So you didn’t mind being late because you didn’t mind the punishment.
WALTON: Well, I was embarrassed about being late; I was a good girl.
EISENSTEIN: How many … how would you get the passes to go out? Was there an RA in
the dorm, or how did that work?
WALTON: We had an RA; we had a director; an assistant director each quarter. And then
each corridor in Roble had two seniors who were also there for guidance, support, and
discipline if necessary. So there was a lot of close supervision.
EISENSTEIN: And was Roble an all-women’s dorm?
WALTON: All women. In fact that reminded me of something else: the freshmen girls were
so popular that we often had to have a coffee at six with somebody; dinner at seven thirty to
nine thirty, and a late coffee. And it was very careful: we had phones in each corridor, and
we had to work on these schedules very tightly.
EISENSTEIN: You were triple-booked?
WALTON: Yes, triple-booked.

4

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: That sounds exciting. So can you tell me about what a typical day would
have been like?
WALTON: Well, along El Camino … one of the things was dinner. Along El Camino there
was a restaurant called L’Omelette, which was a French-themed restaurant. And next door
was Kirk’s Steakburgers. And you’d be invited out to dinner, and you’d never know which
parking lot they were going to pull into. So you’d kind of hold you breath [to find out] what
kind of a date this was. The funny thing was I had never seen my teachers drink, and if we
went to L’Ommies, or L’Omelette’s, there would be a lot of the English teachers and the
history teachers in there at the bar; that was a new experience for me.
EISENSTEIN: Did you ever socialize with your teachers when you saw them?
WALTON: No. No; they were grown-ups and we had that attitude: we didn’t have the
attitude like you have now, like colleagues. In fact, one of my first freshmen events -- and
the freshmen were invited to come a week early as I recall, before everyone else came here –
Peter Bing was the senior class president and here we all are, coming from our high schools,
and he walks up and he looks like a grown-up: he had on a suit and a tie and a haircut. We
were just like “Who? He’s our class president? Who is this character?” Even though his
name was plastered all over Stanford and he was also very rich. So what did we do the next
year? We elected this motorcycle guy, George Ralph, who dressed like Marlon Brando in
The Wild One and rode a motorcycle around campus. So that was our answer to grown-ups
leading our class. And then he was a big disappointment because as soon as he got elected,
he put on a shirt and a tie, and went to meetings. So he was elected under false pretenses.
We thought we were going to get a big change.
EISENSTEIN: And then he got the big change.
WALTON: He got the big change. We were astonished at him – “What? You’re wearing a
suit?”
EISENSTEIN: So, speaking of the style he’s wearing, what was everybody else wearing?
Was it sort of dressing up on campus, or casual? What was it like?
WALTON: Well, I was from the Midwest, and I wore loafers and socks which was hilarity.
The girls from southern California wore Capezios and hose, which we couldn’t imagine – we
didn’t want to wear pantyhose every day.
EISENSTEIN: What are Capezios?
WALTON: Oh, those are like ballet slippers. They were Italian-made shoes, and that was
sort of the style for southern California girls, who were much more groomed and
professional and L.A. crisp. And so I wore pleated skirts and sweaters and shirts.
EISENSTEIN: Did the difference in the way the different regions dressed affect the social
dynamic at all?

5

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

WALTON: No, no; they just thought socks were funny. And then, if you didn’t have
Spaulding White [note]books, which I did not, that was like, “What are those?” But the
Midwest isn’t, wasn’t that conscious in those days; it was a lot more casualness and variety, I
would say.
EISENSTEIN: Did your style change at all?
WALTON: Oh, I think over time I got the message. I was also cold: coming from Chicago,
which is very cold, the houses are very snug and well-heated in the winter, and these houses
are kind of loose, so cold and a humid cold. I remember it was very chilling at first. I had to
get my clothes right: it was either too hot or too cold. There’s a medium somewhere in there,
and my wardrobe wasn’t quite right.
EISENSTEIN: Was there anything else? You had the temperature shock – was there culture
shock?
WALTON: I thought it was so beautiful. I remember somebody borrowed a car and took
me for a ride along Highway One, and I just felt like I was in movies with Grace Kelly and
Cary Grant, when they drive along the Riviera. And it was the scenes from a lot of movies I
had seen. Monterey was just breathtaking: the cliffs and the ocean pounding up. In the
Midwest we didn’t have anything like that.
EISENSTEIN: So did you get to travel a lot while you were out here? You said, you
mentioned there were parties in Santa Cruz and elsewhere. How did it work with the oncampus parties, and off-campus: did you do weekends away? How did that sort of work?
WALTON: Oh, we couldn’t go weekends: we had only one “midnight” – remember, that
was for freshmen, the Junior Prom; that whole year we had one “midnight” and we had to
be in by ten thirty. But I know one thing that’s funny: it was the Beatnik era, before the
Hippies, and we thought we could go up to North Beach and “pass.” So we would wear
black clothes and berets, and I am sure they were laughing at us. But we thought we were
fitting in, going to Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s store, City Lights Book Store, and go to coffee
houses in North Beach, and we were acting like we were “beat.” [laughs] I’m sure we didn’t
fool anybody.
EISENSTEIN: As long as you had a good time.
WALTON: Well, we just thought we were very “cool.”
EISENSTEIN: That’s always important. So, when you’re saying “we,” did you have a
specific group of friends that you …?
WALTON: Well, the Phi Delts, and my roommates in 1B and so forth. We just kept
hanging out together.
EISENSTEIN: And how did those friendships change or evolve after you graduated?

6

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

WALTON: I would say my best friends, I still have some, were people I lived either in
Storey House with or in Roble. We’re still tight.
EISENSTEIN: How about people you knew from your major?
WALTON: Well, that’s also a trial by fire. Our major required getting a Master’s, so we had
an extended year. I think that’s common nowadays, but it wasn’t common in that time. So
we were taking classes our Senior and then Master year together all the time. Except some of
us were in an honors program, and we took classes in the summer before our fifth year, and
the summer following our fifth year. And in the fifth year, we were actually teachers in
school. And Stanford had an arrangement with the Palo Alto school system, that someone
was assigned from their school system to be our “shepherd” so to speak, and would spend
one day a week with each of us, so they were assigned five people, obviously.
And we were so miserable in getting adjusted to actually doing teaching with real people.
And one of the things Stanford prided itself on was theory, which was good, and some of
the new methods of teaching. What every teacher really needs as well is management and
administration, because you’re dealing with thirty people who have needs, and our heads
were full of knowledge about theory and how to read, and how to teach math and stuff, but
not about dealing with kids who cry, and hurt each other, and all that stuff that goes on in
school. So that’s why I say it was a very difficult year. We would often meet at the end of the
day and cry together. And we worked really, really hard: I had Barron School, Barron Park
School, which I don’t think – I don’t know if it exists any more – but a lot of teachers’
children were in my school, and I was going to school and staying at school until eleven p.m.
Finally the police came, and they said, “Miss Williams, you cannot stay here so late; it isn’t
safe for you to be here in a classroom alone at night.” And I said, “I just have this work,”
because every day I had to do certain things that Stanford had taught us to do. So finally the
policeman sat outside the door in his car, day in and day out. And so I think the police
helped my learning too.
And then, I was engaged to be married, and my children at my school gave me a shower.
And this I always remember, one of the things I got for my shower present was three pairs
of underpants, and it was from Peggy – I can’t remember her name right now – Peggy, and
she said “Miss Williams, this is so you won’t have to wash on your honeymoon.” [laughs]
EISENSTEIN: How old was she?
WALTON: This was fourth grade. And another funny story from then was – you may not
remember the story about Bruce Franklin, but he was a very liberal professor, and he got in
trouble during the ‘60s because there was a bomb scare that really changed the campus
culture at that time. So I read in the paper that Bruce Franklin was arrested at Milton
Taulbee’s house – Milton Taulbee [1949-1982] was in my fourth grade class – and this was
towards ten years later. I could have guessed: Milton would not do his work. So one day I
said, “Milton, you’re going to do your work today, however long it takes, and I don’t have to
be anywhere.” And he ran out the door, climbed over the cyclone fence, and ran home. I ran
out the door, climbed over the cyclone fence, and chased him up on the porch, and his
mother runs out and said, “What is going on?” and I said, “Milton is going to do his work
today.” And she drove us back to campus. [The Taulbee family lived at 980 Matadero.]

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: Wow. How far away was that?
WALTON: I don’t know; a few blocks. I couldn’t do that any more.
EISENSTEIN: Did you continue with teaching once you graduated?
WALTON: I continued with teaching, and went right away to Alexandria, Virginia. And it
was interesting to have Palo Alto school system, which is so precious; and Lucille Nixon, for
whom Nixon school is named, she was alive at that time, and you could ask her to come to
your classroom and do a poetry lesson. Or you could call up the resource center -- which I
did because I taught fourth grade – you could get branding irons, saddles, cattle, hides: you
could do your classroom in a theme. It was all available to you. I went to Alexandria, and it
took me three hours to argue for a piece of orange construction paper. The difference,
because this was so lavish – we were so, we had no idea, we just thought that was normal. So
that’s a tribute to the school system.
EISENSTEIN: The decorating scheme you mentioned is very farm-specific; does that have
anything to do with … ?
WALTON: No, the fourth grade was California history, and at the time, Fannie Shaftel
[SHAFTEL, FANNIE RASKIN (MRS.), Associate Professor of Education. B.S., Columbia, 1935,
M.A., 1936; Ed.D., Stanford, 1948. At Stanford since 1949] was one of the researchers at
Stanford. We taught the unit method of social studies, which was to take reading, math,
health, whatever. And so the morning was like the basics, and then the social studies unit,
you were to put everything together theme-based. And so we did Indians; and we built an
adobe house for the Rancho period – that’s when we had the hides and the branding irons
and all that; and we had the Gold Rush period, and we got gold pans, rockers, we actually
dug a pit behind my classroom and we panned for gold with the hose running. The janitor
wasn’t my favorite person, but we experienced a lot of things, and that’s about as far as we
got.
EISENSTEIN: That sounds exciting; I would like that experience.
WALTON: It was. Six hundred and eighty adobe bricks made by hand. We “mooshed” the
mud outside the classroom with straw and formed them by hand, and built our hacienda on
a piece of plywood; and then we formed the clay tiles over our thumbs, because they were
formed over the thigh, so they are wide at the thigh and narrow at the knee ; that’s how the
tiles fit. So we formed our tiles exactly so and made them to cover the building.
EISENSTEIN: How big was it?
WALTON: It was big. It was actually … I didn’t plan very well, because we couldn’t get it
out of the classroom. We had to destroy it.
EISENSTEIN: My next question would be: where is it now?
WALTON: Well, I think Barron Park is gone.
8

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: Is there anything else – you mention that’s gone – is there anything else at
Stanford, or around Stanford, that you’ve noticed is gone that was particularly relevant
during your time here?
WALTON: No. It’s just bigger and more.
EISENSTEIN: So how about changes on campus, since you’ve been here today or perhaps
at previous reunions; do you have a sense?
WALTON: Well, I’m a Cantor docent, and so I’m on campus a lot, but over on that side
mostly. But I do a walk: I do the outdoor sculpture walking tour. I was really sorry to see the
big tree by the Biz School, because I always added that to my walking tour: “Look at this
fabulous tree.” And of course the campus is an arboretum too: there’s a 150 year old Yucca
tree over by the Cantor Center, which is an amazing thing. If you’re here in April, you must
go and pay homage to it; it’s quite an amazing sight, with these large, waxy tulip-shaped
blossoms that just trail over the tree.
EISENSTEIN: So you mentioned you’re a Cantor Arts docent, and you moved to the East
coast, so what happened in between, and how did you end up back here?
WALTON: By stages. My husband was in the Army making eleven cents an hour during the
Korean War, I think it was. And when he graduated, I mean when he got out of the Army,
we went to Ann Arbor, Michigan where I taught school there, and it was an interesting
contrast, again. And then we went to Houston, where he was in the oil business, and then we
came to California and ended up close by.
EISENSTEIN: What brought you back?
WALTON: We decided that we wanted to be near family: my family lived in Berkeley and
his family lived in southern California. We thought it was a shame for the kids to never have
family and cousins, so we decided to do that, and the oil business was very adaptable, or it
was -- I don’t know if any business is adaptable today, but it was very adaptable, and so we
came for that reason.
EISENSTEIN: You mentioned you were engaged in your fifth year; so did you meet your
husband here at Stanford?
WALTON: I met him at Roble, as a Roble hasher, and we had an off-again, on-again, and
we eventually married.
EISENSTEIN: What year was it?
WALTON: He was … ’57 would be his year.
EISENSTEIN: Was it common for people to marry classmates at that time?

9

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

WALTON: Oh, yes. In fact, you’ll laugh because being a young woman, things were
different, but I remember there were several of my friends who were desperate to get
married Senior spring. Their whole idea was to get married, to have a Country Squire station
wagon, five kids and a shaggy dog, just like “Please Don’t Eat the Daisies,” if you’ve ever
seen that movie. That was the model of the time. And they were making a real serious effort,
and I was concerned that “you don’t know him that well,” and some turned out and some
didn’t. But it was a focus for some people.
EISENSTEIN: So did a lot of people also get married here, at the Church, or …??
WALTON: I was trying to think … well, I guess the two friends I know the best, they were
married in Catholic churches at the Newman Center in Palo Alto.
EISENSTEIN: And were you married in the area?
WALTON: I was married in Berkeley.
EISENSTEIN: That’s so fascinating, because you moved away. I’d like to find out: some
figure, a fellow student or a professor in your campus life made a significant impact in your
life, either to shape it in a direction or someone who just really stands out, for some reason?
WALTON: Oh, yes. The first person who comes to mind is Dr. Spiegelberg
[SPIEGELBERG, FREDERIC, Associate Professor of Indian Civilization. Ph.D., Tubingen, 1922,
S.T.M., 1925. At Stanford since 1942] who taught comparative religion at that time. I’m sort of
a failed Methodist, Protestant, and it opened my mind to hear him recite poems from the
Bhagavad Gita, Indian religion, and talk about Muslim poetry, Sunni. And he had a big
class: it was in Geology Corner before it was remodeled. And in those days, as you went in
the door, the professor’s desk and blackboard were right there, and there were sort of risers
of the classroom, so … it wasn’t steep, but you had a little view of the professor. It was all
wood, and if you came late, it was “creak, creak, creak,” and of course you had to go up to
the back. When he started talking, there were no creaks; it was magic. I remember that, just
being totally enthralled: the sun coming in the windows in the afternoon, he’s telling us some
story and taking us away.
EISENSTEIN: Did that inspire you in later years as a teacher?
WALTON: Well, I certainly have always appreciated the value of story-telling, just like we’re
doing now. But just to open my mind to other religions and the spiritual qualities of all of
them.
EISENSTEIN: So when did this happen?
WALTON: I think it was freshman … and then there was Monsieur Lemaitre
[LEMAITRE, GEORGES E., Professor of Romanic Languages. B, es-Lettres, Algiers, 1916; Licencie
es-Lettres, Paris, 1917, Agrege de l'Universite, 1921, Docteur es-Lettres, 1931. At Stanford since 1938]
who taught French civilization: what a character he was! And so enthusiastic, and so French
and so “exclamation point.” And I’d already had three years of French, and I took more
French at Stanford, so I ended up with five years of French, which was fun: translating in
10

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

French and reading French and all of that. So I liked that. And we had a … Western Civ was
a great course – sorry about that -- but we had many teachers. Those are the ones I
remember.
EISENSTEIN: I had Western Civ myself.
WALTON: Oh, good!
EISENSTEIN: So one of the traditions, as I’m sure you know, is the Wacky Walk when we
graduate now. What was it like when you graduated then?
WALTON: Oh, it wasn’t anything like that!
EISENSTEIN: What were your graduation traditions?
WALTON: We were solemn; we were glad to be going, our parents came, and we were all
dressed up. We were being taken out to dinner. I don’t remember anybody doing anything
weird. But I do remember at Spring Sing of Senior year was a wonderful experience, and the
people that won – I can’t remember if the Betas – anyway, what they did, they did
Chopsticks. I know, exactly: how could you do Chopsticks? They dressed in tie and tails,
black or white, and represented the piano keys, and when they sang the basic song and the
variations, they nodded as if you were pressing the keys. And they got it perfect. We also -we were Storey House and the Phi Delts -- went together and we did “Let My People Go,” a
Negro spiritual, and we also won. But their performance was so amazing! And then the Phi
Sigs, I remember they did (it was my husband’s), they did a medley from “Brigadoon,” and
they all wore kilts and they looked so good.
EISENSTEIN: So can you tell me more about the background behind Spring Sing?
WALTON: No; I don’t know anything about it. Do they do it any more? Well, it was your
dorms, were the organizing unit that you did it. I don’t know if somebody like Rally Com or
the dance group – I think it was all dorms. And we did it in Frost Amphitheater, and you
were audience, and then you got up and performed, so it was back and forth. And it was in
the spring. It was fabulous, and what was so surprising is that you expect the music majors
or something to do a great job. What you don’t expect is for the Phi Delts and Zetes [Zeta
Psi], for God’s sake, to stand up and do something really creative and well-done and
thoughtful. That was the surprise, to see your classmates show a side to themselves that they
hadn’t previously shown.
EISENSTEIN: So was fraternity and sorority life a big part of your time?
WALTON: There were no sororities – I don’t know when they restored the sororities, but I
do know that people said that in about 1946 after World War II there weren’t enough people
on campus, for some reason the sororities died, or they thought they weren’t useful. So the
girls were organized, in my time, by dormitories. And the boys had fraternities and I guess
eating clubs. And there were other clubs you could join too, but there were no sororities at
that time.

11

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: Why didn’t women have eating clubs?
WALTON: I think there was … the ratio, you know, was three to one, boys to girls. The
girls were always housed as far as I know; I don’t know if there was an exception or not.
There was always plenty of room for girls. The boys, they formed the eating clubs because
some of them could not live on campus in the dorm, and so they had the eating clubs
because they ate together, and that helped them to make friends and be connected.
EISENSTEIN: What would you say is one of the major ways that the boys and girls
socialized, since you lived in separate places?
WALTON: The boys would come over: we had jolly-ups, we had dances, we had … going
to games, we just saw each other in class, library and that kind of thing. Until I lived in
Storey House, and then we lived next door, between the Sigma Chis and the Phi Delts, and
they were always buddies, not necessarily dates. Some people were seriously dating, and
other people were just hanging out. And if we had, say, Storey House would give a party, and
some of the girls didn’t have somebody particular they wanted to invite, there would always
be a buddy who would come over and make it a couple. It was kind of like that. So the
Sigma Chis were … Storey House had a sleeping porch – I don’t know if they still have
sleeping porches with screens – so there weren’t … there were three to a room but there was
only one bed, and you had to draw straws, and two of you had to sleep on the sleeping
porch, which is not Eden. So you went out on the sleeping porch and there were bunk beds,
stacked up very close together. And so you put on your wool socks, and your sweatshirt, and
your jacket, and your wool hat, and your mittens [laughs] and you laugh at the sleeping porch.
But the Sigma Chi’s house always thought that was an opportunity too … so they were
always throwing things at the screen. And I know we had a terrible water fight – I just
remembered – we got in trouble. We got into a water fight with each other across the lawns,
because we were on the same side of the street. And we let it go out into the street; we were
actually throwing buckets of water on people coming home from church, and it was bad: it
was stupid, but … Before the 60’s, when there were bombs and things on campus, things
were handled more like a family. The sheriff never came here. If you did something that you
shouldn’t have done, there was a student committee, and there was a faculty committee that
were assigned to give you a talk, and give you Con Home hours if that was necessary, or
whatever. And so, I know our RA had … I remember her talking to me about the water
fight and how dangerous that was. It was: it was terrible! But that is how we made friends,
walking to school and being next door to one another. I didn’t really know the girls on the
upper row; we just didn’t see each other because we weren’t eating together and so forth.
EISENSTEIN: You just mentioned jolly-ups; can you say something about those?
WALTON: Jolly-ups were what they called these casual dances: I think they were in the gym,
maybe the Roble Gym – it wasn’t like a big deal. And then fraternities gave parties: There
was the Red Death party: that was famous, where people were bringing … I know there was
no alcohol, but people were bringing alcohol of their choice and it was all dumped into a big
punch bowl. It’s a wonder we didn’t all die, but we didn’t. And so the Sigma Chi’s gave a
really beautiful party, and the Navy ROTC group gave a really fabulous ball in San Francisco
at the Sheraton Palace, and that was very formal. That’s what I remember.

EISENSTEIN: Was there one event, or even just one non-event, that was like the best
memory you have?
WALTON: No, not particularly. Oh, I know one thing that was fun: going to the movies on
Friday nights. I guess you still have the movies at Memorial Auditorium? And that was
raucous: people brought alarm clocks, and so when they were kissing on the screen, there’d
be alarm clocks going off. It was kind of like – what’s the show that people made a cult of ?
It’s a black and white movie, and … anyway, they started showing it a lot of places around
midnight, and people would go in costume …
EISENSTEIN: Rocky Horror?
WALTON: That’s it, the Rocky Horror movie [Rocky Horror Picture Show]. They’ve now done
that with “The Sound of Music”; did you know that?
EISENSTEIN: No.
WALTON: Well, it was wonderful: it was in San Francisco, they had one of those, and a
man actually went as “Ray, a drop of golden sun,” and dressed like the sun. If you can
imagine, with San Francisco creativity: a lot of people came dressed as nuns. And when they
sing on the screen “What shall we do about Maria?” all the people who were in costume sing
along with the nuns. So that’s sort of what Mem Aud was like, because a lot of them weren’t
first run movies; they were old Humphrey Bogart movies, which, I was a child when he was
making those movies, and so people knew them very well and would come prepared.
EISENSTEIN: So people would actually come in costume?
WALTON: They didn’t come in costume, but they came with noisemakers and goofy things.
And they would throw things – at each other, not at the screen. So I guess that was a
preamble for the Rocky Horror. It was fun.
EISENSTEIN: Sounds like how it is today. Some traditions continue on. My next question
was going to be … first I asked what the highlight was. Do you remember a time that maybe
was the worst time, or your least favorite memory?
WALTON: I met some boys who – I won’t say their names but they were bad boys, and I’m
sorry to say that they were studying to be doctors. And they did some really bad things. And
I’m just sort of shocked that these boys who came to Stanford from good families could do
some really bad things.
But also, another good memory was … was it Big Game? We paraded down Palo Alto
streets: that was insane. And everybody made floats. And we worked really hard on this float,
we made a skillet: we had to get the back of a truck, it was all this elaborate stuff. And we did
it with the Phi Delts, and we made a huge skillet. And we made this all out of crepe paper,
made a chimney next to the cab, and on this platform, the idea was we were going to cook -of course it was Cal, because of Big Game -- and we were going to cook Cal students. So we
had people dressed up as bears with roller skates, who were skating around inside the skillet.
13

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

And the rest of us were – I don’t know how we were doing, fanning the flames or whatever.
So we worked day and night on this dumb thing, and the night before, it burned [laughing]
and all the crepe paper, the chimney just came down. We had bought crepe paper that was
like bricks, and it just melted, and the flames were getting on the side of the truck, and I
remember we were standing there that morning, wondering what to do. “We’re going
anyway.” And so we drove the truck along with other floats down Palo Alto, all of us roller
skating. We roller skated on the Quad all the time. Now it’s skateboards and stuff. But here’s
this miserable looking float and all this melted crepe paper, and nobody knew what it was.
But
we weren’t going to not go, after we put so many night hours into making this thing.
EISENSTEIN: So no one else had that problem?
WALTON: I can’t remember; I just remember how stupid some of us looked, roller skating
in these wet clothes, and all of this mess, this dripping mess.
EISENSTEIN: Was it an annual tradition to do that before Big Game?
WALTON: Yeah, it must have been; we wouldn’t have been motivated to do it, otherwise.
But everybody was doing it on the Row, and so there were lots of floats.
EISENSTEIN: Was that just when the game was at home?
WALTON: It must have been: I don’t remember the details, but I do remember the bonfire,
too, which I know they stopped doing that. But, I don’t know, those freshmen boys, I think
they took all of, every [piece of] furniture out of Encina; it was a bad thing. They would
scrounge lumber from all kinds of places for the fun of making this huge bonfire, which was
out in the middle of Lake Lag. And there were some chairs in there, desks.
EISENSTEIN: No wonder they stopped doing it.
WALTON: Well, yes, and also, you know is it – you know, the Aggie school [Texas A&M,
November 1999; twelve students were killed] where they built it up too high: remember that? That
was another good reason. It was stupid: why do that?
EISENSTEIN: Not to bring it back to that, but you mentioned earlier that there were some
boys who did some bad things.
WALTON: I did.
EISENSTEIN: Would you care to elaborate on that? You don’t have to name names.
WALTON: OK, they went out with shotguns, and shot udders on the cows in the fields.
Isn’t that revolting?
EISENSTEIN: OK; that’s a bad thing.
WALTON: Yep, and bragged about it.
14

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: So, were the fields that you’re talking about the same ones we can see out
there?
WALTON: In fact, today, when I came over, I was delighted to see that – I came from 280
along Page Mill – and the fields were covered with horses. Because one of the things I did at
Stanford was I took horseback riding as part of my gym, and before the Med School was
built there, that was all wild fields. And so I just have memories of running and jumping
fences and riding, and it was great fun. And we had an instructor, Colonel Sysin [Alexande P.
Sysin, 1892-1976] who was a former Russian officer, and he was about four ten, but very
rigid and very stiff in his demeanor, and he wore jodhpurs and military-looking clothes. He
was very precise with his whip. And so for practice or for doing certain things, we would
have to ride around the ring, and he would test us on our posture, our giving cues to the
horses and so forth. And one day, we had a final, and we were riding around the ring, and
everything was going really well, and just as I’m coming near him, a bird pooped right on my
forehead, and I couldn’t wipe it away because I would get “bad points” if I broke my
posture. So I remember riding along [laughs] with white on my face. And I got an A.
And we had to groom our horses when we were … we had to saddle them and then clean
them up afterwards, and that was an experience just going in the barn. I have a lot of fond
feelings, the way the barn smells and the way the sunlight comes in through the dust in the
room … and jumping the fences, and just feeling so free. Of course, we did also go out in
those fields in VW Bugs, just riding around, because they were new and novel in those times
– “So, what can a Bug do? We’ll see: let’s see how it takes the fields.”
EISENSTEIN: Was that allowed?
WALTON: Oh, no. But Stanford at that time was very paternal; they didn’t send you to jail.
EISENSTEIN: They just said “Stop”?
WALTON: Well, they would … you had to have “a talk” and that kind of thing. But in
those days, the ABC [California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control] would go to
Al’s [i.e., Art’s] ‘Fashionable’ Portola Club – they would start, and then Al’s would call Mama
Garcia’s, which was the next restaurant along, and say “the ABC is coming”, so then we’d all
leave Al’s and go to Mama Garcia’s, and when we’d get the call at Mama Garcia’s, then we’d
go to Rossotti’s [Alpine Inn] and we could go round again. We were all underage, underage
drinking. So the restaurants would call that the ABCs were coming, so we’d all leave and go
to the next place until we got the call. And there was Rudy’s Alpine Inn, which is now a
tennis court or something. I’m trying to explain not that we were so, about breaking the law
we were so communal, and people looked after one another.
EISENSTEIN: So did you feel … you mentioned the police officer waiting for you outside
at night.
WALTON: Oh, that was in Palo Alto.

15

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

EISENSTEIN: But did you feel safe on campus?
WALTON: Yes. There was one policeman -- we called him Captain Midnight – who was a
problem. I had -- I was fortunate – I had a blue Ford convertible, and he would stop me for
no reason, you know, that kind of thing. He was a nuisance. But a lot of, some of the
policemen were on bicycles, and if you came out of the library at night, they would ride
along with you. A lot of us, might be a bunch of us, but if you were alone he’d come from
out of nowhere and just ride along and talk with you, and not say “I’m guarding you” or
anything like that. He’d just “How are you doing tonight, Miss?” He’d just kind of be there.
“Well, see you later” because I had to walk to Roble, that was kind of a long trek. And
Florence Moore wasn’t built when we were freshmen.
EISENSTEIN: What was there?
WALTON: Nothing; a field. Yes, that’s what really surprises me: the lack of open space. It
used to be, Stanford Shopping Center wasn’t there. It used to be, as soon as you crossed the
gateway at El Camino, the quiet was so startling, and it was The Farm.
EISENSTEIN: What was it like then, on El Camino and in Palo Alto?
WALTON: Palo Alto was a bustling little town; a lot of professors lived there. But El
Camino has always been a busy street, going back and forth. But it was amazing, the sound
barrier, because the shopping center wasn’t there and the long distance: the first building
would have been the Mausoleum and then the Cantor Museum or the Stanford Museum as
it was at the time, and then the Chem building, and the you got to the Quad. There wasn’t
anything else. There wasn’t an Engineering Quad, there wasn’t the Business School, there
wasn’t the Schwab Center: all the administrative offices they just tore down over by
Transportation --that was all in the Quad. And Memorial Court was smaller. I don’t know
how many students: the graduate schools weren’t nearly as big.
EISENSTEIN: What about the student union area, now the center of campus, where White
Plaza is: what was that like?
WALTON: It was called The Cellar, and it was a greasy hamburger-coke place where a lot of
people studied and hung out. And the bookstore was not there either; the bookstore was
where the Career Center is now, a very small little building. It was adequate at the time. And
there was a little, tiny cottage next door; it was called Roos-Atkins, which was a women’s
clothing store at the time, kind of like Chico’s or something like that. There was a little store
there, and it was just all smaller.
EISENSTEIN: Was Dinkelspiel there then?
WALTON: No. It was built while I was here [dedicated in May 1957]. And Tresidder wasn’t
there [dedicated in September 1962]. It was just the Quad, and the engineering directly behind it,
and the little bookstore, and …
EISENSTEIN: The Old Union was there.

16

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

WALTON: The Old Union was there, yes.
EISENSTEIN: What was Old Union like?
WALTON: I ate at Old Union when I slept at Ventura. There were women’s dorms there; I
don’t have much recollection, because I don’t think I knew anyone in there. We ate in there.
Interesting, though: Dave Guard, who was the Kingston Trio, the original Kingston Trio,
was a hasher there. He was another thing: when Peter Bing showed up with a tie and suit,
Dave Guard was a sophomore, also showed up, and at that time, it was so amazing that they
had this kid who was so talented. So he was part of the entertainment at that original
meeting. Here he comes out, this lanky boy, and plays the guitar, and he was just great! And
of course they formed the Kingston Trio after that.
EISENSTEIN: Was there a place on campus where musicians would gather, and you could
watch student shows, or anything like that?
WALTON: Nope. There was Ram’s Head, which was the drama group, and they performed
in Memorial Auditorium. No, that wasn’t the style then. The idea of music and rap sessions,
and things like that wasn’t what we were doing.
EISENSTEIN: So how would you experience another student’s music? Or you just
wouldn’t?
WALTON: We wouldn’t.
EISENSTEIN: Interesting.
WALTON: Oh, we had records; we played records in our dorm rooms and things like that.
And we went to concerts; I’m trying to think … the Four Freshmen were hot in those days,
and we would go up to San Francisco and hear professional music. Oh, and I forgot to say,
Paul Livadary and Greg somebody and I, he was a bass player: we formed a music group,
and we played at a restaurant on El Camino called Frank’s, which is no longer there. They
would let us perform in the afternoon when nobody was there anyway, except our friends.
EISENSTEIN: What role did you play?
WALTON: I was a singer.
EISENSTEIN: Wow. Any original music, or did you do …
WALTON: Oh, no; we just did the standards. It’s hard to believe, but we had some people
singing for us today that … I don’t know, there was a guy that wears a T-shirt that says he’s
a drummer, and he is – do you know that group? They’re the Fractious something-or-others;
I can’t remember. Anyway, it was a different kind of singing.
EISENSTEIN: That’s funny. Do you remember any funny or humorous stories, unless you
have more?

17

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

WALTON: I have another funny story: the man that became my husband was a Phi Sig [Phi
Sigma Kappa], and along that road was a sort of wild place, and we were taking a walk one
evening, and we started fooling around and shagging and chase. And Professor Kerensky,
the Kerensky of the Russian Revolution, [Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky, 1881-1970, Prime
Minister of the Russian Provisional Government, 1917] was a teacher at the time, and he came
along and he saw us playing tag and he misunderstood what we were doing. And he starts
after my boyfriend with his cane, being the gentleman that he was. [laughs] That was a
memorable moment because of who he was, you know; unbelievable!
EISENSTEIN: Did you make contact?
WALTON: Well, we stopped and talked with him, and said everything was fine and not to
worry, and everything else. It was sweet.
EISENSTEIN: So, did professors live on campus at that time? How was it back then?
WALTON: Well, the faculty housing, which is over on the other side of Stanford Avenue,
was just beginning. I know Matt Kahn [KAHN, MATTHEW SEYMOUR, Assistant Professor
of Art. Cranbrook Academy of Art, 1946-49. At Stanford since 1949.], he was my art teacher, and
he was getting a house over there. But it was a very new idea. But yes, professors have
always lived on the streets they call Salvatierra and Mayfield. Professor Hanna lived on
Frenchman’s Creek Road, which is a very famous house, the Hanna House, which is a Frank
Lloyd Wright house, and it’s also another house I tour on campus. People come from all
over and tour it: there’s a waiting list, like three months, to go and tour the Hanna House.
You’ll have to sign up and go. So professors did live there, and he built this house, and I
think everyone else did, so now the Historical Society, twice a year, in spring and at
Christmas, they have house tours. And they’re all different styles, so it kind of “grew like
Topsy.” I think the Hoovers built a house here – maybe before, or after he was President of
the University. [Note: Herbert Hoover was never President of Stanford.] There’s a house they lived
in, but it’s not the President’s mansion, when he was president of the university, not when
he was President of the United States. Three’s another house that they lived in. And there
are craftsman styles, and Victorian, and Shingle, and on and on. So that’s very varied.
EISENSTEIN: And this is a part of the Cantor tour?
WALTON: The Hanna House is the one that’s part of the Cantor tour, the Cantor
organization; but if you want a tour, you have to call the Architecture Department. In some
ways it’s separate. They sell tickets; you have to pay. And most Cantor tours, you don’t have
to pay. So that’s a different deal. The Stanford Historical Society has the historical house
tours twice a year, and I think you also have to pay: go and see twelve houses or so. They’re
really interesting and quite beautiful.
EISENSTEIN: And these are some of those houses the professors lived in?
WALTON: Yes, they still do. I think it would be hard to get a house … I don’t think
anybody can just walk off the street and buy a house. I’m not sure how it works.
EISENSTEIN: I think it’s all Stanford land, and you can own a home.
18

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

WALTON: Eight thousand, five hundred acres. And that was a good thing.
EISENSTEIN: It still is a good thing.
WALTON: Yes.
EISENSTEIN: So, two related questions: can you tell us a lesson that you learned at
Stanford, and how that played into the dream that you had as an undergrad, with what you
wanted to do with your life?
WALTON: Well, I didn’t have a lot of dreams about that, because I came here to be a
teacher. So that was a set thing. I think I learned a lot from meeting people from different
areas, and I think that was one of the reasons I got in Stanford, because I wasn’t from
California. They were trying to have a cosmopolitan … we had some – we had a couple of
princes on campus from the Middle East who wore turbans and had bodyguards; it was very
interesting. Dick Zanuck was on campus, and of course his father was already a movie
mogul. Susan Mayer of Metro Goldwyn Mayer was on campus, and Jill Schary of Dore
Schary. In fact Susan and Jill didn’t make it; they weren’t pampered enough, I think. So it
was interesting to see people come and adjust to life on campus from all these different
places. And I felt that I had been lucky, because I had moved around in my life – I’d lived in
different states, and I’d already made my peace with that. So I didn’t come from a
background where I had to face that the first time. That’s not something I really learned on
campus, but something that I came to appreciate. I also think it’s a beautiful place; I still
think it’s a beautiful place.
EISENSTEIN: Even though it’s gotten more dense in terms of buildings.
WALTON: Well, like the Law School: I am so impressed with some of the architecture [at
the] Law School; I don’t know if you’ve been up close if you go over there or not, but, you
know, to keep the red tiles, they’ve done pretty consistently doing that. And then the Law
School is all concrete now, because they can’t afford the sandstone, the original, but they
grooved it; they did some really interesting things, so it blends in but it’s also very modern
and has all the modern wiring and things that you have to have these days. So they’ve tried
to keep to it to some extent. There are a few oddball buildings; I don’t know how those
happened.
EISENSTEIN: So, we’re going to do one more question that I’m going to ask, and then I’ll
open it to you. So, if you were going to have to say maybe one … we sort of have done this
earlier … but if there’s one take-away from your experience at Stanford, either an
experience, a memory, a special place like a spot in the library: one place or one thing that
meant a lot to you that you can still remember distinctly as having meant that much. Is there
anything like that?
WALTON: Well, you see, since I’ve been on the campus since I graduated, that’s a little
fuzzy. So I think Herbert Fong, the landscape man, is an unsung hero: I enjoy the lavender
planting, I enjoy the silk tree -- I see them as I go about, and I’m always in awe of the
wildflowers, the plants in the median strips in the spring, the fruit trees in the citrus court – I
19

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/ANN WILLIAMS WALTON

appreciate all of that and am so glad it’s still here. You know, Stanford wanted grass in the
Main Quad, and Frederick Law Olmstead said to him, “No, this is not a good climate for
grass.” And so when I was here, it was gravel and mud, and when it rained, the gravel gets
displaced so it’s not all even, and there’d be places where it would just settle, the water would
settle, so it was gravel and mud. And I think it’s a great improvement to have it paved. But I
think I just like the whole, beautiful part of it, and the fact that it’s endured and it’s tried to
grow pretty gracefully, considering the pressures of money and so forth.
EISENSTEIN: Is there anything in particular you’d like to mention that we haven’t touched
on?
WALTON: Well, these things take time and come to mind with time, but I think I’ve said
plenty.
EISENSTEIN: OK. Well, I’ve really enjoyed speaking with you and meeting you, and just
for the record, let me introduce myself and you: this is Larissa Eisenstein interviewing Ann
Williams Walton, Class of ’58, as part of the 2008 Alumni Stories Project.
