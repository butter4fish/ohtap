Sparks:So my first question is: what was your major?
Trego: Political science.
Sparks: Okay.
Trego: Basically within that, I believe it was International Relations.
Sparks:
Trego:
Sparks:

Oh, interesting.
Um hmm.
And where did you live on campus?

Trego: I lived initially at Branner. I transferred into Stanford as a sophomore
from Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Colorado. And it was a very small campus,
and I was quite unhappy there because it was half the size of my high school in Denver,
which is East Denver High. And two of my friends had come to Stanford their freshman
year. And I had been through sorority rush at this small college and I wrote them a letter,
of course, we had no computers or e-mail or faxes or anything. So I wrote them and I
said, “Joan, what are you doing about rush?” She wrote back and said “What is rush?” I
thought, “That’s for me. Stanford has no sororities.” And that was one of the main
reasons I came, was to get away from Greek or sorority life, particularly on a small
college. And the other reason, people say “Why did you go to Stanford?” I wanted to
see the ocean. [laughs] I was from the mountains in Colorado, so…
Sparks:

That’s amazing. And how did you pick your major too?

Trego: I think it was just sort of an accumulation of courses that I really wanted to
take. I was so inspired and thrilled by the academic offerings at Stanford. And there was
such a great variety. So I began choosing a great variety in addition to the requirements.
And then my freshman year from this small college, I was on the dean’s list there, so
everything was accepted at Stanford. So I could just move into the traditional sophomore
program and actually had a lot of Pre-Med studies. I had thought I would, wanted to go
into, become a doctor. I had thought. And so I took a lot of science. And some of these
science courses applied to political science. There were so many -- political science at

2

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

that time incorporated a lot of the liberal arts and humanities and history. So about my
junior year, I continued with some of my basic Pre-Med courses. But I found that more
and more my interests were really leading more and more toward the liberal arts and
humanities. And I think I just sort of fell into political science.
Sparks: And okay; that addresses several questions. What student traditions or
activities do you remember at Stanford?
Trego: Traditions? Well, one thing I liked about Stanford is I didn’t find there
were many traditions. I felt that what I liked about it was it was a wonderful place to
live, this Northern California life, California style. But the freedom: our motto was
“Where the winds of freedom blow.” I don’t know if that’s still the motto or not, but that
was the motto. And I always felt that. So as far as actual traditions, I really can’t
remember any, except the history of the university and what we learned of that, if you
mean by that tradition. But as far as traditions meaning something that we all followed,
that, you know, we followed in someone’s footsteps, and did this and did that because
they had done it for generations. I don’t remember anything like that. That’s what I
loved about it was the lack of stultifying traditions.
Sparks:
Trego:
Sparks:
like?

Can you describe the student body as you recall it?
Describe it in what way?
However way that you remember it. How many students, what were they

Trego: Well, you see this was 1950 and the Korean War was on, and our men
were being drafted. And it was post-World War II. They call us this: the Nice
Generation. Imagine anyone in the 60’s, wanting to be called a Nice Generation. No, we
were in the 50’s, the post-War, not Baby Boomers. But we were in college after World
War II. And we were born in the Depression. So practically all of us, you know, our
families had struggled somewhat, because the nation had struggled. And I remember the
feeling at Stanford of abundance. I remember the feeling of, but the equality here. It
didn’t seem like anyone was aware of anyone else having money or car -- there were a
few automobiles and so on. But this intermingling and total acceptance of everyone was
like a continuation of my high school days with that type of attitude. I really enjoyed it.
And we met a lot of students from abroad, which I had never met before, coming from
Colorado mountains. And…
Sparks:

What countries did they come from?

Trego: Well, they were coming from everywhere. I remember I met this nice
man from Africa. I can’t remember what he was from. They were from Europe, fewer
from Asia. Now I see all over campus a lot of Asian students: whether they’re AsianAmerican or whether they’re here studying from abroad, I don’t know. But we had very
few Asian students. But we had quite—I remember quite a few Black Americans. They

3

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

weren’t called, you know, they didn’t call themselves Black at the time or AfricanAmerican. I think they called it Negroes. And we were Caucasians. And things were
kind of simple and pragmatic. They were not political; the campus wasn’t politically
oriented. And I remember the clothing: the women had to—we could never wear pants
on campus. We had to wear skirts. And we had to sign into the dormitories. We had to
be in by ten thirty at night. You signed out and then you signed when you came in. And
you had certain weekends, I think it was one or one thirty [a.m.] You had to keep track
of your hours and how many weekends that you could be free. I don’t know; there
must’ve been Overnights. We were, the women were rather strictly guarded. And I was
at Lagunita [Court], which was a beautiful campus. And it was flowers everywhere and a
beautiful little fountain in the front. And I loved there, they had very good food, their
little, you know, the dining room. And it was not Coed, just women. And we were
broken up into different little houses. It was a beautifully designed dormitory, unique.
Sparks: Do you have any special memories of activities, studies or campus
organizations that you participated in?
Trego: Well, because we were post World War II, and the United Nations was
just starting; as a matter of fact, it was just struggling internationally. And I think the
first meeting was in 1945 in San Francisco. It was Eleanor Roosevelt, John Foster
Dulles, some of these people really pushed getting a United Nations going. And because
we’re here on the Pacific Rim, and because Stanford was very open and enlightened, we
became—some of us were primarily concerned about setting up systems, and studying in
such a way that we could prevent a third World War, because the Second World War, we
were all very seriously affected by. My brother was killed in the Second World War, the
Marines. And then we had plunged into the Korean War. So we were a very happy
group of people. On the other hand, the Cold War was starting; we took lessons on how
to dodge, how to fall under the table in case a bomb went off, and how to avoid radiation
exposure. And that went on for a while. But I helped organize what was called the
Institute of International Relations. And we had the first United Nations, collegiate
U.N. in the world, here at Stanford. I think we had like thirty-five colleges participating.
And our group worked on this for weeks and weeks. And that was an important activity.
Sparks:

What was your role in that?

Trego: Oh, just since I was an officer with the Institute, IIR we called it, we had
just some sort of indistinct, you know, unattractive little building over somewhere on
campus, I couldn’t even, wouldn’t have found it now. We organized this United Nations.
Oh, we sent out invitations to colleges, we assigned the countries that they were to
represent. And then Bernard Baruch, who had been Secretary General to the U.N. came
and conducted our model U.N. here. So there was that interest in building a better world
as quickly as possible, in order to avoid the chaos and the conflict which resulted really in
World War II. So I think we were, the whole campus was subdued by that. And then we
had, many of our men were being killed in Korea. Then we had, I remember the blood
drives we had on campus, huge blood drives conducted by the Red Cross, to send blood
to our troops in Korea.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

Sparks:

And did you donate blood?

Trego: I probably did, I really don’t remember. It seemed like I was very ‘gungho’ about most anything that was going on, so I probably did.
Sparks:
memorable?

Were there any visitors to campus during your years that were particularly

Trego: Well our Junior Prom, I think we had Louis Armstrong. And he was
fantastic; of course we hardly danced, we just stood around staring at him around the
bandstand. And that was memorable. As far as speakers, Toynbee came once, Arnold
Toynbee; I remember he had a lecture on campus. [Arnold Joseph Toynbee, British
historian. 1889-1975.] We had a lot of good professors, visiting professors too from
back East. I can’t remember any other visitors of importance to students.
Sparks:
goodness.
Trego:
Sparks:

Louis Armstrong must’ve been incredible. I can only imagine. Oh my
That’s very memorable: three hours of staring at this wonderful man.
You said it was Junior Prom?

Trego: Yeah, I believe it was the Junior Prom. I think so. And we danced a lot.
We were a very, a dancing generation. And we danced, we embraced, you know, we
held each other in arms and sort of swirled around. And, you know, really enjoyed
holding the opposite sex in a very social and enjoyable way. Dancing was, you know, all
kinds of dancing: waltzing, Foxtrot, Tango, whatever. So the school dances were—and
we wore formals, the girls, sometimes, you know. But dancing…
Sparks:

Where were they held?

Trego: Well, I can’t remember, gymnasiums—I don’t remember where they were
held. On campus, we had the dances. But I’m just pointing out that there was a lot of
dancing, and that was important social activities.
Sparks: How about—do you remember any, a faculty member, a classmate who
had an important impact on you?
Trego:
Yes, there was a professor from New Zealand, Dr. Arthur Miller.
[MILLER, ALEXANDER, Lecturer in Religion. M.A., University of New Zealand, 1932.
At Stanford since 1950.] And Dr. Miller was a Presbyterian teaching courses on
Christianity. And that was unique in Stanford. There were no—there was only one other
religion course in Stanford. And that was a Dr. Spiegelberg who taught World Religion,
Comparative Religions. [SPIEGELBERG, FREDERIC, Associate Professor of Indian
Civilization. Ph.D., Tubingen, 1922, S.T.M., 1925. At Stanford since 1942.] And he

5

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

taught Spiritual Practices of India. And I took both of those. I mean, you know, how
exciting to think you could learn things like this in college. So when Dr. Miller came, he
offered, as I recall, four courses in Christianity. He was brilliant. And I took all of his
courses. So I ended up minoring in religion. And he was a brilliant man. And then there
was a professor from Minnesota in Political Science, Political Theory my senior year.
And there was a Dr. Vucinich who was History of the Near East, I think it was.
[VUCINICH, WAYNE S., Associate Professor of History. A.B., California, 1936, M.A.,
1937, Ph.D., 1941. At Stanford since 1946.] It was a long time ago. But generally
speaking, I respected my professors; I was always questioning. But I felt this was kind of
a huge investment for me and my family, so I tried so hard to get whatever I could out of
it, and spent most of my time in academics; not much social life.
Sparks: How did you celebrate your graduation?
Trego: I don’t, was so exhausted I could hardly remember. My parents came
from Denver and at the last minute, I didn’t know where to put them. I hadn’t made
reservations for them. I’d forgotten, and they thought I had and I thought they had. And
so, we could hardly find, everything was filled. We finally found some little motel down
on El Camino, whew. We managed to get settled. And then I remember these robes
were so hot. We were sitting there kind of sweltering in the sun, and all of us kept
thinking “Gosh, we want to get, you know, let’s get this over with.” But I can’t
remember feeling very excited or, you know, even exalted over it. It was like “It’s all
over, thank God, we did it.” And that was mostly it, you know.
Sparks:
Trego:
about?

What were you dreams as an undergraduate?
Dreams of what? You mean my physical dreams? What was I dreaming

Sparks: I guess you could interpret that as you will, but I think the question is
going to ask about, sort of aspirations that you had.
Trego: Well, as an undergraduate, I hadn’t any specific aspirations except to
come to Stanford, learn all that I could, and utilize it. My father was an engineer and I
was taught that, you know. I was taught not to fool around too much with too much
knowledge and too much information that you couldn’t apply and you couldn’t learn to
use. And I had that as part of my background, just sort of built in. And that was my
dream here, was just to gain as much knowledge as I could about many different subjects
so that whatever I might do, I could do well. I thought originally, along the way, I would
be a doctor, but I dropped that.
Sparks: In college, you decided not to be a doctor?
Trego: Um hmm, yeah. I think three percent were women in med school. I took
one or two courses in med school; they allowed undergrads to do that. And I found it so
unpleasant; it just was awful for a woman. And I just didn’t want to put up with that. It

6

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

wasn’t that important to me, you know, to be a doctor, and I couldn’t afford it. It was
getting awfully expensive. I was not an academic type person. You know, I wasn’t the
type of person that wanted to stay on and on and on in college. I was getting impatient to
get out and do something.
Sparks:

What did you go out and do when you graduated?

Trego: When I graduated here, I went to Paris, France and pursued student life
there. It was called L’Institut des Sciences Politiques or we called it Science Po,
Sciences Po. It was a Political Science Institute at the University of Paris, the graduate
school. And I got an equivalent to a doctorate there. And came back because I wanted to
be in Foreign Service, I’d thought, by the time I graduated here. I wanted to help start
this United Nations. I wanted to help start this UNESCO that somebody had heard about.
I wanted to be, maybe, in the Foreign Service where I could go overseas and meet, you
know, new wonderful people. And to do that, we had to have French, because French
was ‘langue internationale,’ it was the international language. And really it’s amazing,
now it’s English. I mean, everywhere you go in the world, it’s English. So I went to
Paris, studied -- I’d had a minor in French here at Stanford -- so I went to Paris to study
French and to get a degree or some kind of recognition with that Institute, which I
thought would set me up for something important. I wasn’t quite sure what.

Can you tell us a lesson you learned at Stanford?
Lessons?
A lesson, yeah.
What do you mean by lesson? I had lots of lessons.
Yeah.
What do you suppose they mean by that?
I’m not sure, maybe a life lesson?
Well, let’s see, I don’t know if this is right.
You don’t have to answer the question…

Trego: I’m trying though. I’m trying to be conscientious. I can’t think of any
general principle really that was new to me here.
Sparks:
Trego:

How about, did you have any escapades while at Stanford?
Escapades?

7

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

Sparks:

Yeah, escapades like, I don’t know, a funny or humorous story.

Trego: Well, I’m sure I did but I can’t remember anything in particular. You
know, like an anecdote?
Sparks:
Trego:
Sparks:

Exactly.
A humorous anecdote?
Yeah.

Trego: There were a lot of them, but I have nothing particularly to illustrate my
generation or the circumstances. I did go join the Stanford Alpine Club because I was
from Colorado, and I sort of needed to get out from this campus; it was quite constricting
for me. Sometimes I felt like I was suffocating. So we would go to Yosemite and climb.
And then sometimes we would campout, you know, skiing or mountaineering, ski
mountaineering. And I suppose that was one of my most enjoyable, one of my more
enjoyable activities, because these were wonderful people in the Alpine Club. I think
there were only three women. But the men were so dear, so kind, and taught us to use
ropes and do technical climbing, and treated us as equals. We weren’t always treated that
way at Stanford. I always felt the women were kind of looked down upon a little
academically. I had one professor tell me, my counselor, which I won’t mention, but I
really got to dislike him so much because every time I left him, I was crying. He was
discouraging me from doing anything.
And I told him I wanted to go, maybe, into the Foreign Service; he was in the Political
Science Department. I didn’t quite know -- something. And he said “Well, you’re a
woman; you will not have any opportunity except if you want to marry someone who’s
with the Foreign Service, who’s more outstanding than you.” He actually said that. So I
left crying again. But I felt—and then he said another time, “Well, if you feel that you
want to get into a man’s world then you must think like a man.” And I felt that, as
women, we were—our way—women are uniquely feminine, we think in a certain way.
And I did not feel at Stanford that the woman’s way of thinking, functioning, the brain
functioning even, that it was recognized, really. So we spent a lot of our time sort of
trying to figure out what these men wanted, you know, not physically, personally, but I
mean professors and the courses. And I think that wasn’t unique to Stanford. I think that
was the whole world. But I do remember that was a problem for me. It was kind of
being, I felt put down because I was thinking like a woman, quote, unquote.
Sparks:

What do you enjoy most about coming back to Stanford?

Trego: I enjoy learning about the university, what’s going on. I’ve tried to stop
and visit with students to see what they’re doing, what their future is. I did not enjoy
coming back to my dormitory, Lagunita, because, you know, now it was coed and there
were no flowers around, and the fountain out in the front that used to, you know, used to
be so lovely and beautiful, was sort of dead, stopped, you know; trash was sort of thrown

8

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

in it. There wasn’t the lovely dining room that we had, good food, nicely served. It was
very gracious; I enjoyed that. When I saw it this, I didn’t see that experience anymore. I
felt that it was kind of like just a dorm. But I enjoy the ‘classes without quizzes’ [reunion
activity]; I guess those are my favorite. In fact, I didn’t even go to the game yesterday. I
gave my ticket away so I could attend a class that I had just learned about.
Sparks:

Which one?

Trego: On Founding Fathers. Of course I’m still in political science. I’m a
journalist. I’ve taught in college; I’ve taught American Government and Journalism and
some English in a couple of small colleges. And so this was on the Founding Fathers,
and it was well done.
Sparks: What do you think about how Stanford has grown and changed since you
were an undergraduate?
Trego: Well, frankly I’m a little disappointed because I hear ‘research, research,
research.’ The president gave his presentation at Mem Aud and mentioned the word I
don’t know how many times. And whenever we’re asked to contribute money, it’s
toward research. And then we’re told that seventy percent of the Stanford money comes
from federal research. Well, when I was here, I was a member of the Student Council. I
was elected to Student Council. We had dinner with President Wallace Sterling, who was
a magnificent man, just wonderful. And I remember President Sterling saying essentially
this, that Stanford had little or very, very little research money from the federal
government or any government, and that this was something he was very proud of. And
the he wanted to keep it that way as he could, because that’s how we could retain our
academic freedom. That’s how the university could choose to do whatever research it
wanted and to study what it wanted.
And those were the days of the McCarthy Era when other universities were having to
swear to what they called a Loyalty Oath. And Stanford didn’t, because we were
privately owned and because we just didn’t take money from the government. And
therefore there were no strings attached. And I’m very disappointed. I go back to the
Political Science Department, and I gave a couple thousand dollars once, you know, to
get a new building and books. And the humanities: I never hear humanities mentioned;
liberal arts, social sciences. As alums coming back, it’s just, you know, ‘research,
research.’ And when they’re talking about research, they want their Nobel Prizes and
their science awards and so on. And I can see that because, my heavens, imagine what it
costs now to keep this campus going and to fund all this research. But I’m a little
disappointed that this school, a private institution, has become so reliant on federal
money. That bothers me.
Sparks: What is your favorite memory from campus, from your time as a
student? Or do you have a favorite?

9

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

Trego: Well, it’s hard to say, my gosh, so long ago, a memory. I can say, “Well I
really enjoyed Lagunita.” I enjoyed the graciousness and the humanity of that lovely
dormitory. And we had such good food. I guess that was pleasant surprise, not thinking
college would have good food, you know. And we had—I looked forward to the meals
and to being with friends at the table. And I [was] very serious; I had no roommates, I
always had a single room so I could study, because I really wanted to study hard and I
did. So that was the social time, over meals and visiting. And then I think, actually, I
enjoyed going to San Francisco. I enjoyed the area because, again, coming from
Colorado, this was all quite exciting to me.
Sparks: How about a least favorite memory?
Trego: I guess my least favorite was that counselor all the time, when I would end
up hoping to have some counseling and would end up crying. I guess that was very
unpleasant.
Sparks: Well, is there anything else that you would like to share in particular?
Trego: You mean memories of Stanford?
Sparks: Memories of Stanford or what have you. I have gone through my list of
questions.
Trego: Uh huh. I admire the people who have been so dedicated to the original
structure that Leland, that the Stanfords established. I really think that this university has
created a unique place among institutions of higher education. And I think it’s taken
incredible dedication and a lot of funding, but a lot of very, very capable people to carry
this on. And I think that’s what impresses me most about the university. I went ahead
last time I was here, I went to the historical museum but I picked out the Will and Jane
Stanford’s statements, and the original statement of the university. And I felt that the
university was really diverging from that because the original goal was to train good
citizenship; that was it basically, to train good citizens, for California students primarily.
And to train, to think well, to be active, knowledgeable, active in humanities, so on. And
the university has certainly diverged from that.
Sparks: How so?
Trego: Well, again, I feel that the main emphasis from what I can see, I keep saying
over and over are the graduate schools now. And again, basic research because these
prizes, Nobel Prizes, others, really bring additional money, additional professors,
additional research. So I believe that’s the thrust of it, and I don’t think that the Stanfords
had that in mind at all. But it’s a different era.
Sparks: They had more in mind, students, don’t you think?

10

STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2008/CHARLOTTE TREGO

Trego: I think it was the tradition throughout the United States, maybe the world,
certainly Europe and United States, where a student was a scholar and you trained – a
student was trained to be scholarly. And social adjustment wasn’t all that important,
although being civil, you know, Civics: government you studied used to be called Civics.
And that’s what a student was: improve the mind, you know. But Stanford always had
professional training, pragmatic approach, which was very important. And the Stanfords
did not want a religious association with the university as the Ivy League schools: many
of them had started out as church schools. And Mr. Stanford said no, he wanted these
students to be scholarly and pragmatic, to be civilized, to contribute to their community
and to be good citizens. And I’m not saying it isn’t being done now, but it appears to me
that it certainly isn’t quite the emphasis it used to be. I think that there’s a lot -- I see
more emphasis on technology and technical training. And—but then, I’m only here a few
days.
Sparks: You’re coming from Colorado, right?
Trego: Um hmm.
Sparks: Oh, okay. Well thank you.
