 Evan Faulkenbury: Today is June 13, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m here with Janelle Basham at the Liberty Godparent Home in Lynchburg, Virginia. So to begin, Janelle if you could tell me a little bit about where you were born and your childhood. Janelle Basham: Okay. My life at the very beginning is very different from where, obviously, I am right now. I was born in Vineland, New Jersey so I am actually at heart a Yankee, but grew up there in the beautiful Garden State and come from the all-American family. My mom was a nurse, met my dad in nursing school, and I have a sister that&#8217;s five years older than me, so pretty normal childhood. I went to the Jersey Shore growing up, went to private Christian school, and enjoyed, as a child, riding my bike through the neighborhood. I was the only German in my all-Italian neighborhood. So, it was really neat, the culture that I grew up in. I thought everybody had this experience growing up. I&#8217;m so thankful for having those experiences. EF: So were your parents, or what generation came from Germany? JB: Honestly, I&#8217;m not really sure. Going back, let&#8217;s see, my mom&#8217;s grandmother was actually&#8211;. I would call them Amish. Anybody would call them Amish from looking at them, but they were actually called River Brethren. EF: Okay. JB: My grandmother broke away from it, so if you were to see me I don&#8217;t have a lot of jewelry on, I don&#8217;t wear a lot of makeup, and I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s come down through the generations. EF: Okay. JB: But I drive an SUV, not a horse and buggy. EF: [Laughs] JB: Then my dad actually grew up in a very poor home in Danville, Pennsylvania. My mom was in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Then after nursing school they moved to Vineland, New Jersey and my dad got a job at the Vineland hospital. It was called Newcomb Hospital. So, yeah; that&#8217;s the nutshell of my history that I really know. EF: Well, I&#8217;ll ask about more. Do you know why your grandmother left the River Brethren? JB: I&#8217;m not really sure. They don&#8217;t really talk about it. She&#8217;s very, very private, even today. She&#8217;s extremely healthy and she&#8217;s in her nineties. But her family understood that it was a dying religion. My whole family is wired that you push for better, you have goals, and they knew that if she was going to be successful that she would have to marry an English person, so that&#8217;s what happened. She was sitting on some fence, eating ice cream, and my grandfather drove by, and they were married pretty quick after that. EF: Oh, wow. JB: They lived for years, up until like ten years ago, maybe five minutes away from the family farm. Yeah, it&#8217;s super cool, so cool, and I only have one picture of my great-grandmother, because they don&#8217;t want pictures taken. It&#8217;s a whole different life than what we live now. EF: Right, right. Just keeping on track with your grandparents, can you tell me a bit about what influence they had particularly on your life growing up? JB: Oh, wow, huge. Huge. My grandfather, if I could be half the person that he was I&#8217;d be thrilled. Him and my grandmother were always giving to charities, giving without asking anything in return. He was a financial planner, I believe, for the government, so the wisdom that he had: I wish I could have picked up on it before he passed away, about eight years ago. They were always traveling and they were so&#8211;. My grandmother is still so devoted to family. Family was number two. God was number one, family was number two, and the consistency that they&#8217;ve shown their entire family, whether it&#8217;s a birthday, Valentine&#8217;s Day. I&#8217;ve always gotten a card. My kids, the great-grandkids, have always gotten a card. Every year we go on a vacation together and my grandmother, I think she&#8217;s ninety-three now, every single year she, because her husband was so wise with his financial planning, pays for the entire family to come together. At Christmastime or Thanksgiving we all come together. That&#8217;s family coming in from Florida, California, Virginia, I mean we&#8217;re coming from all over, but that to me speaks volumes on: this is what&#8217;s important to her. So that&#8217;s the foundation of who we are. EF: And then you said your father worked&#8211;. Can you talk about his work and his relationship to you? [He worked] in a hospital? Was that right? JB: Yes. My dad&#8217;s awesome. He grew up in a very poor home. His dad passed away when he was fifty-two, I believe, of a heart attack, so I never knew my grandfather. My grandmother was a spitfire. I mean she told it like it was, and there was no questions asked. You knew exactly how she felt about everything. She would come stay at our house for about two to three weeks every summer. I loved it when Nana came because we would walk up to the Wawa or wherever for ice cream, and she had these great stories about living through the Depression, how she eloped with her husband. It&#8217;s crazy, because I never knew my grandfather, and I know so much about him from the stories that she shared and she passed down. His name was Jack. Now, looking back, I think, oh, that&#8217;s kind of creepy, but she used to talk about him like he was here. He was still a huge part of her life. EF: Right. JB: Unlike my mom&#8217;s side of the family, they were dirt poor, so, so poor, and she never took anything for granted. [She] never had a driver&#8217;s license, always lived in an apartment, and her kids took care of her financially after her husband died. But that&#8217;s probably where I get my little spitfire personality from, so I appreciate that about Edith so much. My dad was second born. He&#8217;s the youngest, he&#8217;s the baby, and he&#8217;s such a fun guy to be around. His laugh, I mean once he gets started it fills up the whole house when he starts laughing. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s ever had piano lessons and the man can sit down and play by ear. EF: Oh, wow. JB: He&#8217;s phenomenally gifted when it comes to his hands. So he&#8217;s a nurse-anesthetist. He just retired last year, which he&#8217;s super excited about. My parents, they&#8217;ve always lived this crazy busy life of him being on call or these long hours, and so it&#8217;s really neat now, in their older years, that they&#8217;ve been able to slow down. They actually moved to Lynchburg to be closer to my family and the grandkids, obviously. EF: That&#8217;s great. JB: So my dad&#8217;s side of the family was very different than my mom&#8217;s side of the family, where you had the wealthy and the not wealthy, and I gained such an appreciation for both. I think that&#8217;s impacted my life in many, many ways as I deal in my career now where I can deal with the whole spectrum and appreciate the differences that we all have. EF: Right. So you detailed your father. Can you give a bit more information about your mother and her influence on you growing up? JB: Yes. Okay, so my mom is&#8211;. Wow. I don&#8217;t even know how to really describe her. She&#8217;s a very complex person, and I mean that in a positive way. EF: Sure. JB: My grandfather, being this planner, going through wars, he told her after high school that she had to have a career. If something were to happen to her husband she had to have a career. So she went off to nursing school and she hated it. Still to this day if she sees blood or if one of the kids is sick she gets queasy. So her nursing career was actually working in the files at the hospital, and then when I finished high school she went to Liberty University for a master&#8217;s and got her master&#8217;s in counseling. EF: Oh, okay. JB: So she is exactly where she needs to be now, helping other people through issues and planning and helping them make positive choices in their life. My mom is&#8211;. She is the result of my grandparents, where we had this quiet, meek grandmother that was a submissive woman and this strong grandfather, so trying to balance that I&#8217;m sure has been hard for her, growing up and figuring that all out. But family is so important to her, just like it was to her parents, so she&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s in the kitchen baking with the kids and playing Uno and all those games with the kids while my dad will pull my son aside and be like, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s go work out in the garden.&#8221; Both of my parents, but especially my mom, it&#8217;s very important to her to leave a legacy and to do that through the grandkids and her own kids. EF: That&#8217;s great. [Could you tell me a bit about your educational experience growing up,] what stood out and the biggest moments in childhood, adolescence, high school? JB: Okay. So I went to a small private school growing up. I don&#8217;t really know why I went to a Christian private school. Well, I grew up in New Jersey and we went to a church, Faith Bible Church, and they were very much Word of Life oriented and I would think to them probably public school was almost a scary place to send your children to. EF: So the church itself was conservative theologically? JB: Yes, extremely. So under that leadership my parents decided, we&#8217;re sending the girls, because I have an older sister and we both went to this Christian school. So our classrooms were very small, maybe fifteen to twenty kids in it, so I was there from kindergarten up until sixth or seventh grade. Academically I struggled. I would think now I probably had a learning disability or something that made it so hard for me to process the words that the teachers were saying, where I&#8217;m more of the hands-on learner like that. So it was really hard because it was expected of me that every week you learn your Bible verse, and I struggled through little things like that. But I&#8217;m such a social person. I loved those small classrooms. I&#8217;m still a part of the Facebook page, or whatever it is, for Cumberland Christian School. But it was a really neat experience, being in that setting. Then through some different things that had happened my parents decided to slow down, whatever that means. So in 1989 my sister graduated high school from this Christian school and came to Liberty University and we pretty much dropped her off at school and we moved. So we left New Jersey and we moved to Dunn, North Carolina, which was an absolute culture shock. It was crazy, for so many different reasons. I found myself all of a sudden in advanced classes. EF: Were you in middle school at the time? JB: Yes. It would have been my last year of middle school, I believe. So I found myself in advanced classes, which was so strange to me because I struggled in my last school and then all of a sudden, hey; I&#8217;m in AP classes. I couldn&#8217;t understand anyone because of the dialect, and a lot of my peers were almost frightened of me because I had such a strong South Jersey dialect and they&#8217;re thinking I&#8217;m some mobster kid. But, it really was a whole different way of life. I grew up in this conservative church and then I moved to the South, and what I&#8217;ve discovered through the years is that different areas have different rules when it comes to churches and religions. So I found myself totally confused about, okay, I&#8217;m not supposed to listen to rock-n-roll music, but then I moved to the South, and girls and guys can&#8217;t swim in the same pool together and they&#8217;re supposed to wear culottes. So it was total overload, and by my tenth grade year of high school I found myself in a predicament where it was almost an internal battle of&#8211;. I couldn&#8217;t even figure out what right from wrong was. Again, great parents, and I never knew how to communicate with them in a way to say, &#8220;What does the Bible say about this? I don&#8217;t care what this pastor says or what this person says.&#8221; But it was very confusing. My parents have always been super involved with the church and my dad has usually played some part in leading the music or playing the piano. My mom was always my Sunday school teacher or a Sunday school teacher, or working in the youth, so church was a huge priority and I never wanted to mess up. Once I got into high school I loved being in public school. I was like, &#8220;Yeah! This is my freedom! I&#8217;m not having to memorize Bible verses anymore.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t the fact that I didn&#8217;t enjoy reading the Bible or memorizing those Bible verses; it was just hard. It was a hard process for me to figure out. So Janelle, as middle school[er], I looked very different in high school and started dibble-dabbling a little bit in things that I knew were wrong. But I also didn&#8217;t care because God would forgive me. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d always learned. Really it was that internal battle and it was a fight with myself. What&#8217;s right? What&#8217;s wrong? Finally I decided I&#8217;m going to do what&#8217;s right for me, and God will forgive me, and life will end up okay in the end, and everyone will be happy. My sister graduated from Liberty University with, I believe, a 4.0 GPA, so in some ways that was a slap in the face for me, like why can&#8217;t I get those grades? While I was learning about mercy and grace by passing algebra with a D, my sister is graduating college with a 4.0, so that was hard for me at the same time to process. I was very athletic, enjoyed also the social aspect of high school. I had a lot of freedom because the moment I could get a job I went out there and got a job and saved every penny, because that&#8217;s what my grandfather taught me to do. So when my friends were limited on what they could do, going out and shopping or buying their first car or whatever, I had that there because I had saved up from the minute I was born. So I had more freedom in my mind than a lot of my friends where they were worried about, &#8220;When I go to college how am I going to survive?&#8221; I had my college fund, and that wasn&#8217;t anything that somebody had given to me; it was something that I had worked for. So, my life pretty much hit rock bottom my junior year of high school. Do you want me to go into that? EF: Yeah. That was probably going to be my next question&#8211; JB: [Laughs] Okay. EF: &#8211;but you&#8217;ve already gone there, so please keep going. JB: Okay. My junior year of high school I would consider myself probably one of the popular people. Unlike a lot of the individuals that I went to high school with, race wasn&#8217;t a big deal to me because growing up in South Jersey, where it was like the Puerto Ricans and the Italians that had issues with each other, I didn&#8217;t realize that the blacks and whites had issues down there. Or maybe I did but I thought they were ridiculous. So that was just something that I couldn&#8217;t really figure out because in my head the Civil War had happened and everybody was equal. This is how it should be. But that&#8217;s not how life was in this town, and this would have been in 1992, 1993. Now, looking back at that town, it was a very small Southern town and there were railroad tracks that went right through the middle of it. I hope it&#8217;s not the same way today, but on one side of the tracks was the African American community and on the other side was the white more predominant individuals, and I never noticed that until I moved away. But I had no problem hanging out with black people, white people, whatever, and that&#8217;s what made my life so fun. I didn&#8217;t care. I wasn&#8217;t racist. I had friends that were racists and it didn&#8217;t faze me. I thought, &#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re idiots. They&#8217;ll get over it. In a few years I&#8217;m out of this town. I don&#8217;t care.&#8221; So, I found myself &#8211; and this is funny &#8211; running all the time. I guess I was running in my head away from all the rules that I had put on myself, and the church had put on me, that I found myself physically running a lot. So I joined the track team. I was maybe one of four people that were white on the track team, and that&#8217;s where I found my niche. I loved it. I loved hearing my feet pounding on the ground, the wind, bopping my ponytail back and forth, and I would put my Walkman on and put my headphones on and off I would go, and I loved that feeling of freedom. I continued to party though, on the weekends. I was never, ever, ever truthful with my parents, and I was such a good manipulator, coming up with reasons for why I needed to go over to this person&#8217;s house, or, &#8220;I&#8217;m hanging out with this person,&#8221; and again that internal battle was horrible, horrible. I had a good friend and he was on the track team. He would tutor me often in French because I was struggling with French so bad, and he had a great personality. He had an amazing smile. He could always make me laugh and that attracted me to his friendship so much. But the problem was that he was black, and so people used to say, &#8220;Oh, that would be so great if you would date him, but he&#8217;s black.&#8221; I remember thinking, &#8220;That&#8217;s crazy. I can&#8217;t even wrap my mind around that.&#8221; So we started a friendship, a very intense friendship that we almost kept hidden from everybody because it was inappropriate, for his culture, for my culture. There was one evening where I was at a party, I started drinking &#8211; apparently I&#8217;m a lightweight &#8211; and I found myself in a very bad situation and neither of us stopped, pretty much. That evening&#8211;. Let me back up a little bit, because this is important about my mom. EF: Sure. JB: I have a praying mom, and growing up I was embarrassed by it. I was frustrated by it. Now I am comforted by it because I know she&#8217;s praying for me every day. But she knew I was going through a big rebellion and she knew I was going through a hard time, which is why she&#8217;s a counselor today. It was graduation night my junior year of high school, and I told her, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Mom, I want to go out with Karen. I want to go to graduation and then we&#8217;re going to go hang out at this person&#8217;s house.&#8221; And she said no, and I did not like that answer. I wasn&#8217;t a brat, I had a 10:00 curfew, I was respectful, but this night I was going out, doggone it. This woman was not going to stop me. So she said no, and there were tears and screaming on my end. She never screamed. She finally sat down on her bed and she said, &#8220;You know what, Janelle? If you need to go out that bad tonight, you go out, but tonight you&#8217;re in God&#8217;s hands.&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Peace out! See you, woman. I&#8217;ll be back whenever.&#8221; So I went out that night to graduation and after graduation there was a party, and me and this guy got together. It was my first sexual experience and it was the night that changed my life forever. My mom apparently didn&#8217;t sleep the whole night. She knew something very bad was happening. I went back to the party after this event had happened ,and I pretty much stood in the shower and bawled my eyes out. My friend came in and she said, &#8220;Is everything okay?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No. My life is not okay. My life is an absolute disaster,&#8221; and I just cried. And really my tears were crying out to God, saying, &#8220;I am such a mess, and I can&#8217;t do this. You&#8217;ve got to be in control. I cannot handle my life. I am following you. I am ready to go out in the mission field. I will never do this again. I&#8217;ll never drink, I&#8217;ll never curse.&#8221; I was ready to be a nun or something. He, the next day, got on the bus for boot camp and I went on with my life and thought, &#8220;Alright. I&#8217;m going to be serious about going to church. I&#8217;m going to pray every day.&#8221; It was summertime, I got a job, because I was saving my money, and it was a new babysitting job. I found out about this job through a family in our church. This family in our church had recently gone through and shared their journey with the church, their journey of infertility. It blew my mind when I babysat that child, the child that they had adopted through this place in Lynchburg where my sister had gone to school. They had adopted a little boy through Family Life Services, and I remember holding him one night and being blown away that somewhere in the world was a woman who would do anything to trade places with me, because I was holding her son. So from the same family I found out about this babysitting job, and every single day the kid would cry, and was colicky, and had allergies, and so they had to give it special milk and it would spit up all the time. I would sit there and I&#8217;d be like, why am I watching this bad, bad baby? The parents were so stressed out that they barely went grocery shopping so I ate cold cuts every day, and lost my mind every day, and was exhausted every day and got to the point where I was physically sick. Every morning I&#8217;d get up to go to work and I&#8217;d feel queasy and go to work, and I&#8217;m like, this baby is just so bad! Like, what would I ever do if I had a baby this bad? Then it started to hit me. Hold on. I&#8217;m getting sick every morning. I&#8217;m exhausted at night. I went to Wal-Mart an hour away from where my family lived and actually shoplifted two pregnancy tests because, you know, ooh! What if somebody saw me buy these pregnancy tests? I sat on the floor in my bathroom, it was a cold tile floor, and turned my music way up so my parents wouldn&#8217;t hear me in the bathroom. I think in each pregnancy test box was like two or three tests and I took every single one and all of them came back positive. I sat on the floor and bawled my eyes out because, here I was, absolutely alone, and I knew that this was going to absolutely destroy my family, not only the pregnancy. So you have those dynamics of my family dealing with Janelle being pregnant but also the community: Janelle&#8217;s pregnant with a biracial child. What does this mean for my parents, for my family? So immediately I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay; should I abort? Then everything will go away. Life will be back to normal. God will forgive me again.&#8221; I had no desire, no desire at all to pursue that option. I confided in my best friend, the one who actually knew about my sexual experience that night, and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m pregnant.&#8221; She really encouraged me to abort. Financially I could have done it. I could have gone to Chapel Hill and had the procedure done, I believe without my family even knowing. I didn&#8217;t really look into it that much. I think she did. But I knew that wasn&#8217;t what I wanted for my life or for my child&#8217;s life, and if my parents kicked me out then my parents kicked me out because I knew I had that savings. I knew that I would be okay for a few years. Through some strange events I grew up really quick and got to the point within three or four weeks that I told my parents that I was pregnant. My sister is absolutely amazing. She drives me crazy sometimes, because she&#8217;s definitely the perfect one, but she was the one that I first told about the pregnancy. And at that time she never drank alcohol, and probably never said a cuss word in her life, so for her, her whole world came crashing down when her little sister got pregnant. Then the evening that I told my parents, that was the night that my whole family changed. There was the night that Janelle changed and then there was the night that our family changed. Going through the process of telling my parents, when they didn&#8217;t even know that I had been sexually active, and then to find out that it was a biracial child: everything that I thought they would do they didn&#8217;t even bring up. They didn&#8217;t care that this child was biracial. They cared about me and my health and the baby&#8217;s health. They did ask who the father was and they knew who he was because they came to all my track meets. The night that I told my parents he actually called the house, which was very strange because he never called the house, and he heard about my pregnancy from my dad. EF: Wow. JB: Yeah. It was a horrible night, but when my mom said, &#8220;Okay, Janelle, what are you going to do? Abortion isn&#8217;t an option,&#8221; which I was relieved to hear. I knew they wouldn&#8217;t want me to pursue that. I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to go to the Liberty Godparent Home.&#8221; I knew about this place because of little nuggets in my life before. My sister had done her Christian service. While she was at Liberty University she did her Christian service at the Godparent Home. My mom had actually come and toured the home a few years prior for a young lady in our church that had gotten pregnant. So with no knowledge of this place, other than those two things, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the Godparent Home.&#8221; This was before people had laptop computers and the internet and all this stuff, so I had no clue what I was signing myself up for. I just knew I wanted to get out of that town and I wanted to get out quick. So I&#8211;. Well, let me go back to that night. My dad, who is, I would assume, six-two &#8211; he&#8217;s a big guy &#8211; he came in that night, and I thought, &#8220;My life is over. My dad&#8217;s never going to talk to me. My mom&#8217;s so disappointed. I think my sister&#8217;s passed out from stress somewhere.&#8221; My dad came in and he turned on my light, and I was laying in my bed and he said, &#8220;Can you sit up?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, gosh, he&#8217;s going to slap me across the face or something.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I love you. I&#8217;m going to take care of you. I&#8217;m going to take care of this baby,&#8221; and he gave me the biggest hug, and I knew right there that was absolute, unconditional love. When you asked me about my dad, I can&#8217;t even describe the man, because I knew that he was getting ready to fight for his daughter. Look, I&#8217;m almost tearing up here. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s Father&#8217;s Day this weekend. EF: That&#8217;s true. JB: My whole family changed. My perspective of the church changed. Grace, mercy, unconditional love, all that stuff that I heard about from the pulpit, everything fell into place really quick. So, that&#8217;s my ugly part of my life. EF: Well thanks for sharing. Well, can you tell me a bit about your experience here at the Godparent Home, coming through it? JB: Oh, yes, I can. Wow. That&#8217;s really hard to put into words. When I came to the Godparent Home I was terrified. I was seventeen years old. I&#8217;d just turned seventeen years old. We pulled up to the Godparent Home and it wasn&#8217;t at all what I expected. I rang the doorbell, my parents were with me, and this girl opened the door and I turned around to my dad and I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do it. I cannot do it.&#8221; The girl in front of me was&#8211;. She was huge. Now, what I found out later was that she was overdue, so seeing that young lady and seeing that stomach, it terrified me. I was such an avid runner that I was so tiny, I was like a hundred pounds, and thinking, how can my body even handle carrying that big baby? But it was very welcoming, very loving. I had one roommate, and young ladies come and go while I was there. But it was such a great time in my life. It was that safe haven that I needed during my pregnancy. It was 1993 when I got pregnant and I had decided to come to the Godparent Home, and they worked with us &#8211; well, with everyone &#8211; on the education because education is really important. My mom went into my public school and said, &#8220;Janelle&#8217;s going to go away for a while and we need to figure out getting her transcripts and all of that,&#8221; and of course gossip went through that town so quick, and pretty much the principal said something to the effect of, &#8220;This is so sad,&#8221; and then she said, &#8220;For the birth father.&#8221; And my mom stood there like, &#8220;What does this have to do with him? This is my daughter.&#8221; In one way or another, and I don&#8217;t know the whole conversation, I was pretty much asked not to return to that school. So it wasn&#8217;t because I was a troublemaker, I was never in trouble; it was because of my grades. I can only say it was because I was carrying this biracial child. So I have experienced racism in a whole different way than most people. When my friends found out and their parents found out, in some ways I was shunned, because parents didn&#8217;t want their daughters hanging out with me because they might get pregnant by a black man. And I thought, &#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re so ignorant if that&#8217;s what you really think.&#8221; I knew I was the talk of the town. My parents were obviously the talk of the town because how could they control the family if they can&#8217;t control me, or whatever. So, knowing about the Godparent Home was such a great option for me. I wanted the best chance for this kid that I was carrying and I knew that that town was not the best chance. So I came to the Godparent Home. When my parents dropped me off I made the commitment to my dad, and really both of them, that I would be honest, not only with the counselors but I would be honest with myself in making a plan for this child, and my dad said, &#8220;I want my baby back,&#8221; meaning he wants his daughter back. So I was at the home from August 24 of 1993 until February 24 of 1994. My time at the home was emotional and happy and sad and all these emotions. I was figuring out what was going on with my body, living with&#8211;. At one time we had fifteen girls, at one time, from all across the US. We had a girl from Alaska and girls from Virginia and everywhere, coming from all different backgrounds. It was a melting pot of all these women who had that one common factor of a teenage pregnancy. So we would sit around often at night, waiting for the phone to ring, to see whose parents or boyfriend or whoever was going to call. Parents would come up on the weekends. The rules were strict but they were rules that I could live within because I knew these people cared so much about me. While I was in the program it became very evident to me that parenting might not be the best option for my child, and it wasn&#8217;t so much about me, or my family, or financially what I could do; it was solely about this baby. I had one ultrasound during my pregnancy and the baby&#8217;s legs were closed so I didn&#8217;t know if it was a boy or a girl, but I had names picked out, and I loved feeling this baby kick, and I had decided I was such a strong and healthy person I was going to deliver naturally. But I was also growing up really, really fast, and by my seventh month of pregnancy I had to sit down and really evaluate my life and think about that baby that I watched and how that was such a bad experience for me. What would I do if that child that I was babysitting, when I found out I was pregnant, if my child was born with colic, and I knew I wasn&#8217;t equipped. Then I looked also back in my life and realized time and time again, even from when I was a little, little girl, adoption had been a part of my life, over and over again. Going back to New Jersey, I sat on the front porch one day with my mom and this limo pulled up and all these people got out of this limo, which limos in my neighborhood weren&#8217;t too strange because [the Atlantic City casinos] would come pick up people in my neighborhood. But it was my neighbors, and they got out of the car and they had a baby. My mom sat there and talked to me about: they&#8217;re adopting, the baby&#8217;s home with them now. So from a really young age adoption was something that I was almost comfortable with and I was exposed to in really interesting ways. So at seven months I started to pursue an adoption plan for the baby. It was overwhelming to think, okay, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a boy or girl. I don&#8217;t know if the father of the child is going to contest. I don&#8217;t if my parents are in agreement with this. But it was one of those things where I had to do what was best for her and I decided that adoption was probably going to be the best. The father of the child was nice, that he would call me every so often, but he went to college. He wasn&#8217;t ready to be a dad, and I had such a great dad that that&#8217;s what I wanted for this baby that I was carrying. EF: Sorry to interrupt, but was the father supportive of your decision to go to the Godparent Home and supportive of what you were deciding while you were here? JB: He really didn&#8217;t have a say. I didn&#8217;t have a school to go to, and me being seventeen years old, and he was at boot camp and then went to college. It was like, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re being taken care of,&#8221; that kind of thing. He also wasn&#8217;t at all invested in me as a person. There was no relationship. It was just a friendship that went way too far, and then, oh my gosh, now he has this responsibility. So for him it was almost like, &#8220;Whew! I don&#8217;t have to deal with this.&#8221; And he was dating, and once a week or whatever he would call. He was not in agreement with an adoption plan and he was very verbal, saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re never going to give away my kid.&#8221; Or, &#8220;My blood,&#8221; that&#8217;s what he would call it, &#8220;My blood,&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s disgusting, to call this baby your blood.&#8221; But it was something that, I loved this child so much that I was going to go ahead with my plan, and my prayer was specifically &#8211; and I would pray this all the time &#8211; &#8220;God, you&#8217;ve got to close every single door so I know exactly what I&#8217;m supposed to do,&#8221; because I could have parented. I had a place to live. I had my parents&#8217; support. Financially I could have done it. But when I looked at being a mom, I wasn&#8217;t ready. I wasn&#8217;t grown up and stable. He wasn&#8217;t grown up and stable. I would be moving back to this Southern town where she&#8217;d be the talk of the town and I was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do that to this child.&#8221; So in February I actually had a massive fight with the birth father on the phone and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve chosen a family.&#8221; Back then the adoption caseworker would tell me about a family by reading the home study, and as soon as I heard about this one couple I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221; I had no clue why. There were things that stuck out about this family that I adored. The dad was super involved. Mom was going to be stay-at-home. They had no debt. They were Mennonite. Priorities were in place and I thought, &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s what I want someday, for me, a husband that&#8217;s so involved and can&#8217;t wait to be a father and wants to be that Super Dad.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what I couldn&#8217;t give this child. So, when I found out about Barb and Dale I made a whole bunch of notes about them and went down the hall and called my parents. They knew that I had been making an adoption plan and they were amazing. They never said, &#8220;We want you to parent,&#8221; or, &#8220;We want you to consider adoption.&#8221; They said, &#8220;You need to do what&#8217;s right for this child.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t even say, &#8220;You need to do what&#8217;s best for you,&#8221; it was always about this child. It was an amazing experience to go through childbirth. I had a massive fight with the birth father on the phone a few days before my due date, and told him that I was going through with this adoption and if he was going to fight me then he would just have to fight me. And he said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve bought all this stuff,&#8221; and, at seventeen years&#8211;. I was so frustrated with him. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you do what I need you to do?&#8221; He told me that he&#8217;d never let it go through, and I could not see us being positive parents for this child. I would have fought him until the day I died to make sure that she was safe, being taken care of the best way possible. So I got off the phone that night, went and lay down, and cried myself to sleep. Halfway through the night I woke up and my stomach was hurting and I was like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve cried too much,&#8221; or whatever. I got up in the morning and the pain was still there. Now, looking back, I almost have to say it was because of that fight that I went into labor. But I did, I went into labor that day. My mom was able to come up for the delivery. I had a natural delivery. I had a volunteer from the Godparent Home there with me. It was a beautiful experience. I did it natural, I felt like Super Woman. Things have definitely changed in regards to adoption. They held her up &#8211; it was a girl &#8211; and I saw that she had all of her toes, I saw her hair. I&#8217;m sure she didn&#8217;t open her eyes but I saw that she was beautiful, and then they took her out of the room. It was a neat time for me and my mom, to be there together, because now we were working on rebuilding trust. The hospital was such a hard experience. That&#8217;s where I learned really how strong I was. I already knew physically how strong I was, but now emotionally. Holding this little girl, and I named her, and seeing, gosh, this kid looks just like me, and realizing, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ve made this plan, I&#8217;ve picked this family. I&#8217;m not the best option right now.&#8221; That was really hard for me to process, but I had to keep reminding myself that it&#8217;s not about me; it&#8217;s about her. So about a month later everything was final and she was ready to be adopted into her family. The father of the child got the paperwork at college and got so angry that he threw the paperwork in the trash. What he should have done, if he wanted to stop the adoption, was sign the paperwork and send it back, but I found out later that he was so angry that he threw it away in the trash and he literally threw away his parental rights to that child. So twenty-five days after she was born she went to her new home. February 24, two to three days after delivery, I went to my new home. My parents are so awesome that while I was at the Godparent Home my dad got a new job, and so I went to a new home in a whole new part of North Carolina so I could have a brand new start. EF: Where at? JB: In Eden, North Carolina, so right across the Virginia border. My dad got a job at the hospital there, and that&#8217;s when me and my mom started working on our relationship. To finish high school she homeschooled me, which is crazy. I don&#8217;t see myself as a home school kid at all. But I graduated, and the best gift that I&#8217;ve ever gotten was when I got a call from Julie Clinton, who at the time was the director of the Godparent Home, and it was approved through Jerry Falwell that I would get a full scholarship to Liberty. EF: Wow. JB: So I left the Godparent Home February 24, and came back in August, and I was a residential student, six months later. EF: Wow. That&#8217;s quite a story. JB: So that was my senior year. EF: Yeah. That&#8217;s not the kind of senior year a lot of people have. Maybe it would be more appropriate to cycle back to this later, but I want to go ahead and ask now, after adoption did you have any contact? What&#8217;s been your relationship since then? JB: Great question. Adoption&#8217;s changed so, so much. At the beginning they called it &#8220;mediated,&#8221; so that meant that I could write letters though the agency. I didn&#8217;t know their last name. I didn&#8217;t know where they lived, and vice versa. They didn&#8217;t know where I lived. But I knew that this family was very interested in having communication with me as the birth mom, so for eight years that&#8217;s how we communicated. Then every so often we would have a conference call, and since I was at Liberty I would come over to the office, they would set up the conference call. And I would talk to Barb, the adoptive mom, and she&#8217;d fill me in on what Catherine&#8217;s doing and the progress, and, &#8220;Oh, she must be like you in this way,&#8221; and, &#8220;Her wrists are so skinny. Where does she get that from?&#8221; It was so neat, being respected by this woman who could have feared me and could have been terrified of me, but she desired to have that relationship. And I&#8217;ve kept every single letter, every single one of them. All of the pictures that they sent are in this yellow photo book that I have. Eventually, as she sent pictures, there was one picture that had a Yellow Page book in the background and I figured out where they lived, so that was really cool. I know where my daughter is! That was so neat. So I knew where she was. I knew their names were Barb and Dale. I chose them also because they had an older daughter that was also biracial and also adopted. Her name is Jenny. So like I had that older sister, I wanted that same thing for Catherine, so that&#8217;s one of the big reasons why I chose them. When she was about eight laws changed and I was able to meet Barb and Dale face to face, and I was terrified, terrified. It was all set up at a restaurant here in Lynchburg. They could move towards opening the adoption, but before they did that they wanted to meet me first. I had no clue what to expect. I didn&#8217;t know if her dad&#8217;s voice was going to be super high, what was my hair going to look like, were they going to like me, and it was again another amazing situation that God blessed me with. We connected face to face. It was so amazing. Then not long after that, I was actually reunited with her at a park, and ever since then we&#8217;ve had an open adoption. She&#8217;s twenty now. She is amazing. She looks just like me, just a little tanner. She&#8217;s incredible. If I would have known that it would have ended up like this I would do it all again. I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing. There&#8217;s a lot of hurt and pain that I went through, but to see her healthy and happy, and now in love and enjoying life, that&#8217;s all I wanted for her. EF: That&#8217;s great. Thanks for sharing that. Well maybe, kind of a different avenue of discussion, if you don&#8217;t mind, but I wanted to get more of your story. Can you tell me about coming back to college, going to Liberty, and your experience at Liberty? JB: Oh, it was so strange, because the Godparent Home at the time was over on Rivermont Avenue by the hospital. So now I was in another part of Lynchburg, and I had this whole brand new start again. I kept reinventing myself. One of the first nights that I was at Liberty we walked around the circle, which was a circle of dorms, and people just walked around it at night because we didn&#8217;t have Facebook and cell phones and all that stuff. So people would go out, and that&#8217;s how we met. I really think it was the first night that I was at Liberty: I was walking around the circle with my roommates and came up on this group of guys. We started talking and found out we were in each other&#8217;s brother-sister dorms and, gosh, there was this one guy that was so cute, but he was from South Carolina. He was such a redneck. And my self-esteem, in that regard, was really low where I thought, &#8220;Who would ever want to date me?&#8221; I had stretch marks. I had gone through all this racial junk and thought, &#8220;Obviously I&#8217;m going to have to marry somebody from the North because I&#8217;ve had this biracial child.&#8221; But he was so cute, he was. Going back to school, I didn&#8217;t tell people. That was such a private part of my life that I knew people did not understand, especially young ladies my age. They were crying at night because they missed their boyfriends at home, and I would cry in the shower because I missed my daughter. There&#8217;s a big difference. But I was so excited to be at school and be a normal teenage girl again, so I loved it. I loved that experience. Started dating this one guy that I met from Arizona and it was just bad. Then by my sophomore year [I] sparked that friendship up again with the guy that I met that first night. We started dating and really within a week or two, he pretty much said that I was the woman that he was going to marry. And I told him my whole story and he was okay. Now we&#8217;ve been married sixteen years in August. EF: That&#8217;s great. JB: So it&#8217;s so crazy that this girl from New Jersey who has all this baggage ended up marrying this redneck guy from Greenville, South Carolina. But that pretty much sums up my whole life, that it&#8217;s so crazy and ironic, all in one swift motion. EF: What did you study at Liberty? JB: I was really confused. I was like, &#8220;What do I want to do?&#8221; I had just gone through this traumatic event in my life and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I want to go change the world!&#8221; So I wanted to be like my parents and I wanted to get into nursing school. That didn&#8217;t last very long. So I attempted&#8211; whatever that one class is that everybody fails over at Liberty. Anatomy, that&#8217;s what it was. I took anatomy and I dropped out and I was like, &#8220;Okay, God, this is not where I&#8217;m supposed to be.&#8221; So I knew nursing wasn&#8217;t for me. My sister had graduated with a degree in Family and Consumer Sciences, so I&#8217;m like, &#8220;She graduated with a 4.0. It must be easy. I can do it.&#8221; So I changed my major to Family and Consumer Sciences and I loved it, being in classes, mostly with girls back then, and I took classes in everything from sewing to textiles, and it was this [58:09] that I could study all of this stuff and figure out where God wants me. Let&#8217;s see, it would have been, again, my junior year. Things happen in my junior years of life. My junior year of college I was engaged and we got married in 1998. I was so in love that we decided we would finish our last semester&#8211;. I had one semester left and he had a full year left, so we would get married and then we would finish. God had a different plan, and I&#8217;m extremely fertile, and five months after we were married&#8211;. We decided to take a little bit of time before we went back to school. Five months after we were married I found out I was pregnant, so it took us a little bit longer to get back to school. I started college in 1994 and I finished in 2007. EF: Well, you finished. JB: I finished. In between there I had two kids and I started my career at Family Life Services. EF: Okay. So Family Life Services, was that your first job after being married? JB: Yes. I had a job in North Carolina in a textile plant. I hated it. It didn&#8217;t challenge me at all, and I could have worked up the ladder to management and all this stuff, but I just wasn&#8217;t happy. I knew this is not the career for me. So we were in North Carolina when we had our son and I called my husband, who was working at a Fresh Market in Greensboro, and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ve got to go back to school. I&#8217;ve got to finish, and if we don&#8217;t do it now we&#8217;re never going to do it.&#8221; He said okay, so within a few months we were back here in Lynchburg. I attempted to do one semester and it about killed me being mom, wife, student, working. We were broke. I wouldn&#8217;t touch my savings because that was for an emergency and this was not an emergency. So it took a lot out of us, but both of us finished. I got a job at Family Life Services, which is the adoption agency associated with the Liberty Godparent Home. EF: I see. JB: It&#8217;s the same agency that I used for my adoption. So I worked there as a caseworker for about ten years and then came over to the Godparent Home as the director. EF: When was that? JB: That would have been in 2010. EF: Okay. So for about four years now you&#8217;ve been the director. JB: Yes. EF: Okay. JB: Time is flying by. EF: Yes. Well, tell me a little bit about, I guess first your work as a caseworker and then transitioning that to here and being the director of the Godparent Home. JB: Oh, there&#8217;s so many parts of that job that I loved, probably a few things that I didn&#8217;t enjoy, but being able to work with especially the young ladies. I watched them go through this hard decision of coming to grips with, &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m not the best choice right now, and making that plan.&#8221; Helping them process, &#8220;You are an amazing woman, and just because you&#8217;re making an adoption plan doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re any less than any other mother out there. It just means you&#8217;re a different kind of mom.&#8221; Working with birth fathers supporting the mothers of these kids making those decisions. It was phenomenal to be on the other side of it. Leaving the hospital with these moms, and a lot of times I was the one saying, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;s time to leave the hospital now. This is the plan. We&#8217;re going to discharge the baby now, and you, at this point.&#8221; That was really hard and for the first probably year or two I would go home and cry because it was so raw to me and so real. EF: Sure. JB: But also my clients knew that I was speaking from experience and that when I was saying, &#8220;This is something that you can get through,&#8221; they knew if I was saying that, they could get through it. The one thing that I love is being in Lynchburg for so long, there&#8217;s not a month that goes by that I don&#8217;t run into a family or a birth parent that I worked with. I was sitting at a baseball game the other night with my husband and my son, who&#8217;s fourteen, was playing, and I said, &#8220;Jason, the kid that&#8217;s up to bat, he&#8217;s one of mine.&#8221; It blows my mind to think about working with his birth mom and seeing that kid go up to bat and knowing the love that she put into that decision, and seeing the adoptive dad rooting for that kid. It&#8217;s a beautiful picture. Man, you got me on an emotional day. But being able to have a small part in somebody&#8217;s life like that, it blows my mind. It does. So, when I walk through my daughter&#8217;s elementary school and I see kids I&#8217;ve worked with, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh! This is incredible.&#8221; Even this morning my day started with&#8211;. Family Life Services placed a baby in an adoptive home, and I see it all the time, and now it&#8217;s another family that their life has been changed because of this ministry. EF: As director, what&#8217;s a day in the life of the director of the Liberty Godparent Home? JB: Lots of emails, lots of networking. EF: Sure. JB: Gosh. I wish I could say, &#8220;Hey, this is my job description and this is the only stuff I do,&#8221; but no. That doesn&#8217;t happen. So two or three weeks ago I was sitting at my desk working on emails. Some of the staff was off at a training, and it was just me and the house parent here and one of our young ladies, and she was a couple weeks away from her due date. I heard this scream down the hall and I thought, &#8220;Huh. That&#8217;s not something you usually hear around here.&#8221; Went down the hall, and she had been in labor and been hiding it. For some of these young, young ladies it&#8217;s very scary. She was screaming because she was ready to push. EF: Oh my. JB: So that is a normal day. EF: Right. Wow. JB: Dealing with those intense, high stress moments. [I said,] &#8220;Everything is going to be okay. Do not push that baby out. We&#8217;re going to the hospital right now.&#8221; Got to the hospital, and within twenty minutes there&#8217;s a baby here. EF: Wow. JB: Then they decide to admit her. But the phone could ring right now and it could be a mom that just found out her daughter&#8217;s pregnant, or going out and fundraising because we solely survive off of donations. So all of that&#8217;s on my shoulders, but that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m willing to take on because somebody did it for me. EF: Well, I want to maybe transition a little bit. Since I&#8217;ve heard so much about your story and about the Godparent Home and everything that&#8217;s happened here, I guess I want to try to connect the work of the Godparent Home, and more largely Liberty University, and the kind of conservative evangelical, and political principles that, in my mind, I&#8217;m guessing guides a lot of what happens here in directing women towards adoption and away from abortion as an option. JB: Okay. EF: So I&#8217;m wondering if you can talk to me about maybe your personal beliefs on abortion and then in what sense the Godparent Home &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to find the right words &#8211; in what sense the Godparent Home tries to maybe steer women away from that as an option, or educate her, or however you would term it. JB: Okay, so make sure that I&#8217;m staying on track here, because that&#8217;s a big question&#8211; EF: Yeah, I know. JB: &#8211;that you asked me. So the Godparent Home was founded in 1982 by Dr. Falwell, and the story goes that he was in an airport and a reporter came up to him and said, &#8220;You say that abortion&#8217;s wrong, but what&#8217;s the alternative?&#8221; And this is the alternative. He came home, created the Godparent Home. It was first called Save a Baby Ministries, and I think within a year or two they changed the name over to Liberty Godparent Home, and this truly is the alternative to abortion. So young ladies can come to this program, and we&#8217;re going to help them either make a parenting plan or an adoption plan. So by the time the young lady has called us, she&#8217;s chosen life. She&#8217;s chosen not to pursue an abortion, so we&#8217;re really saying, &#8220;Okay, you&#8217;ve chosen life.&#8221; Maybe she&#8217;s come from a crisis pregnancy center or a pastor or a family friend, and she&#8217;s saying, &#8220;I want to go through with this pregnancy. Now I need help making it all happen.&#8221; So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for. We&#8217;re here to continue with her education, make sure she gets good medical care. With education we are able to work with Liberty University Online Academy, and that is kind of the gem of our program, because there are maternity homes out there, but the one thing that they don&#8217;t have that we do have is that relationship with the university, with the online middle school, high school classes. When a girl come in, she doesn&#8217;t skip a beat when it comes to her education, so we can have a young lady coming in that&#8217;s twelve years old and we&#8217;re able to give her a great education. We work with local counselors to make sure if there&#8217;s other issues going on, which usually there is, that we&#8217;re going to take care of her, not only the whole pregnancy factor. We&#8217;re going to take care of: Okay, you&#8217;ve gone through abuse, you have an eating issue, you&#8217;re a cutter. Let&#8217;s really work on you as a whole person. Then the spiritual aspect of it all too: most girls that come in here aren&#8217;t Southern Baptist young ladies. They might be Muslim. They might be homeless. They might be in the foster care system. But I want them &#8211; and I know it was Dr. Falwell&#8217;s passion &#8211; I want them to see unconditional love in the love of Jesus Christ. So when it comes to our core beliefs, that&#8217;s pretty much what it is. We&#8217;re here to save a life, the life of the baby, [and] change another, which is change that woman&#8217;s future. Okay, so what else is on&#8211;? [Laughs] What else was in that loaded question that you gave me? EF: No, you&#8217;re certainly right on task with it. I was trying to figure out what the Liberty Godparent Home&#8217;s stance is towards abortion, and you&#8217;ve already outlined that. If I understood you right, your position is that you&#8217;re the next step. Unlike a pregnancy center, which might counsel women who are still undecided about what to do, you&#8217;re the next step once they&#8217;ve decided&#8211; JB: Absolutely. EF: &#8211;and then you help them through that process. Then I asked you about your own thoughts on abortion, abortion rights, maybe rooted back into your own first pregnancy, but if there was anything else you wanted to say about that. JB: I&#8217;m probably different than a lot of people that might be sitting in the pews &#8211; well, in the chairs &#8211; over at Thomas Road. In some way I understand why a young woman would do that because it&#8217;s the first thing anybody thinks of when they find out they&#8217;re pregnant, in an unplanned pregnancy. It is the first option that comes up because everything will go away. But the reality is, it doesn&#8217;t go away, and that&#8217;s what society has fed women. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a baby,&#8221; [or,] &#8220;You&#8217;ll have more kids.&#8221; It will impact you forever. I do not believe abortion should be an option for many different reasons and that&#8217;s primarily because of my first pregnancy and because it was drilled into me that, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t even about you, Janelle. This is about this baby, and you have to give her a chance.&#8221; I was on board with that, and I&#8217;ve seen it over and over and over again. These kids that maybe even their birth mom didn&#8217;t want them, they wanted to leave the hospital and have nothing to do with that child, those kids are amazing. And seeing these families that have such a desire to adopt and bring kids that aren&#8217;t biologically connected to them into their family and say, &#8220;You&#8217;re my daughter or son.&#8221; I can&#8217;t say to a young lady, &#8220;Hey, abortion is the way to go,&#8221; and then turn to this family and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that you can&#8217;t adopt because she aborted the child.&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen the beauty of life, and when I look at it from that perspective, it&#8217;s not a woman&#8217;s right issue. It&#8217;s totally about giving that kid a chance. If they want to mess up their life, that is totally up to them to mess up, but give that kid a chance at whatever God created him or her to be. I&#8217;ve seen it over and over and over again where, if someday my daughter comes home and says, &#8220;This is the predicament I&#8217;m in. I was raped. The father of the baby is older, the baby&#8217;s sick,&#8221; or whatever. If God doesn&#8217;t want that pregnancy to happen, let him be in charge of that. I&#8217;ve held a baby in my hand because it was a preemie. It was so tiny. I wish I could remember how big he was. But there&#8217;s a picture of me going to visit him, and his hand fit around the top, top part of my pinky, so my very first knuckle. And now to see that kid in elementary school, you can&#8217;t even question every child has a purpose, and there&#8217;s enough families that will adopt these kids if a woman says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to parent this child.&#8221; There are families out there that will take these babies, so to give that kid a chance. It will absolutely change your life. If I would have aborted, I have no clue where I&#8217;d be. My life probably wouldn&#8217;t have changed. What was so dirty and ugly and horrible: kicked out of my &#8211; well, asked not to come back &#8211; to my high school, friends turning against me. I walked out of this whole deal realizing that God chose me for this pregnancy. Scholarship to college, met a great husband, I have an amazing relationship with my family, my sister&#8217;s still perfect but I wouldn&#8217;t change a thing, even though I went through such incredible hurt. I wouldn&#8217;t change it. EF: I really just have one more question, and it originates out of what you just said about adoption as an option for people. I guess, as someone who&#8217;s intimately familiar with adoption personally and professionally, is there &#8211; I&#8217;m not even sure how to ask it &#8211; is there a way to make adoption easier or more accessible? Because it seems as though, just from stories one hears, it seems like it&#8217;s a process and maybe the narrative &#8211; and maybe I&#8217;m wrong about this &#8211; is that there aren&#8217;t enough potential adoptive families, but you&#8217;re saying the opposite of that. So I wonder if you can speak a bit more about that. JB: Yeah, absolutely. I will tell you, you hear the horror stories. That&#8217;s what people talk about. As soon as people heard that I was considering an adoption, oh, everybody had to give their opinion on it, and their cousin that this happened to, and then I&#8217;d watch a Lifetime movie. Yeah. There&#8217;s so many negative stories out there. There are tons of kids in foster care, and I&#8217;m not at all--. I can&#8217;t speak on behalf of all those kids in foster care. I wish I could. I wish I was more knowledgeable about that. There aren&#8217;t enough families out there that are open to adopting older children, and there&#8217;s a lot of kids sitting in foster care because parental rights haven&#8217;t been terminated and stuff like that. In regards to babies, there are too many families that are hoping to adopt babies. The process is long for adoptive parents, but if anybody wants my kid, I want them to jump through hoops. I want them to prove that financially they&#8217;re ready, their marriage is ready, that they will go the extra mile to show, &#8220;We are going to be great parents.&#8221; I don&#8217;t want it to be an easy process. As for a young lady making an adoption plan, those horror stories scare women who would potentially make adoption plans. A young lady will abort before she&#8217;ll even consider adoption, and that blows my mind because we will hear it time and time again in society, &#8220;I can never give my child away,&#8221; but yet I&#8217;ll abort the child. I never gave my child away. I placed her in an adoptive family, and then I watched her grow up. I&#8217;ve always been a part of her life. She&#8217;s never called me &#8220;Mom,&#8221; I&#8217;m &#8220;Janelle,&#8221; but I&#8217;ve never missed her birthday, I have always sent gifts at Christmas. Yesterday was my birthday and I got text messages from her, and she&#8217;s a part of my life. So that&#8217;s one of the things about adoption that so many people in unplanned pregnancy don&#8217;t realize, is that it&#8217;s a really hard decision to make, but you can be a part of that kid&#8217;s life forever. Catherine will always be a part of my life. She&#8217;s always going to be a part of my husband&#8217;s life [though] he has no biological link to her. But adoption doesn&#8217;t only impact me, and abortion doesn&#8217;t only impact these women. It impacts the generations to come. There&#8217;s something amazing about standing with my kids, and then knowing that I will go the extra mile to do what&#8217;s right for my kids because they&#8217;ve seen it. Adoption has changed my life, my husband&#8217;s life, my parents&#8217; life, my sister&#8217;s life, my niece&#8217;s life, my in-law&#8217;s life. It wasn&#8217;t only about me. It has changed a whole generation of my family. So when it comes to abortion and adoption, I don&#8217;t think people see the big picture of when my daughter someday gets married, it is going to be huge because she has her family, she has communication with her birth father and his family, and then the birth mother and her family. There are so many people that love this one child that I had to make a big decision about, and I made the right decision for her. EF: Well, thanks for sharing everything. Is there anything else that you&#8217;d like to add or anything else that you wanted to clarify? JB: Well, no. Is there anything that you think I need to clarify? EF: No, no. JB: Okay. EF: I always like to give that option at the end, to make sure I&#8217;m not cutting you off prematurely. JB: No, you&#8217;re definitely not cutting me off. I think life is always moving, and when I was facing that unplanned pregnancy, I thought that was the end of my life. And it was such a small hiccup in my life story, and it only made my story better. So as people come across different issues, different struggles, just make it part of your story and make it work and learn from it. If you would have said twenty years ago, &#8220;Hey, someday, Janelle, you are going to be the director of a maternity home, you&#8217;re going to be married to a redneck, you&#8217;re going to have these two kids,&#8221; I would have never even imagined it. But while I was at the Godparent Home, I said, &#8220;Okay, God, you&#8217;ve got to take this, because I can&#8217;t deal with my crazy messes that I made.&#8221; And it was at that moment that I was like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my life. Take it. Do what you want.&#8221; And again, everything that I learned in church and that Christian school came back, and now it&#8217;s real. So now it&#8217;s not going through the motions. Now this is the real Janelle. This is the Janelle that understands unconditional love and God&#8217;s forgiveness and God&#8217;s grace. So for anybody that&#8217;s listening to this, not to give up, because God&#8217;s got so much more in store for me. It&#8217;s an exciting ride and I&#8217;m just along to serve him and continue to impact other people&#8217;s lives. EF: Well thank you so much for sharing. JB: You are welcome...
