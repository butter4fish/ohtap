 Joey Fink: This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. It&#8217;s May 17, 2011. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee with Dr. Lida Barrett. Dr. Barrett, thank you for agreeing to talk with me today. Can we start by you telling me when and where you were born? Lida Barrett: I was born on the 21st of May, 1927, in Houston, Texas. An interesting little story, my father always said that my mother didn&#8217;t say when she came out of the delivery room was it a boy or a girl but she said, &#8220;Did Lindbergh get to Paris? [Laughs] I suspect that&#8217;s more my father&#8217;s story, but I was born the night he flew to Paris. [And if it was true, which I don&#8217;t think it is, my mother was] as convinced that my sister and I should get a college education as she was that my brother should. My mother got an undergraduate degree at the University of Texas in 1912. JF: Wow. Was that unusual, for her to have an undergraduate degree? LB: Well yeah because my father&#8217;s father was a prominent judge but my father dropped out of high school in the eighth grade. He was born in 1882 and so he dropped out in 1900. I think he always thought he would go back to school and go to medical school but he never did, so even finishing college was something in those days. JF: And you said you mother was&#8212;. LB: The University of Texas. JF: The University of Texas and what did she study? Did she work while you were&#8212;? LB: She studied, I think, just a general liberal arts course. She took Greek because she could take Greek and not have to take mathematics. [Laughs] And then she didn&#8217;t work. She did what in those days were called social service work and volunteered at the church and she worked with young women who were living at the YWCA and had, you know, probably moved from the country to town. Then in 1918, which was six years later, the minister at our church was elected the bishop of the Episcopal diocese and so from 1918 until she married in I think 1922 she managed the diocesan office of the Episcopal Church. But mainly she was just a Southern lady. [Laughs] JF: And you said she was determined that you and your sister would get an education? LB: Oh, yeah, she wanted us all to have a college education, and so did my father. He had gone to work for the railroad as an express agent on a train, working for Wells Fargo, and he fell under the train swinging on and lost a leg. After that he managed a freight station for Wells Fargo and then some time, I&#8217;m not really sure when but before he married Mother, the place where he was buying his artificial limbs was going to be sold so he bought it, and all my life he was the owner/operator of the Texas Artificial Limb Company. But I think part of my mathematical interest&#8212;. Of course I grew up before TV. In fact I can remember when we got a Monopoly set when they first came out. But he&#8212; JF: Oh yeah? How old were you? LB: &#8212;loved to play games. He knew fifteen different kinds of Solitaire and we played Monopoly and a lot of games, which I think helped with my math skills. JF: That&#8217;s interesting you bring up Monopoly. I just heard or read somewhere that it was manufactured as a game to promote capitalism. LB: [Laughs] JF: You know, because the Great Depression sort of raised people&#8217;s suspicions about if capitalism was doable, if it was going to be able sustain itself, and Monopoly was sort of promoting this acquisitiveness and capitalist attitude. LB: I never thought about it except it was a good game. [Laughs] JF: Yeah. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t even remember where I heard that. Was it unusual for your mother to expect that her daughters would go on to higher education amongst your generation? LB: I don&#8217;t know. In those days by the time you got to high school people were tracked based on ability or performance or both or something, and most of the people that I graduated from high school with in 1943 planned to go on to college, but that&#8217;s partly because of the way we were tracked. I think, as it is true today, I think that tracking or kids that get into&#8212;what do they call them now? They don&#8217;t call it tracking. JF: Like the advanced placement courses and stuff? LB: Yeah, and things like that, probably tend to come from a pretty good socioeconomic background because I think the failure of the socioeconomic background is part of the reason some kids have trouble in school. But I would say the majority of my class went on to college, the ones I had courses with regularly. Now the situation in Texas was strange in those days. There were only eleven grades before World War II and I happened to skip one so I got out of high school at sixteen, in fact I was barely sixteen. Then Rice Institute went all year round because it had a V-12 program, Navy, so we finished in two years and eight months, so I graduated from Rice when I was still eighteen. We all did. What it meant was that the boys that graduated with us were either sixteen or seventeen so most of them went to college for a year before they were drafted and they had to be, I think, eighteen to be drafted and seventeen to enlist. So pretty much we all went to college. JF: And how did World War II affect your daily life? LB: A lot. Well of course there was gas rationing and we only had one car. This was the days when all the kids didn&#8217;t have cars. I started out taking the bus to Rice from where we lived and I had to change buses and it was a hassle so we got a ration certificate to buy me a bicycle. I never had had a bicycle, partly because of my father and the artificial limb company, and so rain or shine, summer or winter, I rode a bicycle. I don&#8217;t know how far it was but it was a fifteen-, twenty-minute bicycle ride. Of course the men at Rice&#8212;. Rice was a much smaller school then. The men were primarily, after the first year or so, people in the naval ROTC or the V-12 program. Some of them came back&#8212;. I don&#8217;t remember for sure whether we had both V-7 and V-12. Seems to me we might have. There were people who had been in the Navy that came back to go to college and be commissioned so we had quite a number of men students but who was there sort of shifted. I do remember two people, whose names I probably shouldn&#8217;t tell you, who were twins who started with us and they knew they were going in the service and their parents wanted them to go to college and they didn&#8217;t do a darn thing the first year. I think they must have flunked everything. They enlisted in the Navy and the Navy sent them back to Rice. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] LB: And they had to take the same courses all over again while the rest of us made fun of them being a year behind. But of course the other thing that happened, I was co-editor of the very slim high school annual because they weren&#8217;t printing big fancy annuals that year. It was a little paperback. The young man that I was co-editor with when he was eighteen went in the Navy air corps and was killed the first year. There were quite a few people that were killed. My sister-in-law, her stepfather was a chief engineer on a boat, I don&#8217;t know whether it was a tanker or what kind of boat, but anyway it was torpedoed by the Germans and the engineering crew never was found. He probably drowned with the boat. So, you know, there was just a lot of death and destruction. Oh, and I was an air raid warden. [Laughs] JF: You were what? LB: An air raid warden. JF: What&#8217;s that? LB: What&#8217;s an air raid warden? [Laughs] Houston is fifty miles from the coast and the German submarines were out in the Gulf of Mexico picking off boats that came out of the Houston ship channel, or trying to, so Houston had a dim-out all the time. You weren&#8217;t allowed to have outside lights and you were supposed to have shades at night to keep the lights from the city from being there to outline boats. So I was at Rice and I was picked, or volunteered, to be an air raid warden and I had a white&#8212;what do you call it? People don&#8217;t even wear them anymore. They were slacks and a top all in one piece and I think it had something like &#8220;Air Raid Warden&#8221; on the back. Once every week or two I wandered around my six or eight blocks and if people didn&#8217;t have their shades right to keep the light from coming out I&#8217;d go knock on the door and say I&#8217;ll be back in two or three days and if it&#8217;s not fixed by then I&#8217;ll have to cite you. Then every once in awhile, not so often, they would have a full blackout and everything would go out, even the traffic signals, and I was to carry rocks in my pocket and if the streetlights or the traffic signals didn&#8217;t go out I was to break them. JF: [Laughs] LB: Now I can remember once I was standing by one of the traffic red and green lights that hadn&#8217;t gone out, trying to hit it with a rock, [Laughs] and not having much luck, when the all clear came. So being an air raid warden was part of my college career. Oh, one of the stories I told at the Rice banquet that I went to, I took sophomore math with a very famous mathematician named Szolem Mandelbrojt. His nephew was the Mandelbrot that did the fractals, if you know anything about fractals. They&#8217;re a popularized math concept. But anyway, I had the standard sophomore math course and then we had a small section with probably no more than eight of us in which we were talking about the primary concepts of math and I really learned about differentiation and integration and particularly the limit definition. He insisted on class preparation and participation so you did your homework. But one day in June of my sophomore year we were sitting there and the French class down the hall started singing the French national anthem and he said, &#8220;Oh, I bet they&#8217;ve invaded France,&#8221; and he went down and came back and said they had, &#8220;And I&#8217;m an officer in the French army and I&#8217;m gone,&#8221; and that&#8217;s the last time we ever saw him. He left. And of course it was June so the University of Houston was on summer&#8212;Rice was going all year round because they never had had summer school&#8212;so they got somebody from the University of Houston to finish the class. But, yeah, that&#8217;s just part of the war. I can also remember working in the&#8212;. I was a student assistant in the biology lab. I considered biology for a major at one point, partly because Dr. Davies was such a wonderful teacher. I can remember working in the biology lab and hearing that Roosevelt had died, and we stayed around and listened to it for quite awhile and then they locked up the building and rather than try to call somebody to let us out we crawled out a window. [Laughs] Isn&#8217;t it funny what you remember? [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] What were your expectations for what you would do after college? LB: I didn&#8217;t want to teach. [Laughs] I graduated in February&#8212;probably the diploma says March&#8212;1946, and I had sort of planned to take off two or three months because we hadn&#8217;t had summer vacations. We had nine days between semesters. But I applied for jobs as a mathematician because that was my major and I can remember applying at Humble Oil which is a predecessor of Exxon. They wanted me to take a typing test and I wouldn&#8217;t do it. [Laughs] I said, &#8220;Do you ask men who are applying for mathematics jobs to take a typing test?&#8221; I can&#8217;t remember whether they offered me a job or not. IBM offered me a job in Poughkeepsie, New York, but they said I wouldn&#8217;t be based there. It was, you know, you&#8217;d go there six months, and I didn&#8217;t want to go to New York, [Laughs] particularly when I didn&#8217;t know where I&#8217;d be. Then Schlumberger [pronounced shlum-ber-gee, like negligee], the oil well service company&#8212;spelled Schlumberger, where we had hamburgees for lunch [Laughs]&#8212;offered me a job as a mathematician, but they wanted me to come to work right away, so I went to work for them, I don&#8217;t know, within a couple of months after I graduated. I worked for them a year and a half and it got boring because I was doing stuff that became routine and the man who was my immediate boss, I was convinced I was a lot brighter than he was. I think I was right. But anyway, there were four of us in the group, I guess, and Mr. Stratton, who may have been Dr. Stratton, who was my boss&#8217;s boss, I said I&#8217;d like to move to the research lab and really do some real mathematics and he said the only way you can go to the research lab is either to have a graduate degree or do fieldwork and have the experience, and of course we don&#8217;t send women to the field. So I was pretty much thinking about going back to graduate school, actually at Rice, and the Texas State College for Women, which is now the Texas Women&#8217;s University, the department head, who was a woman, called and wanted to know if I was interested in a teaching job because they had had somebody&#8212;. This was &#8217;47 and people were coming back, veterans, and schools were growing and a woman they&#8217;d had on the faculty had been offered a job at the University of Oklahoma and she wanted to go someplace where there was a graduate program. So they were looking for a replacement and they called Rice looking for a woman with a master&#8217;s and Rice, being Rice, said any woman with a bachelor&#8217;s degree from here knows more than somebody with a master&#8217;s from a teachers&#8217; college. [Laughs] So they offered me a teaching job and I wasn&#8217;t sure and I called the University of Houston, partly to see what they knew about TSCW, and they offered me a&#8212;. [Laughs] You know, everything was growing. For personal reasons I&#8217;d lived at home and gone&#8212;. Rice didn&#8217;t have any women&#8217;s dorms, by the way, so I had lived at home and gone to Rice and I lived at home while I was [working] so I thought it would be fun to leave town. [Laughs] I had been dating a young man and we&#8217;d broken up fairly recently so it was just a good time to leave. I should have&#8212;. Well I shouldn&#8217;t either, but it ended up his family became quite wealthy. [Laughs] Anyway, so I left and went to teach for a year in Denton and Harlan Miller, who got a doctorate at Texas in math in the early &#8217;40s, after she&#8217;d been a high school teacher at Hockaday, a very fancy school in Dallas, she&#8217;d gone to Texas. She used to tell me she used to go to Europe every summer, that was one reason for teaching high school, and when the war was on she went down to the University of Texas to graduate school and stayed and got a doctorate. So I was enjoying teaching, which surprised me because I didn&#8217;t think I wanted to, and she talked me into going to Texas to summer school and then I was going to come back and teach another year. Well Texas treated me just like they did her. They offered me an assistantship to stay and she, being the kind of person she was, said not to resign until she&#8217;d found somebody to replace me. So that&#8217;s how I got to Texas, and then I got a master&#8217;s at Texas in &#8217;49 and started dating a fellow graduate student and married him in 1950. JF: So you were living for the first time away from home when you were in grad school at Texas? LB: When I was in Denton, yeah. JF: And what was that like? Where did you live? LB: I lived in a graduate dorm to start with [Laughs] and I guess I&#8217;ve always been a troublemaker. They tried to tell me you had to be in by 11:00 and I was still just twenty but I had been out of college for a year and I said is that a university rule, and the woman said no, but if you come in late somebody&#8217;s going to have to answer the door because we lock up at 11:00. We said, well we can answer the door for each other; you don&#8217;t have to. [Laughs] So we took turns for two weeks staying downtown and coming in every fifteen minutes. I probably was one of the instigators. She gave up locking the door at 11:00. JF: [Laughs] So after that no more curfew? LB: Yeah. Then after I guess the spring semester living in the dorm had its drawbacks; I guess the bath was down the hall, I can&#8217;t remember. Anyway I rented a room in a faculty home that was very close to campus and then I went down to Texas, to Austin, for graduate school and lived in a boarding house which people don&#8217;t seem to do anymore. We got breakfast; we may have gotten all three meals, I can&#8217;t remember. JF: Was it all females living in the boarding house&#8212; LB: Yeah. JF: &#8212;or mixed? LB: And my brother, who was out of the military by then, lived in one on the same block across the street that was all men. JF: Did you like living on your own? LB: Oh yeah, yeah. All of my family was very good about&#8212;. I don&#8217;t even remember ever having a time I had to be in. I guess I was reasonable. Although I can remember that we had a clock that struck the hour and if I would get in say five minutes to 2:00 I would set it back ten minutes so everything would be settled and people would be back to sleep before [it struck]. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] That&#8217;s a pretty good strategy. How did you meet your husband? LB: The first time I think I met him he was teaching a class for Dr. [24:00], his professor, and I was intrigued by the fact that he would write halfway across the board with his right hand and then when he got in front of the board he&#8217;d switch and write with his left. [Laughs] JF: Why did he do that? LB: Well he could use both hands and he wasn&#8217;t standing in front of it. JF: Oh! Yeah, that makes sense. [Laughs] LB: Actually he&#8217;d broken his right arm at one point and he&#8217;d learned to write with his left hand. Anyway, the graduate group was small. When I went there, there was only one other woman graduate student but I think one way I got in with a group of four or five graduate students, not all in math, was that one of them liked to cook and they liked to go fix fancy meals and I had an apartment, [Laughs] so they added me to the group so they could come cook at my place. But I ran around with the bachelor&#8217;s club, the four of them, and he was a part of that group. JF: Did they call themselves that? LB: Yeah. JF: [Laughs] LB: And in fact when we got engaged this was in the days before telephones and stuff. I think John sent Clarence, who had been his roommate&#8212;maybe he called him&#8212;but anyway we have a telegram I&#8217;ve got in my book of pictures from the wedding. The telegram didn&#8217;t say &#8220;congratulations&#8221; or anything; it just said, &#8220;That&#8217;s against the rules.&#8221; [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] Did you think you would continue working after you got married? What were your plans? LB: I had gotten a master&#8217;s in &#8217;49, we got married &#8217;50, and it was pretty clear he was going to&#8212;. He may have finished his&#8212;. If we hadn&#8217;t spent so much time dating he might have finished in &#8217;50, although he says that&#8217;s not true, but anyway he finished in &#8217;51. In &#8217;50/&#8217;51 I took some courses so I could teach high school and I kept on doing the research, but then he took a job with the University of Delaware. The man I started under at Texas is a very famous mathematician who had lots of good graduate students, people that became president of the American Mathematical Society, and a couple of them at least got elected to the National Academy of Science. His first PhD was head of the math department at the University of Pennsylvania so the two of them finagled to get me into graduate school at Pennsylvania and I ended up doing my dissertation with Dr. Kline, [27:14] student, so there was sort of a nice link there. The first year we went to Penn, or that we were in Delaware, I agreed to stay in graduate school only until I got pregnant. I mean if you don&#8217;t get pregnant you get a PhD. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] LB: And that first year I wouldn&#8217;t take an assistantship because the year that John and I got engaged in the spring I had been told that I was at that point instead of being a graduate assistant I was working half time at the defense research lab. It was related to guided missiles but it was a wave guide project and it paid better than being a graduate assistant and I had the applied math background from Rice. They had told me I could have a full fellowship the next year, wouldn&#8217;t have to work, and would make as much as a graduate student, but when we got engaged I got moved to an alternate position and two men got the fellowships. Well they just assumed that when I got married I wouldn&#8217;t finish the doctorate. But anyway, I finished my doctorate before either of the two guys did. But the second year I was at Penn Dr. Kline said, that&#8217;s silly. I just didn&#8217;t want to take an assistantship at Penn and then get pregnant and drop out because I knew what that would do to other women [28:57], so the last two years I had an assistantship and taught part time. Then I got my degree in 1954. In 1954-1955 I did not take a job. I got offered one at one of the women&#8217;s colleges and I wrote back and said I&#8217;m married, my husband&#8217;s at Delaware, and I&#8217;m not interested in moving to New England. Then I ran into Anna Pell Wheeler who was a well known mathematician and retired from Bryn Mawr and she would come to the colloquium at Penn. She said, &#8220;Have you gotten any interesting letters?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re the one that recommended me. You knew I wouldn&#8217;t move.&#8221; She laughed and said, &#8220;Yeah, but they said did I know somebody qualified and I figured you might as well get acquainted with them.&#8221; But anyway &#8217;54/&#8217;55 we went to an expert to try to get pregnant and it just didn&#8217;t work and then John took a post doc at Yale and they have a wonderful fertility clinic and they told us&#8212;. He had had mumps as an adult, a very serious case, and if you have mumps you still have sperm but it kills them off and the chances of my getting pregnant were zilch. Now I might as well tell you the whole story. They told us in doing the examination that he had problems with his kidneys and that he might have something called polycystic renal disease, which is a congenital disease and you&#8217;re born with widespread small cysts in your kidneys and then when you get to be older they begin to grow. So they told us if he had it he&#8217;d have his first kidney hemorrhage at forty and be dead at forty-five, and they said we can tell in two years. So we went up there for the summer semester so they checked that year and then the University of Utah checked the next year and they told us that he didn&#8217;t have it so we adopted three kids in three years and moved to Tennessee. So when we came here the kids were three, two, and a new baby. JF: Wow. LB: Because see &#8217;58, &#8217;59 and &#8217;61, this was before the birth control pill and before legal abortion so a lot of people adopted and Utah was a good place. Single women didn&#8217;t tend to keep babies then so if you wanted to go someplace and be anonymous Utah was&#8212;. Now our youngest child came from a Utah background but the other two, the mother came from California and one came from Ohio. JF: So there was some facility or home? LB: Yes, it was a well known adoption agency. They didn&#8217;t tell us a whole lot of information about the birth parents. So we moved here and we had gone from the year at Yale to Utah where we both had appointments in the math department and then we&#8217;d spent a year, both of us, at the University of Wisconsin. John had a full fellowship at the Mathematics Research Center there and I taught in the math department and did some research with a man named [33:00]. We just had&#8212;well we had the two children. When we accepted the job we only had one. But we had a wonderful woman who had worked for a woman medical doctor and so I was home in the morning and she&#8217;d come in the afternoon and look after the kids. We had things scheduled so that John could be home in the afternoon if he needed to and I was home in the morning. Then when we moved to Tennessee he had a regular job and I was acting associate professor part time because of the nepotism rules. JF: So you could teach but you couldn&#8217;t be a full professor. LB: I&#8217;d been an assistant professor when we went to Utah and I was an acting assistant professor because we were both in the department but Utah&#8217;s nepotism rules back in the &#8217;50s were much more lax. We had two men in the department who had the same grandfather but different grandmothers and their grandmothers were married to their grandfather at the same time&#8212;this is Mormon Utah&#8212;and so they were really willing to hire both of us. But when the people [34:41] assistants professors when I did became associate professor I wanted to be&#8212;. I guess I was a lecturer with assistant professor. I wanted the associate professor equivalent rank and they wouldn&#8217;t give it to me. I just had to be a lecturer. So when we came here I wanted an associate professor&#8217;s rank and I felt like I deserved it so they got it for me. Well when we got the third child, after we&#8217;d accepted the jobs&#8212;we seemed to do that. [Laughs] After we agreed to go to Wisconsin we got [35:23]. But anyway, I thought well with three kids I was going to stay home and then John said they went all the way to the board to get the acting associate professor title. So we had a wonderful housekeeper and we did the same thing; I was home in the morning and he could be home in the afternoon if he needed to be. The housekeeper was black and I really wonder, anybody as smart as she was&#8212;not particularly well educated but smart&#8212;in this generation wouldn&#8217;t be a housekeeper. Anyway, in 1963 we&#8217;d only been here a couple of years, December of &#8217;62&#8212;is that right?&#8212;yeah, he was forty, and in March of &#8217;43 [sic] he had his first kidney hemorrhage and he died&#8212;. He was forty-six in December and he died in January, so Yale had been right. So I had a five-year-old&#8212;. No. They were five, four and three when he&#8217;d gotten sick and ten, nine, and seven when he died. He became department head in 1964 so I got kicked off the faculty. He was going to do it just one year and then it turned out his health was failing and it was easier to be department head than teach a class. Then he went to the University of Utah in early October 1968 and died in January of 1969. In 1968 he had an early kidney transplant and it just didn&#8217;t work and the artery where it was transplanted ruptured. But anyway, I went back to the university and immediately got tenure the first time, and I had been working at Oak Ridge and continuing to publish. I originally published in the area of my dissertation which was topology and then I had my first PhD student just before I got kicked off the faculty and while I was at Oak Ridge I went back to doing applied [math]. I didn&#8217;t work full time; I worked two to ten days a month. I went back to doing really applied math and then there was some topology which is pure math that was used looking at porosity in reactor fuel. So when I came back to the university I had been publishing steady in something a little bit different so they gave me tenure, and they wanted to promote me and I wouldn&#8217;t let them for a year because that was a period of big growth and the university had hired all these people that didn&#8217;t know me and I wanted to be back for a year before I was promoted. So the dean held it up in his office and then I was promoted to full professor. This is 1970. I was the third female full professor at the University of Tennessee outside of home ec and nursing. JF: Wow. LB: And that&#8217;s disgraceful, I think, but anyway. Then John had been department head and somebody else was department head for awhile and then in 1973 the man that had been department head was supposed to serve another semester or another two semesters but for a strange reason the University of Alabama offered me their department head&#8217;s job. If you want to know the strange&#8212;? [Laughs] JF: I do. LB: I was at a math meeting, I think it was in Dallas, and John Neff, who was head of the department at Vanderbilt was a friend&#8212;no, not at Vanderbilt, at Georgia Tech&#8212;and I was sitting there and a guy from the University of Alabama that I knew came along and said, &#8220;We have to find a female candidate for department head,&#8221; and John said, &#8220;Interview Lida,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got three kids and I&#8217;m not going to move,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ve got to interview a woman so if I buy you a [40:23 shrimp cocktail] can I interview you?&#8221; so I said sure. It was Bill Gray. We didn&#8217;t really talk much and then I think he called me and said I&#8217;ve got to have a resume or they won&#8217;t let me count you, so I sent the resume one day and two days later they invited me to interview and I interviewed and they offered me the job. Well the dean&#8212;. JF: Do you know why they had to interview a woman? LB: Affirmative action. JF: Okay. LB: That was just required by the affirmative action office, and when Bill was interviewing me he didn&#8217;t really think I was a candidate. He was just trying to&#8212;. But anyway&#8212;. JF: Even though he was a friend of yours and he must have known your qualifications&#8212; LB: Oh yeah, but I had said I&#8212; JF: &#8212;he still was just kind of dismissing it? LB: &#8212;wasn&#8217;t interested. I went down there though and interviewed. But they called the dean at Tennessee and he called me and said, &#8220;I tried to get you to be an associate dean after you were on that curriculum committee and you wouldn&#8217;t do it and now you&#8217;re talking about going to Alabama,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, but they say I don&#8217;t have to work full time in the summer and the job you had would have required me to work full time in the summer and with the three kids I didn&#8217;t want to do that.&#8221; So he said, &#8220;Well would you consider being department head here?&#8221; So he interviewed the whole department, they didn&#8217;t even list the job, and then the man who was department head was willing to step down early and so I became department head here. JF: What were your experiences like as a woman in a leadership role over what I assume must have been a department predominantly male? LB: Yeah. We had&#8212;. I guess two women were [42:34 wives with doctorates], we had two women instructors with masters, and it seems to me we had one woman, I can&#8217;t remember for sure&#8212;. Oh, one of the things that would irritate me was if they would have a department heads&#8217; meeting and I missed they always knew it but if a man missed, you know, one man out of a group of fifteen or more is not noticed but one woman, you can&#8217;t get away with skipping things. JF: [Laughs] LB: I think that there were a couple of men that were unhappy that I was made department head. One of them was, I think, just sexist. The other one thought he was going to be the next department head. He had a wife, still does, and four or five kids and I think he thought women&#8217;s place was in the home. The man that had been department head, well he said to me once&#8212;. I took over the department and we had a tenure case in court, a guy that hadn&#8217;t gotten tenure, and we had an EEOC case, and one reason I agreed to do it, I didn&#8217;t think the department that John had built was going well. Even before I became department head I called on one of my neighbors in the next office and said you&#8217;ve got a reduced teaching load and you&#8217;re the citywide tennis champion and you&#8217;re spending more time on tennis than research and when I become department head, I&#8217;m telling you ahead of time, you&#8217;re going to have to start publishing or you&#8217;re going to have to have a bigger teaching load. That didn&#8217;t make him happy because I ended up raising his teaching load. The dean said there was a reaction to my first year because I was busy straightening things out. Now the EEOC case, one of the people in the law school had a hearing and the woman&#8212;. You want this kind of information because you&#8217;re talking about women. She had her doctorate and was an instructor at a really good school when her husband was a graduate student. By the time he graduated and they got married she came as an associate professor and he came as an assistant professor and she was a much better mathematician. So, he didn&#8217;t get tenure; they didn&#8217;t even consider her for tenure. If her husband didn&#8217;t get tenure she&#8217;d be gone too. JF: Oh gosh. LB: So the first thing I did when I took over the first of July was have a meeting and deny her tenure. They both had one more year. Well she filed an EEOC case because she knew that she hadn&#8217;t been considered, but she had come to direct dissertations in one area and then they&#8217;d had two kids and she really hadn&#8217;t done what she was hired for and this came out in the hearing so she agreed to withdraw the case. Now the guy that didn&#8217;t get tenure and took it to court got tenure in court and when I had a meeting after he got tenure the dean came and said he&#8217;s going to be back in the department and you&#8217;re all going to have to get along with him. One of the guys in the department said, &#8220;I make a motion that we realize that the courts have the final decision on this and we will accept it,&#8221; and that&#8217;s all the department would do. But anyway, it was interesting. JF: The guy who got the tenure in court, what was his claim, for discrimination? Was he an African American? LB: It was complicated. He hadn&#8217;t done a lot and when he didn&#8217;t get tenure he went to the University of Chicago and got an MBA, but his wife did have tenure here and they published two or three papers that year, and of course everybody felt she had been the author. He just hadn&#8217;t done as much as was expected for people to get tenure and of course it was kind of tough that his wife got it and he didn&#8217;t, but interestingly he ended up with kidney problems and after I was retired back here I saw him one day and he stopped me and he said, &#8220;You know if your husband had been here one more year he would have gotten me straight and I would have gotten tenure.&#8221; So John was really trying to push him. JF: Were you involved with the women&#8217;s task force&#8212; LB: Yes. JF: &#8212;that formed in&#8212;? LB: That&#8217;s what got the dean&#8212;. Well I was on the curriculum committee that revised the general arts and science curriculum. That&#8217;s when the dean tried to get me to be associate dean. But the women&#8217;s task force&#8212;was that &#8217;71?&#8212;&#8217;71 or &#8217;72. The associate vice president came and wanted me to chair the task force. The man that came as president, Archie Dykes, smart guy, he said he had three campus problems that he identified: One was the role of women, one was the role of minorities, and one was housing. People were pushing for co-ed dorms. He didn&#8217;t want to spend his first year on those problems, he wanted to be more on the academic side, so he appointed three task forces, one on women, one on minorities, and one on dorms, and somebody came and asked me to chair the task force. It must have been &#8217;71 because I said&#8212;it could have been &#8217;70&#8212;that I was just back, that I had been publishing in a different area, that I wanted to get back into my research area, and I didn&#8217;t want to chair a task force. I didn&#8217;t even want to be on it; I really wanted to get back into my career. Well he comes back a couple of weeks later and said we&#8217;ve looked into it and there&#8217;s a woman professor in home economics that really wants to do this, we think, and if you won&#8217;t do it she&#8217;ll do it. Well that wasn&#8217;t the right person. Somebody in home ec has a different view, where most of the faculty was women, and I said you&#8217;re blackmailing me and he said yes, so I chaired it. That&#8217;s probably part of the reason I got to be department head. We had a good committee. I was trying to remember. I can&#8217;t remember for sure. I kind of think we were all women, which is a mistake. It should have been partly men. I can remember there was a woman who was really pushing the issue and they&#8217;d just advertised for an ombudsman and the first time we met she said we have to send a protest because they advertised for an ombudsman and only got male candidates and they should have advertised for an ombudsperson. Well I thought that was the wrong place to start but they agreed and we made them put out a new announcement and got two women candidates, and the language I think was a part of it. But anyway, we had hearings and from 12:00 to 2:00 one or two days a week I could see people in my office or somebody else could see them, and we learned all sorts of things about the way women were treated. One of them, the university at that time had an aquatic center and they would check out sports equipment for people to play volleyball or something and a woman came and said the sports equipment&#8217;s checked out in the men&#8217;s locker room and we can&#8217;t go in there. So I called over there and they said, oh, that&#8217;s all right; the women that come to play [52:58 always have a date;] they can go get it. JF: [Laughs] LB: So we got that changed. There&#8217;s a full report on it. We got a lot of things done. We looked at the women&#8217;s salaries; they were out of line. We looked at regulations that affected women more than men. JF: What kind of regulations affected women more than men? LB: Oh, women&#8217;s dorms and I don&#8217;t remember what the differences were. I guess the men didn&#8217;t have to keep the same hours. I&#8217;m not sure. That&#8217;s been a long time ago. But I think the thing that started really pushing it was the whole issue of salaries for women, but there were a lot of other issues that surfaced. JF: Was there a huge discrepancy between male and female salaries? LB: Oh yeah, yeah. We documented all that. When I became department head we had three instructors&#8212;we may have had more than that but I think we just had three&#8212;and the two women got raises and the [54:24 man instructed]&#8212;. They were MA people that usually taught&#8212;we were on quarters&#8212;fall and winter quarter and we might not need him in the spring. In fact he ran a contracting business. But he didn&#8217;t get a raise. [Laughs] So when I became department head a couple of years later I noticed the two women&#8212;. His name was Eugene Doss but I looked&#8212;we shouldn&#8217;t put his name in there&#8212;I looked up his full name and his first name was Carol, C-a-r-o-l, so I listed him in my budget as Carol and gave him a raise and they didn&#8217;t question it. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] It sounds like there was, in the math department at least, a lot of marriages, that people came in together. LB: Yeah, and it&#8217;s in that book. I think it&#8217;s in that book. It may be in Pat Kenschaft&#8217;s book. I&#8217;m pretty sure it may be. At the time that we started going to national math meetings we knew twenty-five couples that both had doctorates in math, or were both math faculty; maybe some of them didn&#8217;t have doctorates. We counted them all up one time. I think it&#8217;s because women that stayed active had husbands that wanted them to stay active or they were in situations where they could stay active. JF: I read in the book, in Patricia Kenschaft&#8217;s book, that you told a story of a couple that had gotten married but they were registered&#8212; LB: [Laughs] JF: &#8212;under two different names. LB: Is that in Pat&#8217;s book? JF: Can you tell that story? LB: Yeah. We went to the national math meetings in Ontario. In fact the math meetings were so small in the &#8217;50s that they would list in the bulletin everybody that came to the meeting. Well I wouldn&#8217;t get listed, so we registered separately. JF: You wouldn&#8217;t get listed as&#8212;? LB: As attending, yeah, and the people that came&#8212;. JF: Just your husband would get listed. LB: Yeah, and so we registered separately and the other couple registered separately and she kept her name. So they gave us both, my husband and me, single rooms and the two of them single rooms. [Laughs] We complained and they didn&#8217;t want to do anything about it so we took the bed out of my room and put it in John&#8217;s room and took the desk out of his room and put it in my room and to heck with the [57:24 dormitory] people. No, I didn&#8217;t get listed before that. JF: So that would have been in the &#8217;50s. LB: Yeah, that would have been &#8217;53 or &#8217;54, probably &#8217;53 before I got my degree. JF: What kind of changes or differences did you notice in your female colleagues that were starting their careers in the &#8217;70s versus the women that you knew in the &#8217;50s? LB: Well certainly the people&#8212;. Harlan Miller, who was head of the department at TSCW, came back there partly because she had a brother that was a banker in town and she was a Texan, but she was a very good&#8212;. I don't think she ever published anything much but her dissertation, but as good a mathematician as she was she should have gone on to a doctoral program. She went to, I think, Winthrop College, some female college, for a year before she came back, at least a year before she came back to Texas, and I think women tended to mainly go to women&#8217;s colleges for jobs, which was good for the women&#8217;s colleges, and of course they came after me. Even recently&#8212;one of the books on women mathematicians can tell you&#8212;but the Ivy League schools didn&#8217;t tend to&#8212;. Well of course most of them had stayed not co-ed, but they tended not to have women faculty. Now one reason we went to Utah is they were happy to have us move around the edge of the nepotism rule and were happy to have a woman faculty. Then when we came here I guess&#8212;. I was trying to think if there were any other women on the faculty here when I came. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t remember. The couple I was talking about came&#8212;. I think John hired them. Women were only five percent of the PhDs in the &#8217;50s and by late 1990s, early 2000s, they were thirty percent, so partly it was the scarcity of women but partly where women were put in women&#8217;s jobs. JF: I talked to some women who got advanced degrees in the &#8217;50s and they mentioned to me that because there were so few women it was hard for them to be part of the social life of their department. Do you have any stories or experiences with that? LB: Yeah. Now one of the things is that the advantages of being a couple, of course, was that the social life tended to be around couples, so I didn&#8217;t have those problems, but when I became department head&#8212;. On the announcements I used my full name so it was clear that the head of the department was female, and we sent out posters to attract graduate students so we got quite a few women applications partly because of that, but when I wrote letters of reference I&#8217;d just use my initials. I inquired of the graduate students how they picked their thesis advisor. I was still keeping an eye on what was happening in my field. They said, oh, one of the best ways to get acquainted is to play on the department basketball team. There was intramurals and the math department for some reason had always had a good basketball team. So I said well how many girls on the team? Oh we don&#8217;t have girls on the team. I said, okay, then how do the women find a dissertation director [1:02:33]? Well they hadn&#8217;t thought about that. So I said well are there any girls on the other teams, and they weren&#8217;t even sure. They didn&#8217;t think so but they didn&#8217;t think there was a rule against it. But the girls could be cheerleaders. JF: [Laughs] LB: Well I decided&#8212;. Most graduate students in those days drank beer, girls included, so we started having a Friday afternoon 4:00 gathering at the local joint drinking beer and I would be sure the girls came along. JF: And this was at Texas State University? LB: No, this was here when I was department head. JF: Oh, okay, when you were department head. LB: Yeah. When I was department head is when I started being concerned about how the women found [advisors]. Then the next year I was smart enough to hire a women who had been a college basketball player and had actually played on a semiprofessional team in Europe and she came back to get a master&#8217;s. Well all of a sudden [Laughs] we had a woman on the basketball team. JF: [Laughs] LB: But I think that&#8217;s a problem, certainly it was more so in the &#8217;70s, because you had to look for a way faculty and graduate students made contact, and, you know, part of it was in classes. It should be. JF: Did you have any complaints or issues with sexual harassment? LB: Not here. I had a wonderful arrangement with teaching. Dr. Eaves, who started teaching at the university in 1955, I think before he even had a doctorate, and this was 1970 so he was eighty the first year I was department head, and he said, &#8220;Can I keep an office and teach?&#8221; This was when you had&#8212;. Was he eighty? No, he was seventy, I guess. Yeah, he would have been seventy. That was when you had to retire at seventy; you don&#8217;t have to anymore. I said, &#8220;Sure, we&#8217;d be delighted to have you, but I can&#8217;t pay you.&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;Oh, I just want to keep teaching.&#8221; He was a wonderful teacher so I said, &#8220;I tell you what. I&#8217;ll trade you the office if I can put up a sign that students with teaching complaints see you.&#8221; People knew he wasn&#8217;t on the regular faculty and he certainly wasn&#8217;t the department head and he handled the teaching complaints from students. I suspect, in fact I know, there was some time that women felt like they weren&#8217;t treated fairly, but Ed took care of all those. JF: And you were a single mother during the &#8217;70s when you were doing all this. LB: Yeah. JF: How did you balance that? LB: I had a student, I knew her mother through the Episcopal Church, and she was from Morristown and maybe her mother and I were both on the board of the Episcopal Student Center. Back when I was working at Oak Ridge I hired her to be there after school because they were all in school by then. She borrowed John&#8217;s car because he was&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know. Anyway, I had her, and then when John died she kept his car so she was there after school; wonderful. She was a freshman or a sophomore and she worked for me until after she got her master&#8217;s degree, and she could stay with the kids. She must have&#8212;. Hmm. Yeah, she must have been working for me when I was working at Oak Ridge. Yeah, she was, because when John would get sick in the middle of the night and have to go to the hospital and life was complicated I could call Margaret and she&#8217;d come stay with the kids and they knew her well enough. We tried to give them some understanding of his illness. In March of &#8217;68 his kidneys were getting worse and worse and I unexpectedly inherited five thousand dollars out of a family estate. So we took the summer off, took the kids, and spent the summer in Europe, both to have the quality time with them and then try to explain to them that their father was going to have a kidney transplant that probably wasn&#8217;t going to work. So we had two and a half months together. It was good. JF: Where&#8217;d you go in Europe? LB: Can you believe? This was when Europe on Five Dollars a Day came out and we took a boat to Europe, tourist class, of course, landed in Denmark, drove over to Sweden to rent a car because if we had rented it in Denmark&#8212;it was a car from Denmark&#8212;we&#8217;d have had to pay different tax. [Laughs] Anyway, we drove down through Europe, Germany, Austria, south of France, up through Belgium, Holland, then we flew to England and my sister and her husband were in London so we spent two weeks in London and two weeks touring with them, and we took the ocean liner The France home. JF: I&#8217;m kind of curious. You were there in 1968, the summer of 1968? LB: Yeah. JF: I&#8217;m curious if you, in conversations with Europeans, if they asked you about being from the South or if they asked you about some of the civil rights protests and demonstrations that were in the news, and of course &#8217;68 was King&#8217;s assassination and there were some urban riots. I was wondering if that ever came up. LB: We tended to stay in places in Europe on Five Dollars a Day that were bed and breakfast and John was fairly fluent in German and I knew enough French to [1:10:09 rent] and talk very little, so we didn&#8217;t do a lot of talking to people. I had enough German to pass the German exam for my doctorate. So we didn&#8217;t tend to have that much local conversation. Now in England, we really didn&#8217;t talk with many people beside my sister and her husband and their four kids. We left the kids with them and went up to Scotland. John had been writing joint papers or doing joint work with somebody and we went up there for a few days. They probably asked us about what was going on but the conversation was limited by our lack of language skills. [Break in recording] JF: So, Dr. Barrett, I&#8217;m going to ask you a few questions about the late &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s and just give me your observations at the time or your memories and reflections now. First I was going to ask about the Civil Rights Movement and how you feel that changed dynamics in the university. Let me just start with, was the University of Tennessee integrated when you started teaching there? LB: No. It integrated after I was there, I don&#8217;t know what year. The man who is now vice president for minority relations was the first person that applied and I seem to remember he threatened to sue. Anyway, he was admitted, but Andy Holt, who was a wonderful, wonderful president, he saw his role as working with the legislature and the board and he had a really good vice president of academic affairs and he didn&#8217;t mess in the academic side of things. Anyway, the first batch of minority students that they admitted were I don&#8217;t know how many; maybe a dozen, maybe more. Somebody could give you the number. What I do remember is Dr. Holt saying we&#8217;re not going to have an Autherine Lucy or a James Meredith. We're going to admit a number of students, and some of them are going to graduate and some of them are going to drop out, and we&#8217;re going to treat them just like other students. But when the president came and&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see. In the early 1970s the then president, whose name I&#8217;ll remember in a minute, he said there were three major problems on campus, housing, minorities, and the dorms, and he appointed a task force on each. The task force on women was the one I chaired, but he has a task force on minorities. There were still issues. Initially there was an issue of the restaurants along Cumberland Avenue, and of course it&#8217;s interesting. Cumberland Avenue in that time had a shoe store, a nice women&#8217;s store, a men&#8217;s store. Kids didn&#8217;t have cars like they do now and it was more of a small shopping area. But there were restaurants and the students picketed the ones that wouldn&#8217;t integrate. My husband was head of the math department. One of the math graduate students went into one of them with a black student and the owner called the police and he was put in jail. Then the jail called my husband in the middle of the night to come get him because the other prisoners had beat him up. JF: Oh my gosh. LB: I think he had a lifelong problem he was so severely beaten. But the boycott from the students and the faculty helped and everybody integrated except the cafeteria that was blocked off that was on the ground floor of the Masonic building. I guess it was 1964 when there was another push for integration. The local restaurant association met and the guy that ran that cafeteria said for gosh sakes, integrate. Don&#8217;t put up with what I&#8217;ve done. We haven&#8217;t integrated and we&#8217;ve been boycotted. I can remember on at least one occasion going over with a group of people with signs: Don&#8217;t eat here; they won&#8217;t integrate. I wasn&#8217;t on the faculty at that point. That&#8217;s another from the &#8217;60s. When my husband became department head I couldn&#8217;t be on the faculty. Now, he had already been diagnosed, I think I talked about his illness, and he was only going to be department head for a year. So I was just going to stay home with the kids, who were five, four, and three at that point, and then Oak Ridge invited me to be a consultant and that turned out to be most enjoyable and most profitable in terms of my long term career. So I wasn&#8217;t involved with the campus as much. Now the university did make an offer. My undergraduate background from Rice was related to applied math and when I was with the University of Texas although I was working in topology, which is pure math, one year I worked half time at the defense research lab on a physics project so I knew quite a bit of applied math, so I wound up as the mathematician on a lot of engineering committees. The suggestion was made that maybe I could teach in engineering, and there were two problems with that. One, I wasn&#8217;t sure I knew the material that was engineering and the other was that the engineers really wanted me to teach a math course&#8212;. One of the things mathematicians at math departments have to do is try to keep the engineers from teaching math and the sociologists from teaching the statistics. People want to teach their version of math, so I just said I didn&#8217;t want to do that. Then when John decided to continue by then I had a nice little consulting business going. My arrangement with Oak Ridge was if the kids were sick or it wasn&#8217;t a good day I could pretty much&#8212;. I worked two to ten days a month and I could move it around. Interesting, I was trying to remember the woman who was head of the Atomic Energy Commission. It wasn&#8217;t Dixie whatever her name was. It was a woman who had been president of the women&#8217;s college at Harvard that was separate, Radcliffe. At the time John died she was pushing Oak Ridge to hire women scientists on a schedule where they could work less than a full time schedule to get women jobs when their children were small, and Oak Ridge did offer me, because I&#8217;d been consulting, they did offer me a job, but I just thought the university&#8212;. Well I liked teaching at the university but I think one reason that Oak Ridge offered me the job was because of the woman that was head of the Atomic Energy Commission pushing. JF: I can look her name up and find her name. LB: Yeah. That was some time in the &#8217;60s. JF: I don&#8217;t know quite how to phrase this question but you mentioned Oak Ridge and it got me thinking about the Cold War and national defense and I was wondering if because of all the concerns about national defense and this militarization after World War II, if that opened up a lot of opportunities in mathematics? LB: I think to a certain extent it did. We had a wonderful year at Wisconsin. When we were at the University of Utah my husband worked in differential equations, more the theoretical side [but] differential equations are heavily used in applied math, so in &#8217;59/&#8217;60 he was at the math research center at the University of Wisconsin, the one that eventually was blown up. JF: Oh yeah. LB: At the time he was there it was peaceful. He, because of his research, was offered a year there at full pay and no responsibilities except that he had to be willing to go consult with the military, I think it was, I don&#8217;t know, six times or something. I don&#8217;t think he did it but twice. But the idea was the math research center was going to pay back the math community for pulling people out during the war to do just wartime work, so this was sort of a payback thing, which was very nice. Then I had an appointment in the math department. Oak Ridge had, and still has&#8212;in fact somebody was arrested sometime recently, a nun, and I think she&#8217;s going to be sentenced to prison for protesting over there about nuclear armament. When I took the consulting job my nephew, who works for the Quakers&#8212;. He has a title but what he really is is head of their lobbying&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know what the title is. Well, back when I took the job at Oak Ridge, and certainly when I taught three years at West Point, Jim and I had long discussions and my feeling is I would love for us to be pacifists but given the state of the world we&#8217;re going to have an army and I think it&#8217;s more important to go to Oak Ridge or to West Point and be sure what&#8217;s done is ethical, so. JF: Thinking about war and the military, were there anti-war demonstrations on campus during the Vietnam War? LB: Oh yeah. JF: Do you remember anything in particular about that? LB: I remember&#8212;. I wasn&#8217;t department head. There was a guy, Glenn Reynolds, who writes a blog that&#8217;s nationally read. I don&#8217;t know, maybe his father was part of it. But I remember when Nixon did something that everybody was unhappy with and he came with the Billy Graham Crusade and they smuggled signs and things in and they were arrested for taking part in that. Somebody else may have told you about this. I remember standing on the third floor of the math building and looking out at what was then the administration building and the cops coming with shields and sticks and running people off. One of our nonpolitical graduate students who was walking up&#8212;. Ayres Hall is on top of the hill there, and he was walking up carrying a motorcycle helmet because he was a motorcyclist and they arrested him. He had nothing to do with the demonstration. JF: [Laughs] Poor kid. LB: But, yeah, there were demonstrations. That couldn&#8217;t have been &#8217;69&#8212;. Well it may have been after I&#8212;. I went back to teaching in the spring quarter of &#8217;69. I don&#8217;t remember the date but like every place else college students were opposed to the Vietnam War, and I knew people in the math community who moved to Canada, not necessarily local people. JF: What about the women&#8217;s movement in the &#8217;70s? Was that visible in town or on campus? LB: Oh yeah, yeah. I wish I could remember. Of course when I was asked to chair the task force on women I first said I wouldn&#8217;t do it because it was the early &#8217;70s and I had just gone back to being full time and was trying to rebuild my research agenda and I had three kids. [Laughs] This was before I was department head. I said no, that I wouldn&#8217;t do it; I had to get back into my research. Then a couple weeks later they came back and said if you don&#8217;t do it we&#8217;re going to appoint a woman who I think was pretty competent from home economics but she didn&#8217;t understand what women in non women&#8217;s fields put up with, so I agreed to chair the committee. Then we held hearings&#8212;. Well we met, and the woman who was the most vociferous member of the committee at the first meeting said we had to make them re-advertise the position for ombudsman and call it ombudsperson and I said we got more important things to do and she said that has to be changed. So we asked them to do it, they hadn&#8217;t gotten any women candidates, they redid it and they got two women candidates and they hired one as the assistant ombudsperson. But she&#8217;s somebody you ought to [interview] too. She&#8217;s back here. JF: You mentioned her. Is this Sharon Lord? LB: Yeah. Have you interviewed her? JF: I haven&#8217;t yet. Some people have mentioned her. She&#8217;s going to be on our list for a future resource trip. LB: Yeah. Does she still go by Sharon Lord? JF: I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;m going to have to do a little research to find her. LB: Yeah. Well somebody that she&#8212;. But she was adamant about everything. JF: You said at first, her pushing to get the language changed, you thought that&#8217;s not as important as some other issues. Did&#8212;? LB: Well I think changing the language is very important but I think for the first thing the task force on women my initial reaction was something&#8212;. Salaries were more important. And she was right, you know; that was something that should have been taken care of at that point, and I think language is very important. I don&#8217;t know that I can remember it but the task force report starts with a story about a doctor being called to treat a man that had been in an automobile accident. I don&#8217;t know. The story ends up that the doctor is the young man&#8217;s mother but the story doesn't make sense until you realize there are women doctors. I do think language is very important. The initial book about women&#8217;s language, the woman that wrote it just died in the last month or so and there was quite a story about her in the New York Times, talking about how language affects people. It does. JF: Can you recall any events or instances where you experienced the way that language can affect? LB: Well one of the things, when I was department head and wrote letters of reference I used my initials. When we sent out advertisements trying to attract graduate students I used my name and we attracted more women that way but if I was writing&#8212;. Say you were a graduate student in math looking for a job I would sign L.K. instead of Lida because I think people pay more attention&#8212;. And still most people when they write references for men just talk about their [1:29:45 professional]. When people write references for women they say they get along well with people, they&#8217;re married, they have kids but they know how to manage stuff; they don&#8217;t say that in letters for men. I&#8217;m currently on the committee of the Mathematical Association of America that looks at women&#8217;s issues and that committee is now pushing for blind refereeing for journals and the publication committee that involves most of the senior editors of the journals says they don&#8217;t see any proof that blind refereeing makes a difference. Some of them do, and it&#8217;s a hassle, and other ones say they think it&#8217;s a good idea. But I think it makes a difference, but I think the difference is more than that. I have a feeling that named, whatever that means, mathematicians who submit articles get them published whether they&#8217;re any good or not where the less well known&#8212;. So I think there&#8217;s more than one reason to blind referee. But I think people, some people, discount women. JF: In 1971 an Association for Women in Mathematics was formed. LB: Yeah. Mary Gray was one of the instigators, Mary Gray and Alice Schafer. I think Alice was the first president and Mary was the second. There were no women on&#8212;. The American Mathematical Society is the research organization. The Math Association of America, that I was president of, is college level curriculum, more into teaching. The two organizations work quite well together. But Mary Gray went to a meeting of the council of the American Math Society and they said, oh, the meetings weren&#8217;t open and she said well she was a member and she didn&#8217;t see any rule against it, and they said it was a gentlemen&#8217;s agreement. [Laughs] This is a story that&#8217;s been told for years; I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s true or not. Her reply was, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m not a gentleman.&#8221; [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] LB: But eventually I think she was elected vice president of AMS, but that&#8217;s what started the&#8212;. And of course the Association of Women in Mathematics is forty years old now, so if it&#8217;s forty years old it started in 1970/&#8217;71. I joined immediately. I wasn&#8217;t particularly active, partly because at that point I was trying to get back into math and I wasn&#8217;t really involved in things like that, but I certainly was supportive of it and I knew Mary and Alice. Alice taught at Wellesley and Dick was department head at MIT and Mary and her husband&#8212;again it&#8217;s the husbands and wives deal&#8212;were both in Washington at&#8212;Georgetown? I don&#8217;t know. JF: I found this great question in an article by Patricia Kenschaft and I&#8217;m just going to read it because I don&#8217;t think I could reword it better. LB: Okay. JF: I&#8217;m just interested to see what you think of the question and if you have an opinion on an answer for it. She asked, sort of rhetorically, &#8220;Do the little girls who loved arithmetic in grade school automatically lose interest in advanced mathematics, or did a sexist attitude somewhere along the way convince them that it is unladylike to enjoy electric trains and abstract algebra?&#8221; LB: I think that certainly both things happened. Mathematics is not really arithmetic. If you&#8217;re really good at arithmetic and like that kind of thing my feeling is you might be a better accountant. The kind of math that I did, abstract math, topology, I laugh at my Bridge group and say I&#8217;m a mathematician, not an arithmetician. JF: [Laughs] LB: So I think some people just lose interest. But there&#8217;s no question. In the &#8217;60s&#8212;I&#8217;d forgotten about this&#8212;in the &#8217;60s the Math Association of America had a grant to send out speakers to small colleges&#8212;or big colleges but mainly small colleges&#8212;to try to get people to go to graduate school. I was on that panel and I primarily went and talked to women&#8217;s colleges about why women should continue in math. I had a talk about how to&#8212;this was when John was still alive&#8212;how to combine math and children and marriage. One of the things that was very clear, undergraduate math majors, when they were dating, would say they were English majors because they didn&#8217;t want guys to think they were math majors because women math majors were supposed to be different. [Laughs] I think there was sort of a social pressure against women in math. When I was a freshman at Rice in 1943&#8212;I just got through spending some time at Rice&#8212;the women were put in a separate math class taught by a woman. When it happened, I don&#8217;t know, I just didn&#8217;t think too much about it, but once I got further along&#8212;. The men&#8217;s course met for an hour, it had the head of the math department teaching it, it was a large lecture&#8212;the women&#8217;s course was smaller&#8212;but they then stayed for an hour with probably undergraduate students helping and worked on their homework, so it was sort of a group homework assignment. We got cheated out of that, so when I got to sophomore math I had had a lesser experience than the men had, and I guess they thought women and math didn&#8217;t go together. I wish Dr. [1:37:31] was still alive. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve told you this, but in the year John died, so &#8217;69, Steve Puckett, who was the dean at Sewanee, the University of the South, called me in the spring and said I want you to come down here in two weeks and talk about your research. I said, &#8220;Steve, you know John&#8217;s just died. Let me do it next fall.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, I need you in two weeks.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Because Sewanee&#8217;s been a men&#8217;s college and we&#8217;re going coed and when we talked about it people stood up in faculty meeting and said well we&#8217;ll have to do away with the math requirement.&#8221; [Laughs] So I went down and I gave my talk about women combining career and I talked about that last paper I&#8217;d published and the kind of research I had done at Oak Ridge, which was the most recent, and it had been publishable, and the research I&#8217;d done for my early years that was pure math. [Laughs] Then Steve drug me around to people&#8217;s offices and he&#8217;d walk in and say, &#8220;Hey, you know Lida&#8217;s been here and I just thought because of your concern about math at Sewanee you all should have a conversation.&#8221; [Laughs] So I went around politicking for keeping the math requirement. JF: [Laughs] LB: We had known Steve. He was a graduate student at Yale when my husband was on post doctorate. But that&#8217;s the &#8217;60s, or early &#8217;70s. JF: Wow. [Laughs] That reminds me of an interview I did with a woman in Chapel Hill. She was the first African American professor hired at UNC in 1966 and she said she felt very visible, obviously, and very like people were watching her. She said she even remembers a professor from another department saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re keeping an eye on you and if you do good we&#8217;re going to get one of you for our department.&#8221; LB: [Laughs] JF: She laughs about it now but I thought there are similarities here between experiences of minorities and women and how visible you must feel sometimes. LB: Well when I was department head at UT, I don&#8217;t remember how many, fifteen or more departments, the men could miss a meeting and nobody would know they weren&#8217;t there but if I sent the associate head, which sometimes meetings were&#8212;worthless. [Laughs] Well not worth taking my time, and if I sent somebody else and I wasn&#8217;t there somebody would say, &#8220;Oh, Lida&#8217;s not here. Who&#8217;s representing math?&#8221; and if it was a man nobody would notice. JF: [Laughs] Some women have talked about when they were starting out in their careers in the &#8217;60s or &#8217;70s being very conscious of what they wore and how they looked, for different reasons, and I was wondering if you relate to that. LB: Oh yeah, that&#8217;s always a factor. Of course in the &#8217;60s women weren&#8217;t allowed to wear slacks on campus so when I&#8217;d go in on Saturdays&#8212;. We had a scheme where Tuesdays and Saturdays John took&#8212;. He was such a good husband. You know I talked about the fact he kept house while I finished my degree. I would work on my research and he would fix Tuesday night dinner and then on Saturday morning he&#8217;d do things with the kids and I&#8217;d go into the office and I&#8217;d wear blue jeans but even if it wasn&#8217;t raining I&#8217;d roll them up under a raincoat. [Laughs] When I went back after he died the first thing that happened was the graduate students came and said would you wear slacks to teach in, and I said, oh, has the rule changed, and they said, yes, for students, but the department head says we can&#8217;t wear slacks, but if you wear them he&#8217;s not going to challenge you and then we can. So I wore slacks and he didn&#8217;t challenge me and the women started wearing them. [Laughs] JF: That&#8217;s a great story. LB: Yeah. But, you know, and I wore slacks. Now if we had a visitor or something on campus in the &#8217;70s I would sometimes dress up in a business suit and when I was at Northern Illinois and was associate vice president I probably dressed more formally most of the time. Then when I was in Mississippi I still wore slacks part of the time, but I can remember the first Saturday I was there when we moved there I went to the grocery store and I was younger and I wore not shorts but long shorts&#8212;I don&#8217;t know what they were called in those days&#8212;and ran into one of the vice president&#8217;s wives and she said to me, &#8220;Well you can&#8217;t wear that to the grocery store. You&#8217;re a dean.&#8221; I started to tell her what I thought, but I said, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s Saturday morning and I&#8217;ve just moved here.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m going to do what I please. [Laughs] JF: It sounds like in Mississippi there were some differences. LB: Yeah. Oh yeah. But then when I&#8212; JF: Can you tell me some more about that? LB: &#8212;was in NSF, and some of the time I would go listen to things on the Hill or go call on people in Congress for various politicking. NSF didn&#8217;t politic enough. JF: Is that the National&#8212;? LB: National Science Foundation. JF: Okay. LB: I always wore business suits and I did not see any woman in Congress in anything but business suits or anybody at the Department of Education. I chaired a&#8212;. Well my boss and Eve [1:44:12], who had been the head of education in Maine, we were the associates&#8212;. Well that wasn&#8217;t my title but I was the associate to the director of education at NSF and she was an associate to the head of the education department and our bosses chaired and we operated a committee that met about every six weeks, or maybe two months, of the federal agencies that had activities in math and science education to be sure that the different agencies weren&#8217;t contradicting themselves or stepping on each other. Nobody&#8212;well she and I may have been the only women although we chaired the thing. Maybe there was one other women, but nobody wore anything but business suits and then just before I left there was an assistant secretary of education who was a woman and who was African American who was hired and she started coming to work in nice looking pant suits. Of course now, Hillary Clinton&#8212;. [Laughs] JF: Yeah. [Laughs] LB: When I went from NSF to West Point I still had all these business suits and that year was the year the government shut down and the military could keep teaching but I couldn&#8217;t because I was a civilian so I went out and bought a bunch of slacks and stuff to teach in. [Laughs] JF: Did you consider yourself a feminist? LB: Oh yeah. Yeah, sure. Why not? [Laughs] JF: What does feminism mean to you? LB: Well I think I&#8217;m not like&#8212;. I have a different approach than Sharon Lord, and maybe Sharon Lord had a different approach as she got older. I guess I tried to belong and instigate things rather than just&#8212;and of course I&#8217;m not bashful. Sometimes I would crusade but sometimes it was better to&#8212;. Well when I was dean at Mississippi State the women were mad at me because I wouldn&#8217;t take on, I don&#8217;t even remember what the issue was, and I said I had to prioritize issues and I thought it was much more important to get the women&#8217;s studies program started again and to do something about salaries and hiring than whatever&#8212;I don&#8217;t even remember what the issue was. They were unhappy about it because they thought every issue ought to be [a priority] and I guess I&#8217;m pragmatic about that sort of thing. Not always. [Laughs] JF: Can you tell me a little bit more about Mississippi State and being dean there? This would have been in 1987 you went there, right? LB: Yeah. JF: And you were dean of arts and sciences? LB: Yeah. First female dean, all the department heads were men. My predecessor, and I didn&#8217;t realize how much trouble it was going to cause, had been an alcoholic and the associate dean had been acting dean. They tried to get him into treatment and he wouldn&#8217;t stay in treatment and he eventually left there with his wife and did get in treatment and get straightened out, but I don&#8217;t think&#8212;. Well there was some resentment because people wanted the associate dean to become dean. He had been an undergraduate at Mississippi State, had gone off to Duke and got a doctorate in physics and come back, and so he was a part of the culture and they were disappointed when they brought in somebody from outside. But people were polite. I don&#8217;t think anybody was too unpleasant. I&#8217;d asked all the department heads to come see me and have a conversation and then I wanted to go visit all the departments and after about four or five days I said I haven&#8217;t heard from anybody and my secretary said, oh, I&#8217;m setting up the appointments for you. They called to talk to you but I told them I could take care of it, and it was just her way, because her former boss&#8212;. Well she was running the college. So I got her transferred. [Laughs] She just didn&#8217;t understand that I was different. The budget officer was running the budget without consulting me and a woman who was a full professor in biology, and I don&#8217;t think there were that many but there were quite a few women on the faculty, but anyway she told me that the budget officer was even contradicting when I said things about the budget, and he wouldn&#8217;t give me full information. So I sent the associate dean, the good old boy, up to get our records from the finance office and I went in and confronted the budget officer and I said I think you need to decide that you need to be full time working on your research. He said he wasn&#8217;t about to and I said, okay, then I&#8217;ll bring up the discrepancies in what you&#8217;re telling people about the budget and what the budget really is, so he decided to go back to his research. [Laughs] But it was a woman who told me what was going on, so I think that was partly because I was female but it may be mainly because I followed somebody that had let other people run the [school]. The man who was associate dean said he didn&#8217;t want to continue, he&#8217;d expected to be dean, and at the end of the year he&#8217;d either go back to physics or get him another dean&#8217;s job, and he applied for a couple of dean&#8217;s jobs and didn&#8217;t get them. Then he came in and said he found working with me was something he enjoyed and he thought he was learning from me, so he would continue. I said, okay, I&#8217;m going to move you over to run the budget [Laughs] because that&#8217;s one reason you can&#8217;t get a dean&#8217;s job, so he did end up getting a dean&#8217;s job. On campus I had one major thing. The head of the art department came to see me and said if I have problems in the department I can bring them to the dean, and I have a problem that the campus thinks should go to the affirmative action officer but I tried that and it didn&#8217;t work. I have an art professor that really harasses women and when I told the affirmative action officer about it they just sort of scolded him and he still harasses women, and he brought me a letter about this professor inviting a woman student to meet him in the evening and leaning over her desk and she was just really upset. The guy had just gotten promoted so I wrote a letter based on what the art department had suggesting that his promotion be upheld for misbehavior and that would be a sanction and that he could get promoted if he straightened out his act. I sent it to the provost, who agreed with me, and he sent it to the president. Well the provost calls me and says you and I need to go talk to the president, so we did, and the president said the promotion had already gone to the board and so he hesitated to air all this with the board and could we do something else. He suggested something trivial. So he wanted me to withdraw the letter and I said, you&#8217;re president, you can do anything you want, and if you want to try these alternate things that&#8217;s your preference, but I won&#8217;t withdraw the letter. Well the provost said to me, are you sure, or something and I said I&#8217;m absolutely sure. Well they ended up sending it to the board and the guy wasn&#8217;t promoted and it was complicated after that. After I left he said I was discriminating and blah, blah, blah, but eventually he acted up again, invited some woman out&#8212;. Called her dorm and the dorm people had a record of [it] so they fired him. But I think the very fact that the affirmative action officer was a woman and had really not done anything was a part of the culture. I don&#8217;t know. JF: Do you think she was afraid to do anything or do you think she was just dismissed? LB: Oh, I just think the president didn&#8217;t want anything that was too public done, and maybe they didn&#8217;t think it mattered that much. I had another interesting experience when the head of math came and said two women students had accused a graduate student of having them over to his house and creating a problem and he didn&#8217;t think that the issue was clear. I talked to the students, it was a little more complicated than that, and they said they had asked about their grades and he said come by the house and there were two of them so they didn&#8217;t think anything about it, and he didn&#8217;t change the grades but the grades were questionable, and the person at fault was the graduate student. It was the teacher, not the girls. He was defending his side of things and his poor grading by accusing the girls of being the problem. JF: The teacher was defending his male graduate student&#8212; LB: Yeah. JF: &#8212;and saying the girls were trying to trade sexual favors for a better grade. LB: Yeah. JF: Hmm. [Break in recording] LB: I want to be sure and have the story about Mattie on there. JF: Yeah. Do you want to start with that? LB: Yeah. JF: Okay. LB: When I moved to Mississippi from Illinois the house I bought had a maid that came every week and I asked her to continue to come, and my neighbors also had the same woman working for them and they called me and said don&#8217;t you dare pay more than the minimum wage. So I talked to Mattie and asked her why she wasn&#8217;t working on campus because I thought the pay would be better and she would get health benefits and retirement. She said the university wouldn&#8217;t hire her because she had dropped out of school. I think she was about twenty-one or twenty-two and had four kids so I think when she dropped out of school she was young and pregnant. In order to get on at the university she had to have a high school diploma or a GED so I looked into the GED and then I told her I&#8217;d pay her ten dollars every time she went to a GED class, and her oldest child was old enough she could leave the kids at home and take an early evening GED class. So before I left there she passed enough of the GED to get a job on campus and she quit everybody but me. In the meantime I had been discussing with the people the fact that they weren&#8217;t paying social security and if they had somebody every week at her rate they still, over a year&#8212;and I told them about my neighbors in Tennessee that hadn&#8217;t paid it and the maid had gotten sick and they told her she could get social security benefits and unemployment. Well nobody had paid it so they went back and made them pay the back and pay a penalty. I guess this is an example of my approach. Instead of arguing with them when I got there I figured out a way to accomplish what I wanted and in the long term to pressure them into doing things better. Sometimes direct confrontation just creates an argument. JF: That&#8217;s been a familiar theme I&#8217;ve heard in interviews with women. Like I interviewed Gloria Ray who was the first women&#8217;s athletic director. LB: Oh yeah. JF: And I think Lorayne Lester said something similar about find your allies, work with your allies. Pick your battles that you&#8217;ll win. Use federal legislation or the threat of a lawsuit&#8212;that&#8217;s like your ace in your back pocket. That&#8217;s how Gloria Ray put it. LB: Yeah. JF: But it does seem that it&#8217;s been really important when the federal government has intervened with legislation to have that ace in the back pocket. LB: Oh yeah. I think it&#8217;s made a big difference. JF: And since your&#8212;. LB: Did she ever come take our order? JF: Not yet, no. LB: Okay. We&#8217;ve got plenty of time&#8212; JF: We&#8217;ll get her when she comes back out. LB: &#8212;because you&#8217;re only about fifteen minutes. JF: Great. I was thinking, your career basically starts during World War II and you could maybe reflect a little bit on how you&#8217;ve seen things change over the years with regards to the relationship between the state and the citizens. LB: Well, I don&#8217;t know. I was thinking that during World War II I think Rice was very happy to have women students. They had a pretty good sized enrollment because they had the Navy&#8212;I guess it was V-12 and ROTC. But of course when I graduated in &#8217;46 everybody wasn&#8217;t out of the Army yet so I think a mathematician was a mathematician. In the late &#8217;40s, early &#8217;50s we had so many GI bill students in college that that made a difference with the colleges and universities, and of course there weren&#8217;t very many women in the military. I happened to have&#8212;she&#8217;s now dead&#8212;a friend in Knoxville who was one of the pilots that ferried&#8212;. You know the women pilots ferried the planes from where they were manufactured to the Army. There was a whole group of them. She was interesting. But I don&#8217;t know whether the attitude to the military&#8212;. I think people had great respect for the people that served. JF: A lot of times the &#8217;50s is described as the doldrums for the women&#8217;s movement or people talk more about the conformity and the conservatism of the &#8217;50s, that there wasn&#8217;t a lot of activism or agitation around civil rights issues or women&#8217;s rights issues. LB: I don&#8217;t know&#8212;. Of course in the &#8217;50s there were only two women in the doctoral program when I went to Texas and I guess there were maybe three of us at Penn. I think one reason we took the jobs at the University of Utah was because the Mormons, their nepotism rules were different. I think I mentioned earlier that there were two men who had the same grandfather and different grandmothers and the grandmothers were married to the grandfather at the same time. Of course Utah was fairly sexist. In the Mormon Church you can&#8217;t go to heaven unless your husband goes. I had a good Mormon friend whose husband had no use for the Mormon Church [2:03:15 and that bothered her.] I don&#8217;t remember thinking much about the military in the &#8217;50s. JF: [Pause] So how long were you at Mississippi as the dean? LB: I went there in 1987 and when I went they told me that I&#8217;d have to retire as dean at sixty-five but I went with tenure in the math department so when I was sixty-four I wrote some friends and said I was looking for a nine-months&#8217; job, and I never had been in the math department [2:04:03]. I taught an occasional class if somebody was sick or something. But I was thinking about moving and I wanted to find a nine-months&#8217; job someplace else. At that time one of the people I wrote was at the National Science Foundation and I was on the advisory board to the education director[y 2:04:27], because I&#8217;d been president of MAA, probably. She told the head of the education director[y] I was looking for a job and so he called me and wanted to know if I didn&#8217;t want a job working for him and I said, oh no, I want to be at Mississippi State another year. He figured out I wanted five years to get a Mississippi retirement. He said but I need you this year. Well the next thing I knew my boss called up and said, &#8220;I understand you&#8217;re thinking about leaving,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;How did you find out? But I&#8217;m not until next year.&#8221; He said, &#8220;NSF called personnel to see if they could buy your services next year in the Intergovernmental Personnel Act so Mississippi State would be paying your salary but you&#8217;d be in Washington.&#8221; So personnel called me and asked me what I thought about it and I said, darn, he&#8217;s smart. [Laughs] They wanted me to come do something special that they think I can do and one of the things was that business of chairing this committee&#8212;because I&#8217;d been a dean they thought I could work with it&#8212;and one of it was being a staff backup for the National Committee on Educational Standards and Testing, which my background&#8212;. It was a congressional committee. The initials were unfortunate: NCEST was the &#8220;incest&#8221; committee. JF: [Laughs] LB: They didn&#8217;t think about that. He said, &#8220;If you want to go, they&#8217;re good candidates. You&#8217;ve done a lot of things; is there anything left?&#8221; and I said I don&#8217;t really have any projects right now, so I decided to go. I was only there four years. It was really wonderful. He asked me to ask the department heads who would&#8212;he&#8217;d appoint somebody for a year because this was April or May&#8212;and they all picked the same guy as a good person to be interim dean, which made us all feel good. So that&#8217;s when I left there. JF: You never remarried? LB: No. My husband always thought I would, but who&#8217;s going to marry a woman with a PhD in math and three teenagers and the kind of job I had? Then my mother came to visit in 1972 and had a stroke while she was here. My brother thought she&#8217;d move back to Houston when he got transferred to Houston. He was in Denver and he got transferred to New York. So she stayed in a very nice Seventh Day Adventist retirement home, kind of assisted living. But between mother and three teenagers, and you know somebody asks you out two or three times and you never can go they think you&#8217;re turning them off. I dated quite a bit right after John died and I made a mistake going to Northern and to Mississippi State because they&#8217;re both college towns and that was the time that there was so much attention paid to sexual harassment so they didn&#8217;t want the men dating the women professors and so they didn&#8217;t want the women dating the men professors. I don&#8217;t know. Anyway, I would have been better off in a big city. JF: Raising three kids on your own. [Laughs] LB: Yeah. Well I was very fortunate. I had been a consultant at Oak Ridge and I had a university student, actually she may have been a freshman when she started working for me after school, and I knew her mother. The days I was in Oak Ridge the kids were&#8212;. I started at Oak Ridge&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see. I don&#8217;t know. I guess they were all in school. I guess [2:09:00] had started the first grade, so Margaret was there after school and then she worked for me until&#8212;. Well after John died she kept his car so she was available. I don&#8217;t remember how she got there. She may have had a car or shared a car&#8212;students shared cars then more than they do now&#8212;because I know when he&#8217;d get sick in the middle of the night I could call her and she&#8217;d come out. So after he died and I went back to working full time she was there every day and then after she graduated and got married and didn&#8217;t want to do it anymore I hired a young couple. Well I hired the woman and she said I can do it but if you want me on weekends when you&#8217;re out of town I&#8217;ll have to have my husband here too but we won&#8217;t charge you. Well that was just perfect. So they worked for me, she was an undergraduate, and then when she graduated I guess the last year or two I was here I advertised for somebody from 3:00 to 6:00 five days a week and I hired this wonderful African American woman who had started out at the hospital as something and trained to be a practical nurse and then I don&#8217;t think she was a nurse but she worked in the operating room so she got off from work at 3:00 and then she came. It was wonderful because she kept the house clean and on Wednesdays she did the grocery shopping and every night when I got home she had dinner on the table. JF: Wow. LB: I told her she wasn&#8217;t responsible for the kids and I told the kids they had to behave, but it was somebody in the house&#8212;they were teenagers by then&#8212;when they got home from school. Interesting story about race relations, her name was Mrs. Bennett, I think, I don&#8217;t remember her last name, but some of my friends, racist friends, came one night, and everybody came in through my back door. I had a steep driveway. So when they came through I said, &#8220;[2:11:28], this is Mrs. Bennett,&#8221; and when we went and sat down in the living room he said, &#8220;What&#8217;s this &#8216;Mrs.&#8217; business? What&#8217;s her name?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Do you know, I don&#8217;t know. She&#8217;s so fed up with racist folks like you she doesn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221; [Laughs] And I never did know her first name and I don&#8217;t even think I put it on the&#8212;. I paid social security [2:11:54] and when I sent it I may have learned it. But she was wonderful. All the help I had was good. The two students were good. JF: It sounds like it was equally important for you to have that help&#8212; LB: Oh yeah. JF: &#8212;and also to treat them fairly and equitably. LB: Oh yeah. I&#8217;ve always paid social security on people. I had a fuss with the woman I had clean my apartment when I was working for the National Science Foundation because if you pay social security they&#8217;re going to have to pay income tax, but I pointed out, actually to her daughter&#8212;. She was Costa Rican and didn&#8217;t speak English and if I needed to talk to her&#8212;. I guess it was Costa Rica. Anyway, she came on Saturdays and I would have to call her daughter to translate. My Spanish is not that good. So I [2:12:52 did] pay social security on her, I convinced her daughter, and actually she was working during the week for a bookstore cleaning and doing things. I thought maybe she was working for a bookstore where they specialized in Spanish books, among other things. JF: So you had to be both a mother and a father for your kids when they were in their teenage years. LB: Yeah. JF: And this is the &#8217;70s, there&#8217;s a lot of social and cultural change. LB: Oh yeah. JF: How was that for you? LB: Well I tried to get my son to have some men in his life. Although I dated one guy, Brad came to pick me up and I wasn&#8217;t ready and I said you have a choice. You can take Kit to his party or I can and you&#8217;ll have to wait longer. When he came back from taking Kit he said I&#8217;m not going to take that kid with hair down to his shoulders any place again. If you want me to carry him around you&#8217;re going to have to get him a haircut. [Laughs] Brad and I were about as different as any two&#8212;. We did enjoy each other&#8217;s company but he was super conservative. Unfortunately he was killed in an automobile accident and his sister called me wanting to know if my son could be an acolyte at the funeral, and I suggested they better find somebody else. I figured if Brad didn&#8217;t like Kit&#8217;s long hair Brad&#8217;s mother probably wouldn&#8217;t either. Anyway, [Pause] it was complicated, there&#8217;s no question about it, and I never understood people who stopped by the bar on the way home. The Faculty Club, which by the way the university took over for a welcome center and that&#8217;s the reason Lorayne met you at Club LeConte because they arranged a special deal at Club LeConte for people that belonged to the Faculty Club. Now what did I start to tell you about the Faculty Club? JF: You said you didn&#8217;t understand when people would stop at the bar on the way home. LB: Oh, oh, yeah. Well I&#8217;d have a terrible day at the office and then I&#8217;d be going home to not knowing what, and the Faculty Club in those days, the only way you could have a drink is if you kept your own drinks there and they wouldn&#8217;t serve it to you unless there was more than one person in the bar. But every afternoon there were a couple of people that were usually there so occasionally I&#8217;d stop by the Faculty Club on the way home and shift from one place to the other. Then occasionally after I had the lake house I&#8217;d get Margaret to stay late, just to have an evening to myself. A good story, I&#8217;m not sure it has to do with&#8212;well I guess it does have something to do with racism. I would come out here and fix a scotch, turn on the little fireplace you saw in the corner instead of turning the heat on because I love the fireplace, and then I&#8217;d go fill the bathtub all the way up, drink the scotch, and by then the fire would have warmed up the living room, and I&#8217;d have supper and I&#8217;d go home about 10:00 and the kids would already be in bed. One time I was going home and there was this elderly couple walking down the road, actually on the causeway over to the interstate, and I picked them up. They wanted somebody to help them change their tire and we couldn&#8217;t find anybody and I was at a gas station and saw these five guys that were actually getting the air thing pumped up in a car, you know. So I asked them if they would change the tire and explained the problem and they said sure. I believe they were all African American, big guys, probably football players, and this elderly couple, country people, in it was actually, I think, a truck, said, oh, we&#8217;re scared to death of those guys. I said oh, they&#8217;re university students but I&#8217;ll tell them I&#8217;m head of the math department. They were real nice, changed the tire, wouldn&#8217;t let him pay them anything, so I said, if I can ever do you a favor give me a call. Well that spring one of them called and he said I don&#8217;t want a grade change; I just want the information before I go home because if I fail math again I lose my football scholarship. I said, okay, so I go down and check and it turned out he had made fifty-eight, I don&#8217;t know, maybe for the whole course, so he&#8217;d flunked. I said to the graduate student I&#8217;m just checking because that&#8217;s going to lose him his football scholarship and I don&#8217;t want you to change the grade. He said, oh, I hated to do that because he did such good work. He did all the homework even though he had help but he just didn&#8217;t do much on the final. I said, well, why didn't you pass him at fifty-eight? He said well I was passing at sixty and if I passed him at fifty-eight I&#8217;d have to pass the no account guy that made fifty-nine. I said, well why don&#8217;t you give him extra credit for doing all that homework, and he said, gee, do you suppose the grade sheet&#8217;s still in the office? [Laughs] So he changed the grade, so I felt, you know, the guy who changed the tire deserved it. JF: Nice. [Break in recording] Go ahead. LB: I think West Point was interesting. One thing, that some people won&#8217;t believe, but when I went there the Congress had required West Point&#8212;they didn&#8217;t actually pass a law but they pressured them into hiring civilian faculty. The Military Academy and the Air Force Academy had never had civilian faculty except as visitors and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d ever had a female visitor in math. The first year when they hired young PhDs they were all know-it-alls and there was some conflicting culture between brand new PhDs and captains who had been out of West Point ROTC for eight years, so they felt like adding full professors, we could help bridge that gap, which I think we did. We tried to find ways to have both groups together and to understand their diverse talents. I was hesitant, for the same reason I was hesitant to leave Mississippi State. I&#8217;d been at NSF only three years that counted. I&#8217;d been there four but the first year was on Mississippi&#8217;s payroll and I wanted to stay with NSF five years. West Point said, oh, we are the government; you can transfer. JF: [Laughs] LB: So I got six years in with the government. But I was the only female full professor so when they had meetings of the full professors to discuss things even though I was who I was I was still, I wouldn&#8217;t say ignored, but I consciously had the woman&#8217;s role in the group. When Kathi Snook, who was a lieutenant colonel and had been in the first class of women at West Point, she came back and was in charge of the freshman teaching and looked after five kids and finished her dissertation the first year, quite a woman. She was then in the group and two women in a group make a difference. One woman in a group tends to be ignored or people tend to repeat what they said as if it hadn&#8217;t been said, and even at my age and with my status I still felt uncomfortable until the second woman was in the group, which I think is significant. But in general, except for one person&#8212;. Now some people may have not wanted civilians and not wanted a woman full professor but the man whose office I took over had already moved to Washington but he wouldn&#8217;t let me use the office because it was his until the first of August, and I used somebody else&#8217;s office that was gone for the summer. I think he was just being obnoxious. He wasn&#8217;t using the office; I just don&#8217;t think he wanted a woman or a civilian, I don&#8217;t know what. But I wasn&#8217;t the only one who didn&#8217;t think much of him. But I think in general the women were treated well. I said I wouldn&#8217;t be on any committee, I wouldn&#8217;t do anything but teach, but because Kathi Snook talked me into it I agreed to be on the committee that looked at the accreditation of West Point because it has to be an accredited college and they asked me to chair the committee on women and minorities at West Point. Kathi said if she did it she was an officer who reported to people and I didn&#8217;t report to the military except for teaching and I wasn&#8217;t looking for the next job. I think that women were treated well the freshman year and there was more of a divergence between the women and the men because the officer that ran the summer program between freshman and sophomore years was the kind that smoked cigars and rode a motorcycle and he really made a change in the culture so that women had a different role. Then another problem, which we acknowledged in our report, is women mature faster than men. They&#8217;re fifteen to sixteen percent [of the student body and] tend to be more than fifteen or sixteen percent of the officers in their senior year just because they&#8217;ve done better, and some of the men resented that. [Pause; interruption by waitperson] Oh, there&#8217;s tax in this darn state. JF: [Laughs] LB: Sales tax is discriminatory to low income people. I take part in Tennesseans for Fair Taxation, which is trying to get&#8212;. We&#8217;ve got a 9.5% sales tax. That&#8217;s equal to a month of food. We&#8217;re trying to get them to change but the obvious thing to change to is income tax, which we don&#8217;t have and they don&#8217;t want to do that. But anyway, no, I think the military works hard. Now one concern is the fact that, like anything where you had a lot of men and women, at West Point people never lock their rooms and occasionally men invade women&#8217;s rooms when they don&#8217;t want them there, maybe not for rape for just for the wrong sort of reasons. Just this past year I think it was, I saw in the paper that they had let women start locking their doors. In fact I guess everybody started locking their doors. But this guy that was so awful, I went over with a male civilian professor who was also on this committee and told the commandant&#8212;there&#8217;s an academic dean and then there&#8217;s a commandment in charge of the military&#8212;that I thought the summer program was bad and explained how I thought it affected the culture and he had a woman sergeant sitting in on the meeting and she agreed. He said well the man had a child that was going to be a senior in high school and they would change after that. [He&#8217;d] be there one more year and they would say something to him. Well it turned out the next year his office put out an email that was homophobic and they got rid of him, so I guess they&#8217;d do it for that, or maybe it was because it was the second [complaint]. But I think any place in the culture, and particularly maybe the people who go to a military academy, there&#8217;s a certain amount of sexism. But they have worked hard at adding women faculty, at least to the percentage there are women students, and they had a couple of very fine African American faculty, and interestingly enough, I think they went out of their way to have Jewish faculty, and there is a Jewish chapel and a Catholic chapel and a Protestant chapel on base. JF: Well we&#8217;re going to have to wrap up. LB: Yeah. [Laughs] JF: Can I close by asking just if there&#8217;s anything that we haven&#8217;t talked about yet that you&#8217;d like to add or anything you&#8217;d like to close with? LB: I think I talked about the fact that I had gone to the Harvard Business School and learned about how organizations were structured. JF: When was that? LB: When I went to Northern from Tennessee I moved from being department head to being associate vice president in charge of the undergraduate program and so they sent me to a five-week summer program at Harvard that was run by the business school and the college of education, so it talked about how organizations worked. When I became president of MAA they were appointing people to committees by asking the committee chair who they wanted and there were very few minorities. So I spent two months and found thirty-nine minorities to add to committees and when I went to the committee meeting the secretary had already appointed the committees and I said well you&#8217;re going to have to add some people because the bylaws say I do it, the president does it. I do think that pointing out people couldn&#8217;t chair more than one major committee and they couldn&#8217;t be on more than two committees and they had to find another way beside asking the chair, I really think it had an impact on the culture of the Math Association, and I think the Math Association had been pretty good about women who were active being on the committees because they knew people. But I think that all kinds of ways it&#8217;s important for people to look at how organizations work and I don&#8217;t think the MAA was consciously discriminating against minorities and women but I think you have to look at the structure of an organization and that&#8217;s what Harvard business did for me, so if that&#8217;s not on there before. [Laughs] JF: Excellent. Well thank you so much. LB: Well thank you. JF: I would love to have a chance to talk with you again. LB: Okay...
