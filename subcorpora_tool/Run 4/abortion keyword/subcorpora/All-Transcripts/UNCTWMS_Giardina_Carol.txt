 Jessica Wilkerson: This is June 5, 2009, and I&#8217;m at the Southern Association for Women Historians Conference, and I&#8217;m interviewing Carol Giardina. So the first question is did your parents or family members participate in or discuss the Civil Rights Movement? Carol Giardin: They didn&#8217;t participate in it. The only thing I can really remember was probably my father, who was an immigrant from Sicily, came over in the--didn&#8217;t like Malcolm X, [Laughs] and would every once in awhile make some comment. Like Malcolm would be on TV going, &#8220;The day of the white devil is almost over,&#8221; and my father would say [angry mumbling], you know. [Laughs] But, no, they didn&#8217;t. JW: So how were you introduced to the Civil Rights Movement and how did you begin to participate? CG: Well in the early &#8217;60s I was in New York City going to high school and I graduated from high school in &#8217;63, and probably those last few years in high school, maybe thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen years old--. I left for the South when I was sixteen in &#8217;63 so the last three or four years in New York all kind of stuff was going on. There were sympathy demonstrations in our high school, there were pickets of White Castle, a hamburger joint, in New York. Also by sheer chance a group of jazz musicians moved next door to us in our Hollis, New York, quiet neighborhood, sort of a--. Lennie Tristano; he&#8217;s known to jazz people. This brought many African Americans into our neighborhood because they were jazz musicians. They studied with Lennie. And I was Lennie&#8217;s babysitter, so I was just a twelve or thirteen-year-old kid babysitting for these jazz--. Anyway, that kind of opened a whole new world for me, and I began to read Freud and Wilhelm Reich and all these people, The Doors of Perception [by] Aldous Huxley, On the Road [by Jack Kerouac]. Anyway, I became a beatnik and a protester, much to my parents&#8217; dismay. That was their word for it, &#8220;Oh, our daughter&#8217;s becoming a beatnik and a protester,&#8221; so they were horrified at all of this. They decided they would get me out of New York; it would save me from life as a beatnik and a protester, right? [Laughs] So they sent me off to the University of Florida in Gainesville. I was going to be a psych major and it supposedly had a good psych program, but mainly it had a curfew and a dress code and all of that stuff. And we had neighbors in Ocala that--. Our neighbors went in the winter and stayed in Ocala. I didn&#8217;t want to go. I had been accepted to one of the CUNYs, I forget. I wanted to stay in New York City and have them let me have my own apartment and pay for it [Laughs] and stuff, which they were not going to do. So off I came to the University of Florida, and I remember that fall going to my first football game at the University of Florida. They didn&#8217;t play the national anthem. They played &#8220;Dixie&#8221;--right?--and everybody rose [Laughs] before they played &#8220;Dixie,&#8221; and I remember sitting there looking around, thinking, oh, my God, you know. [Laughs] Where am I? But luckily the Civil Rights Movement--. You know, it was &#8217;63 and all kinds of stuff was going on in Gainesville, so there it was. In those days beatniks and protesters were close, [Laughs] because many beatniks were protesters and even those who weren&#8217;t partied together with activists and stuff. Now in the Civil Rights Movement I was a participant. I wasn&#8217;t a leader; I wasn&#8217;t a staff; I didn&#8217;t go to Selma; I was just a participant in local demonstrations and protests. I guess the biggest thing I did was I ran for--. We had a thing called Freedom Party which we created at the University of Florida. I forget whether that was &#8217;64 or &#8217;65. I don&#8217;t think it was &#8217;63, because I was already out of the dorm. It was probably &#8217;64. At Freedom Party we ran candidates for student government. We were going to run against the Greek stranglehold on campus, which was very conservative, and we wanted the right to collect money for Civil Rights Movement activities, pass out flyers for all the free speech stuff, mostly Civil Rights Movement free speech stuff. So we ran, and I ran, I don&#8217;t know, as sophomore representative or something on the Freedom Party ticket. That was probably the most organizational type thing I did in the Civil Rights Movement. None of us won, although we did pretty well. I don&#8217;t think any of us won. I think I&#8217;d remember if one of us won. I can&#8217;t swear to it that none of us won, but some of us did quite well, much to our surprise. Let me see; Freedom Party--. So I guess what I would say is that I went to pickets and things like that but I didn&#8217;t--. The organization that did most of the civil rights work in Gainesville was CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, although the NAACP Youth Council also was active. JW: You were also involved in the New Left, is that right? So how did you begin your involvement with the New Left? CG: [Pause] I graduated in &#8217;67. If you look on this--. I&#8217;m going to send you this movement activist biography. I can&#8217;t remember the right chronology. I was involved in a--. Now how did I get involved in this, I don&#8217;t even know. I was involved in it--. We went--. Our SDS chapter was involved in trying to help organize migrant workers in Belle Glade and Immokalee, those towns, where the famous now Immokalee Workers are, only this was the AFL-CIO, and I don&#8217;t remember what union it was, but they had were trying to organize people picking--migrant workers in Belle Glade and Immokalee. So a bunch of us went there, our SDS chapter went there. It might have been &#8217;66, &#8217;67--I just don&#8217;t remember what year it was--and we--. The organizers, who were themselves migrant workers, took us through the migrant camps to show us what life was really like and we then went back to Gainesville and sat in front of grocery stores collecting food because they were going to strike if they didn&#8217;t--. So that was an early activity. I didn&#8217;t become what you would actually call a regular organizer kind of person until I want to say &#8217;67 or &#8217;68, and what happened there was I graduated in &#8217;67, I went to work for the welfare department. Now all in through here I&#8217;m a counterculture person, right? I mean I have this long hair and beads and the whole counterculture stuff. So I go to work for the welfare department, and I suddenly am introduced to poverty in a way that I had never, ever imagined, even imagined it, in the United States. Not only am I--and this is black and white people. In all the surrounding counties, and even just outside of Gainesville in Alachua County, are very, very poor rural people, very poor. I mean poor: no indoor plumbing, no indoor electricity. This was in &#8217;67. It was also true right up through the &#8217;70s, because then I worked for the Great Society programs. Anyway, no electricity, they hauled water from a cattle trough of a neighbor to wash their clothes in, to cook in. They had big distended tummies and worms and impetigo and all, terrible, you know, I mean it really looked like photographs from the National Geographic somewhere in a very poor Third World country. Anyway, it just blew me away, and the thing that really blew me away was not so much that--. On top of the fact that these people were so very poor was the fact that they all worked their brains out, right? I mean they weren&#8217;t sitting around, drinking moonshine and being stupid. [Laughs] They worked. They either picked pecans or they picked up eggs for a chicken laying thing; all agribusiness in the South that managed to not fall under federal labor law because in the New Deal FDR made deals, right, and so agribusiness in the South got exempted from all worker&#8217;s comp and all the rest of that stuff. They cut trees and hauled pulp wood and they would have terrible accidents and they had nowhere to turn for healthcare. If you didn&#8217;t have insurance or cash you couldn&#8217;t go to a hospital then. Anyway, they worked terribly hard. All of these things were not--didn&#8217;t have to obey federal law. So they worked in a chicken plucking place where the chickens would come and this was somehow exempt. So here were these unimaginably impoverished people who worked from dawn until dusk, you know? At that point the last shreds of me that kind of believed in psychological explanations for things like poverty, right--which was really sort of the American BS, your bootstraps, and try really hard, and bad social conditions are caused by neurosis and bad childrearing and all that--the last stuff of that that I had in my head fell away, because these people were so good that they went around and collected money for their church [Laughs] when they barely had a roof over their head. They had no electricity. They had light after dark because they had pine knots which they would light, so the kids would go into school smelling like a pine knot then get teased. They grew flowers, they collected money for their church, they were like upstanding people in their personal habits [Laughs] and the way they lived their lives except for they were poor like this, and you couldn&#8217;t find anything to blame it on except the terrible conditions. There were no minimum wages and no kind of, you know, things that--. So that was sort of like the last straw for me. As a matter of fact it made me realize that I had had these ideas. My own shock made me realize that I still had a lot of BS in my head, at which point I went to see our SDS leader, and I said, &#8220;This is it; now I&#8217;m really ready.&#8221; One of them--it was two guys--the younger fellow said, &#8220;Carol, you&#8217;ve always been in the Movement. What are you talking about?&#8221; [Laughs] But at that point they could have said now you have to take minutes at all the meetings, send out the literature, do this, do that, and I would have done twice that much because I just had this big sort of shocking realization. But anyway he just blew it up. He said, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve always been in the Movement. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221; The next person I approached was an older person who was a person that we sort of greatly admired, a honcho, and he said, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad that you are feeling this way. Let&#8217;s go fuck on the steps of Tigert Hall,&#8221; [Laughs] which was the University administration building where we demonstrated a lot, you know. Anyway, I didn&#8217;t do that. Then finally Judy, who was the person who organized me into the Movement--. The next person I talk to is Judy, who takes me seriously [Laughs] right, and recruits me to--. Our black power people in &#8217;67 and &#8217;68 were all getting arrested and sent to jail for very long sentences with ridiculously high bail and we she was organizing people to go and pack the courthouse where sentencing would come for one of them, and I said, &#8220;Well all right, I&#8217;ll go sit in the courthouse but I&#8217;m not going to go to the demonstration afterwards because I think she really hit that cop.&#8221; This is how stupid I still was. [Laughs] Now this was like a woman who was five, two. Now why did she hit this cop? There had been a demonstration. Joe Waller, his now name is Omali Yeshitela and he still leads a black power group, a black nationalist group, but he gave a speech at this rally and he was arrested then for inciting to riot, which there had been no riot, but he just gave a fiery speech. He didn&#8217;t say go shoot white people or go burn down buildings or anything like that. Anyway, nobody rioted. So the police tried to arrest him; he ran; Carol Thomas hid him in her house; the police came and there was some fracas at the door. I don&#8217;t remember whether she actually hit him or not, but it didn&#8217;t make any difference. The whole reason that he was getting arrested was bogus BS, you know, and he certainly wasn&#8217;t hurt, the policeman. [Laughs] So anyway in the course of packing the courthouse and talking to the other people and to Judy I began to realize all this so then I went to the demonstration, then one thing led to another. At that point the main work that the New Left did was to try to organize support for black power, so I drove kids to the jail to visit black power people who were in jail. I collected bail money. When was the coup in Greece? That was an early demonstration too. The University of Florida was either training or giving research money or something to this thing called the Greek Institute which was supporting the generals who had just had the coup in Greece. I remember us all--that was a very early one. That along with the support of black power, and then of course we did all the other things that the New Left did. We protested the War; we took over the administration building; so I did typical. I did what the New Left did. JW: I&#8217;ve read that you also were active with making referrals for abortions at the University of Florida? CG: Right. I wasn&#8217;t in any movement doing this, and if you had asked me why was I doing this, what was going on, I would have said, oh, we&#8217;re restricted in dorm curfews and we can&#8217;t get abortions and stuff like that because of Victorian morality, a hangover of [Victorian morality], or something like that. When Judy first started talking to me she was writing a paper to take to the first conference, which was at Sandy Springs, the first Women&#8217;s Liberation Conference, and she said, &#8220;You know, Carol, we&#8217;re oppressed as women as well as all this other stuff,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Get out of here. I&#8217;m not oppressed. [Laughs] What are you talking about?&#8221; was my reaction to it. But I was curious about her paper, which was &#8220;Toward a Female Liberation Movement.&#8221; Finally I decided I would go with her to this conference and she said, &#8220;If you go you have to write a paper of your own and give it,&#8221; and I went, and the rest is history on the women&#8217;s liberation front. But the abortion referrals; it was &#8217;63, I was in my dorm, and my roommate got pregnant. She was a blonde, blue-eyed Southern girl to the max and she was just freaking out. She said, &#8220;My mother will kill me.&#8221; I was a beatnik from New York. I thought I knew somebody who knew somebody, you know. So I said, &#8220;Well maybe we could do something about it.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yeah, well let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; So we then began to collect money to pay for this abortion. [Laughs] We got contributions; we put out the word. That&#8217;s where my second boyfriend came. He wasn&#8217;t my boyfriend then. He brought his whole tuition scholarship to donate to us, whereupon I fell in love with him. [Laughs] Anyhow, it was part of breaking the curfews at the dorm, wearing pants on campus, because you had to wear a dress between 9:00 and 5:00 or else you got what was called an offense slip. Someone came up to you and handed you an offense slip and when you got three offense slips you were what was called &#8220;campused,&#8221; which meant that you couldn&#8217;t leave the dorm for forty-eight hours on the weekend. Now what is that? It&#8217;s really physical detention of your person, involuntary physical detention of your person for forty-eight hours because you don&#8217;t have a dress on. This wasn&#8217;t that long ago, you know. I mean it&#8217;s not the Taliban but it wasn&#8217;t great. It was on northern campuses too; it was not just in the South, although I think it was perhaps slightly heavier imposition of it and maybe it lasted a little bit longer, because studying the history of stuff at Queens College where I&#8217;m at now they had dress codes and stuff then too. They might have gotten rid of them a little sooner. But anyway, so we raised money to get Susan an abortion, or I did mostly, and she got the abortion and then because a lot of people knew that we had been raising this money women started showing up at our room, and they would be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m pregnant. Can you help me too?&#8221; So then we kind of, or I mostly, tried to help them too and raise more money. It gave me a view of what happens to college freshman girls that I never would have had before either, because there were so many, I mean a vast number. And then, you left college; that was it. You either went home and had the baby--. And you couldn&#8217;t come back as a single mom. It wasn&#8217;t like you could just have a baby and keep going to college, [Laughs] if you chose to have it, and if you chose not to have it you were risking death, and so many young women made the decision to risk death when you really think about it, because they didn&#8217;t want to have a baby right then. Anyhow, I did that even after I got out of the dorm on up through the years, simply because I knew how to do it. The last person I helped get an abortion was in 1970. The New York law had just changed and it became the model for Roe [v. Wade]. The New York law had just changed and here came--. [Pause] I&#8217;d better not say this because I don&#8217;t know if she wants everyone to know. [Laughs] I&#8217;ll just say she was the relative of a big Southern politician, whose name everybody who knows Southern history would know. He was like one of the people who stood in the schoolhouse door, you know, he was a known name in Southern politics. So I brought her to New York to get an abortion. It turned out she was a hemophiliac and she hadn&#8217;t told anybody, and she bled. She hadn&#8217;t told anybody because it cost more if you had to get transfusions and stuff and she was having like a six-month abortion. She was right to the wire. I remember us coming back home on the plane and her bleeding and drinking and I&#8217;m thinking, man, she&#8217;s going to die, and then &#8220;schmo&#8217;s&#8221; family is going to come after me, [Laughs] and it&#8217;s going to be the end of me. [Laughs] Luckily that didn&#8217;t happen; she survived and was okay. Anyway, abortion referrals; I didn&#8217;t think of it in relation to male domination or female oppression or feminism or any kind of thing like that at all, not until &#8217;67 or &#8217;68 when I began to understand feminism. I didn&#8217;t view it as a women&#8217;s liberation activity. [Laughs] It was, but. JW: So how do you think being in the South and participating in civil rights shaped your understanding of women&#8217;s liberation? CG: There were two probably big ways. One way was indirectly through Judy, which I&#8217;m going to talk some more about. If you read Judith Brown: Freedom Fighter you know some of that anyway. Judy learned all kinds of stuff in the Civil Rights Movement, which she then passed on to the rest of us, and organized on the basis of, and let me come back to that. The thing I think I learned directly on my own was the following: I learned that people can act like they&#8217;re okay about a thing, or even that they like it, when they really don&#8217;t like it at all. This is dissimulation, or whatever you call it, right? [Laughs] Because you could see, especially in the South, in a way that I had never seen in New York, black people were different. I remember one of my earliest shocks about this was in Gainesville when I first got there. If you were white and you were walking down the street and a black person was walking toward you--you&#8217;re on the sidewalk now, right--the black person would cast down their eyes, walk down off the sidewalk into the curb, into the gutter of the street, until they passed you and then they would come back onto the sidewalk. The first time this happened to me I thought, Jesus Christ, this is really incredible, because our high school was integrated by the time I came south and nobody would have thought about behaving in such a way. So it really took me by surprise and I didn&#8217;t know what to make of it either. But all of this, what people call &#8220;tomming&#8221; was in abundance in the South in a way that I had never experienced before and I really didn&#8217;t know what to make of it. Then when we began to organize for women&#8217;s liberation, I&#8217;ll never forget, one of our two main black power leaders had just gotten out of jail and he was in Gainesville and we were fixing dinner. And we were in the grocery store, and as you--well you probably don&#8217;t know because it&#8217;s not so much the same anymore but back then there were like a can of peas, or you know that famous Aunt Jemima image, right? Well a lot of products in the South and in the grocery store had images like that. They were called &#8220;Dixie Green Beans&#8221; and they&#8217;d have a smiling black person serving you some green beans, you know, and you could just look on the labels in the store. I remember saying, &#8220;Joe, look at this now,&#8221; and I had picked up a can and one was a smiling black person with a big tray of food and the other was a smiling white woman with a big tray of food, and if you looked at the smile--I wish I had both of these images--the looks on their faces were exactly alike, the same so-happy-to-serve-you smile, right? I said, &#8220;Now see, there really is--. You have to understand that women have these kinds of problems the same way,&#8221; because what Joe had gone to jail for was the city of St. Pete had put up a mural of I think it was a guy with a banjo. Anyway, it was &#8220;Scenes from the Old South that we all love,&#8221; or something like this, and one of them was with a black guy playing a banjo, and the black community had tried to get this mural changed and taken down and they had gone through channels and channels and it wasn&#8217;t getting anywhere, and Joe had finally either ripped up the mural or somehow defaced it. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know what he had done but he went to the state penitentiary for doing it. Anyway the point of this is I think I learned from the Civil Rights Movement that it was clear that because now here were African Americans fighting back and making it perfectly clear that they were totally dissatisfied with every aspect of their oppression, including how they were portrayed by white people, not just segregation and all the rest of it, but the depiction of them as less than human people, smiling all the time as white people were insulting them and stuff, you know. And I thought about women, how we were supposed to laugh at dumb jokes that guys told and even at jokes that insulted women. We would smile, and you were supposed to make the guy feel smart and ask him a lot of questions, and even if he didn&#8217;t know what he was talking about [Laughs] you were supposed to act like you were just learning so much, and all this; &#8220;boys don&#8217;t make passes at girls who wear glasses,&#8221; and you couldn&#8217;t be too smart, you know, you should be sweet at all times and all this kind of stuff; that women were not happy with this any more than African Americans were, and if you really talked to them you could find that out. We, in consciousness-raising, found that out and we called it the pro-woman line, meaning that women are really fighters and are not satisfied with this junk either, and I don&#8217;t think I would have learned that lesson as readily had it not been for the Civil Rights Movement. Then do you want me to do the part from Judy? JW: Yeah, why don&#8217;t you talk a little bit about your relationship with her? It&#8217;s Judith Brown? CG: Judith Brown. She was then Judith Benninger. She married a New Left guy, Julian Brown, and so she became Judith Benninger Brown. No, she was married to Brownie when I met her, come to think about it, so she was Judith Brown. Judith is in Patricia Due&#8217;s book--what is the name of it?--Freedom in the Family. There&#8217;s more stuff about Judith. I think it&#8217;s OneWorld/Ballantine. She wrote it with her daughter, Tananarive Due. I think Tananarive is Judith&#8217;s goddaughter. Anyhow, Judith started in the Civil Rights Movement in &#8217;63 and she became really a founding leader of women&#8217;s liberation. She and Bev[erly Jones] started working on &#8220;Toward a Female Liberation Movement&#8221; in &#8217;67, finished in &#8217;68. Judy learned all kinds of lessons from Patricia Due and another woman, Betty Wright, who was also a CORE leader in Florida, which she kind of based her organizing on and explained it, you know, everything from strategy and tactics and the whole thing to just the belief that people would rise up. People didn&#8217;t look like they would, and so if you had that kind of bedrock thing it could get you through a lot of organizing where you weren&#8217;t getting very far, because she really believed that women, just like African Americans had, who looked like they were down and out and suddenly were in motion, and she had seen this. Really she lived in a Freedom House that was shot into, which was not my experience. Although it was brave enough in Gainesville just to go to a demonstration it wasn&#8217;t the same thing as what the staff people went through by any stretch. She knew that people who appeared to be just anybody walking down the street had a set of complaints and grievances and wounds that if they could get them into a kind of a perspective they would want redress, and that you had to change social conditions to make that happen. But the belief that people would stand up for themselves if there were a movement that gave them the opportunity to do so was kind of a bedrock belief that she brought to women&#8217;s liberation, and women in &#8217;67 and &#8217;68 did not look like they were about to rise any more than the poor, black people in the South had looked. [Laughs] You had at the University of Florida a homecoming queen and all this Southern tradition--you were just drowning in it--of what ladies were supposed to be like, and I think that was really true for African American women as well as for white women. I mean African American women--. My friend Zoharah Simmons who went to Spellman--. Where can you read about--? Zoharah tells her story--. She&#8217;s Gwendolyn Simmons. Her daughter just made that terrific film &#8220;No!&#8221; about sexual abuse in the black community, Aishah Simmons. Anyway, Zoharah&#8217;s story is in a book of &#8217;60s interviews, published interviews, called Time it Was. She explains all of this. You also get a good taste of it in that Soon We Will Not Cry, the book about Rudy Doris Robinson. The young black women who went to Spellman were supposed to be ladies. I mean a white Southern lady was different than a black Southern lady, no question about it, but you were supposed to be a good girl, and you weren&#8217;t supposed to wear an afro, and you had a way you were supposed to work and a way you were supposed to behave with the white gloves and all that. [Laughs] We really got a double dose of it in the South, I think, black and white women, a different dose but a big, big dose. What&#8217;s the point here? The point is that we didn&#8217;t look like a likely constituency [Laughs] to be organizing, to be confronting the powers that be in the ways that we did. So that realization that came to many of the women&#8217;s liberation founders who were really more deeply rooted in the Civil Rights Movement that I was, they had that to start with, which was a big thing to have, a really big thing to have. So I would say that&#8217;s one thing that Judith had that she imparted to us. Another thing that she had was the belief that militancy was a good thing, not militancy for militancy&#8217;s sake but militancy would be effective; it would be a winning strategy; that confrontational approaches were going to win as opposed to legalistic approaches or lobbying. You could confront everybody from your boyfriend to the people who made the rules at the University of Florida to the Supreme Court or whoever it was; you could be confrontational about it and you should be because you&#8217;d be more likely to win. Redstockings called that &#8220;going for what we really want,&#8221; or said, &#8220;this time we&#8217;re going all the way.&#8221; But where did she learn that? I&#8217;m going to give this quote in the talk I give tomorrow. She learned it from Pat Due, and she said, &#8220;My first true movement experiences were with black women in the Civil Rights Movement who were militant,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;I saw them confront white people on white supremacy and men on male supremacy,&#8221; and if you were a young black woman leader in the Civil Rights Movement you had to confront plenty of guys about male supremacy, black and white. There are stories in Pat Due&#8217;s book--and my book too--about she and Pat--. The white volunteers and the black male volunteers are wondering how these two--and Zoharah had the same experience in SNCC. Her project in Laurel, Mississippi was called--. They dubbed it the &#8220;Amazon Project&#8221; because she was a woman leading the project, and she made rules on her project against sexual harassment. Imagine that? Guys could not chase women, especially the town women that they were trying to organize, all kinds of rules like that. Judith and Pat both had guys older than them, black and white, who reported to them. They had a security system where people had to call in and say their whereabouts by x time so they would know that everybody was accounted for, things like that. What&#8217;s the point there? Oh, oh--so being militant with them and not only militant with the guys on the project but demonstrating--. The rallies and the marches that Pat led were very confrontative. They defied--what is it when the court tells you you&#8217;re not allowed to--? Injunctions. They marched and hundreds of them would be arrested. They would be thrown into jail. They were confrontative all the way: with the police, they did civil disobedience, they had jail-ins, they were not cooperative. They didn&#8217;t negotiate with the establishment. [Laughs] And they won. I mean they won--. I don&#8217;t have to tell you the victories of the Civil Rights Movement, the &#8217;64 Civil Rights Act and the &#8217;65 Voting Rights Act, but they didn&#8217;t win those things by lobbying and legal stuff, although that certainly played a part. They won it by defying law and custom in a militant way. So Judy brought a spirit of militancy to women&#8217;s liberation. Organizing, confronting men about male supremacy was part of that. We were the radical branch. We were the women&#8217;s liberation branch, and then there was NOW, and NOW consciously said of itself: We need an NAACP for women. Polly Murray says that, Betty Friedan says that. Betty Friedan says we&#8217;re the NAACP of the women&#8217;s movement and these radical feminists over here are like the SNCC [branch]. Friedan makes that comparison in an interview. Okay, so militancy is an effective tactic; believing that people would rise up; testifying, consciousness-raising, comes in a great part from--. You know the slogan, &#8220;Tell it like it is,&#8221; right? People would come to mass meetings and they would testify. They would talk about what happened, especially people who had been in demonstrations and got arrested or some discrimination they had experienced. They would stand up in the church and they would testify about it and then another person would stand up and testify about it, and pretty soon everybody would be testifying about it and then they would sing a freedom song and then they&#8217;d be ready to roll, right? [Laughs] There&#8217;s a whole part of one of the--I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s in Judith Brown: Freedom Fighter or where it is, but it&#8217;s in my book that&#8217;s coming out, where Judy explains that Pat making her do this and telling why was she involved in this and what had happened to her, and she--. It was hard for her to learn to speak from her own experience, but she learned how to do it, and she said Pat insisting on this and teaching it to her made consciousness-raising seem like the way to go when she heard about it in the women&#8217;s liberation movement. So our Gainesville women&#8217;s liberation starts out as a consciousness-raising group. Now that&#8217;s not--. It&#8217;s for two reasons really. We learn about it from Kathie Sarachild in New York at the Sandy Springs conference, but how did Kathie learn about it? She was in SNCC in Mississippi and went through the same experiences about testifying that Judy had in North Florida, so Judy says, &#8220;When I heard Kathie talking about it I knew that was the right thing because of the experience I had had in the Civil Rights Movement.&#8221; Consciousness-raising was like a--. I don&#8217;t know. It was the premier theory-building, organizing strategy of women&#8217;s liberation. If there could be a gift from the Civil Rights Movement there couldn&#8217;t have been a better--I mean that was a big one, a really big one. There&#8217;s probably more, but you have three big ones right there. [Laughs] And my own one, of learning about dissimulation and that women were doing that. Yeah, but there&#8217;s a bunch of ones. Okay. JW: So how did you bridge your activist and academic lives? CG: [Laughs] That&#8217;s a harder one than any of these other ones, much harder. [Laughs] And I don&#8217;t know how to fully--. JW: Well I was--. CG: I can disclose it so I&#8217;ll tell you a little bit, but-- JW: Well I was--. I had seen--. CG: --it&#8217;s not going to be the whole story,-- JW: Right. CG: --let&#8217;s put it that way. JW: I had seen I guess at the University of Florida your work on male supremacy. CG: That was in &#8217;70, yeah, my first master&#8217;s thesis. It&#8217;s called &#8220;A Critical Analysis of Marxist Theory and Practice on the Woman Question.&#8221; You could also get that from Redstocking archives. You can order it. I think it&#8217;s called &#8220;Marxism Without Male Supremacy.&#8221; That was a struggle too because, Jesus Christ, first of all I was the only girl in the philosophy department. I mean I was the only female philosophy student and I had a big scholarship. I had one professor who--. Now whether he did this unconsciously or punitively I&#8217;ll never know. I was the only woman, female student, in that seminar, right? You know what a seminar is like, a graduate seminar? Okay, there&#8217;s maybe fifteen people in there and we would come in, he would have coffee and tea and all of these refreshments, and he would say, &#8220;Now Carol&#8217;s going to serve the refreshments.&#8221; [Laughs] This was &#8217;69, &#8217;70. And I had to ask the guys, &#8220;What would you like in your tea?&#8221; just like a flight attendant, you know, &#8220;Do you want sugar or cream?&#8221; etcetera, and this went on and on, and finally the guys were embarrassed by it, because we had been at them about male chauvinism and they kind of saved me. They began to take turns and pass it around. But the master&#8217;s thesis, some of us believed in women&#8217;s liberation that Marx had something to offer and we should find out what it was and use Marxism, whatever we thought was good in it, as a tool for women&#8217;s liberation, right, so we were reading Marx at a great rate, and Lenin and Mao and everybody who--Che and Fanon and all those people, and the Chinese revolution, William Hinton&#8217;s book, Fanshen--trying to look for things that they had done or ways of understanding that had helped to make change, right? So that master&#8217;s thesis was about what Marxism had to offer and it was a critique of Marx, because the Old Left and the New Left had not applied what it knew to the woman question because male chauvinism got in the way. It applied it to the national question and to factory workers and issues of class but not to issues of women, so that&#8217;s what that was about. But that was hard to--. One of the professors wouldn&#8217;t sign off after I defended it because he said it was a polemic and not academic enough because it was a polemic, right? [Laughs] Going to classes then in philosophy was like--. The belief was that women--. Now none of these guys would have said this to you directly but the idea was that--. Well the problem with all of my papers was that I wasn&#8217;t doing what they called systematic theory, that it was empiricism, and really this was a problem of women who could only think empirically. They couldn&#8217;t think abstractly, right? [Laughs] I mean, why are girls bad in math? It all comes out of this whole tradition of women not thinking logically or abstractly because we are chained to our experience, our emotions and all that kind of thing. Later on it becomes enshrined by women&#8217;s studies itself as essentialism, somehow, that we&#8217;re doing, you know, but then it was a kind of discrimination against women. Anyway, I remember coming home from class just crying, thinking I really can&#8217;t do systematic theory. How am I going to get my brain to work here? [Laughs] So it was quite an experience. I got the master&#8217;s finally but the one guy thought it was a polemic and wouldn&#8217;t sign. It was tough. That was the early days. Now then, from 1970--. I didn&#8217;t go back to school until &#8217;95, to get my PhD, so then here I am at the City University of New York, getting this PhD in American history and women&#8217;s studies, or women&#8217;s history, and there were problems then. It hadn&#8217;t gone away. That was &#8217;95 to 2004, right, so very recent. Let&#8217;s just say an important person in the department who thought well of me asked me what was I going to write my dissertation about, and I said, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to write it about the women&#8217;s liberation movement.&#8221; He just looked crestfallen and he said, &#8220;Oh, Carol, there&#8217;s already two books about that.&#8221; At this point there was Personal Politics and Alice--. JW: Daring to be Bad. CG: Daring to be Bad, right, Alice Echols. Well there were already two books about this, you know, and he thought I was a promising scholar and why would I be--? There were two books, as if this was enough. Well there must be like twenty books just about the Brooklyn Bridge. [Laughs] Which is great, the Brooklyn Bridge, but there could be--. There&#8217;s no end of how many books you could write about women&#8217;s liberation-related issues. It affects every aspect of everybody&#8217;s life and has throughout history. There are analyst interpretations of everything, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on and is still going on: looking for what women really did, trying--. You&#8217;re in the middle of it yourself. What&#8217;s the point? So, he didn&#8217;t think I should do that, and I mean part of their job is to have their graduate students, as you well know, write books that are going to reflect well [Laughs] upon the institution, and they want you to write a great book so the college will look good, and two books was enough. So there were those kinds of things without question. The other problem, which I&#8217;m not sure is a problem of male chauvinism--I don&#8217;t know--was that I had been a participant in the women&#8217;s liberation movement, so how could I be objective? So what happened was it was bad enough that I had once been a participant in it, but then a lot of people did a lot of things in the &#8217;60s, right, and then theoretically they weren&#8217;t doing it any more, right, [Laughs] because they had grown up or something. But I was, and right now, am very much an activist still. I&#8217;m in three feminist organizations, [Laughs] maybe more than that. I&#8217;m in NOW, Redstockings, and [53:42] for Women&#8217;s Liberation, which is very active, and I think social conditions still call for the kind of activism that we did in the &#8217;60s and are going to see again, surely, it&#8217;s just a matter of when. But women are not going to sit around and--. I mean I can&#8217;t--. Don&#8217;t get me started on things that are going on now. I can&#8217;t stand it. Just the Lilly Ledbetter Act. It&#8217;s great Obama signs this thing, right, but if you really look at this woman, she worked for Goodyear Tire Company for twenty-odd years as a supervisor, she gets unequal pay, the Supreme Court rules that that&#8217;s too bad because she didn&#8217;t report it earlier. Okay, Congress reverses it, the law changes, but does she get paid? She should get all of that back pay! How come they don&#8217;t make Goodyear obey the law? Goodyear should obey the law. It&#8217;s outrageous. There are at least two laws that Goodyear broke. It should be prosecuted. There&#8217;s the Equal Pay Act of &#8217;63 and then there&#8217;s the &#8217;64 Civil Rights Act and the EEOC. It broke both of those laws already. They should have to pay her back and they should be fined or something for breaking the law. Anyway, all this stuff is still alive and well, unfortunately. What&#8217;s the point? The point is I think that almost everything we did in the &#8217;60s, with very few exceptions, [Laughs] were a very good thing to do and I think we need to be doing them now, and I try as hard as I can to get people to participate in doing them now. So it was that part of myself, the fact that I was currently of that same frame of mind, which doesn&#8217;t mean I didn&#8217;t think the times called for new ways of looking at things and new ways of doing things, because I do think you have to analyze conditions that you&#8217;re in. Then we had a liberal president for most--. Since we&#8217;ve had--. I mean the right wing nut burgers have been--. You know, you have to do things a little bit differently but I still think that mass movements and masses of people in action are what ultimately are a really powerful thing that makes things change. What&#8217;s the point? So all the time I&#8217;m at the graduate center, because several of the important professors had this idea about objectivity, [and because] I already had sort of one bad mark because I had been in the movement before, [Laughs] I felt like they shouldn&#8217;t really know that I was still very much feeling the same way about things. So I sort of tried--. I didn&#8217;t talk about this whole big part of my life at school. I had a few close friends, student friends, who knew that I was still active but I tried to keep that [Laughs] out from under the nose of the PhD people, which was--it would have been better if I could have been myself, I guess is what I would say. But I&#8217;m not sure, like it might be if you were writing a dissertation about the environmental movement and you were a member of Earth First, or something, [Laughs] you might have the same problem. I don&#8217;t know. So that might not be male chauvinism. Okay, negotiating with academics. I&#8217;ll say another thing about negotiating with academics. If you read that women&#8217;s liberation or women&#8217;s studies paper you&#8217;ll see it. It irks me no end that the university is not more supportive of--and especially women&#8217;s studies departments--not just of people studying women, which is very important, but also of activism, so that if you--. I mean in New York places to meet other than your apartment are not easy to find and it&#8217;s hard to find a free place to have a meeting and stuff, and I really think that academia, especially women&#8217;s studies, and black studies too, should be more helpful and useful and grateful for their existence to the movements that--. I mean the black movement and the feminist movement could use help, just free places to meet, places to have movement things, and all the other things that we got from academia in the &#8217;60s, like use of WATS lines [Laughs] to organize events [58:50], stuff like that. I mean the sections of academia which have benefited from the social movements should be of a frame of mind to help back, because as women&#8217;s studies and all the different studies, right, which are really all products of the &#8217;60s, as budgets tighten up we know we&#8217;re going to be first to the wall. I mean a lot of women&#8217;s studies around the country don&#8217;t even have their own departments, their own administrators. They&#8217;re interdepartmental, which is both good and bad. I mean the more of a staff that you have and the more tenured lines that you can provide the more likely you are to be around when the budget ax falls, and I think we&#8217;re going to see this happening in women&#8217;s studies and [African] studies and all those. The only people who are going to defend keeping those things are going to be movement people. The unions may defend it a little bit; we&#8217;ll see. But, okay, so that&#8217;s another thing about negotiating academia. [Laughs] JW: Are there problems in women&#8217;s studies that arose that you did not anticipate, as an activist, as someone coming from the movement, something that surprised you, especially since you took time off? CG: Yeah, a lot of stuff surprised me, if you want to open this Pandora&#8217;s Box. For one thing, [sighs] so much of women&#8217;s studies stuff is written in gobbledy gook, you know, aco-babble, I call it. It ought to be written--. And that&#8217;s a reflection of the fact that it&#8217;s being written for other people in women&#8217;s studies and not for the broad reading public, and this is a problem about public scholars and all this kind of thing, people like DuBois, people who as members of oppressed constituencies who go to school and get privileges that you&#8217;re going to give back to your own people by helping them. It&#8217;s a movement thing, even the black women&#8217;s club movement, Lifting As We Climb, all of that kind of stuff. I mean women once were not even allowed into public schools, and then there were quotas. I mean the Second Wave brought class action lawsuits against the whole state university systems of Florida, of California, of New York, because there were quotas. [This] many women could go to school and after that, too bad for you, not to mention that we weren&#8217;t taken seriously as students because we were just there to get what was called an &#8220;MRS degree,&#8221; you know. [Laughs] Even yet and still Larry Summers, who should be drowned, says that women can&#8217;t do well in math back when he was president of Harvard. But what&#8217;s the point here? The point is that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to even get undergraduate degrees much less graduate degrees were it not for movements of the First Wave and the Second Wave, so those doors having been opened to us essentially by movements, the least we could do, it seems to me, is if we learned something we should make it such that the broad public, not just women but men and everybody, could benefit from it. It&#8217;s like you owe back that to the people who made it possible for you to get it. And when you write in this--I don&#8217;t mean you personally [Laughs]--but when one writes in this Derrida, Lacan, and Foucault stuff, style, no one can understand it except another person who--. I mean I think France has given us a lot of things, like Simone de Beauvoir, [Laughs] the Statue of Liberty, and whatnot, but those guys are not--. But let&#8217;s say I believed in post-modernism and all of that, then if I really believed it was a good thing for people to know I would try to write and talk about it in an way that other people could understand it, instead of writing so that it&#8217;s just impossible to understand. So that really surprised me. In &#8217;95, when I went back to school at CUNY, that was in full sway. It&#8217;s kind of waning a little bit, I think, thank goodness. [Laughs] But I thought, &#8220;What is this crap? Is this what we fought for?&#8221; [Laughs] Anyway, what else? I was pleased to see that women&#8217;s studies had really blossomed. At CUNY you could get a PhD in women&#8217;s history, a PhD just in women&#8217;s history, which really seemed a good thing to me. You want to know what surprised me about women&#8217;s studies? That&#8217;s what you asked? JW: Yeah. CG: Okay. JW: Or also what alliances developed that you maybe didn&#8217;t expect? CG: I don&#8217;t know what alliances developed, but I&#8217;ll tell you a nice thing. I think this probably at least once a week, when I&#8217;m on campus at Queens. There are your students, right, and they&#8217;re like nineteen and twenty and twenty-one, and especially because I teach women&#8217;s studies but I also teach contemporary American history, so I teach a course I created on the &#8217;60s called &#8220;America in the &#8217;60s,&#8221; right, everybody talks about hippies, and here are all these students talking about bra burners and hippies and stuff, and you look at them and they look exactly like hippies, right? [Laughs] They look like bra burners and hippies. They have body tattoos all over them, they&#8217;re dressed in jeans and t-shirts and sandals and sneakers, and it just tickles me, and I&#8217;m so pleased with it because it&#8217;s so nice to just be able to sit in a class and be comfortable and not worry about what you have on and looking a certain way. There they are, just casual, especially the young women in their jeans and sneakers, [and] I think, mm, you know, that&#8217;s pretty good, and I&#8217;m glad I protested the Miss America contest, you know? [Laughs] So I think the positive changes that have become so much a part of the landscape that people don&#8217;t even realize it had anything to do with women&#8217;s liberation, the successes that were so successful that they don&#8217;t even appear to be products of the movement, they&#8217;re so much a part of--just that there are women professors and you can study women&#8217;s history and nobody thinks you&#8217;re out of your mind. They think maybe two books is enough, [Laughs] but it&#8217;s been recognized as something that is a genuine field that needs more investigation--not too much investigation, two books, right? [Laughs] But anyway, that students themselves aren&#8217;t trapped in this same, quite such a limiting way of having to look and be. Female students speak up, and they don&#8217;t even realize themselves, I don&#8217;t think, that they have a kind of consciousness that was literally not there in the &#8217;60s. There was no such--. I mean I didn&#8217;t have it. I didn&#8217;t think women are oppressed, women are a constituency with a certain set of needs and wrongs that need to be righted and all of that. They now think that. They&#8217;re not feminists, although a lot of them are not as afraid of saying that they&#8217;re feminists as the media would have you believe, but they&#8217;re not activists, I guess is what I would say, but they certainly have a feminist consciousness. I mean if some guy tells them girls can&#8217;t do this or that and the other thing they don&#8217;t believe that at all. They&#8217;re the first to tell them that. They know that there&#8217;s something called sexual harassment and that it&#8217;s wrong and that it shouldn&#8217;t happen to them, and they want to have careers, and they think that nobody should discriminate against them if they become pregnant. They use the morning after pill, they don&#8217;t want to have children right away, they think that birth control--. I mean out on the far edges of should twelve-year-olds be able to get it without a prescription, you could have some argument, but in the main they definitely support birth control, family planning, abortion, whatever. They think they should be treated equally and they have some understanding of what that means so they&#8217;re already like, here, whereas in the &#8217;60s--. I mean Judy started with me with a head full of junk, and as we organized--. I mean people needed to lose a lot of illusions, and the young women today don&#8217;t have anywhere near that many, the students that I encounter anyway don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re much more conscious, which is very good, very good. JW: Well that&#8217;s all the questions I had,-- CG: Okay. JW: --but are there questions that I didn&#8217;t ask that you thought I would that you would like to consider, or anything else that you want to add? CG: I&#8217;ll tell you one thing that you might ask. I don&#8217;t know the answer to it. [Laughs] I mean I wish I did know the answer to it. Maybe if you ask more people you&#8217;ll come up with some answers to it of your own. I wish that more of the women who came into things, who were founding people in the &#8217;60s, right, women who dared to have ideas that really sounded ridiculous, who dared to throw bras in a trash can, I wish that more of them--and it&#8217;s not just the women. I wish that my SDS colleagues, I wish that all of us &#8217;60s activists were active. Now some are. You can look at the progressive Democrats and there&#8217;s Tom Hayden and Carl Davidson, another SDS leader. Some are, but many are not. Too many are not, let&#8217;s put it that way. When I first came up to New York one of the things I intended to do as well as get this PhD, when I came back to New York from the South, I intended to try to reactivate the founding women. I had already tried to do this in Gainesville without very much success and was looking forward to trying to do it in New York, and I haven&#8217;t gotten very far. As I began to agitate for women&#8217;s liberation in New York in the &#8217;90s it was young women that came forward. So we have a whole bunch of radical feminists now that I work with and they&#8217;re all less than half my age. Why--? Well you&#8217;re interviewing one person. If I were you, if you interview people like what&#8217;s-her-name, the League of Women--. JW: Keller Barron. CG: Keller, or older people, ask them if they&#8217;re still--I hate this &#8220;still active&#8221;--if they&#8217;re active today, why is it, and if they&#8217;re not active today, why? Do they think everything is solved and they&#8217;re happy with the way things are? And if they are active today, not only why are they active but why do they think such a number of the people that they worked with in the beginnings of things are no longer active? I&#8217;d like to know the answer to that. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know the answer to it. If you want to know why I&#8217;m still active I really don&#8217;t know. I remember when that feminist memoir book was coming out and my friend, Shulie Firestone, didn&#8217;t want to submit a memoir and she said, &#8220;Carol, why don&#8217;t you do one in my place?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to submit a memoir, Shulie. It seems like that&#8217;s something you do after it&#8217;s over.&#8221; [Laughs] And then when they started this veteran feminist project and they did this big--what&#8217;s-her-name? I can&#8217;t think of her name. Barbara Love. I had to have my arm twisted to submit a thing to that. I don&#8217;t feel like a--. I mean I guess I feel a little like a veteran but to me a veteran is after the war is over, then you become a veteran and it seems to me that we&#8217;re still fighting this war, but obviously a whole lot of people feel like memoirs are a good idea and being a veteran feminist. There&#8217;s Veteran Feminists--. My dear Jacquie Ceballos, right, who was at the Miss America protest with us from NOW, organized a group called Veteran Feminists of America, which goes around giving awards and celebrating people for what they did back then. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s all very nice to do that but I can&#8217;t understand why--. I&#8217;m not doing it now because of a sense of duty at all. I&#8217;m doing it because it&#8217;s still fascinating. It&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s more interesting than academia really. I mean figuring out what women did and people did in the past is very, very interesting, there&#8217;s no question. The kind of research you&#8217;re doing about Appalachian women and the labor movement and stuff, I mean it&#8217;s [free] and fascinating, and the research I just did for my dissertation and my book was fascinating too, I have to say, but trying to change the world out there in the world is even more fascinating. It&#8217;s the most interesting thing in the world. You see people and here they&#8217;re staying stupid things like, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ll sit in the courtroom but I won&#8217;t protest.&#8221; And then how they get from there to where they&#8217;re actually in the demonstration, and are you able to make them understand that? Are you able to get that understanding in people? I don&#8217;t know; I couldn&#8217;t think of anything more interesting that I could do, and I&#8217;m very interested in a great many things. I really would like to write this second book, I feel like--. Anyway, there&#8217;s lots of things I&#8217;m interested in. I like the opera and the ballet and stuff, [Laughs] but none of it is as interesting as movement activism is. But why did these other folk lose interest in it? I don&#8217;t know what went wrong, and I don&#8217;t know why it still interests me and there are so many people it doesn&#8217;t seem to interest, so that&#8217;s the burning question that I&#8217;m curious about now. If you come up with an answer--. [Laughs] When you interview the older ones you should ask them, or the ones that were active, even in the &#8217;80s, like the ERA person, or whoever you&#8217;re going to--. If they&#8217;re not active now, what made that change happen? I think that&#8217;s instructive. I mean it&#8217;s instructive for me as an organizer because I&#8217;m trying to organize people but also I think as a researcher, why did people stop is an important question...
