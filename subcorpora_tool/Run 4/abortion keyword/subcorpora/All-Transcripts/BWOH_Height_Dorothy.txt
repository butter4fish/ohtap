 ï»¿Polly Cowan: Dorothy Height: pÂ°lly Cowan: Dorothy Height: This is an interview with Dorothy I. Height conducted by Polly Cowan. Miss Height is president of the National Council of Negro Women. The interview begins on Febuary 11, 1974. Betty Barnes is also present. You see, both of my sisters knew me all their life, but as I remember them, they were both women. I don't remember them as children. I had no contact with them. They must have been associates, relationships... Did you have Yes, you see, when I have to describe it to you this way, it's interesting. The reality is that I know that we are half brothers and sisters, but I have no sense of their being half brothers and sisters. I just have a sense of getting to know them later in my life; but I knew my little sisterâthat's the only feeling I have. pÂ°lly Cowan: Dorothy Height: PÂ°lly Cowan: Now, my sister Josephine, who is the child of my mother's second marriage, tells me how she was the only one who really had to care for me, she and my older sister, you know, when I was first born. She used to have to take me around, she and one of her little playmates. Because your mother was working? Yes, my mother was a nurse in a hospital in Richmond, Virginia. She tells stories about how she and her friends practically decided that they would just throw me over into the James River. They just couldn't move around. They had to look after these little ones and so on. But none of that is in my recollection; I couldn't say that I remember any of that. I think this is before you came, Betty [Barnes]. I said that all I know from the beginning is that Dorothy was born in 1912 in Richmond, and moved to Rankin in 1916, which she says is correct. Now, I don't know how old you were when you started school, whether you went to kindergarten, thoseï»¿2 PC: DH: PC DH PC DH PC: DH: (cont.) things I don't know. No, there was no kindergarten in my town. I went to schoolâjust regular school. Did you go at the age of five? No, I don't think so. Six? I imagine. Whenever you started school. Well, people weren't very early childhood education conscious. Betty and I wondered, because 1918 came right after that, whether the First World War had any impact that you could remember on your family, on your brothers? The greatest fact I remember is what they called "the transportation." The steel mills all transported black men from the South to work in the mills. Because my father was very active in Baptist circles and things of that sort, I guess, our house was kind of a meeting ground or something, so I was very conscious of people coming and going, and I was very conscious of the steel mills. I guess I was about seven or eight when my aunt, one of my mother's three sisters, Mrs. Sally White, came up from Virginia to live with her son. He worked at one of the mines; I don't know where, but somewhere close by. It was singular that she was the only one of my mother's sisters who could neither read nor write, but that was because at a very early age she had dropped out of school, because she had worked for a white family down in King William County, Virginia. She really became a very unusually good pastry cook, an excellent one. At that time she was still living in Virginia, and I remember she came to Rankin to look for her son Lincoln, who was working in the mine, and I came home from school and there was a telegram. She didn't know what a telegram was, so she gave it to me, and I read it. It said that this was to inform the family that Lincoln White had been lost in the cave-in in the mine. So I told her that this was for my mother. So my mother came home and I told her about it. Then she explained it to my aunt. I always remember that because my aunt always feltâ used to say, that I was a little old lady. I felt very close to my Aunt Sally because that tragedy occurred, and I didn't really know quite what I was doing, but I knew that I couldn't read it to her. She always appreciated that, because it would have been such a shock. She had just arrived. So we lived with the impact of the coal mines and the steel industry all around, and people coming and going and being lost in the mines, and...ï»¿3 & BB: Did your mother work in a hospital in Rankin? No. When she went to Pittsburgh she was not able to get into any sort of hospital work, so she worked for a private familyâfor private familiesânursing cancer people. The ones that she worked the longest for were the Johnstons. It's very interesting, a few years ago I was in that symposium in the Ladies Home Journal, and I recently looked to find the letter, but I've lost it, from Mary Johnston, whom I learned both to like and to hate because it almost seemed to me that at every important event in my life, my mother had to be at her house, and so on. I liked her because she had a long narrow foot and I thought, beautiful new shoes, nice clothes. [laughter] PC: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH PC But she took your mother away from you. I was always appearing on some programâor if it was my mother's day at school, my mother was over there. But she [Mary Johnston] wrote me a beautiful letter saying that she was now very active in the Presbyterian church in Pittsburgh, and she saidâit's a lovely letter, and when I was moving I really looked for it, but it got away from me somehowâin which she was saying how her life and mine were always tied together, and how her mother took pride in whatever I was doing. She always recognized that her mother would send meâI remember having a beaver hat when beaver hats were very elegant, only rich girls had them. She would do things like that, you know, if I got a special prize or something, she would send me... Your mother was working for her all through that high school period then when you were getting... I guess so. She's the one that I remember the most, because she meant the most, and this girl in writing me said, "I'm sure that from wherever both of them are, that both of them would be rejoicing at this," whatever this honor was that had come to me at that time. Let's see, my dates say you left high school in 1927, is that right? No, no... high school? Yes, '23,'24,'25... You must have left in '26. No... Yes, I guess you're right, '27. There were twelve years of school, unless you skipped grades. Yes, that was one of Betty's questions. * Betty Barnesï»¿DH Yes, there were twelve years of school. I thought you skipped grades. DH PC BB DH PC DH: BB: DH: BB DH PC BB DH PC DH: PC: DH: PC: I finished early because I had two double promotions. Yes, I guess you're right. Would that be '26? And went right to NYU. Do you remember when you got your A.B. from NYU? I thought, '33, about. You were way before that. When did you get your M.A? Let's move backward.. '33. There was no break, you stayed right at NYU? I did four years of college in three years. Yes, and I stayed right straight through because I had a four-year college scholarship, so they let me take the fourth year for a master's. Was that an NYU scholarship? No, it was an Elks scholarship. That covers the four years... And was your master's in educational psychology? Yes, educational psychology. All right, I know that you went to Oxford, but I don't know if you went right to Oxford from graduate school? No, no, no. I went to Oxford in 1937, in connection with the World Conference of Churches... And then I remained to take a seminar. I have that you were a delegate to the International Youth Conference. Wasn't that it? Yes, it was the World Conference on Life and Work of the Churches. I'm sorry, I interrupted you. When did you go to the Emma Ransom [YWCA Residence in Harlem]? You see, I'm confused about your first job. You've told us marvelous stories about Bronxville but that wasn't your first job.ï»¿5 Brownsville, Brownsville... Brownsville was practice teaching when I was at NYU. My first jobâI was assigned in 1933, when I was still at NYU, to the field work service for religion and social work to Brownsville Community Center in Brownsville, at 187 Oswald Street. I was assigned there in a very strange way. There was a woman, Mrs. Orrin R. Judd, who... Years before when I was in high school and active in Rankin at the Rankin Christian Centerâthis is at the Christian Centerâat that time the Center allowed black participation on Thursdays only. But I lived across the street from the Center, and I went up to the woman who was in charge. I'd watched what was going on with the little children, and so I went over and I saw her. I knew how to tell Bible stories. I asked her if she'd like me to come and tell Bible stories. I must say you had a great deal of nerve. I got a message from her just a month agoâI can't think of her name at the moment, but she was very cordial to me. And I said I'd come on Thursdays, but I noticed that they had these classes for little children going along, so she said if I'd like to, sure, just come in. So I went in and I started telling Bible stories to these little classes. And one day some people came who had funded the Rankin Christian Center, and they were quite intrigued. I really was the only black person around there. They asked me a lot of questions. I told them I lived across the street, and I liked to tell Bible stories. I liked to read stories and talk to children, and so forth. They were very much interested. It was strange that when I was sent to the Brownsville Community Center to work, within a few months, Mrs. Orrin R. Judd appeared out there; her husband and she were very much interested in this center. There were some Baptist auspices and they were Baptists, so she came in and discovered that I was there. And the head of the center said that I'd been there as a field worker, but they wished that I could remain and work with them. So Mrs. Judd appropriated the great amount of twenty dollars a month, which I was paid to work at Brownsville Community Center. Was that the practice teaching? No. I went out of practice teaching into being assistant to the director. I have to say, all the time that I was in graduate school and college, it was in the midst of the depression, and I sought all kinds of employment opportunities. I worked in a factory. I did jobs waiting tables. I did all sorts of things, tried doing them anyway. Even when you were in college?ï»¿6 DH: BB: DH: PC: DH: BB: DH: PC: Yes. My cousin used to do the laundry for several Broadway shows; she found that I was good at personal ironing, so she let me do the shirts for Eddie Cantor, and I did that. I used to do the bow ties for Simple Simon, you know. 1 used to do work like that. I did laundry and things of that kind that I could do around the edges of things. I used to write obituaries for a funeral parlor in Harlem. I did some proofreading on Marcus Garvey's newspaper. I was always looking for work. I used to writeâyou know, I used to do things like letter writing, things of that sort. But once I got that assignment at Brownsville Community Center, I could say that I've never since looked for a job... Never applied for a job since that day. May I ask a little different kind of question? Again, I get a picture, Dorothy, of great initiative and vitalityâthis is by the time you're a very young adultâand yet I notice in the biography, in that, you refer to having had asthma and to thinking of yourself as shy. Could you give just a little more picture... Yes. That is true, plus the fact that I was shy. When I came to NYU, I was exceedingly shy, and I, yes, I'd had asthma. As a matter of fact, all of my early childhood I had very severe asthma. I had asthma to the extent that there were periods of two or three weeks when I just never could go to bed. I would sit in a big chair and there used to be a big hood that they would put over my head, and something, Asthmador that I would smoke, you know; they would light it and you would take the fumes from it, and things of that sort. Yet, year after year, I was never absent and never tardy from school, so that now I wonder sometimes whether what was weakness in my childhood did not develop some kind of constitutional strength. I don't know, because... The asthma was when you were very young, not in college? No, elementary school. And you had outgrown it? All through my elementary school, yes. By the time I got to college, I had got better. But all through my elementary school, I used to go to school and would not have been able to go to bed all night, but I would go to school and I could sit in the classroom. You know, my eyes would tear so that I couldn't see the board or anything; I used to just sit there and listen and try to memorize what people were saying. That may have been a strength too, because your memory is so good.ï»¿7 DH: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Well, it's fascinating. I look back now and seeâif you'd see my school record, you'd see no absence, no tardiness, and yet all the way through that period I would have hadâyou know, this was a real thing. In the last years, I used to have quinsy sore throats. I think that toward the latter part of elementary school, it kept me out of school for a few days, but...first of all, I loved school, and I could somehow get up whatever it took during the day to get to school. Now, when I came to high school, I think I would say I was shy because... The kinds of things that I learned to do, even as a small child, having this bronchial condition meant that even when X played house, or played school, I'd want to be the principal, so I didn't have to move around. I'd do that kind of thing. I used to play at medicine, find birds that were injured, try to put them together, things of that sort. I liked reading and things that one could do by oneself, and I also developed quite a repertoire of the black poets. I liked to memorize poetry. I entered all sorts of spelling bees and Bible contests. Was your younger sister like you, or was she very different? Did she also care very much about school? She didn't have that kind of taste for school, and she also had a little bit of a handicap, because whatever class she came into, people would say, "Well, you know, Dorothy..." I just wondered. Poor woman! It was a tough act to follow. So she would say that she had more of a flair for dramatics. We were both musical. I used to sing and that sort of thing. By the time I got to high school, I played basketballâboth girls' and boys' rules in basketball. I used to play girls' rules in the day, and boys' rules at the Christian Center or some other place. By that time I was vigorous; I was thin but vigorous, and I always had a full schedule-I mean, I cannot remember when I didn't have. My mother used to try to get my schedule together, but in high school I was always in the glee club and Latin club and basketball, and all kinds of athletics. Now I've got that straight. You're talked several times about basketball as really something you enjoyed doing. Was it your favorite sport? Yes. I have a question here about when you joined the national Christian Youth Movement, what year, do you remember? It was organized in 1934, and I was one of the first officers of the United Christian Youth Movement. I was the vice-chairman for North America.ï»¿8 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: About that same time when it was organized? I came into office in '35... You were working where then? By that time, I was working for the Department of Welfare of the City of New York... Oh Betty, we don't have that, do we? Well, I continued to work in the Brownsville Community Center, and I became assistant to the director. Was this after you finished graduate school, or while you were still in? While I was finishing, that was 1934, and I was the assistant directorâ actually starting in '33. Then as I became assistant to the director, I supervised about twenty WPA workers and the interesting thing was, they were making more per week than I was making per month. But by this time, I had helped the director to organize the Christian Center, and so we began a church there called the Universal Baptist Church. In Brownsville? In Brownsville, in the Center. Now, that was an area that was a population of some 35,000, predominantly Jewish, and the next group was black. What had happened was that most of the blacks who had come to Brownsville were from the South or the West Indies, and they had adapted themselves to the Jewish culture. As a result, they made the fires for the Jewish familiesâit was the height of the depressionâor they were on relief or something of that kind. So that on Sundays they acted as though it was a Monday. We started with themâthis was under the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation. We started Sunday school at six o'clock, then we moved it to four, then to twoâin time we got it to ten o'clock in the morning. So the church began to play sort of a little something. You know, we never could quite count on them. By this time, I really felt that I had to get a job, and I was referred to the Department of Welfare. Well, I did some special work with the Bureau of Charities. One of the supervisors there was astounded to find that I was working out of a mission center without a real salary of any kind, so she sent me to the Department of Welfare. I went to the Department of Welfare for something that was going on, like a conference. I forget what it was. One of the people there spoke with me, and then told me to come over and talk with her, and I went and she gave me a job as an investigator. So I started in as an investigator for the Department of Welfare, and then later I was an intake interviewer. Then I was in charge of intake. Then that led to...ï»¿Is that what led to the New York School of Social Work? Yes. Then I got a special study thing for the New York School. I was going to the New York School. I took first some courses with Lindemann at the New York School, and... Well, Lindemann was at Russell Sage, but doing special work [at the New York School] on philosophy of social work. I had a real bent toward philosophy you know, whether religious or social or whatever. But in the meantime, the Department of Welfare, where I was working as an investigator, placedme out in Brownsville, and of course they had all of the unemployment of domestics and so forth. And so there was a supervisor who oversaw my work, who placed me in charge because I could handle all of the, what do you call them, the...protest groups. So I used to have a regular schedule of meeting with all the groups who came protesting, the Unemployment Councils. But later she [the supervisor] was transferred, and Anne Rebeck, head of the Brooklyn borough office, decided that they were going to make a study of the job of the supervisor. I had been teaching some courses at the Friends' Seminary, and therefore, while I didn't have a job like that, the church was paying me something. I was also earning something for teaching at the Friends' Seminary. I was teaching in the Fort Greene Training School for Religious Education, and I was doing some courses at Columbia University in religious education... You were studying... Teaching. So with all of this, you see, I had my hands full. I felt that I didn't want to give up the course I was teaching at Friends' Seminary when I'd taken the job as investigator, but when I got into the jobâat that time they worked a half day on Saturdays and my course was on Saturdays. So this Mrs. Rebeck finally asked anybody in the district office who wished to work with her on this study of the role of the supervisor, to let her know, and I volunteered for it. Then she gave me permission to finish this course. But I volunteered for it, and my job was to sit at her desk, and to do an hour by hour analysis of what the supervisor of a district office does, and I did this. And she was amazed because, as I said, I very quietly moved around, and I didn't have very much to say, and so she was so amazed. They were sent in from all the district offices, and the borough office called her and said, "What's the background of this person?" Well, of course, what had happened to me was that from my field work days right straight through, I'd had an exposure to some of the problems, and that, I guess, was reflected in what I would see. Many of them would say, "She signed forms for Consolidated Edison; she approved such and such." But I sort of related her telephoneï»¿10 (cont.) calls to what I knew about the communities and what I knew was happening, and I therefore related her desk to the Brownsville community, because I happened to know the community. So then instead of saying "She might speak to Mr. Sullivan," instead of saying that, she'd write down the name and just pass me a slipâ it would say Sullivan and such and such. Then I would look at that and I would know that that was Sullivan who was the head of the Unemployment Council, and then I would put down that she spent this amount of time dealing with dissident groups in the community who were opposing this, that, or the other, or who were demanding that dental services be provided, or such and such and such. As a result, the borough office asked her to transfer me to the borough office and I became a special investigator. Now, a special investigator has to deal with fraud and all kinds of "things like that, but I was asked to make a study of the first one hundred families accepted for poor relief in the Borough of Brooklyn, to determine where they were at that point. So then after that, when I finished that study, I was promoted to a supervisor of another district office. Still in Brooklyn? Still in Brooklyn, but requested by the woman for whom I had done the analysis of the job of supervisor. So then, when I went back to do that jobâto work with Mrs. Kaunitzâshe was very helpful to me. She was a Jewish woman. Her husband was a doctor. She lived on Central Park West. She found it very difficult to deal with groups in the communityâthe unemployed, who were protesting or who would come and sit in and do things of that sortâso that she would call me at home and I would meet her, as we would ride on the subway, talk about what was going on. And so that was why she would assign me to difficult spots or rough spots, or where there were real problems. Then the 1935 riots in Harlem took place, and there was a strong demand from the Harlem community, saying that a part of the problem was that a little over 6 percent of the population was producing 42 percent of the welfare clientele, and there was no representation of blacks in key posts in the welfare system. So that out of that protest came the request that we place a person to work with those problems, and Anna Hedgeman was designated to be the minority representative in the Department of Welfare. But that <3idn't satisfy, because they said that really the district offices were where the personnel was. Charlotte Carr then was the administrator of welfare. She asked to have somebody placed there, and Mrs. Kaunitz recommended me. I was on vacation. I returned.ï»¿11 (cont.) I was summoned to the central office, and I became the first black person to be a personnel supervisor. I was placed not in charge of the Harlem office, but in charge of all central office servicesâ the medical, the health, the nutritional, home economics, ophthalmologists, insuranceâevery specialized service for four or five other district offices, but none was in Harlem. So it was in that post that I remained until I went to work for the YWCA in 1937. PC: DH: I also have Oxford in 1937. In 1937, I accepted a job with the Greater New York Council of Churches to become director of Youth Services, and resigned. Because what I discovered was, that though I was interested in social welfare and the work that I was doing, I was working all day at one job, and then I was spending all my evenings and weekends at the United Christian Youth Movement and in all those related activities... PC: You decided to take a job that had a religious base to it. DH: BB: Yes, because what I discovered was that my interests were not just in doing things, but that I had a keen desire to see the relation between faith and action. And so, what was happening to me was that I was working all day in a job under public auspices, and then in the evenings and weekends and every chance I got, I was busy... So therefore I resigned when I was offered this job. At that time I was president of the Christian Youth Council of the state of New York, as well as the vice-chairperson of the United Christian Youth Movement of North America, and it was not a Sunday school type of thing. For instance, my chief interest was in economic order, so I was going to the Labor Temple and learning about economics, and the relation between the economy and life and work, that sort of thing. So what happened was that I was selected as the person from the United Christian Youth Movement to be one of the ten American youths to participate in a World Conference on Life and Work of the Church, held at Oxford, England. There were only two girls in the group, and two young black men and myself, and the ten of us went. There were young people from some thirty-five countries. I participated in this, and then remained to take a special seminar in international concerns. When I returned to the United States, I had a letter from Mrs. Cecelia Cabaniss Saunders, who was the branch executive of the YWCA in Harlem, asking me to come in and see her. Well, I had seen this letter there for a whileâI thought it was something about membership, so I didn't open it immediately. But then after I got in touch with Mrs. Saunders, I discovered that she had a job as an assistant to her, as the executive of the branch, that she wanted to talk with me about. You knew Mrs. Saunders before?ï»¿12 ^H: x knew who she was. I was suprised to realize that she knew me, but on the other hand, I shouldn't have been, because I was also carrying a major leadership in the Harlem Christian Youth Council which organized some eighty-eight youth groups. At that time, in the day of the United Front, it included not only the Christian groups but other groups including the Young Communist League and others. So we had quite a lot of conferences and marches and protests, and I don't know what all in the Harlem community. And I'd taken an active part in the work that Adam Powell had initiated, to open up stores on 125th Street. I was working in all these things, so I guess that's how she got to know me. DH: BB: DH: BB: DH: DH: BB: DH; May I ask a background questionâall the time that you were in college, you were living in Harlem? Oh yes. I lived with my sister in Harlem. And all the time you were working in Brownsville. So this was your neighborhood. Harlem was my neighborhood, oh yes. So even as a young person when you were first a joiner and not a leader, you were joining groups in Harlem? Well, I was joining groups, but I was alsoâas Kenneth Clark said to me just a few months ago, "You know, at that time, with all this talk of women's liberation," he said, "we were all very active in the Harlem Christian Youth Council. But now, you are my leader." That happened rapidly, but at any rate, that was your home base. My home base was Harlem. I knew the 140-some churches in the Harlem community. I was in and out of them; I knew the people. In addition to everything else, one of the ways that I had earned some of my living was that I had been sort of a visiting teacher for the Daily Vacation Bible Schools under the Federation of Churches. And so I taught, did the teacher training for church school leaders. I went into all of these places. One of the twists in my own education was that at one point, I thought that I'd like to major in religious education, and I went in to Dr. Samuel Hamilton to tell him so. And he told me that the church was not ready for a woman, and the black church was least ready. Do you agree with that? Yes, I do. And he followed me and he said, "You have too good a mind to concentrate on religious education. Study as much as you want, butï»¿13 (cont.) find something where you can make a living." But he made a very important point. He said, "You don't ever need to be outside the church." I realized that one could carry a role in the church without being employed by it. I guess Mrs. Saunders got to know me because of all of these activities. A very peculiar thing about it was that when I went in to talk with her I said, "But Mrs. Saunders, isn't Margaret Webster the executive of the YWCA of the city of New York?" I said, "Well, she is the chairman of the personnel committee for the Greater New York Council of Churches, and just before I went to England, she employed me to work for the Federation of Churches." Mrs. Saunders said, "Well, yes, but you see, in this branch, we look out for our own, we select our own people." She made a very strong case for my working in the Harlem YWCA, and I went through quite a traumatic period, and I finally had to turn to Marion Cuthbert, who was on the national YWCA staff and whom I had known as a friend. And I sat down with her and told her just what was happening. I said, "The more I think about it, the more I feel that maybe I could pursue my interests with a broader base in the YWCA than in strictly church-related agencies." So she then helped me to see that already I was beginning to make some kind of a shift, or wish that I could make a shift in my decision, but it wasn't certain. There was a very great man named Dr. Robert Searle, head of the Federation of Churches, and he had been like a mentor to me. The great tragedy was that the person on his staff, a Miss Amy Blanche Green who had been a guiding light for me and many other young people in the United Christian Youth Movement here in New York State, did not tell meâwhen she told me that she had recommended me for this job and she talked to me about itâat that time that she knew that she had a malignancy, and that she just wasn't responding to any kind of treatment. I was sorry afterward that she hadn't told me, because I think my devotion to her was such that I would have taken the job. But I went and talked with her, and Dr. Searle then arranged...he said, "Well, let us get everybody together." So he brought us all together at Miss Webster's office, at the central branch building of the YWCA on Lexington Avenue, and we had a delightful lunch; we had officers from the YWCA, and Miss Webster from the Federation. He opened the conference by saying, "We're here to discuss one corpus delicti, Dorothy Height, and to make some decision." Soâhe had a very keen sense of humorâon that basis, I was able to say what my dilemma was, and then each one in turn talked about the work they were doing. The good thing was that in the course of it all, they began to talk about how each was interrelated to the other. And when it was over, Dr. Searle said, "Well, we then are agreed thatï»¿(cont.) now the decision is up to Dorothy, and whatever she decides, we will support her." And so, therefore, after that, I told the Federation that I'd like to be released, because I had gone through quite a few things. I'd gone through "McCall's Ten Steps to Decision Making." I'd talked to Marion Cuthbert. I'd done all sorts of thinking about it. The more I thought about it, I felt that I needed the breadth of operation, and that that was one reason I was leaving the Department of Welfare, because in the Department of Welfare I had to administer policies that I didn't always agree with. I found myselfâas a person who had formerly been active in the unionârepresenting management in negotiations, and I found myself feeling sometimes that people had been discriminated against on the basis of race or color or religion, but I was bound by bureaucratic reports that usually said very little. I had to defend those and I had to speak on behalf of management against people that I often thought were being mistreated. So, I just thought, I need something broader. Therefore, I decided to come to the YWCA. The strangest thing happened. About three or four years ago, I received some kind of citationâI can't think what it was nowâand a voice came over the phone saying, "Do you remember Robert Searle?" I said, "Could I ever forget Robert Searle?" He said, "I see the thing that you're doing in the National Council of Negro Women and I wish you could come down to where I am now." Because he was not in that job too long; he was too progressive. He was too understanding of what young people were trying to do. He was considered sort of radical. So the Federation dropped him, and he went down and took a job at less salary working with the family court, way down on the East Side. He called me and said, "I wish some time you would come down here, because you would be interested in the kind of thing we're doing. I'm dealing with more black families than any other." I said, "Well, I appreciate that" and so forth. And he said, "I want to tell you, though, that I said to my wife that I would say to you, that as a young person you always demonstrated a capacity for caring." And you know, I've always remembered that. It was so like him, you know, "capacity for caring." Not everyone thinks in those terms. So it's very interesting how one thing pushes you to the next. In Harlem, 1933 to 1935, were you the only young woman who moved out into leadership? Were the rest men or who were they? No. There was Ethel James Williams, who until recently was on the faculty of Howard University School of Social Work. She's now director of human resources for the mayor of the city of Washington. There were men like James Farmer, Kenneth Clark, Clinton Hoggard, who's now a bishop in the A.M.E. church, James Robinson, who created Crossroads Africa. It was such a fantastic group of young people, that I hardlyï»¿15 H: (cont.) know how to describe. There was Henry Winston, who's one of the Communist Eleven, and Tony Morton. There was Juanita Mitchell, who is Clarence Mitchell's wife; she was NAACP. Madison Jones, who is now with Metropolitan Life and NAACP. It's uncanny who was in that group. We used to meet at least once or twice every week, downtown. The NAACP was at Fifth Avenue and Fourteenth Street, and whenever there was a lynching they would hang out a sign saying "A Man Was Lynched Today." Whenever that sign went out, we wore black armbands and took our "Stop Lynching" buttons, and marched around Forty-second Street. I wish I had a movie of that. BB â¢ Did you feel any divisionâobviously you didn't feel any conflict, but did you feel that your life was compartmentalized, Dorothy, between your days as a student in a predominantly white group at NYU, and your community life? DH: BB: DH: PC: DH: PC; DH: Well, even at NYU, I had helped to organize a group called the Rameses Club which was all black students. That also was newâit was generated by the feelings of the thirties? The feelings of the thirties, but what we also needed was a way to get together. But, remember, for me, my Slavson says that people are influenced most by the groups in which they most fully live, and the group that I was deepest in scholastically was a small study group. But I also was an officer in the Rameses Club, sponsoring the DuBois lectures and Paul Robeson discussions, and things of that sort. And there was another group called the Touchstone at Columbia University. It was also black students. And we used to have joint meetings on occasion. People like Hulan Jack and Constance DeWitt Baker and a lot of key people in the Harlem community, who were students at NYU at that time, were members of that group. So that I didn't feel a conflict at all, since they were just different. I didn't take as active a role as many of the black students in some of the sororities and fraternities. I wanted to know, where does that come, because you must have been a Delta in order to become president of Delta Sigma Theta. We decided at NYU to organize a chapter of Delta. I came there with that in mind, because some Delta women when I was in high school had been especially nice and encouraging to me. But the first time I went into Dean Raushenbush and presented the grades that we had, I was shocked to discover that they were all kind of riding on my grades, and they just didn't have the grades... For a sorority? To be recognized. You see, you have to have a certain number who wereï»¿DH: BB: DH: BB: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: 16 (cont.) above a B, and you couldn't have C students get student permission to organize a group and soâwell, we had made the effort. So I gave that up. I did not become a member of Delta until 1939. I was out of school. I became a Delta as a graduate. I gave up that idea; [in college] it didn't work. You didn't join any other sorority at that time? No. I was rushed for two other sororities, but then when I got there and they looked me over, they discovered it was an accident. They had taken me from the grades in the halls, you know, because I was a straight A student, so therefore I was rushed, but never accepted. That for me was a sort of game anyway, because I really wanted to ^become a Delta. Why? What did you know about Delta? Well, for the little Christian center that I told you about, the Rankin Christ ian Center, that had people on Thursday, two women had come out from the YWCA in Pittsburgh to organize a Girl Reserve club. Both of them happened to be Delta women. One of them, Lula Howell, simply took a real fancy to me, and encouraged me really not to be soâ the only word I know how to use is shyâand it sounds very funny, because I was in a trio and I did all kinds of things. I've always had an active life. But she was very encouraging to me, to carry leadership and that sort of thing, so as a result of that, she kept saying to me, "You must become a Delta." And then Edna Kincheon, who was a national secretary of Delta, was the other person. She gave me my first silk stockings. They had an interest, so that when I came [to college] I was recruited for two other groups and I would go to their teas, but I knew that I wasn't really interested. I couldn't figure it out, in your school life. Then you became an honorary Delta? No, no, no! I became a member of this chapter, the Rho Chapter in New York City, which was then a citywide chapter, and I was doing graduate work, so that I was still a student. I was not a full-time student, but I was still a student. I thought you had to be a student. I was doing clinical psychology, for at that time, I thought I wanted clinical psychology and I was doing clinical psychology at Manhattan State Hospital, out on the island. So I was still on student status. I was still in graduate study. Was that with New York School of Social Work?ï»¿17 New York University. Pp â¢ That still was your home base for a while. I'm still lost in time here. So many other things happened that we don't know, we'll have to get in some other fashion. All of these things are later. Betty, do you have any of the earlier dates? BB: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: BB: DH: DH: In 1937 you made the decision to give up the city job, to give up the Federation job and work for the YWCA in Harlem. Yes. And did you stay there until... I became assistant director the first year, and then when the director of Emma Ransom House left, because I had been working with them on crucial aspects, I became director of Emma Ransom House. What was the date, when you became director? In '38. Then in 1939 my mother died. The YWCA National Board had offered me several jobs, and then they asked me to take the job as executive of the Phillis Wheatley YWCA in Washington, D.C. I had already been selected as a delegate to the World Conference of Christian Youth to be held in Amsterdam, Holland, so I accepted. The Phillis Wheatley YWCA agreed that I would not come until later in the fall after I got back. So in the fall I went. And your father had died before, so that there was nothing to hold you in New York? You mentioned the fact that your mother died that year. My mother died. My father was still living, but I guess... I felt that I could [leave New York]. Pr â¢ Miss Height, when we ended our last taping, we'd just about gotten to the end of your schooling, except some of that extra schooling you were taking, and you had begun your employment. You even told us about that fascinating time in history, that most of us have forgotten and you still have very clearly in your mind. Let me ask you several questions. One, we found in a book that it was claimed that the Communistsâand I know this is of interest to youâcaptured peace groups and youth organizations and infiltrated church organizations. Will you tell us what you know about that? Is it true, isn't it true, what happened to you? Well, I think there undoubtedly was some of that, hut to me the important thing was that in the early thirties, we were in an era of the United Front. I got to know and to work with Carl Ross, Henry Winston, and others who were leaders in the Young Communist League, not through political organizations, but through the fact that I represented the Harlem Christian Youth Council in the United Front in Harlem. We had some eighty-eight youth organizations, and I was very active, and was "in factï»¿18 DH: PC: DH: PC: E>H: (cont.) the chairperson for the Harlem Christian Youth Council. The way it worked was that we all met around particular issues. At that time, we were concerned about some kind of American youth act and the American Youth Congress was taking an active hand in that. I was very active in the American Youth Congress. Here was another place where there was a United Front approach. You were there as Communist and non-Communist young people together. Now the thing that I always recall is that for me, it was sort of a time of clarifying where I stood, both politically and religiously. I always remember being at a meeting where one of the Young Communists turned to me and said that I blocked all the discussions because I always kept coming back to the fact that there was a God. And he turned and looked at me. We were in one of hundreds and hundreds of meetings that we went to. This one was in Greenwich Village, and I remember, people were sitting on the floor and on boxes and whatnot. You know, this was a time when there wasn't much money and we were trying to make do. I mean, there was no such thing as having drinks and things of that sort. You had a few apples and soft drinks or something. Everybody was sitting around talking and going over issues. I don't even know now what the subject was, but I do remember this one young man turned around and he said to me, "Dorothy, I wish you would stop bringing in all that Christian stuff." He said, "Don't you know that I can fly in the face of your God?" I have never in my life thought that I would ever be in the same room with anybody who would speak that way. To me, it was so irreverent. You know, it just shattered everything. I'd come up in a rather closely knit Christian family, so that for someone to say, "I can fly in the face of your God." Well, I thought and then in a few moments I said, "But did it ever occur to you that my God gives you the capacity to learn to fly?" That was brilliant. I sat there, and we went on discussing, and it was a kind of a religious experience because it was like, in that conversation, I understood dialectical materialism, I understood Communism, and I understood Communism's digression from some of the things that are basic to my faith. And at that point, it was very clear to me that I was deeply involved. I went to all kinds of Young Communist groups' meetings, I was in everythingâbut I knew I was not and never would be a Communist. Now, I think that was one of the things that clarified it for me. From then on, I knew how to operate. When the World Youth Congress met at VassarâMrs. Roosevelt hosted the groupâI was one of the ten American young people who had gone up earlier to her home to help plan it, and fellows like Jim Carey, and I think, Joe Lash. We all worked out the plans for this meeting. Excuse me, were you the only black young person who went up there? No, there were others of us. The ones I remember particularly, Harrietï»¿19 (cont.) Pickensâoh, there were some of the black Communists, like Henry Winston, Tony Morton, Lionel Florant, and a number of them. But the thing is that experience that evening meant that I would be more alert in that group that I met with, Young Communist representatives from Latin American countries especially. We were assessing peace, and we were trying to develop a preamble to the report of our section, and many of us who were thereâthere were some people from the YWCA, but I wasn't connected with the YWCA at that timeâhad drafted something that said, in effect, that all people were created by God, and it was intended that we would live on the face of the earth as one human family. It was something as innocuous in a sense as that and we thought it would be a good way to open this meeting. We tried to make this the base for saying that we therefore should not be so preoccupied with the development of arms and with the means of war, and we were moving in that direction. This would be 1938. So when we got into the discussion, there were several of us who just had to stay by it, and I was one, so that I was sort of the night watchman. In other words, we found that the tactics of the Young Communists were to open the discussion, and talk and talk, and bring you to the point of thinking, it's just about settled, it's just about over. Then as all of our forces would be dispersed, they would make the real decisions, and the next morning, we would have to start all over again to battle. Then they would say, "Well, you just weren't there." So that our idea was that if those discussions went twenty-four hours, there would be some of us there at all times. Some would go off and take a rest, and then come back. We stayed with it. PC: DH: PC: DH: I always remember this; when I went to work for the YWCA in Washington in 1939, the World Youth Congress report was out, and on the cover was a picture of Eleanor Roosevelt at the top. It was a snapshot of her. She was in the White House then, and she was crocheting something, or knitting. But in the center of the whole cover of the page was a young, blond fellow whispering into the ear of a young, black girl, and that was Carl Ross and Dorothy Height. Th is was on tlis cover of what? On the cover of the report of the World Youth Conference held at Vassar. I read a report about a young black girl with Mrs. Roosevelt and I had wondered if it was Dorothy Height. Well, that picture was there. And when I went to work for the YWCA the next year in Washington, D.C., people who just saw it as a nice interracial picture, put it up on the bulletin board. My first official task was to say to one of the people, "Well, I don't want to have a picture of me in my youth because I'm now"âI was at that moment, the youngest executive in the YWCA movementâ"now I'm an executive and I don't want people to think of me as a youth." The reality was that I knew Washington. I had been there when the tide had changed, and when the United Front was no more, and when itï»¿20 (cont.) was very clear that the nation's policy had become anti-Communist. Because we were going to war? That's right, and I knew then that if that picture appeared, it would never be understood, that this was not a picture taken for that momentâ¢ PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Somehow or other, though, as I look back over it, there was a kind of vitality in the democratic experience that I think I experienced as a young person, because it wasn't just a question of majority rule and self-determination. People throw these words around now, but I think at that time, there was a kind of struggle that we were having around our philosophies of a democratic society. And also, I learned so much from the Communists. Those were some of the best minds that I ever came upon. And the tactics that you learned from them... And the tactics, the tactics I learned. I think that has something to do with my staying power now. If I go into a meeting, I don't like to run in and out. I don't whisper in meetings. I learned then that you had to listen, you had to be alert, you had to watch. We got to the place where we watched, and when we saw X leave the meeting, we waited then to see how long it would be before Y would leave. If X and Y left together, we knew what that meant for us, that A and B had better start moving, or C and D should move. And we never went into a meeting without assessing who was there, what they were saying, what were we in battle for. Of course, there were more of you than of them, but they had the tactics and you had to learn them. There weren't so many Communists. There were more of us than them. There were more non-Communists. Of course.' But the young Communists had learned tricks that you had to catch up with and lick. Yes, but they also had learned something that has helped me to understand the nature of militancy. I found that there were some of the Communists who in a sense might be more conservative on some points than I was. But that there were others, once they got the party lineâ you just had to find out what the party line wasâthey stuck to it. What I found particularly in the Christian groups, was a kind of all men are created equal" philosophy; the "we're all children of God" idea. But if you said, "Now, what's the line that you really are trying to pursue, to make that a reality?" they would say. Well, of course, you can't do this, because after all, people wouldn't understand, or my neighbors wouldn't understand having blacks come in their neighborhood," this, that and the other excuse. So it gaveï»¿21 (cont.) me more of a sense of social forces and how they work, rather than just people talking about things. I find myself always trying to find out, where is this person coming from? What's really underneath what he's saying? And I think this was the place of battle, PC â¢ It was a more political time than any time since for young people. They learned more, did more, I would think, and you were right in the middle of it. DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH: Not only that, but we organized marches, for example, against lynching. We did things of that kind. And the thing that I think it has said to me is that I cannot talk about the person who is radical or militant as if there's something wrong with what he's doing. I have to see militancy as my way of using my approach to making a direct head-on attack on problems, rather than just vaguely discussing them. This has been kind of a driving force. But I must say, that era helped to contribute to it. I used to say many times, as we talked about the "silent generation," part of the real trouble was that something went out of what young people had been caught up in. Kenneth Clark said to me recently, "You know, Dorothy, back in those days, nobodyâ well, dope wasn't where it is in Harlem now anyway, people weren't even drinking liquor." They didn't have the money. No, they didn't have the money, I guess that's one thing, but there was a kind of senseâ"I have to finish the work I'm doing today because tonight we have a meeting, and that meeting is going to change the world." I was the vice-chairperson of the United Christian Youth Movement of North America, and I was in Geneva when we set as our theme, "Christian Youth Building a New World." And we really believed that. We really believed that in these little meetings we had, we were building a new world. We were hammering it out. We were making it piece by piece. And interestingly enough, when I went to work with the YWCA, that's how I got into the whole thing about the domestic workers. Way that long ago? That's right. That's when it was, 1938. How did that happen? Well, one of these Young Communist fellows was at the city council. He called me up; he knew that I had been working with the Harlem YWCA. I worked with the girls who had special problems as well as the YWCA residents. So one day, Lionel called me and he said that there was a thing going on before the city council. They were working on a thing about the slave markets. These were places in the Bronx, in Brooklyn, in fact, in most of the boroughs, where large numbers of the black women would come and stand on a street corner. Then people would drive up in their cars, look them over, and select one they wanted to have work for the day. Then they took them to their homes and hadï»¿22 (cont.) them work. And all kinds of things were happening. I had worked with these girls. Lionel knew about this, because this was the kind of thing we talked about when we got together, "What's happening to our people? What should we be doing about it?" So it wasn't just that I was a staff person doing casework in the daytime, but then we would sit down and talk after work. I told him about a young womanâtwo of them in fact. One was a girl who had come up from the South, and someone had lured her to this place, because she was living in the YWCA. The job that she came to do only lasted a short while. Some told her to go up to this slave market. She went up to the slave market, and a woman came and got her, and she worked in this woman's house. And then somehow or other, when the woman left the house, the man of the house simply took advantage of her, and the girl was so young, she didn't know what to do. So she came in to talk to me about it, to see what could be done. The man threatened to have her arrested if she told anything about what had happened. Well, I searched and searched and couldn't find anything at all that we could do. The girl almost went into shock. She must have been about seventeen or eighteen, seventeen,I think. After a very short period of time, this girl was pregnant and I had to see her all the way through that pregnancy. I got her into the Club Caroline, and she had come from a very, very poor Southern family, and the thing that worried her the -most was, What would her mother ever say? So we had to have all kinds of special care for her. Was she singular or were there many like that? There were many who had problems. I suppose many of them would have worked them out different ways. Some of the young people took up money to help her. I helped her to get some work around the Y, got her a little job on the elevator. But as time went on, she became so depressed that she was a liability on the elevator. We really had to see her all the way through it. It was a terrific thing. We finally got her back to her home. The other woman was a little older person, in her twenties. She had gone to work for a family, and had worked and worked and workedâshe had done cleaning, and she'd done washing, she'd done all sorts of things. And the woman had turned the clock back on her, so that when she came out, thinking she was coming out at say five or six o'clock, she was coming out at something like nine or ten and she had done all this work. When she got down on the street and realized what the time really was, she went back. And the woman told her she was calling the police. Well, this frightened her. I had a steady case load of people. They would come and say, "Can't the Y do something? Can you come out there with me?" So with a couple Â°f young fellows, we went up to see what really was going on, to observe the whole thing. Well, Lionel called me and said, "Would you be willing to come?" because they were trying to get a bill through the city council requiring thatï»¿23 (cont.) hiring halls be established. PC â¢ Like unions. DH â¢ Right, so that people would not be permitted, under the city regulations, to do hiring on the street corners. Well, he called me to come to the city council. I said to the executives I'd be back shortly, and I went down. When I got there and offered my testimony about what was going on, and said, "the Bronx slave market," the Bronx councilman interrupted me. He said, "Well, you certainly don't mean slave market." So then the Brooklyn councilman said, "Well, it doesn't exist in Brooklyn, does it?" I said, "Yes, it does, at King's Highway, and let me tell you about that," and so on. Well, then the Bronx man came back and he said, "I just think you should not call these slave markets. You're just saying that people are hiring people and they're not going to employment agencies; it's not a slave market." I said that it was a slave market. "That's what we call it." He said, "Well, you want to correct that, don't you?" Well, it got to be something that people teased me about for a long time, because I wasn't exactly thought of as a fan of Cab Calloway's or of someone in the jazz circuit, but sort of in response, I said to the councilman, "Well, maybe you don't know it, but when I say 'Bronx slave market,' everybody in Harlem knows exactly what I'm talking about, and it's the same thing as if I were to say 'Hi-de-ho.'" Well, of course, the whole council went into hysterics. Every newspaper in the place, even those from London and other parts of the world, picked this up, and having made just a simple little exit from my office, by the time I got back, the executive was standing at the door saying, "What on earth has happened? We're simply deluged." Because you see, all these councilmen were greatly on the defense about the slave market. But it did bring these cases to light. Just recently, a young fellow at the Daily; News uncovered the news stories of that time. He was writing up something about my civil rights activities, and he said they went back to that time. Pc = When did you break the back of the slave market? DH: I think this publicity meant that for a while, it sort of went under cover. At least, it wasn't as flagrant. But it continued. We didn't get the legislation through. There was stong opposition to it. There was no mood to do anything about domestic workers. It was really almost ten years laterï»¿24 (cont.) when Hilda Fortune and some people working with her at the Urban League of Greater New York picked it up again, and tried to work at it. PC: DH: PC: DH: But I think the point that I really want to make about it is less the incident, and more that being a part of greatly diversified, politically-oriented youth group activity meant, for me, that I could never be satisfied with "working to bring about the Kingdom of God." I had to see one little piece of it that you could tackle. That was kind of the mood that we were always into. And that's how I got into the whole question of the domestic workers you see, because there I was at the YWCA at that time, in the midst of the aftermath of the depression. When I was there working in Harlem, thousands of girls were coming for the World's Fair, and they would get stranded and their problems would get multiplied. They had heard the World's Fair was going to be hiring people, and although it didn't open for a year, they came. I was there in the midst of all of that, and I found myself constantly dealing with the problems of young people who were just plain exploited, that's all. So that a sense of how you deal with exploitation was something we as young people would sharpen up. And though I was a staff person by that time, you see, I was working at it with a group of... ...of your friends and acquaintances who would tackle problems. Yes. In after hours, I worked on how you tackle the causes of what I was dealing with on my job, you understand. It wasn't a question of counseling. I could counsel with young people. For instance, a whole group of us just went up and stood on these slave market corners, to see what went on, so they couldn't tell us it didn't exist. I'm glad you've elaborated on the slave market because you've talked about it, but I haven't heard it in depth. I would like to bring you to a question you've answered in a way about Mrs. Roosevelt. You were in Hyde Park with her during those early days. Did you consider her at that time, a protector, or whatever word you want to use, of the youth and the youth movement? No. My whole relationship to adults in the United Youth Movement had been such a satisfying experience that I often look back at it and wonder why was it that I was so gentle, although I was always running into something. I keep wondering, why was it? I actually liked adults. I don't mean all of them. But you see, Harry Stark and the people we worked with, worked with a kind of sense that this was not a movement for young people, this was a young people's movement. It belonged to us. Now, one of the things that I remember most about Mrs. Roosevelt at that time was that she never acted as a protector. I mean, when people accused her of protecting young people, I looked at it as a kind of misreading her as an adult. She wasn't that kind of adult.ï»¿25 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: She fought for young people. She fought for the young people. She was an advocate of young people's rights. But she, at the same time, was the person who pressed us the hardest. I was one of ten who went up to Hyde Park, and we spent the whole day with her serving hot dogs and ice cream on the porch in between talking. We spent the whole day simply hammering out what it was going to be about, and how would American young people hostess it, and what would be required for the World Conference of Youth, the one that was held at Vassar. She would let us have our discussion, but then she would throw in her question, or raise a point, or ask, "How can you be sure that you'll be doing that?" It was this kind of... She was playing the devil's advocate at that point? Well, no. Well, maybe she thought of it that way. I can only give it to you the way I read itâhow I felt about it. Of course, we were all in awe of her. She was just so great. But at the same time, you felt you could say, "Now, Mrs. Roosevelt, we have this problem." One of the problems we had was how to finance the whole thing, and as you know, money was very scarce in those days. But she made us think about what was it going to be needed for, the kinds of things we were going to do. What arrangements were to be made with Vassar Collegeâwe had to take those seriously. We dealt with the administration. We had to work out the scheduling and the planning. Then she helped us to see what we were hostessing, and so we had to find the ways that we could do the things that would help, and then of course, she got people to support us and to give help with those things that young people have no access to. So in that sense, I guess she was a sensitive advocate. She did not try to speak for us and say, "This is what the young people are trying to do," et cetera, et cetera. And if you went back and read any of her early columnsâshe would sometimes take her column and address it to some of the issues that we were talking about. She would give her views on it. They weren't always exactly what the young people thought, but she came through with her views. For me, it was a climate of making you use your mind and making young people have to be responsible. Do you feel that you had a personal relationship with her then? I know you did laterâbut when you were one of "the young people"? Ob yes. I think every single one felt that Mrs. Roosevelt knew you, and when she was talking to you, she was talking to you. She was not talking to "young people." She helped me, I felt, to see myself as being a representative of the interests of the people. It wasn't personal. Her relationship with young peopleâit had sounded like protector, but this is much better. Yes> and the reason that I react to that, I think, is because so much Â°f the attack on Mrs. Roosevelt, when people used to say there were the Eleanor Clubs and things of this kindâso much of that I resented, because they felt that she protected blacks, and she did this kind of thing, andï»¿26 (cont.) it made a real difference. What you're saying is, she was not Lady Bountiful. What she was, was a worker with the people. She was working with you. She was worried about the things that were facing you and she was concerned about it and so on. It comes to my mind that I went to the memorial service for her at Saint John the Divine after her death, and coming out of the service, I bumped into a woman named Mrs. Turner. Mrs. Turner had been a maid in the Roosevelt home when I first saw her; she and...I can't think of the fellow's name now who was a chauffeur. I first met them when we were at Hyde Park planning the World Youth Conference. Later she came in and worked with Mrs. Roosevelt in the cityâand this is an example of her attitude toward young people and toward blacks and the poorâas we came out, I saw this woman, and she gravitated toward me. Well, we both stood on the corner and talked, and she said, "Oh, I'm so glad to see you. You know, Mrs. Roosevelt was really something." She said that she, Mrs. Turner, had worked with President Roosevelt. She was at Warm Springs, and she used to lift him, and she did a great deal like that. In her later years, she developed a heart condition. Well, she stood there, and it was drizzling rain, and I was on my wayâ finally several buses had passed and so on, and I realized we were both standing in the rain, just standing, just getting wet. She said to me that Mrs. Roosevelt had finally sent her to Baltimore when she got too ill and she couldn't work, and she was in a nursing home. And then the thing that had made her the happiest was that in her last few weeks, Mrs. Roosevelt sent for her to come and she said, "Can you imagine that of all people in the world, I'm one of those that she wanted to be there at the end?" Mrs. Turner said, "But to tell you what a wonderful person she wasâ" and I think her name was Georgia, I'm sure it is, Georgia Turnerâshe said, "Can you imagine, one day I went in, and she was so miserable, and she would stay on one side, and then I'd want to turn her to the other side. She'd want to turn to the other side..." Before that she said that Mrs. Roosevelt sent for her and said, "Georgia, I want you to come down and have tea with me." This was just a few months before she became really ill. "She sat and talked and she told me, 'You really have done such great things.'" She said, "Now, mind you, this woman telling me I've done great things." So she said, "I came away, and I just went back..." She's living now in the old YWCA in Harlem, in that Â°ld building that I used to be director of when it was in its heyday. She said, "I went back and sat in that room and I just felt like I was sitting in a palace because I'd been there." So then she told me that Mrs. Roosevelt called her, on this day in the hospital, and said, "Oh, I need to turn." You know, she was so miserable. She said, "And as I put my arms under her and I wanted to lift her and turnï»¿27 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) her, she said, as near dead as she was, she said, 'Georgia, your heartâget so and so.'" She said, "Can you imagine her remembering that I had a bad heart?" I tell you, it was just one of those devastating experiences. We just stood there in the rain and recalled. You see, she identified with people and their struggle and their problems Like Georgia was saying, "You know, she said to me, 'Georgia, you have a bad heart, don't you lift me.'" She said, "Miss Height, at that point, if it would have killed me, I would have done it, if it would have made her live." You know, it was quite an experience. That's what I mean. I wanted to ask you whether you remembered special qualities of Mrs. Roosevelt, and then I wanted to compare them to Mrs. Bethune, and ask you whether when you were young there was anything that you wanted to emulate of these two women, or whether it was simply a question of admiration and delight in their friendship, and in knowing them or admiring them. Well, there again, I can't tell whether this was the nature of them or the nature of me. I would have to say I never thought of them just in terms of admiration. I thought of them as women with whom you became involved, and you got involved in what they were involved in, and they didn't seem to exact so much. What bothers me now is that sometimes I feel that you work with people, and they exact so much. You never quite please them and they're never quite satisfied. These women had a kind of eternal dissatisfaction about all the things that were going on, that kind of got you caught up in that. I suppose what I would say was their keeping the interpersonal relationship at such a level that it always plunged you into something. The excitement of the women, rather than some more sterile qualities, I think you're saying. Well, for instance, I'll speak of Mrs. Bethune. I really got to know Mrs. Bethune and Mrs. Roosevelt almost at the same time. It was in that very same time. I was working at the Harlem branch of the YWCA and Mrs. Bethune was having a meeting of the National Council of Negro Women. This was in the fall of 1937. I had only been on the staff since the first of October and this meeting was in November. So I'd been on the staff about six weeks, and as the newest, youngest, single member of the staff and one who was kind of known in advance for being involved in the community, the executive asked me to bring Mrs. Roosevelt into Mrs. Bethune's meeting. I had started doing it the usual way because on Saturdays Ralph Harlow brought students from Smith College; and then there were the Reconciliation tours that had at that time included Harlem, Chinatown, places like this. The YWCA at Harlem was one of its most important stops, and when they would get there, I was the Person who would take them. I'd have Langston Hughes or Countee Cullen.. They didn't know what they were getting... Yes, I would arrange for different poets and different people. They would always end with dinner in the YWCA cafeteria, and then in the Private dining room I would always have someone like this, or somebodyï»¿28 (cont.) who read literature, Augusta Baker from the library, or different people to do different things. So this was kind of in line for me to do, and Mrs. Saunders asked me to do it. A strange thing happened. The building had two entrances and in between, was a service entrance. This was a time when Mrs. Roosevelt was still driving her own roadster, so I'd alerted everybody, and I was all set for what was to happen. Well, suddenly, one of the janitors came running to me and said, "Oh, Miss Height, Mrs. Roosevelt came in the service entrance, and she's on her way to the auditorium." Well, I saw my little job going up in smoke. Because I thought, that's the one assignment I had for the day, and I couldn't make thatâbut who would have thought that Mrs. Roosevelt would park her own car and get out and go in the service entrance? And not even come to the desk? I had both desks alerted. I had rehearsed them, what they were to say. I'd done everything. And there she was. Well, fortunately, this fellow having alerted me, I made a beeline around the other hallway, and met her just before she could enter the auditorium. So, in the end, I got saved, but you know, it almost went out of my handâthe whole thing. And of course, the whole building then was upset because neither desk clerk, you see, no receptionist ever saw her. They were all giving me all their excuses, but they didn't know I had my own to make upâ where was I that I let all this happen? Well, I took her in, and Mrs. Roosevelt made this very exciting speech, and because she wanted to get to Hyde Park before it was too late that evening, she left shortly thereafter. Mrs. Bethune had a favorite song which was "Let Me Call You Sweetheart," so she had all the women stand and sing this song to Mrs. Roosevelt. So I was standing by her and singing. When we were ready to go, Mrs. Bethune tugged on my skirt. Mrs. Roosevelt was getting her things. She said, "Honey, what is your name?" I said, "My name is Dorothy Height." She said, "What do you do?" I said, "I work here." She said, "Well, come back, we need you." Well, I escorted Mrs. Rooseveltâthis time, I saw to it that she was carefully seated in her roadster, and then we stood on the sidewalk until she drove away, on to Hyde Park. Well, I went back to Mrs. Bethune's meeting and before I knew it, she put me on the resolutions committee with Venice Spraggs. pC: You mean, you weren't part of the NCNW, they were meeting at the Y?ï»¿DH: 29 They were simply meeting there. PC â¢ You were the executive? No, I was the assistant to the executive. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: You were not at that point, a member of NCNW except you were a sorority member, as a sorority person? No, I wasn't as a matter of fact, I had only heard about the National Council. That was my very first direct contact, 1937, November 1937. 1 went in and I was put on the resolutions committee, and then by the next convention, I was the registrar for the convention, and I've been active in it ever since. In the period from 1937 till 1974, I think that I have missed about three conventions. One, I was in India; one, I was carrying a special assignment on the West Coast; and one, I had a tonsillectomy. In those days, you were a young activist stillâ^you were always an activist, but you were a young activist. Right. What did the National Council of Negro Women mean to you as a young activist? I'm not meaning Mrs. Bethune now because you've told me in a way something about Mrs. Bethune. But the Council itself? Yes. Well, you see, I can't speak of it without speaking of Mrs. Bethune, because I was not really active in the New York City group Â°f the National Council, having approached it in this way. Then Mrs. Bethune was working in Washington with the NYA*..,. â¢â¢â¢This was afterward, 1939 or so... Yes, right on through, '38, '39, Mrs. Bethune went back to Washington. You see, she sort of "put her hand on me," and she would therefore call up and say, "Well, there's a meeting going on about such and such, can you go over to that for me?" It sounds as if you became a right arm for her. I became one of many young people. This was one way that she related to them. And I remember that at one of the conventions of the National Councilâthis was the convention of 1938, as a matter of fact, of the National Council of Negro WomenâT. Arnold Hill, who was a director of the National Urban League, called me because he said that at the dinner of the Council, which was being held at the Department of Labor in Washington, they wanted to have a young person who was not an organizational person ln that sense, come and speak on behalf of Mrs. Bethune, but speak from the vantage point of youth. So I went down and attended the convention and I did that. ^National Youth Administrationï»¿30 (cont.) The next year, when I went to work in Washington, Mrs. Bethune then had me to serve as the registrar, to work with that for the National Council. The following year, she had the meeting in Chicago. At that time, there had been a woman serving as the executive secretary to Mrs. Bethune for the Council. She was a much older woman and very organization oriented. And one of the things that I think everybody goes through is having some association with someone who helps you identify what some of your own talents may be. One of the things that working with Mrs. Bethune did for me was that it helped me to feel that it was all right that I was often more abstract, that is, that I liked the underlying philosophies of things, et cetera, and that I was interested inâI'm not speaking now in a narrow religious sense but in a broader spiritual senseâin the spiritual dimensions of things. So that when I went there, we would sit just for hours and just talk about things. It used to bother me that women would say all kinds of nasty things about Mrs. Bethune, and were ready to murder her and say that she was an Uncle Tom, she was this, and she was that. Some of those women weren't nearly so active in social action as she was, but that would be what they would do. It always interested me that Mrs. Bethune would say, "Oh yes, of course, of course, but now let me see, we need a lawyer to do that. Now she knows law, let's tell her to go do that. Dorothy, get her on the phone, that's what she has to do, make her do something..." It wasn't so much "get her off my back" as it was "this woman needs to know that this is a time for her to be something greater than she's acting like she is." And that's what I think she did, she kind of pressed people. Because I was relatively shy, she used to say to me all the time, "Dorothy, you're sitting there, you know exactly what it is, now you go over there and you tell her, or you do so and so and so." This to me was part of the value in women like Mrs. Roosevelt and Mrs. Bethune. It was that they made you move. It wasn't just what they were doing, it was that they--- They could see something in you... They could see something. "Now, this is something, you can do it." And so therefore, when the Chicago group met, Mrs. Bethune asked the woman who had been serving if she would no longer serve as the executive secretary, and she asked me to serve. I was executive of the Phillis Wheatley YWCA in Washington, and she asked me to serve as the executive secretary for the Council. A permanent job or convention job? No, regular, year round. So therefore I started in. Now, I worked at the YWCA at Ninth and Rhode Island; Mrs. Bethune lived on Ninth Street so that she would call me from her office in the National Youth Administration. and she would say, "I'll be home at such and such a time." Or it might be at ten o'clock or ten thirty at night, she would call and say, just as I would be finishing a board meeting, "Could you come for a little bit?" Then I would go there. Maybe we would work a couple of hours.ï»¿31 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: She must have been a woman of tremendous energy. Tremendous energy. Just the greatest of energy. Pat Harris told me she's been asked to write a chapter in a book for the University of North Carolina, the updating of a book. So I told her, "Well, it's been over thirty years since I was with Mrs. Bethune, when she was writing the chapter, and her characteristic way was to get Robert Weaver, and Frank Home and Bill Trent and Ted Poston, all of these people who were there in the Black Cabinet..." Was it called the Black Cabinet? It really was called the Black Cabinet, that's right. So she got everybody and sat us around. And you were part of the Black Cabinet? No. It was menâit was all men, except Mrs. Bethune was the woman in the situation and was the key person in it. So what would happen then, she'd say, "What do you think I should write about?" And all of us around the circle said: "Let's talk about housing; let's talk about education; let's talk about jobs; let's talk about health; let's talk about justice..." We would line up all the things, and after she had worked us until it was oh, at least one or two in the morning, she'd look around and say "Oh, you all are just wonderful, I want to thank you so much." She said, "I think I understand now what the Negro wants. He wants what everyone else wants." What could you say? She had a way of wanting people in the forefront of the day to update what she was thinking, what she was saying. She wanted to test it out. That's what I would think, test it out more than anything. That's right, and what it meant was that she thought... But then, you see, her capacity for going to the heart of it and then to say, "Well, what you really have been saying for two and a half hours, is he wants what everyone else wants." Well, it's that kind of thingâit's meant for me in working with her that it wasn't just a letter that you wrote, there wasn't any one thing that you did. I think this follows me today. I find it very hard to just separate off some kind of theoretical and philosophical base from what you're doing, and why you're doing. It's all... It's all part of one. It's all part of one. It's that kind of wholeness that she had. Then she was an influence. That was a part of you, or you couldn't have worked with her, but the fact that it was the essence of her fortified you. And released. It gave a sense that you didn't need to worry about whether your ideas were the best in the world or not. You just kept working on them.ï»¿32 I'm sure she didn't suffer fools. She wanted good ideas. Yes, that's right, but what I really am saying is, that... I guess, when my older sisters speak of it, they say I was always an old folks' child. I guess the thing that I'm saying is that some of what came through for me as shyness was something that's almost characteristic of my childhood. I never really enjoyed just doing nothing. If I were going to jump rope, I liked to do double rope, I didn't like to just do the same thingâI don't know how to describe it. As a result there were lots of times when I would find myself in groups, particularly after I moved out of that whole activist period, when I seem to have been with other young people in a peer group who were as activist as I... I had a very satisfying group experience in my intellectual and academic work at college. I'd had very satisfying group experience in the little trio that I sang with in my high school, on teams and debating societies, and things of that sort. But when I saw that I could do something on the Constitution of the United States, that interested me, rather than just to do something on what it means to be a good citizen, let's say. Do you see what I'm saying? It's that sort of sense of challenge, of wanting to try to deal with something. So that often I used to find that even in the United Christian Youth Movement, I was drawn to the older people who tended to be tolerant of your struggling with complexity. I'm not sure that has to do with your shyness, but I know you think it does. That makes you shy. Today, I can enjoy people just blowing off for the sake of blowing off. You know, just let them blow off. I can go some place where everybody's just kicking up their heels. I can stand that for a while. I can go to a cocktail party and I can stand that for a while. But I get bored with it, do you understand? What I'm trying to say is, that as a young person I used to feel I shouldn't be bored with what I am now bored with. So this makes you shy. If you're in a group, and everybody there is engaged in small talk, and you don't feel any small talk coming after the first five or six sentences, then shyness means that you say, "What I wish is I could talk to somebody who has either not emerged or the idea that I had does not seem to fit." So therefore, the best thing for me to doâbecause I have dimples, you see, I have often gotten away with itâI just smile, and people feel that I'm very happy, and I'm very delighted. And people say, "Oh, see her smiling." So I'd just smile. But what people often didn't realize was that I had nothing to say because there was nothing I really wanted to say. Yet, my tolerance of the other people let me think, "Well, they're enjoying it, so let them enjoy it. This is not my time. My time will come." You see what I'm saying? Then, when I could get with people where I could say, for example: "You know Mrs. Bethune, I was just wondering, you were all involved in that Oxford group movementânow, how did you get into that?" I could sit down and ask her that kind of question. Do you see? That's when I got to know Mrs. Bethune, in depth. It's this kind of thing.ï»¿33 (cont.) She once said to me, and I'll never forget it... Adam Powell was campaigning at 125th Street and Seventh Avenue, and she was in a hotel room at the Hotel Theresa. She had called me to come down to be with her there, so I had gone. Several people had been there during the day, and we listened to Adam talking and so forth. When he had finished, and other people had gone, the two of us were just sitting there. She told me that one of the reasons that she'd been trying to get me to come and work for the Council was as she said, "You know, you and I are on the same kind of wavelength." Then she began to tell me of different moments when I had done different things or said different things and she would say, "It just interests me that sometimes I sit in a group and know that if you will just speak, it will help." What happened when she died? There was no substitute for Mrs. Bethune. There was no substitute in your life. No. But this is the great strength, I think, in people like Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune. There is one person who says that people are influenced most by the groups and situations in which they most fully live. For me that says, if you're involved with someone like this, if you really don't try to make them over to your own image, but you try to be yourself and to distill whatever you can from that experience that's authentic, what affects you becomes authentically you. Your own autonomous personhood is strengthened by these relationships so that you have to accept the fact that that person is not going to be there all the time, and you don't keep thinking, "I must take this so I'll have it when they're gone," but you try to make the most of the relationship you have in the days you have it. Then when you have a feeling of separation, in a very strange way you will discover those ways in which your own inner resources have been reinforced and have been strengthened. For a while, you have a feeling, as I did when I heard of Mrs. Bethune's death, I was mad at myself in so many ways. She had begged me, literally begged me, to put on tape or to write out what I had said about her in 1938 as a young person, but what she didn't understand was that I could not have recaptured it. T. Arnold Hill had asked me to come to that thing. He had called me up. He said, "Dorothy, you have to come down, we're having this dinner," and he brought two dozen red roses and he said, "I want you to present these to Mrs. Bethune. And I want you to speak on behalf of young people." Until this day, I remember that I opened it by saying, "Mrs. Bethune, the youth of America are inspired by you." But I could not have written out for her the whole thing of what I said because it was not a written speech. It was not recorded, and I couldn't recapture it, because it was part of a whole day's activities of the National Council of Negro Women. This was the banquet. I was in that moment, in that situation, and I made this presentation. And she kept saying to me, 'I want that written out. I have given my life to young people. I have never had anybody say back to me, what I have meant to young people in exactly that way..." She would say, "Dorothy, you promised me, you were going to do that." Well, I couldn't give it to her, do you understand? And I didn't want to sit down and rehash and write something that was some-ï»¿DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH 34 (cont.) thing different for those records. So I began to think of things that I wish that I had done or had been able to get done, that she had wanted me to do. She had asked the YWCA to release me to come and work with her. She came all the way to New York and met with Mrs. Ingraham who was then the president. Then she came and she spoke with me. About when was that? That was in 1951, and she came up to New York and she sat down with Mrs. Ingraham and then she and I talked. We discussed it. I was working for the National Board [YWCA]. But she wanted you to work for the Council? She wanted me to work full time for the Council. She told Mrs. Ingraham, I think that if Dorothy could work with me, I think she and I, we're two different generations, but I think we could produce something." And I must say that the one regret that...I would have welcomed the opportunity to have been president even for a year of her lifetime, because I think that some of the things that it has taken a long, hard struggle to do would have been much easier. If two of you had been working together? Right. If it hadn't dissolved in a way that you had to pick it back up again. Well, it didn't dissolve, it was just that Mrs. Bethune was a realist, and she knew that much of her dream and vision had been expressed, but very little of it had been realized, and she had a great deal of itâ the blueprint was there. So much of what she wanted was on paper, you know, just to actualize what she was dreaming was really the hard job. But it's a very important thing, I think, especially in black history, because there's something about the nature of the society that has meantâand I'm saying this for blacks, though I think it has also affected other young people, but maybe with less hazard, because of their position in societyâthere are ways in which there has been a kind of breakage, a gap that keeps widening between generations. I think Mrs. Bethune helped me to understand the way in which you just can't leave a generation gap, that there has to be a way in which each generation has to be free to move in its own direction. But if it does this without roots or without hooking on to something, pretty soon it becomes disillusioned, it becomes deradicalized, it becomes much more conservative. I think that's almost what's been happening in our country. With white young people, I think manyâwhen they don't find it going their wayâthey're not nearly so radical. They embrace the system more easily because they had tried it [radicalism] and it isn't going to work, and so they get caught up in it. I think Mrs. Bethune, and to a great extent Mrs. Roosevelt, were always examining, looking on, standing outside. In it, but looking at it; in it but examining it, you see. And that is another quality that I loved.ï»¿35 PC: DH: PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: And the caring so much. That's right. Yes, and taking little things so seriously. You know, just things like when Mrs. Roosevelt was in the White House, NCNW would go to the White House. Mrs. Bethune would take the time and tell these women. She would say to me, "Now, Dorothy, you handle the registration." I had to handle all the lists and so on. She would line everybody up and she would say, "Now before you go,"âjust as if we were school childrenâ"I don't want anyone coming out of there with napkins or silverware or anything of that sort. If you want souvenirs, go downtown and buy them." Because, you know, this was a new thing. To go to the White House... Yes. People would come out and say, "I have a napkin, I have â" you know, they'd bring a little souvenir. Well, it wasn't the fact that she could deal with the deepest, broadest issue, but she would still deal with the smallest detail. It was this kind of going at it both ways that I found very exciting. You either learned that or had it because you do the same thing. No longer do you have to say, "Don't walk off with the silverware," but you do examine every detail. You really have to, because for example, after great struggle, I once took a group into the Hotel Roosevelt in New York. One day, one of the women, a black woman, principal of a school in Virginia, came to me and said to me, "Dorothy, tell me two things. I hear people saying they ate in their rooms. How do you get the food to your room?" I said, "Well, you get on the telephone." She said, "Then how will they know what I want?" Then I told her, "You can look in your drawer and see if there is a menu. If not, you call and you get the menu." She said, "Well, then, like, if you need your clothes pressed, what do you do?" I said, "Then you call the valet." well, the next time I saw this lady, she said, "What you didn't tell me was about my bill." It cost her eighteen dollarsâand in 1954 that was a of moneyâto have her things pressed. Do you see? She called up the valet, who took her whole wardrobe and had it pressed. She forgot to ask me about the pay, she just thought it was service. And I realized then that coming out of a highly segregated situation, where she never would have been admitted to a hotel in Virginia, how would she have known? That was her first time. 1 remember telling our children, and forgetting some things I should have told them... Right, because they hadn't experienced it before. I found that some women were uncomfortable because they had all these kinds of things that they couldn't puzzle out, but they were too proud to ask. But here was one who wasn't too proud to ask. lot PC: So now you try to warn people.ï»¿36 DH: PC: DH: PC: ^H: PC: DH: Now, I find lots of times, people say, "Now, why should you do that?" It's because they're not thinking of it in terms of the experience, and you see, this is reality. There was one other question we've talked about. I don't know if we'll have time here. I'll just start it anyway, and that's when you went to Washington, D.C., to be the executive, I thought it was the Emma Ransom House, but it was the Phillis Wheatley House? Phillis Wheatley YWCA. Phillis Wheatley YWCAâwhen all those young black women were coming up to join the secretarial and other service forces of the war, is that the reason? Well, no. I went there to take a job in the fall of 1939. The National Board's recruiting people had been after me to take a job because I had administered about an $80,000 budget of the Emma Ransom House and a residence of 260 women, and they felt that I could handle an executive job. On the sixth of April, 1939, I lost my mother, and after her death, I didn't have the feeling that I had to stay in New York. That is, up to that time whenever they spoke of it, I didn't want to leave the city because my mother was living. But after that, some women came from the YWCA in Washington and talked with me. Mrs. Kelly Miller, the wife of the famous Howard University professor, and great philosopher, Kelly Miller, was the chairperson of personnel for the YWCA of Washington, and she and some of the women there had met me at the 1938 YWCA conventionâmy first conventionâand so they asked and offered me the job of the executive. I went through a long period of trying to decide, but finally I agreed to take the job, so that I went purely for the YWCA job. At the time that I went there, Washington, D.C., was highly segregated. The YWCA itself was the only YWCA in the country that was separated. It was not a branch of any other association. This was an independent association under black leadership, so that I became the only executive director who was black in the country, and the president was the only president who was black. Washington was very segregated. The schools for whites were called divisions Â°ne to nine. The schools for blacks were called divisions ten to thirteen. You had the one school system in the whole country that Probably was "separate and equal." It was equal? It was equal. As a matter of fact, some of the black were in a sense, even superior. Dunbar High School has produced minds like Ralph Bunche and Robert Weaver, just name them, Rayford Logan, all thoseï»¿37 DH: PC: DH: PC: I>H: (cont.) great minds. In Howard University, you had the highest concentration of college graduates and of highly educated blacks anywhere in the world right in Washington, D.C. Though Harlem had a higher black population, it did not have the educated population. Therefore Washington was a very special kind of challenge for the YWCA. It was not until Pearl Harbor that the situation began to change. You see, I almost got to feel that wherever I went, something happened. In Harlem, I was there, and then suddenly the World's Fair came in '38 and '39. I left there with all the World's Fair problems and got into Washington, and then remember Pearl Harbor, December '41. From Pearl Harbor on, the whole city changed into a virtual beehive of war activities, and since the major industry of Washington is the federal government, you have a situation that means that whatever is affecting the federal system is what determines the nature of Washington. Most of the people are working in some government agency or federal agency. So that's where we had this great onslaught of girls and shortage of housing. I found myself once again in a situation where, for the YWCA, we had to have twenty-four hour programs. We had three shifts of staff. Our lights were never out. There was the USO, but the USO was only there for whites, so we had to set up USO activities for the black servicemen. We were close to several army camps. Young women like Miss Sykes, who works now for NCNW, was one of hundreds of girls that I worked with for hostess training. We sent down to the camps two or three hundred girls to dances and activities at the camps, and we had equal numbers of service personnel coming into Washington. We had Spanish classes, three times a day. You could take it at seven o'clock in the evening, or seven o'clock in the morning, because the government was going twenty-four hours. You had young women who had come with telegrams saying "Report in seventy-two hours to the Navy Department," and then they would get there, and the... The Navy had forgotten to get them housing? Well, the Navy had no plan for housing, and they said, "Well, the blacks always look after their own." They set up Meridian Hill and housing for white girls, and that put upon us the problem of providing housing... [This is May 29, 1974.] You spoke about one of the few independent Negro YWCAs in Washington. Why, in segregated Washington, did Negro women have such independence? Well, it's a very peculiar story. I don't know that they had such independence, that it followed the usual American pattern. Washington, D.C., which is the seat of Howard University and at that time had Miner Teachers College, had a separate school system in which the divisions one to nine were white schools, and ten to thirteen were the colored schools. Washington, D.C., had a full assistant superintendentï»¿38 (cont.) of schools related to each division of the schools. Washington teachers, black and white, heard Kilpatrick if he came, or Dewey, if he came for an educational lecture, heard them separatelyâthey'd have to make the same lecture twice, for the blacks and for the whites, but they heard the same lecture. Teachers received the same salary. If there was any place in the country where "separate but equal" was working in the schools, it was working in Washington. And in a very significant way. You know, you had things like Dunbar High School that produced people like Dr. Weaver and Rayford Logan and Ralph Bunche and so on, so that they were really classically equal schools. And with Howard University, Washington, D.C., had the highest per capita of college-trained black people of any city in the United States. So that as a result, the black population was highly stratified around the color base. That is, those who were of lighter color, you know, were preferred or had more opportunity than those who were darker, and that kind of thing. Basically, colored people in the District of Columbiaâ"the citadel of Negro education," as Howard University was calledâtherefore produced a kind of aristocracy and within this, there was a group of women called the Book Lovers' Club. These women were all highly trained womenâmulatto womenâand they organized themselves, and out of that grew what is known as the group that became the organizers of the Phillis Wheatley YWCA. Now that was way ahead of any white women in the community; the Phillis Wheatley YWCA was organized first. It was a little more than a year later that a group of white women decided that they wanted to have a YWCA in the District of Columbia, and so they became an organizing group. When they were organized, they realized that in different parts of the country, there were what were called Negro branches. So they wrote a letter to the women of the Phillis Wheatley YWCA and asked them if they would like to become their branch. Now, that's the American pattern. Well, the women, led by a very able woman, Mrs. Boyce, sat down and wrote back and said, "Since we were organized first, it would be very good if you would become our branch." Needless to say, the white group did not follow that. That's how you got, finally, a YWCA downtown organized by white women, and you had another one on Rhode Island Avenue organized by black women, and so they became recognized. The National Board recognized both of them, and that was the only city in the United States where you actually had that occurring. A complete reversal of the pattern of the YWCA. Well, but you see, it was also true that the white women were runningâ you knowâtrue to the pattern in the country, which was that the white would be the head for the central unit, and if you had a Negro unit, it would be a branch. But could they fight that, if they were so strong and they organized it themselves and were such marvelously independent women?ï»¿39 They didn't need to, once they were given status as a separate association. Now, of course, as times have moved ahead, there has been a consolidation in Washington that followed the Supreme Court's decision in '54, so that the situation is now changed. But you still have a residue of those earliest feelings so that it isn't as it is in many communities, where black and white women are working together harmoniously. There, there's still that residue of feeling, even though they are trying to work together, since the Supreme Court's decision and since Washington essentially...because in those days, and even when I first went to work there, Washington, D.C., was completely segregated. There was not a toilet in downtown Washington that could be used by a black person. I cannot tell you how many times I've been downtown shopping in stores, and you would realize that there's just no place, no facilities designed at all...only at the Union Station could you get a sandwich and a cup of coffee. So that you see, with all due respect to it, the YWCA was the first Place in the District of Columbia, outside of Union Station to open its cafeteria. That's the downtown YWCA, the former white association which by now has all changed. Is it integrated, or is it more black now? Yes. Well, because the community is more black. The Washington community has changed, so that now the white population has fled out to the suburbs, into Maryland and Virginia, leaving the core of the city predominantly black. The public schools are about ninety-three percent black. Well, here's an iffy question. If at that particular time when you went, or soon after you went to Washington, D.C., as the executive, if there had been an integrated YWCA, not a segregated YWCA, would the women who came to the capital for jobs from the South have accepted integrated housing without doubts or fears? Â°h yes. I think that just as blacks from the South as they have moved North have accepted whatever opportunity was there, the same thing would have happened in Washington. We just thought that those young women would be terrified of the situation, Â°f having to live with white women when they never had before. That's why... I don't think some would have preferred it. But, let's go back a minute. The time that the war was on, there were the beginnings of efforts toward desegregation. There was the tremendous protest against the segregation Â°f blood through the Red Crossâin the bloodbanks; there was considerable Protest against having a black and a white army go abroad. There was great effort being made to get black people into government service. You see, when I went into Washington, most of the blacks were grouped in the Bureau of Engraving. Now why was it that most of them were where you made the money, you know, were making the money? It was because theseï»¿40 (cont.) were lower skilled jobs. And you had very, very, very few blacks of any kind. What about the Department of Interior, where Harold Ickes was in charge? DH- Yes, but those were exceptional. They didn't have large numbers of jobs. I think what I saw happening was that the attitude toward black young women coming into Washington was that "Well, all blacks know each other and they will all double up." So the federal government made provisions to house the white girls. They immediately set up Meridian Hill and built new housing facilities for white girls. I organized a group at the YWCA to protest this, because we found that the thing that young black girls were finding the most terrifying was not whether the community had white people, but was that when they got there, blacks, families who rented rooms, exploited them. They could do it because the federal government was bringing them in so fast but it had no provision for them. There were people, for instance, charging four girls in a room, $15 a week, and making $60 a week off a room that had one dresser, often with three drawers, so that each girl didn't even have a drawer. Then they would not permit them to do any laundry, so if they washed their hose they had to take them back into their rooms. They weren't allowed to hang anything in the bathroom. I don't mean that everybody did this, but this got to be so prevalent that what the young women were terrified with was that they were just put in all kinds of conditions. People would just tuck them anywhere to collect their money. And they, of course had left home, and here they were in Washington; they wanted work, and they wanted to try to stick it out, hoping they'd get a great job as a secretary or something, but usually they were only in a clerical pool. We had young women who told us how they had typed. They just put them ln a pool and gave them a government manual and said, "Copy this to keep up your speed." And so some of them had typed this 100-page manual ten times. That's all they'd done. They'd come and see whether they were typing the same page, or whether they'd typed all the way through, and they'd have to turn their copies in. It was just like... PC: ^ They weren't utilizing them. â¢Lt was nothing! They weren't doing anything; they had no assignment, they were just in a pool. Then whenever there was a top job they would come and look them over and usually select a white girl. Then the rest of them would stayâsome of them had given up pretty good jobs. Or if they hadn't given up good jobs, they'd left home, do you see? There was also a black man in the housing agency, and he had bought the story that all black families always can make room for two or three moreâ they were coming to work on jobs, and they wanted some kind of decent living place. Well, Mr. Robert Taylor of Chicago had the housing assignment. When I went down to the agency and talked to him about what we saw happening, he said, "Oh, it couldn't be that bad." But finally, after we'd put considerable pressure, he agreed that if weï»¿41 (cont.) could document what was happening, he would see that the message got to the proper authorities. He called on a Thursday after^ noon and said that, if by Monday we could give him enough case stories to let him know what was happening, he would see what he could do. So I invited him, told him what we would do, but also invited him to come personally to a meeting at the YWCA, where we would present to him what we found. Well, we got young women from a great many of the agencies to come in. We developed a questionnaireâwe didn't need to pay anybody one cent because everybody had typing skills, and all the rest. They cut the stencils and they took the questionnaires out, and young women put their names down. "1 am Mary Smith, I live at such and such a place. I came to Washington such and such a date. I had a telegram saying for me to report in so and so many hours. I was to be classified as such and such. I understood I was to earn such and such. I find I am doing such and such. I find I am earning such and such. I live such and such a place." And what rent they were paying, what services they had, how many were in the room, what kinds of needs they had, what things were happening to them, and what additional costs they had because they had been relocated in Washingtonâbecause it wasn't just train fare. They had all sorts of costs, because when they came and went to the government agency, the government agency simply had lists of homes, or they would send them out to places in town and say, "Go there and look for a place." Well, between Friday morning and Monday afternoon, we had several hundred of these in hand, and because the government was working seven days a week, twenty-four hours, that wasn't hard to do. So they just worked around the clock, and got people, and we invited Mr. Taylor to come to receive them. Well, to his surprise, we had about 300 young women to greet him that evening, and he told them what the government was doing and what kinds Â°f allowances they were going to try to make for them and so forth, and they very politely let him finish. The young women then took up the discussion, and by the end of the evening, Mr. Taylor was saying, "Well, I had no idea that anything like this was going on." It immediately got through to himâbecause there were young women, some even from his own city, who could tell him where they had lived and what they were seeking. The government then appropriated funds and there was developed what they called the Lucy Diggs Slowe Home. Lucy Diggs Slowe had been the dean of women at Howard University for many years and was a legend in her own right. That was the first. Then in addition there were Midway and Wake Halls, and others. The Lucy Diggs Slowe Hall was the equivalent, but even Xn a sense, a finer place than Meridian Hill which was for the white young people. They immediately found, you see, that they not only needed Â°ne residence, but they had to have several. And that began to relieve the situation. But it was really the fact that the young women were willing to make their complaints, and not to do it anonymously. It s not an often told story but it's a very important story.ï»¿42 Well, it's practically never told because no one ever asks about it. Yes, it's a very important thing. Can you tell, for the oral history, how Negro people felt about the Second World War? Is there a distinction? Well, when you ask me that question [long pause] you make me think about the fact that I was once on a train, and found myself seated by what's her nameâElizabeth Dilling? She was...a Communist. There was an Elizabeth Dilling. I don't know why... It's an odd thing as to why she comes at me quite the way she does. I have...sort of Nazi feelings around her, and I can t think why, but her name is Elizabeth Dilling. And she sat next to me on a train and all the way down she kept saying to me, "Why do you people fight?" Why she picked on me? And I didn't know until we got close to Washington, and after I'd pressed her a little bit... I found out who she was. I think there were many people who raised the question. Why do you have black people fighting? What is often forgotten is that black people have fought for this country from the beginning. The first blood shed in the American Revolution was Attucks in Boston. Blacks have always been in the army, even when they were mistreated. There's no piece of folklore that says that blacks have ever produced a traitor, that there is no Benedict Arnold that you can point to. And that, of course, is a part Â°f the great mystiqueâthat here were people, denied opportunity, treated as inferior, who still had an allegiance to the country, and who protested, but went on fighting. When the soldiers came back from the First World War and marched through the streets of the South in Miami, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and places like that, the whites came into the streets and tore their uniforms from them. But they still entered the services. So that I think there is a sense of "This is our country," that blacks have, despite the fact that they don't have much to lean on. That is, they can't say, "My country cherishes me and therefore, I do this for my country." They do this because they say, "This is my country." I remember an actor, Canada Lee, who used to end almost every speech that he made quoting those last lines of "America," about "the land Â°f the free and the home of the brave," or something to that effect. The message that I always got, as a young person listening to him, was that you have the right to say, "This is my country." And I think often, nÂ°w, as I look back, that we talked about the mainstream, and we treated that like you would Main Street. We'd say, "This is white, the Main Street," without realizing that since the slaves were first brought here, that blacks have been a part of whatever stream there was. You know, re not in the mainstream of opportunity, but we certainly have been 111 the mainstream of making the country, do you see? That's why Marcus Garvey probably never caught on. DH: PC:ï»¿43 Yes, you see, "This is my country. I have a heritage; I am an Afro-American, but I am not an African." People feel this. "I belong here just like anybody else belongs here, and don't treat me as if I don't belong here," and if there's a responsibility, blacks have been willing to carry it. Now they've carried it and continued to protest. And that's why I think "The Star Spangled Banner" will never be popular among black people, because they've never been made to feel a part of it, but still they have never denied it. I mean, they say "This is my country," and so on. Now, one of the things that I think is equally true is that there always have been those voices in the black community who keep saying, "Why should I go overseas and fight for democracy..." When there isn't any. When there isn't any here. We're going over there to make the world safe for democracy, but we don't have it. We don't have it here. How can you? And so there have always been those voices of protest. It has not been sort of a blind and unreasoning allegiance. It's been a kind of patriotism that is simply... fulfilling your obligation while you fight for the right to be free. I think that's been the sense that I had about it. Even in Washington, when young women would come to work in the government agencies, you know, they would be taken in and told a whole lot of things about how to keep this as a secret and that as a secret and so on. I used to hear many of their conversationsâ"Well, why do they talk about that? You're supposed to do that in any office." So there was a kind of innate sense of doing your duty that I think kept people in, and that's what I was trying to explain to this woman, and I... Dilling. It all goes away from me now, but the part I remember most was that, sitting around her were two or three men, and it was so clear to me that they were interested in what we were talking about that when I got off the train, since it was in the middle of the war, I reported it to the FBI myself. [Interruption] We're mostly not told about why people who haven't full class citizenship are still feeling that this is their country and they're fighting for their country. There's no other country for them. It's just theirs. Well, yes. I sense this a little bit when I go out of the country, when I go abroad, as I have been many times. I remember once being in a situation where people talked about what was going on in the United States and about the problems and the like. I remember, I was quite young and I was in Germany after the war. I was traveling with a group, and I happened to protest the way they had treated us in the hotel. And this clerk at the desk looked at me and he said, "You're having a lot to say. If you were back in your own country, wouldn't you be lynched?" And it kind of...you know...that particular time, so many years ago, it just hit me right hard. I found myself fighting back and saying to him, "In some parts of the country, I might be. It would be more likelyï»¿44 OH: (cont.) in some than others. But still, there always are in my country, some people, in all races, who would be working with me, and I would feel differently." But then I kept saying to myself ) that night, when this was over, Why did I come through so strong to defend the United States? I was with a Canadian white, young woman, traveling and I kept wishing that I'd been with an American white. I said, "I wonder if a white American would have defended me?" I mean it was a dialogue with myself that I had that night. I just had to sit and think about it, and then I began to say to myself, "Well, why are you even asking the question? You are an American.11 But then I said, "What I have to do, when I get back, everywhere I go, no matter where I speak, no matter what the subject, I will somehow or other get around to that incident, and just raise the fundamental question. 'Who is ready to fight to see that a person like me is not lynched, and that lynching is abolished?' Or 'Who is ready to join hands to bring justice?'" That sort of thing. I So that in many respects, I think and I often thought, young whites are even deprived of the task of really thinking about what it means to be a citizen. Pr â¢ They are now. They weren't a few years ago. ) You see, they're deprived of that because they're not confronted as a black person always is. It's like saying that many whites take for granted, and can take for granted, rights that are guaranteed to everybody, but that others have to keep fighting. And when you have to defend it abroad, then all of a sudden, I think you see very clearly, well, I have to talk about what is unjust, but I ,also feel, this is my country. I've done this even when I've been in Africa, and I've talked with people and they've said things. It wasn't just that I was in a white country at that time. It is that way wherever it is that I find myself sorting , out what is decent about it, but also what is unjust about it. So I think it's not an answered question. I think it's a continuing dialogue, because you have to keepâyou have to have a sense of roots. I look at people in the Deep South, down in the poorest areas, and I go down there and I say to myself, "Why do these people stay here?" And then all of a sudden I'll be talking to somebody and they'll say, "Well, you know, this is our home." Then I have to say, now, I'm looking at them from the outside. This is their home. Why can't you have a decent place, in Issaquena County, Mississippi? Why do you have to go to New York to have a better place? Why don't you have a decent place right there? And I think that's the problem all over this country that black people face. PP. There were different reasons for Negroes, black people, shall we say, in 1939 and 1940, fighting the war, and I think you've told us. I want to switch you again. Do you have any theories, Dorothy, about why you went to work, both as a paid and as a volunteer worker in women's voluntaryï»¿45 (cont.) organizations? I stress women's voluntary organizations, rather than voluntary organizations. DH: Why I went to work? Well, you were at the YWCA as an executive. You were at the National Council of Negro Women by now, according to what we talked about last time, as a volunteer, and you worked with the Methodist women and other women in volunteer capacities or advisory capacities. Your main jobsâI know you have many jobs... DH: PC: DH: DH: PC; DH: DH: Well, let me say, if we go back and remember that when I was fourteen, and I did this work on the Constitution of the United States, and got intrigued with the Reconstruction amendments and things of that sort, that I think I react to the words "women's voluntary organizations..." I want you to react to them... I think of many women's kinds of groups, like clubs, et cetera... I don't mean those. I have always veered toward those things that seem to have some kind of an edge of a struggle with which they were dealing, rather than of activities. That is, when I left high school and I came to New York to go to college, and I was interested in a sorority, I was interested in Delta Sigma Theta b ecause of the fact that the women in Pittsburgh who had come out to my little town of Rankin to organize us into activities happen to have been Delta women. One of them gave me my first pair of silk stockings, as a young person, and the other one got me involved in knowing that I liked to work in debating societies and things of that sort. She got me involved in some forums and things of that sort, that I used to go downtown in Pittsburgh to work with. So that mine was a question of recognizing early that most of the things that I was interested in that had anything to do with the society were things that you cannot do just individually. You have to be a part of some group. And it was my kind of interest in groupsâand groups that were working on somethingâthat got me into it. It wasn't intent, you weren't intent on joining women's groups. They were groups that were doing the things that you believed in. Right, and when I was working withâyou know, even as a young person, I belonged to the State Federation of Girls'Clubs. When I was fourteen, I was president of the Pennsylvania State Federation of Girls'Clubs. And I remember... Was that a mixed group? No, no, black women. It was called the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs. But even then, the club that I organized and belonged toï»¿46 (cont.) what was called the Emma J. Moore Club. This was because there was a woman who had set up in Pittsburgh a home for unwed mothers, and it was really providing a service. In other words, service and action, somehow or other, have been the two kinds of strands- âsome kind of public service, some kind of social action. So this is what I think of being. In addition, when I was working in the Department of Public Welfare, what I discovered was that I was in a job because I needed to earn a living, and then after work, I would go and do the things I was interested in. As a result, I had a life of just steadily fourteen-to sixteen-hour days, because I was really doing two kinds of things. In 1937, when I left the Department of Welfare to work with the YWCA, and chose to work with the YWCA, it was because of the fact that I had just decided to bring these strands of my interests together. I was very active in the United Christian Youth Movement, so that as a result, I spent all my weekends with that. And I was always in the groups working on economic issues and political issues, that sort of thing. You did a great deal of that in the thirties. That's what I'm saying. What I'm really trying to say is, I never thought of it in a career development ladder fashion. It was a sort of a natural development of drives that I had. I had a sense of being driven to do something. Nobody ever thought of me that way because I always seem so peaceful and shy, but the point was that I had a certain kind of drive to be involved, where you were bringing about some kind of change, and I would go to my own church and then I would go to Labor Temple. I grew up in the church and so I saw the church as having a role to play in bringing about change. And if you look at it, every organization that I have been related to itself was involved in dealing with some of the social issues. When I was president of my sorority, Muriel Rahn, one of the very popular actresses said to me, sort of on her deathbed, "Well, Dorothy, you took the fun out of the sorority." And I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "Well, I think a sisterhood should have fun." Well, I would have felt guilty being maybe a little harsh with her, knowing she was dying, except for the fact that I felt that, at the time you are dying is the time when it's helpful even then to know the truth and think of the truth. So I said back to her, "Muriel, you made me a Delta." She was my sponsor in the sorority. "Maybe I didn't understand it, but for me, a sisterhood has to have a purpose, and you don't just have sisterhood for sisterhood, and I don't see how it is that you cannot enjoy yourself and also do something to make life better." I couldn't see it. And now, you see, the sorority is proud to say, "We're a public service sorority." At the time that I was doing that, we were saying, "We must work on job opportunities. We must work on the mental health conditions," and we chose a five-point program that focused in that direction. But you see, some people saw the sorority as social activity and they only wanted it to remain that. So that what I'm saying is that I think it's been my own drives, that whatever I have been in, sooner or later,ï»¿47 DH: (cont.) I have to confront it with, "What are you doing to bring about some change?" PC: Let me cut in here and ask you whether it was when you became the president of Delta Sigma Theta, that it became a service organization? DH: Well, I would say that I think historically, people would describe it as a service organization all the time. But then you come back to what do you mean by service? If you mean, service like... .let me give an example. A piece of work that the sorority had been carrying for a number of years had to do with what they called the bookmobile, and their intent was to provide books. So in Franklin County, North Carolina, there was a young woman, a member of the sororityâshe was a librarian and she had a library, and she collected books by and about the Negro, and she would dispense these and the like. Now, that's a service and it's a professional service and a very important one. Well, I think I contributed something different by saying, "You are saying you want to set up a bookmobile. Then what we need to do is to research...how we use what she has learned there in Franklin County, North Carolina, a fairly congenial place, and find some part of the South where the blacks just don't have access to books." Out of that we found four counties in southwest Georgia, Carlton, King, and I forget the other two counties' names. And I said, "Well, you say it's a bookmobile..." Now, every convention they read a report of how they were having a bookmobile. PC: DH: The same one or others? They read a report about a bookmobile. And finally, I kept writing to the chairperson and I said, "Tell me, when do you see this bookmobile getting under way?" And as I pressured her more and more, I finally had to send her registered letters, and I finally had to say, "By the power vested in me, you are no longer chairing this thing." I had to get another librarian and a group together, and we found out how you make a bookmobile. So we got a company to take a Ford Vanette and make it a bookmobile. We christened "The Bookmobile on Four Wheels" and rolled it into that part of the country, with the librarian from Atlanta University supervising it, and we put it out there. The bookmobile went into those counties, and I learned then that it not only carried books, but the Bible was almost one of the most favorite of all books. We never could get enough Bibles, enough hymn books, and when that bookmobile drove up and blew its horn, people came from all kinds of distances. And a family over at one place sent a pattern for a little girl's coat over to some other place, and they would tell the driver of the bookmobile, "If you find anybody who knows how to make children's coats, let me know." And he would find someone, and they would send the pattern to somebody who didn't So in other words, the bookmobile provided that kind of service. It also brought the black and white community together. But in addition, we met with the county authorities and said, "We do not think that aï»¿48 (cont.) private organization should provide for some of the citizens of the state of Georgia what the state of Georgia is providing for white citizens elsewhere in the state." Because of our demonstration, the message got through. Now, we could have gone on forever just providing books and so on, or talking about it, but what I mean by service is directly dealing with the issue, so that... The South later had vertical libraries, you remember. You could take the book and stand up and read it. But you couldn't sit down and read it if you were black. Yes, they had all sorts of things, but you see, through this bookmobile, the state of Georgia began to extend library services to not only blacks, but to the white poor as well throughout the state. So there's been a whole transformation of the services in the state. There was a big impact. Public service is something that makes some impact on the public good, and not just a benevolent kind of service. I would like to continue the Deltas even though we're a little bit out of our chronology. What made you want to become the president of the Deltas? Actually, I never wanted to become the president of the Deltas. In 1944, a couple of years before that, the president of Delta, Elsie Austin, had asked me to join a small group to discuss what we thought organizations like sororities should be doing. I remember it was in Dr. Charles Wesley and Louise Wesley's home in Washington that we held this meeting. And I said that I thought that a group like us, who were college women, should work to see that there was...and we called it this, "equitable exposure of Negro women to job opportunities." Now, that whole concept of equitable exposure meant not only trying to get women into jobs, but also giving people a sense of what kinds of opportunities there were. Because for the most part, we tended to be teachers, some few nurses, but the point was, we tended to group in certain fields, and that was because that was what we knew. So we set out to do this job opportunities program, and in 1944, I went to the sorority convention in Wilberforce to report on what we hadâhow we had seen developing career conferences and other activities related to thisâand somehow the sorority had a meeting that lasted late into the night, and someone awakened me to say that my name had just been placed in nomination for vice-president of the sorority. Well, this was 1944, and I'd been a member of the sorority just since 1939. I'd been working on developing this job opportunities project, but I just turned around and I said to the young woman from Nashville, Hel en Work of Fisk, who they said had done it, "I don't know anything about this, I can't be any vice-president." And I was getting up toï»¿49 DH: (cont.) decline, and she and a couple of others just said, "Sit still," and they pulled me down. Well, to my surprise, I was elected vice-president. And then, it happened that the president, with whom I was serving, after her first term, felt that she could not continue, and so in San Antonio, Texas, in 1947, which was the next convention, she just said to me, "I wish you would"âand she kept insistingâ"take hold." I was carrying quite a heavy responsibility, working in the YWCA and other things, and I said, "Well, I didn't know, and so I served. So that it all kind of... but I was elected PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: ...snowballed. Yes, it just kind of moved that way. It was just because you started on the Delta Sigma Thetas that I wanted to continue along that line. But I do want to ask you something you might be able to respond to and might not. In the thirties, you enjoyed the company and the challenge of your brilliant male friends and associates. You have this over and over again on tape. Did you have the same type of satisfaction from the women's organizations? Or did you find other compensations? Did you enjoy these people so much? No, I enjoy working with people who want to work on something. And I must say that I have found that when you get women who have real interests and a drive, it is very satisfying. I have no problem with feeling that I can only work where there are men or only where there are women. But you had such intellectual stimulation... Yes, but also, I would say that I was very fortunate when I first came to work for the national YWCA, in that some of its greatest leadership was there. I mean, the woman I worked with in public affairs, Elsie Harper, had been a professor at the London School of Economics. I worked with Rhoda McCulloch, who was the editor of the YWCA magazine, who was a tremendous person. Margaret Williamson, who was an author and leader in the whole field of social work, was the person who urged me to leave the work I had been doing in interracial education, to join the training staff. She, until her death, was at the Columbia School of Social Work, and I worked with her. You have to bear in mind the fact, even when I worked in the Department of Welfare, I had a chance to work with Charlotte Carr. When I look back over it, I really have been as lucky as anyone could be, with the kind of people with whom I was associated. With Margaret Williamson, there was a woman, Margaret Logan Clark, whom some people found difficult because she was such an intellectual. But to me, she was particularly stimulating, and she and I made a good combination because we could work things out in some kind of a way, and... But I have usually found on the national staff a person who put her mind into things, and I think this isï»¿50 DH: r PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) what I liked about it, and I've been very lucky to work with people who did that. You mean, most of the staff does not, but you met and worked with some who do? The people I worked with. And in the National Council of Negro Women, you see that to be associated with someone like Mrs. Bethune...to come along as a young person at a time when some of the women were just outstanding women thinkers who were part of things, so that that to me has been the greatest point of satisfaction. I knew Mrs. Bethune was. I don't know about the other women who gave you this intellectual stimulation at the National Council that you needed, and I obviously have no notion of what goes on at the YWCA. So if you found others than Mrs. Bethune at the National Council of Negro Womenâ that explains it. Well, for example, the first person I worked with on the resolution committee of the NCNW was Venice Spraggs, who... Venice Spraggs. Venice Spraggs was with the Democratic National Committee, a very beautiful woman, but strong and, you know, just brought the kind of mind to whatever she did that was sharp. She not only could present things but she was exciting in what she did, and I must confess... Where have those women gone? Well, some of them are still around. I mean why don't we have substitutes? ...Edith Sampson. Yes, I remember your working with Edith Sampson. Well, I think one of the things that one tragically understands about organizations is that when Venice Spraggs died sort of an untimely death, one of the things that you discover is that many of these women enjoyed being in the reflected glory of Venice Spraggs, of Mrs. Bethune. And when Mrs. Bethune could create a limelight that they were in, they liked that, do you see? Now... Because she was connected with the government and many other things that were going on. Right. And though these womenânow, Eunice Carter and I became friends because Eunice Carter had a very good mind. Eunice Carter was one of the few who remained with the Council for a number of years. But you see, these women saw the Council as a kind of launching pad, and when theyï»¿51 DH: (cont.) could no longer use it just for that, then it didn't have any place for them. There are others, less well known, who are really good workers, and working at it. But some of those older women, you know, didn't find that. They liked to be there when Mrs. Bethune could have all the glamor around, and they would enjoy it. But they don't like to be there when you just have to get in and dig for whatever it is, you see. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: It makes it very difficult for a smooth functioning of the National Council of Negro Women, for you to bat your brains out to get something out of it that is really needed. Well, fortunately, as you grow up, you know, you begin, your whole... you have to bear in mind, I have the residue of all that I've gained from people through the years, so that I don't have the same needs. And I think the same is true of other womenâthey don't have that same need, for that particular moment. They were active, you see. I think I do. At that same time, when you were frantically busy with half the things you're doing now, did you have time to think of marriage? Oh, sure. I not only had time, I thought of it many times. I found, however, that many of the men who might have been the most interesting to me were themselves engaged or married. And I had some friends, one or two, that I was especially interested in, but I found it very hard for them, and for one especially, to in a sense, accept the fact that, you know, that I was a person. And a strong person. Yes, and I finally concluded that somehow or other... I found it very hard to believe that the Lord intended for one person to subdue herself and become something else just for the love and friendship of another person. It was very hard for me, but I worked it through, and that's the way I concluded it. Because I had one friend with whom I was, you know, serious, and he went abroad to work with the Red Cross, with one thing and another thing, but somehow or other, he never really was able... There was always a kind of, "Why don't you kind of calm down?" climate, that I finally had to deal with. I said, "That's not my...I can't do that. I can't give up what I'm concerned about." And I found myself... It would have been playing a secondary role. Yes, it was almost like a competitive thing. Do you see? Mrs. Bethune was very helpful. She liked him very much, and she helped him to make his connections with the Red Cross, and that sort of thing. But I never felt that I could just give up everything that I was doing. I concluded that, and one day, I just said to myself, that there are someï»¿52 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) things that I want to accomplish while I live, and I can't do it if I'm going to be upset by worrying whether or not someone else feels that I'm overshadowing or I'm doing something. The day that I decided that, I found myself very relieved to have that thought. You really did work it through. And the compensations which you get from your work are equal to the compensations that some people get from their marriage, I would assume. Yes. Like everything else, I study things as well. And one of the things that I've been interested in is to understand how the over-emphasis on marriage has destroyed so many people, because it has meant that, particularly I think for women...I used to run upon so many men who would say, "Well, I can't understand why you're not married." And you know, they would try to tell me why they thought I should be married, how good a wife I would make. It always interested me, but you see, they themselves hadn't come to grips with the fact that when they got ready to marry, they looked for someone for some other reasons. And I think that I also have lived close enough to things to have seen a number of people, and a numb er of women especially, who are made to feel that there must be something wrong if you are not married. And so you try to get married, so you can at least say that you were married. Now, that doesn't mean that they've achieved very much. Only a handle of some sort. That's right. And then those same women find themselves just neither married nor achieving what they're doing. They're constantly adjusting to something, without having any real sense of direction. I see so many people that I've worked along with, and I talk with them and realize that they had seen marriage as a way of achieving something. Because their mamas and papas happened to... Right. So this is... ...a very good reason. In my thoughts about you, I couldn't imagine it [marriage], because you have so many places to go and so much to do. Also, I have to say, I think that the real truth is that I literally have enjoyed so many different kinds of things, that to begin to... Well, you couldn't take that person along with you on all those adventures that you have had, or the chances are you couldn't. And you do have one adventure after another. Well, I think that for a black woman in my particular generation, this was especially difficult. I think the present generation has more of a chance of finding both young men and women who have some kind of comparable opportunities, you see. I think the wave of the future is better, it isï»¿53 (cont.) different. Certainly. DBt: But you have to bear in mind that I came along at the height of the depression and all that sort of thing. And I have, over a lifetime, have had, you know, some very exciting male friends. I have dated some very interesting men, you know, with different backgrounds, different races, different groups. And so I have a feeling of having satisfying experiences at so many different levels, that to just be at one level, all this seems to me toânot be where I am. I think it was because I came along at the time when things were at a different place. Pr â¢ You did. I know you did. And I also think if I had not had the opportunities for involvement, you see... And so many of the men with whom I worked...we worked at things, and it was really satisfying. So that in my own experience, I have tried to help, and I've done this even in the YWCA. I've tried to say, "We must help young women find healthy experiences in a heterosexual world, so that they have friends who are men and friends who are women, and that they find satisfaction in those." I used to plan activities where girls met boys, not a boy. Do you see? This way, I think people begin to get much moreâI don't know, I just think your own self-potential comes through at a little different level. But if you spend all your life just trying to please a particular person, somehow the universe is so much more limited. PC: DH: Unless you happen to have somebody who's very exciting and takes you along on his adventures. Now, I listened yesterday morning to four women on a television show, talking about what it means to them to be the wives of famous men. They're the wives of senators, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And it was very funny. I said to myself, "This is fascinating. I could say those same things about men with whom I have been associated, and I was not their wife." Do you see? The wife of Senator Javits was saying that until she found something she could do for herselfâshe had to find something she could do for herselfâand until then, she didn't feel her self-fulfillment. Then they were talking about their children, and the way their children don't even want to hear the word politics, because they feel they were left out of things. You see? So it gives you a way of looking at it, to say, "There's something that the changing patterns in our society right now are kind of churning up, that ought to lead to a better kind of relationship between men and women, and a broader base of partnership between men and women, so that you have many more ways in which... If a man 's elected governor, then there needs to be some way in which that woman doesn't have to say, "I will be nothing but the governor's wife." Can't she also be something, and the governor's wife? You see what I mean? There's a way of getting that whole thingï»¿54 (cont.) looked at, because what I remember Mrs. Javits especially saying was that she hated to be in Washington because she was always "background." She was never herself. And she said, "I hated that." Now, some women like that. This is why I think there's no substitute for understanding who you are, and your own identity, and what you are like. Now, for some women, that's a role that they also enjoy and they find ways of doing their own thing. Do you understand? But for many women, and some of thoseâthey all acknowledged itâit just meant sort of giving up anything that they wanted to do on their own. And it's partly because, as great as those men are, those men didn't see that as important as it is for them to have this person as a helpmate, it was equally important for them to free that person enough to say, "And if there's something you want to do that is your own pursuit, you must do it." What I see happening, in 1974 is that young women coming along today, if they have to go to the most extreme, that fewer and fewer are willing to go that old route, because they find thatâjust take the statistics, women live longer than menânot every man or every women... The point is that this happens so much that they come out and once this is taken away from them, they're justâthey're lost. They're just nothing. They're nobody. And so they have no place to go but down, and so, at the end of their lives, their male-female relationship has not given them a chance to develop at least some of their own gifts, so they have some autonomous interests; and I think this to me is the important thing, that the autonomous person has to be able to feel themself as a person, in a relationship with another person. There's something wrong in the whole marriage pattern in our country, and in the female relationship in the culture, that has meant that the woman has to become sort of the background for the man. Do you see? PC: t>H: PC: DH: PC: DH: ...of that generation. Of that generation. And the fact... The others have rebelled... It's not like that now! Oh no, no, no! The rebellion is on. And to such extent that I think some of it expresses itself in extreme ways. But it's been coming for a long time. It probably came before and left, and has come again. Yes. Pr. I have one more question if we have time for it. Have you any thoughts about the special role played by women's organizations in the life of this nation?ï»¿55 Well, if there's anything you can say about American women, it is that they are organized. I think that women's voluntary organizations have been in the forefront for whatever social change there is. Partly it is that men are so identified with the status quo. The fact that this is a male-dominated society, and indeed a white male-dominated society, means that males are so involved in the systems and institutions, and have had such a dominant influence, that they don't feel the need to do anything to bring about change. So the effort towards change could almost be female versus male. Now, fortunately, there are many organizations which, by their broad social purpose, attack issues rather than persons, and there's where I think the women... Those organizations among women which have not tried just to be an ambulance service to democracy and provide entertainment for women, or outlet, or social contact, or prestige, but those that have dealt with critical issues, have made a vitally important contribution. Women pioneered on child labor laws. The whole struggle for suffrage for women sort of sharpened up the issues about the franchise and the body politic. Those efforts women have made to run for public office, whether for the presidency or whatever, always have been sort of at the growing edge. They have not been just trying to do what the men have done. PC: QH: PC: As a black woman, I would have to say that it's been the women, whether it's in the churches or in some of the other organizations, who have dared to tackle the racial issues. You very seldom hear the issues of race coming from the dominant white male society. They've all come from the oppressed people in the country. And even in the civil rights movement, where the leadership was male, what they leaned upon was the predominant female following. This used to always interest me. You and I've been in the South, in Mississippi and other places, and you would look up on a platform and it was filled with males and the audience was predominantly females and children. So it was the young people and the women who filled the churches night after night. The men were afraid to come. The men were afraid to come. Because in the black community, women have been able to go places where men haven't. In other words, all down through the South, if the audience had been filled with some menâif you could have gotten the men there, they would have had a greater risk, you see. So that's how the civil rights movement was really developed. If you really look at any of the crowds, they are predominantly women and young people. It was the college students who initiated it, and while those were young men, actually the young women really took the vigorous roles of leadership, but they always projected the males in the forefront. That was a calculated thing. So as not to eat their husbands and their men, you mean. Yes. So, it's the whole thing, and I think, without the kinds of steady ways that women have worked on the issues, whether it's with peaceâeven some of those war mothers that I don't always agree withâevery once in aï»¿56 (cont.) while, they've done something right, in keeping the issues alive. Or the efforts toward maternal and child welfareâthe whole struggle, what is going on right this moment. Every time the president vetoes a day care bill, those people come back and go at it. Whereas the men are busy off trying to see how you get the oil companies' profits up and how do these things move, the women are busy working on how do you get day care centers open, how do we get food stamps distributed, how do we get this sort of thing. Now, those kinds of efforts just wouldn't be there if women weren't organized. You cannot do anything without being organized. One of the reasons that I keep trying to say to women when they say, "I don't belong to the National Council of Negro Women"âthey say it as if it's something to be proud ofâand I just say, "Well, sister, wake up. It's not only that the Council needs you, but you need an organized effort. Sometimes when you're at home asleep, the National Council of Negro Women is doing something on your behalf that would be much better done if you would get yourself up and let yourself be physically part of it." As Dr. King used to say, the reason he had the marches was that there are times when you had to put your body out there, as well as your ideas and your words. You have to be ready to do something, and back it up. Well, the same thing I think is true here, and that's why I think that the kinds of things that have happened with women's organizations, whether they're in the church or they're in the broader society, are almost a crucial instrument forever making that growing edge sharper. It's not that we have solved it that much, but it's just keeping the issues alive. A representative of the Ford Foundation said to me not very long ago, "When you first talked to me about it,"âbecause we were the first organization of women funded for anything by the Ford Foundation. This man said to me, "You know, when you first talked to me, I had all sorts of ideas, and thought of women's groups..." I guess they think of us as playing bridge, sipping tea and the like. He said, "But, when I saw that you were talking about, about school breakfasts and school lunch and so forth, I thought, 'Ah1 Well, who besides women would ever have thought about that?'" You see? Men are busy working on big things, but who's handling breakfast in school, or lunch? So I said, "Well, you have to be very careful that you don't make that a sexist comment, as if to say, it's only that we think of little things." I'm thinking we also have some big projects. So he said, "No. What I'm really saying is that there is a precision about some of what I see you're doing. You take it, and you get it down to something precise." This is where I think women's groups...we make our best contribution.ï»¿57 (cont.) We talked about housing for low income families. Then you have to get down to what income, what family, where, and how do you get a house? For me, it's a concept of militance that means that you don't keep working about something, you work on it. So that you say, a militant attack for me means a direct attack. If I go at that thing, militant doesn't mean rhetoric or threats. It means the difference between saying, "We are concerned that more children have school lunch," and making a more militant attack isâand this is why I think the Black Panthers did itâto provide it. And if you don't provide it, see who is supposed to provide it, get them to provide it. But don't keep talking about it and passing resolutions. When I think of "women's groups," I think for years many were caught up in resolutions. But I think we've moved. I feel a sense of trying to move, at least. Pr â¢ The National Council has worked with many women's organizations, so you have some feeling of movement. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: Yes, and I see them more and more trying to move beyond that, particularly the black women. Black women have had to provide for themselves and their community the same services that the rest of the community can take for granted. So while there were large Florence Crittenden homes all over the country, we've had to provide for the young [black] mother who didn't have the benefit of family to take care of her. Or training them, which we're trying to do. I think this is a part of the whole story of what black women have had to do that just gets completely lost, and it's one of the things that I think Mrs. Bethune was very helpful in doing, and helping to identify âyou know, where you take hold, because we have a great, big social problem. You can get so overwhelmed with it that you would just keep on and say, "Oh, we've got such a problem." Then you have to say, to bring about change, one of the change strategies is to find some place that's weak enough so that if you could get that moved, and get a cadre of people working on it, it might begin to move something elseâinstead of just saying, "Well, housing is such a big problem." Then, "What little piece can we start on?" We always find that it ripples out. Better things happen. Yes. Like right now. We have been responsible for about sixty-two million dollars worth of housing being built for low income families. We never could have done that by just passing resolutions. You finally have to go down and say, "What does the law provide? Who's getting it, and why not, and what can we do to make it happen?" As a trained and skilled professional, did you ever find it difficult to work with policy-making volunteers in the YWCA?ï»¿DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: 58 Well, in my work, I never hesitated to say, "You can help me," when I was working on training. I always felt that the volunteers helped to def ine what the training needs were, but as a professional, it was my responsibility to design the training. And I think you have to see thatâand I always felt that it wasn't just that I was a professional, because every once in a while, I had a volunteer who was a professional in her field. And so I would say at that point, "Well, you know more about that than I," and I would follow what she would have to say. If we were working on laws, and the person was a lawyer, I would say, "Well, you know more about that, " and we'd go that distance. But then when I found that she was just being a lawyer, I would say at that point, "But, I want that law applied in the light of civil rights," and at that point, I knew more about it. You see? So it went back and forth. It went back and forth. I don't think you can divide anything. Because look at me, one minute I'm a professional, another I'm a volunteer. The same is true of many other women. I think you have to use people's talents as they come, rather than to label one as Duke Ellington put it, "beyond categories." You know, you can't put everybody in categories, I felt that that wasn t a difficult question for you because you work with volunteers at the National Council, too, and know how to work with them. I have no probl em. The only trouble I have with volunteers is there aren't enough of them. PC: DH: Miss Height and I on October 6, 1974. We ended the last interview on the subject of young women who came to the Phillis Wheatley YWCA in Washington, D.C., during World War II. You shifted jobs during the war, leaving Washington to join the National Board of the YWCA in New York. What induced you to move to New York at that time? Did the national staff job present new and exciting challenges? Were you able to travel more to different parts of the United States, or were there other new things to learn? Were there special reasons? I'd been asked to take a job working with the student movement across the South, to be the black member of an interracial team that worked with the colleges and the YWCA across the South. I had considered that, but when I went for the interview, which was in Nashville, Tennessee, I went down, leaving my job in Washington for that weekend, and I took a Pullman down. Then, when I got to Nashville, there was the white staff person, who was a partner whom I would have been succeeding, was the one who met me. And while we could look across the window and we could see the white staff personâshe was on the white side of the station, and I was on the black side with the black staff person... So, the white staff person went into the dining room there in the station,ï»¿(cont.) and it was agreedâthey had said to each other, I gather, before I got thereâthat they'd just check to see, to make sure both had arrived. And the white girl, Augusta Roberts, went off to eat her breakfast, and the black one took me into a dingy little hole in the Nashville station, which was serving colored people, and she sat me down, and asked whether I wanted coffee or whatever. I said, "Coffee. I was by this time devastated by this place that we were in. Well, out of a pot that looked as if it had been brewing for several days, the man poured some coffee that was more chickory than coffee. She sat down at a table, and immediately opened up a nicely filled shoe box that had in it boiled eggs, and fried chicken, and some bread and butter, and a piece of fruit, and a small sort of a can of some kind of juice. Then she took her little can opener out of her bag and opened up this juice, and the man brought the coffee. Well, I sat there, and I tried like fury to eat some of this. I managed to get something down, and then we went on outside, where we then made connections with the white staff person, who had finished her breakfast. All of us went out to a Seventh-day Adventist college there in Nashville, where a YWCA student conference was to be held. By the end of that day, I'd had enough chance to kind of assess for myself, and I knew that while I could deal with segregation and its problems, I didn't see myself really wanting a job where I would have to go through all of this day by day. And finally that evening, Dean Hilda Davis, who was then the dean of Talladega Collegeâshe was the chairperson of the personnel committeeâand all of us met at the black branch of the Nashville, Tennessee; YWCA which was to be the time the personnel committee was to talk with me. It was a rare combination of things, because in addition, another thing that had happened was, this being a Seventh-day Adventist school, they did not serve any meats. So everything you had was soybean and so on, and I didn't particularly like the taste of that. So that, I think just a simple thing like my body chemistry meant that by the end of the day, I just said, "I think I could tackle racism and segregation and these problems. But I don't think that I would be able to give my very best to a piece of work where I had to confront this daily." It wasn't that I wasn't aware of what it was about or any of that sort of thing, but I just said, give me a chance to do something else, that that wasn't for me. And that experience stood me in good stead, because when I did come to work, I understood the problem. Because I myself, who went into that thing very enthusiastically, I found that within twenty-four hours, really forty-eight hours of this...by the end of the second day... You were beaten down. I just kept thinking, "You can't take a job like this unless you see how you can really make a major contribution." So that that opportunity, I just passed up. That was the only one that I really pursued. There were other jobs that had been offered to me by the National Board.ï»¿60 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) Then in 1944, Helen Wilkins had been the secretary for interracial education, and she resigned to move to Grand Rapids, where she was to get married. Is that the same Mrs. Wilkins who became head of the YWCA? She became Mrs. Clayton. But she had been in the job as secretary for interracial education. I took the interest in that more seriously because it meant that I would work out of New York, which was my favorite city, and it meant that it was an advancement, and I felt that in many ways, I had... Opportunity... An opportunity to move, and I had done the basic things in Washington. As a matter of fact, the one thing that had me reluctant to leave was that in all the earlier days when I'd been in Washington, the black population in what was then called the Community Chest, now the United Wayâthe black population was segregated even in its givingâand all of the black contribution was called the "Capitol Division." What that meant was, all the black people in the Capitol, whereas others were residential. In other words, you might have a Rock Creek section, or a Capitol Hill section, or a Georgetown section and all. That meant, when you went in those places, you got those people who were white; But blacks had a black team, and black agencies organized the whole campaign, and you got these people all over the city. Well, the assistant superintendent of schools (as you know, Washington had a dual school system), Dr. Long, who was the assistant superintendent was, for his day, a very militant person, and he accepted the chairperson ship. Some agency executive served as the staff person for the United Way drive. Well, Dr. Long asked me, and I had just agreed to serve. I had come in to assist the year before, and Dr. Long and I agreed that we would serve, he as the volunteer and I as the staff worker, for the United Keynote Campaign, but that we would do it by insisting that the policy be changed, so that there'd be an integration. If you went in to Fourteenth Street, you got all the blacks and all the whites, and whatever color the person was who went into the street, that person talked to whoever was there. No division of the funds between black and white agencies? No, no. The funds were allocated by agencies, very reluctant to leave. So anyhow, that made me Because you had managed something very progressive. But when I talked to the people at the National Board of the YWCA, they agreed that for the period of the community solicitation of the campaign, that I would come to New York, but that I could steer another person that I was able to get to take it over, so that we didn't backtrackâ the reason being that there wasn't that much sentiment for it. Whereasï»¿61 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) the blacks protested, the whites just took it. They took this change- But a lot of the blacks protested, wouldn't have been ready to tackle it, because they were afraid of the hostility in the group. So the result was that X covered that. Covered two jobs. That's right, just for that period, for the month of the campaign. So it was then October of '44 that I then came to be the secretary for interracial education. I didn't know what your title was. This fits now. Well, then that meant that almost immediately you started to travel, if you were in interracial education. Yes. Right. Did you have any particular feelings about moving around the country the way you probably did then? You didn't move as much then as now, but you started to move around, more than you did in Washington. Oh yes. Washington was a community-based job, and I'd done some traveling, but this was a job with a great deal of travel in it. I came into the YWCA national staff just at the time that Helen Wilkins and Juliette Bell, who had been the team who'd worked together, had completed the interracial study. So it was the very beginning of that part of the work of YWCA. That's one reason that also attracted meâthe fact that the YWCA was studying itself, and was coming to convention recommending that the segregation that was characteristic of the society should not prevail inside the YWCA. So that's what I picked up when I came in. It was up to you in a way to enforce it in other YWCAs across the country? Well, the job of the staff person was to help give professional direction to the efforts the YWCA was making. I worked with the office of public affairs. I worked along with civil rights legislation, wrote further materials. That's when I wrote my first little pamphlet on "Step by Step with Interracial Groups," because at that time, we were recommending a movement toward making groups interracial, and people were saying, "Well, how do you do it?" I remember, the first request I received was that I write a primer on how to work with groups of different races. And I struggled with that because there was something about it that I didn't like and I couldn't figure out why. And then, one day, I said to Polly Cochran, who was a good friend of mine and we had worked together for many years in group work, and we'd worked together at the Harlem branch of the YWCAâso I said to her, "I don't think there are any primers. What is a primer in human relations?" It was sort of then that I began to realize that thatï»¿62 DH: (cont.) was the thing that was blocking me. I couldn't seem to move it, but I kept thinking why does it have to be a "primer"? Finally one day, we were talking about it, and I was saying, "Well, there are different steps that you take. You have to understand different places where people are; to choose what kinds of activities help people who are of different races come together more easily than others; what kinds of activities are people most fearful of doing with people that they have some ideas about; how do such things as myths about health and disease and all that, how do these things affect the way people react in groups? And so forth." So one day she said, "Well, you really are talking about doing it step by step." So that's why I gave it... PC: t>H: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC; Then you were able to write it. She said, "Well, you're absolutely right." And so I set to work on that, and that is what...it was a part of the job to get the kinds of materials, the kinds of suggestions, the kinds of groups, kinds of meetings. This all developed and developed and developed, didn't it? Right. And that's what the job meant. Let me ask you whether, at that time, when you were as involved as ever, what did you do with the National Council of Negro Women? Were you still nationally involved? Well, at that time, I had been serving as the volunteer staff person. But I had convinced Mrs. Bethune before I left Washington to employ a staff, so that there was a staff person. I chaired the personnel committee, and worked with setting up policies and finding staff workers, that sort of thing. Did we have the house on Vermont Avenue then? Oh yes. That had been bought several years before that, while I was still in Washington. Actually, I'd only been here about a year when Mrs. Bethune, at the close of the war, requested Mrs. Ingraham, who was then president of the National Board... She tried to get the National Board to lend me to her to work with her, in the National Council. But of course, I had only been here a short period of time, and the YWCA was in the throes of this whole thing, leading up to the convention on the interracial charter. So Mrs. Ingraham said that she couldn't do that, but I was designated by the National Board as a representative to the Council. And so I was free to go to meetings and that sort of thing. Did you have an office in the National Council of Negro Women? No. I was chairperson of personnel. That's sort of an office. At this point, if there were to be a chairpersonï»¿63 PC: (cont.) of personnelâwe have had someone in since I've known you,* or known each otherâthat person comes to board meetings, sits in on the executive board. DH: PC: DH: PC: PC: DH: PC: DH: Oh yes. Plus, Mrs. Bethune was forever having me do special things. So you were as involved as you could be between New York and Washington, but not every day the way you used to see Mrs. Bethune. You probably talked on the telephone every day. Quite a bit, yes. Now, in the 1940s, the social workers'professional union was already established, wasn't it? Â°H: yes. So what was your relationship as a social worker? You were a secretary to the office but you were also still a social worker, weren't you? The job was called "secretary." Since then, the YWCA has eliminated titles like that, because it had nothing to do with being a secretary. It was a professional job. No, naturally, in that job I immediately became a member of the union. I had a very active role in the union, both in the National Board chapter and in the citywide local. Somehow I thought you did. Would you like to comment on it... anything special about those experiences? Well, the first union we belonged to was called SSEU, Social Service Employees' Union, and it was in the late forties. I can't think exactly which year it was, at the moment, that we discovered that Bernie Segal and some of the people related to the union really were, contrary to any agreement that any of us had, operating in a way that meant that they were much more interested in promoting Communism than they were in promoting the union. And so as a result, they tried to get the union to back particular candidates and do different kinds of things with which we disagreed. So when the time came for the union contract to be renewed... At that point, we who had gone through the kind of thing where, when we went to city-wide meetings, we would attend the meeting, and no matter what the issue, we could stand on the floor all night and never be recognized. Bernie Segal always recognized the same people, and it was... Not a new experience for you; you'd gone through that. I'd gone through it before, and some of us really understood what it was about. Then that meant that we had double work, because we were given assignments to attend all those meetings. Well, we got to the place where the union, our union leaders recommended to the National Board, that we not renew the contract with SSEU, but we * Mrs. Cowan is a member of the board of the National Council of Negro Women.ï»¿64 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH (cont.) would still maintain our collective bargaining relationship, but we would seek a new union. Well, needless to say, that led to a great upheaval, and the next thing we knew, SSEU had pickets thrown around the building, and it was really sort of a rough time. But we weathered that storm, and in relation to it, we were able to get Paul Hall of the Seafarers' Union and others; we had all kinds of peculiar relationships. We were a local of the Seafarers' Union, see, that had no social workers at all in it. I've heard of odd relationships like that with a union. So then we had, I forget, several other affiliations, that they had to give to us, you know, to keep us in the picture. So that after that, we were instrumental in getting the AFL-CIO to set up the Local 1707, which is part of the Community and Social Agency Employees' Union. Still is? Still is, yes. It was really a rough kind of period. You remember anybody from that period? Did you make friends through that experience outside of the YWCA? Oh yes, we had people. There was a young woman from one of the Jewish agencies, Hilda Siff. See, actually, what it amounted to was that through our efforts, there were others who had had that same experience, but we had Ethlyn Christensen. We were very fortunate, in that she had had a long history with the labor movement, and she was able to get Walter Reuther and some others to help us look at what was happening to us, and it got to be more than what would happen to the National Board chapter. It was the whole future for the white collar unions. And it was in many respects, one of the things that I think sort of brought some of us together. I know that many of the maintenance men and all, you know, worked down all the lines, because the maintenance men... ...stuck with the social workers? They're in our union. And still are? Oh yes. We're all in the same union. But it meant that during that period, that different ones of us, you know, maybe one of the janitors, or one of the elevator men, or one of us, we'd all have to take turns at covering the situation and keeping it open. The interesting thing is that although it was very non-YWCA-ish to have all this disruption going, the National Board still honored collective bargaining. Because what we were afraid of for a while was that we might have lost the chance of collective bargaining. And of course, bear in mind, we're talking about an era that was sort of dealing with that McCarthy period. So that made it doubly difficult,ï»¿65 DH: (cont.) because how do you interpret this without seeming to be a Red-baiter? Do you see? pC: Well, I was just going to bring up the McCarthy period, so we can walk right into it. I wondered whether that periodârather than affecting unions which I do remember something aboutâwhether it affected union members as blacks, or black leaders, black people in general... the McCarthy era? DH: Oh yes. You remember that, for example, I was very active in the National Negro Congress and in the National Negro Youth Congress and McCarthy held that anything that was dealing with the issues that we were dealing with that it had to be Communist, you see. Actually, it was at a meeting of the National Negro Congress in Washington, D.C., a meeting that was held at the time of the break in the whole approach to the United Front... PC: PC: E>H: PC: DH: War, you mean? War break? No, it wasn't... Well, I guess it was overseasâthe warâbut in this country, it was the time when the United States began to break from its united front with Russia. You see, when the Axis began to shift, and that was in about 1940âPearl Harbor was '41, so it must have been about 1940â and when at the meeting of the National Negro Congress in Washington, Max Yergen denounced Philip Randolph and the whole approach that was being made... PC: Because Max Yergen was a Communist. Well, Max Yergen was, I think, a sympathizer. I don't think he was a Communist. But he was more in tune with the whole Marxist line. So, all of our black groups were forever plagued with it. Mrs. Bethune herself was denied an opportunity to speak over in Englewood, New Jersey, at a high school, by the American Legion, who said she was a Communist. And the House Un-American Activities Committee, you know, sent people in to different meetings, and would then come back and put someone on your trail, saying that a person said such and such a thing in such a meeting. That was a terrible period, because it meant that if you protested against the lack of jobs or against discrimination, immediately you were considered a Communist. You were considered unpatriotic, that sort of thing. I had a weird experience once, when I was in New York and I went back to Washington, and ran into Elizabeth Dilling. We have it on tape somewhere, your feelings about herâsomehow you never quite remember her name, Dillingsworth or Dilling... I think it's Dilling. That could have been repeated many times, because there was a constant way in which you were harassed, you know. If you turned up at a meeting where somebody like thatânot like Dillingâbut where a group was protesting or speaking out against injustice and so on... You were then called a Communist.ï»¿66 DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH Then you were called a Communist. You were, you know, looked upon as Communist. pC: So it didn't matter that you were black or white? It happened to leadership people, protesting people, everywhere? DH: That's right. PC: Did the women's organizations stand up against McCarthy? Did they dare take a stand on McCarthy? Any of them? Well, I remember the YWCA and the National Council of Jewish Womenâa woman by the name of Mrs. Engel was the president of the National Council of Jewish Womenâand together these organizations decided, through our public affairs programs, that we had to do something about the McCarthy era. What was happening was that everybody was getting silenced, and everybody was afraid to say anything, and people would know that things were wrong, but they would just not speak because they didn't want to be attacked. So the two organizations joined together and did a thing called "Speak Up, Your Rights Are in Danger." It was a public affairs program. We did a whole series of things for discussions. Women did all over the country, and urged women to know their constitutional right, that you did not have to agree with what was being said, that freedom of speech was supposed to be protected. And that proved a very effective thing, because it got Protestant and Jewish, black and white... Not the National Council of Negro Women... No, no, no. We weren't a part of that. It was the YWCA. No, the National Council of Negro Women, back at that particular period, also underwent a very rough time. There were accusations that some of the women who were in office were related toâhad participated in some activities. I remember, when Vivian Carter Mason was very active in the Council, and she was invited by a group to an international meeting that took place somewhere in Europe, and she had been accused by the House Un-American Activities Committee of being a Communist. She went abroad, and in this meeting, she made a very eloquent speech, without really having the permission of the organization. She was speaking for herself. It was a group of women working on peace and different things. I remember Mrs. Bethune, for the protection of the organization, had to send her a telegram saying: "You're free to attend, but cease speaking in the name of the organization." It wasn't so much that she didn't wantâshe knew that we would be under attackâbut that it did not make sense for a person who, literally at that point, was unauthorized to be over there just at a time when we were constantly being under those harassing investigations, you know, trying to turn up somebody. Some investigations byâoh, what was the man's name who chaired that committee? The House Un-American Activities Committee? Oh, I know.ï»¿DH: DH: PC: DH: DH: 67 Voorhees? Something like that... PC: So it wasn't only Joe McCarthy; it was the times. No! McCarthy kind of kicked it off, and I hate to also add, Mr. Nixon, and Mr. Mundt. Yes, Karl Mundt. Remember, they had all those bills that they had up, and all the discussion around them, and then the whole attack on immigration. So it was a very rough period. PC: I remember it well from the white side; I didn't know anything about it from the black side. We don't hear that and I think one should hear that. We were just harassed. I had not been on the national staff very long before I went out to make a speech for the student YWCA in Glendale California. And at that time, it was understood that no black person could stay overnight in Glendale. The students were so eager to have me come that I agreed to go. Then I got there, only to find that the two young students who met me at the airport were as nice as they could be. And they said, "But we won't go straight to the college, we'll go by the house," and they went by the house of their staff advisor. When we got there, they explained to me that unfortunately, they had spent two or three days just trying to get the right for me to speak. It seems that Dr. T.Z. Koo of China had been scheduled to speak, and I knew Dr. Koo from the Amsterdam Conferenceâhe was a Chinese Christian. Then I was to speak. The American Legion came up and brought a protest to the college, saying both of us were Communists, so they said that was impossible. So then these young students said to me, "Did you ever speak on street corners in Los Angeles?" I said, "No, of course not." They said, "This Mr. Tenneyâ," there was a Tenney Committee out there, and this committee, you see, the states also had their little House Un-American Activities Committeesâ"Mr. Tenney saw our announcement that you were to speak. He went to the college and said that we could not have you, that you were a Communist, and that you had spoken about overthrowing the government on all of the street corners in Los Angeles." And I said, "I assure you that he doesn't know what he's talking about, and I don't know who he is talking about, but it certainly wasn't I." But anyhow, we had a very pleasant visit, and decided that the students were having enough of a struggle, and the meetingâthey knew that these people planned to plant people to come to the meeting and all. So we decided that we would just disappoint them, and not have this meeting, because they said that someone in the city hall had said that they could have the meeting, but they would have to have the police there and would have to do all these different things. So the students decided against it.ï»¿68 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Where was Dtâ¢ Koo at that point? Dr. Koo was coming from China. Well, they didn't say a thing! But it gives you some idea of the kinds of things that were just going on, that people just don't... Well, they don't remember, some they never knew about. Right. And not enough of it has been written about. That's why it's important to get it from your point of view. Yes. I started to watch on television last night this Rosenberg case, you knowâjust because it's an interesting thing to follow. I saw it on the stage. I haven't seen whatever they did for television. I guess it's on tonight. But the thing that many people don't realize is the way in which they made poor groups spend ever so much money just trying to defend themselves and their rights and their civil liberties, you see. Because there it cost them all that money for me to come across the country. I had to do something else in California, so I was able to leave and do that. But, when I just think of what it cost, and the agony and the way in which it could destroy groups. You see, as far as students were concerned, at that point, they then dug in all the more behind it, you know. That was their mood. But for the National Council of Negro Women, what it did was that all through the Deep South... People were afraid to join the organization? Yes, and what it did for us was that outstanding women, particularly those who were in teaching jobs, and that's where most black women wereâjust got absolutely frightened. And they would say, "Well, I like Mrs. Bethune, and I'm sending this contribution, but I'm sending a money order." They wouldn't send a check. They would give it anonymously. PC- * You couldn't gain any ground then. We couldn't gain any ground. We lost ground. We would explain to people what all this was about, but they were so terrified. Plus, you have to bear in mind, at that time, there was just no information in the South. I remember, I guess it was when Truman was president, and the report, "To Secure These Rights," came out, and I tried through the YWCA to get people. But all across the South, they would say...well, you know, there wouldn't be a copy in that whole state. So we had to carry our own copies and get it around to people. It was on newstands in the North, but you couldn't find it down there. PC: DH: I'C: DH; So that they even thought that a government document about rights was subversive. Subversive. Just like, you will remember, that when we first went intoï»¿69 (cont.) Mississippi in the summer of '64âthis was years laterâI took the report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights that had to do with the desegregation of schools. The superintendents in all the schools said why did we have Communist literature in our class. So it was a kind of legacy of this McCarthy mentality. I think it's still in some people's minds, the legacy. I think it's left its mark. DH: It's like there's something subversive. This was the point. It was seldom that you were called Communists. It was called "subversive activity." And you see, that's even more devastating. pr. You have done something that is subversive. DH: You are undermining the very foundations of your government, and you therefore are a threat to the security of your community. Anybody who then associates with you is guilty by that association. Or, if you were seen in the presence of someone like, I will say, Henry Winston, or a person who was a Communist, you had to be one, because you were associated. And it was that guilt by association that made the Council suffer, because people would say, "Well, we understood that such and such a woman was in a meeting, or did speak, or was seen on the platform, or that Mrs. Bethune... " PC: DH: PC; DH: PC: DH: It wasn't necessarily the person; it was someone of the same name or a similar name very often. Yes. Just like anybody saying, you know... I'm more aggressive now than I have been in earlier life, and anybody who would say that they saw Dorothy Height going from street corner to street corner in Los Angeles, preaching about overthrowing the government... And then, they would stand up and defend it, and the school president and all the student leadership and all went down and talked about itâbut the Tenney Committee held that, and somewhere in their records I guess they have it. The biggest lie you can tell is the lie that you saw. Yes. And that's just enough to scare people, who say, "Well, I can't afford to lose my job. I don't want my name to appear on the membership roster of the National Council of Negro Women, because the government is after them. " You see, a lot of people never understood what the House Un-American Activities Committee was. You couldn't teach it in school because you were subversive if you did. Yes. See, you couldn't teach it in school. You couldn't do anything about comparative government. And you see, in my lifetime, this represented a direct shift from a few years before, when we were more of an open society. A Republican, and a Communist, and a Socialist, and a Democrat, and whoever else, could all sit down together. Then'every-body'd leave the meeting, having fought out what they wanted to fightï»¿70 DH: (cont.) out, and each wouldâyou know, have their own convictions, that sort of thing. That's a very different thing from being in a time when everybody is suspicious. It created a kind of suspicion, and a kind of climate where people where informing on each other. It's almost like the same kind of thing that happened in the Nazi German situation, where people would say, "Well, you want to be very careful about so and so; they take this or that position." PC: DH: PC: DH PC DH PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: Now, the tragedy was, all down through Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia and all through there, the Council found that there were school principals and others who would just shake and quiver at this thought, because they would lose... Then you had, like in the state of Louisiana, people like Huey Long and people like that, hitting at the colleges, you see. So their colleges, if they had any kind of state support or anything like this, were just overly cautious. As a result, there was a kind of a killing off of any kind of creativity and any kind of learning. Where I came from in Illinois, one thing I remember very well was the literature. If you took The New Republic or The Nation... Oh yes... ...or any similar magazine, your parents would throw it out, or they would hide it or they'd say, "Don't put it on the coffee table." You didn't dare have it in. That's right. Because you were a Communist if you read that sort of thing. That's right. It was a steady pressure. And I think it contributed to a withdrawal from social action, and this was the reason for the program that the Council of Jewish Women and the YWCA had. In fact, at that time, in my job, I was working with the civil rights aspect of the YWCA's public affairs program, and I remember, when we were trying to get a thing like fair employment practices. So you really had to... That's certainly subversive. You had to deal with the fact that for many people, they could not divorceâthey couldn't get that separated from "Well, should we be involved with that?" You know, there was a kind of negative climate. It's a miracle really that we survived it. Survived it? At least, it seems we did. Well, I've jumped something, because I know that at some point in the forties, at least I think it was in the forties, you had a very bad automobile accident. It involved a long stay in the hospital.ï»¿71 DH: Yes. pC: i haven't yet heard you talk about it a great deal, so I would like to know whether it affected your philosophy. Do you have different feelings about life, since you had been so close to death? Whatever came out of that? I don't even know the details of the accident. : Well, actually, it was a series of funny things that happened. I had a car, an Oldsmobile, in Washington, and was on my way... I was scheduled to speak at Saint James Presbyterian Church in New York. You were driving from Washington to New York. No. I was scheduled to speak there on Sunday, and of course what happened with a full time job in Washington, was that I had to stay and finish my work there. What I had planned to do was to drive to the Union Station, and park my car, and take a train up. Planes weren't quite so easy then. I was going to take a train up, and leave the car there, and have it there for Monday. Well, I had a couple of friends in Washington. One of them was a girl who lived in New York. She had said to me that she'd wanted to come up to New York as I went, and I said I thought I was going by train. I was headed to the Union Station, and I went through, I think it was Sixth Street, and at that time, a child ran out from between two cars. Fortunately, I wasn't going very fast, so I stopped the car. The child got touched in some way. I stopped and the child's parent came up. And of course, I drove the child to the hospital with the parent, and the parent was, you know, screaming and going on. Well, when I got down to the hospital, the reality was, the man seeing this fairly new Oldsmobile, and I guess he saw me and thought, "This is a good thing that has happened to us." So that I think he thought he could get quite a bit of money out of it or something. But the child really was not that hurt. It was more a scare than anything. But in the meantime, I was so jittery about the whole thing that I called these friends, and they said, "Well, wait there." They came over to where I was. You know how you have to go through all the different machinery. It was a beautiful day, just like today. And I said I'd never had anything to unnerve me so. Fortunately, I wasn't driving fast. At the moment, though, you're all shaken up. So then they said to me, "Well, maybe what you should do is... Why don't you just decide what you're going to do?" So finally I decided, Oh well, I would drive. But they said they would drive with me, and one of them was a friend of this young lady, a young man friend of hers, and they said, "Let us, we'll go with you." So we came up to New York, and then the next day, that was a Sunday, and I spoke. They went up into Connecticut to visit some relatives or something, and then we came back to Washington. It was 19... What?ï»¿72 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: It was '41. It was bitter, bitter cold; it was January the twelfth. I remember that we suddenly said, it was so cold. So that what we were afterward told was that by closing the windowâand we were all tired, you seeâthe carbon monoxide in the car just meant that... I guess, just quickly, everyone fell asleep about the same time, and the car ran into a telegraph pole. Telephone pole? I guess a telephone pole, yes. As we got into Washington, which was about seven o'clockâit was one of those things. I remember we were very lucky because it was on Sixteenth Street, just near the Liberian embassy. A policeman came, and the weather was so cold that while we were waiting for the ambulanceâand of course you know you're bleeding and that sort of thingâhe removed his coat and put it over us. I never lost consciousness, and realized that my leg was broken. You knew right away. I knew right away that my leg was broken. It was when we were taken by ambulance to Emergency Hospital, which hospital at that time, of course, was thoroughly segregated. Did you have good care nevertheless? Well, we were very...it was very fortunate. We got in there, and as you know, Mrs. Roosevelt was in the White House at that time. Hamilton Fish's sister was the superintendent of nurses. Somehow or other, Mrs. Roosevelt, in talking to Miss Fish, found outâshe knew, Miss Fish must have told her, these three young people were brought in there in this very serious accidentâand when Mrs. Roosevelt found out that I was there, she came to the hospital. Well, actually, before she came, she... The only way that I knew that she knew that I was there was that one day about three dozen King Cardinal carnations appeared, and they were from the White House. Miss Fish came down, and she said that Mrs. Roosevelt had told her these were coming. So I was in a segregated ward, but over in the corner, they had a kind of a glass-like cage, I called itâit was like a partitioned area. They put me in line so that when the patient left, I was placed in there. Immediately, I suggested to themâI had private nurses around the clock at that timeâI asked them if they would... They took the carnations and put them all over the ward. I suggested that they take them, and distribute them all around and it really brightened up the ward. A few days later, Mrs. Roosevelt herself came to visit me. Well, naturally, that helped. Yes, I would think it might. I had about sixty some stitches across my face, but I was very lucky,ï»¿73 DH: (cont.) because the two other people, one lost an eye entirely, and... PC: ...splintered glass? DH: PC: t>H: The glove compartment cut the eyeball. As it did, it cut the rim of mine, but it didn't get into the ball itself. For a good while, you know, I didn't know whether I'd have an eye or not. So it was... So it was a broken leg and a stoved-in face? Yes. My face was flattened out, just like a tin can, just flattened. Mrs. Roosevelt was very interesting. The day that she came, she said that, you know, she'd heard that... Miss Fish had told her... But she knew. She said, "I always remember, you had a very pleasant smile, and I know that you'll be smiling soon." She was just very sensitive. But the interesting thing was, the pattern of racial segregation is such that the white nurse that was working with me was from Cumberland, Maryland, so it had been a slight education for her to deal with me, with all the peopleâpeople from all over the world were coming. The world YMCA office was there then. People like Muriel Lester, or like the people from the Library of Congress; there were all sorts of people, you see. So that by the time Mrs. Roosevelt got there, she'd had enough exposure so that she was at a different stage. I always remember, how upset she got because, when the word got out that Mrs. Roosevelt was on her way up, they were busy serving dinner (or lunch or something) to the other patients, so someone came up and said, "Clear the tables, clear it off." They didn't want Mrs. Roosevelt to see what they were serving, I guess. I had special meals. So one of the nurses aides, or what do you call themâorderlies, when Mrs. Roosevelt was gone, came and stood in the middle of the floor and said, "My goodness, what is wrong with these people, making us go through all of that just because she was coming?" Because they didn't like the idea that they were told to clear the decks you know, get everything straight and so on. Pr â¢ Well, was this one of those people who didn't like the president's wife? I guess so. pp. There were such people. She said, "Well, after all, who is she? She's just a woman like I am." So that upset the nurse who was working with me. She said, "Can you imagine her saying that?" And I said, "Well, there is no other country where you would hear an orderly in a hospital speak about the wife of the head of the nation in that way." And I said, "In addition, it's a very interesting kind of thing, because what you can't tell that woman is, there is no difference, she is a woman too." And she said, "She's just a woman like I am, and I don't care what they say," and so on. I said, "But what she has to remember is, they're both women, but the other one is only the wife of the president of the United States! That's the difference in them." [laughter]ï»¿74 DH: (cont.) So I said to her, "The other interesting thing to me is... what she resents is, the president's wife coming to see me." I said, "You see, that's what worries her. Had she gone in to see some patient on the other side, where they're all white, that would have been all right. But what does it mean that she's coming here to see me? There must be something wrong with her." I said, "But in addition, it's also a crazy country, because she speaks to me, and she first knew me as a young person, she calls me Miss Height, and you awaken me by calling me Dorothy." She said, "Oh, well, you know, Miss Fish gave us orders we're not to call any colored patients..." I said, "Well, that's all the more ridiculous. It doesn't matter to me what you call me, but I just want to tell you, while you're talking about what things are ridiculous, let us talk about that, that the head of the nation, his wife calls me, says, 'I'm glad to see you, Miss Height,' and you awaken me saying,'Dorothy.'" I had fallen asleep, because what I tended to do, while the other people ate their lunch, since I had mine served specially... Why was yours special? ^H: x had a private nurse. I had to have twenty-four hour nursing. So the nurse would bring mine. That's all. I was not served on those tables. I guess I had a special diet, I don't know what the diet was. Truthfully, I hardly remember the diet. But the point was, she always went and got my tray and brought it in to me, you see. So I had learned, I developed a whole way of life. I found out that at that time they had a centralized radio, and I would usually nap while they ate their meal, because I wasn't permitted to have visitors, and only one or two people could come at a time or somethingâit had to be specially arranged. So that being the case, I used to wait until the visiting hours. Then I could request the symphony and things I wanted to hear. Otherwise, I had to listen to what other people wanted. But during visiting hours, nobody wanted radio, you see, so if you got your order in early, whoever got it in firstâI always got an early order in for something during visiting hours. So I had fallen asleep, and the nurse came to me and she said, "Dorothy, there's someone here to see you," and when I awakened, there was Eleanor Roosevelt. PC: DH: PC: DH: Fantastic. I've often thought of that. That's the nurse, the young woman, who taught me how to knit in the hospital, because I had nothing that I could do. You weren't able to read. No, because they were trying to preserve my eyes and therefore they didn't allow me to read. But I had her read to me. Soon I reached the place where I could look up and see a card that had a rose on it or a bird or something, and I would say to her, "Take that card," and I would tell her what the card said, because she would read it to me, then I would memorize it.ï»¿75 PC: DH: PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: You were learning. I had to do something. So when she would read it to me... What took so long, your leg, or putting your face and eye back together? Well, actually I broke the tibia, which is the largest bone. Then I have sort of miraculous healing powers, so good that while they had sent out word asking people to give me blood, the blood that was given to me, I was able to contribute to the blood bank. And they in turn gave blood to the other two young people, because I never had to use any, although I lost an awful lot of blood. My blood replaces itself very rapidly. But what happened was likewise that my bone growth moved very fast, and when it had healed, they suddenly realized, it had grown so fast, it was a little crooked, so it had to be broken and start again. I had to get a new growth. Then, I was first in a cast up to the hip. Then later the cast was made down to the knee. But all of this time, I had to be in bed. And then, after that, they put it in what they called the Titchener wire leg, and that is a traction, and they put weights on it, and you know, when they removed five pounds, you knew that you were getting that much better, and it got down to fifteen, to ten and so on. So that's what really took the longest period of time. PC: About how long? My face was all scratched up, heavy, heavy markings right across the face, in all that period of time. Actually, when I came out of the hospital, I came back to New York to stay with the family with whom I used to live before I went to Washington. I had to be brought from the hospital through the Union Station onto the train, all on a stretcher, that sort of thing, because though I had to learn how to walk on crutches before I left the hospital, I had just only learned two days earlier. I was literally in the hospital eighty-nine days. I knew it was a long time. And most of that time, under tension. But you know, an interesting thing happened. When I was active in the United Christian Youth Movement, I was at Lakeside, Ohio, at the time that Paul Dietz wrote a hymn to the tune of "Finlandia," as the hymn of the United Christian Youth Movement. I was a part of a group of young people who first introduced that song, and the theme of it is,"We would be building." On the morning of the accident, when we got to Emergency Hospital, and I recalled being placed in the emergency room, the intern who was assigned to me, to sew up my face, leaned over and he started to work, and as he was working, he whistled, "Finlandia." And while he was whistling "Finlandia," in my mind I went over all the verses: "We would be building, temples still undone, o'er crumbling walls, their crosses scarcely lift, waiting till love can raise the broken stone, and hearts creative easeï»¿76 DH: (cont.) the human rift. We would be building, Master, reveal the plan, of the kind of world that Thou would make with man." As he did this, it was almost like therapy. I don't know how to describe it to you. There's a mystery about it that I can't quite... PC: You couldn't do that logically. It's illogical and it's quite beautiful. DH: And then the way that he kept humming that tune. He kept whistling it, and it wasn't quite a whistle. Have you ever heard people whistle somethingâit's a soft whistle? I'm not sure. It's not what they call humming under your breath, is it? UH: It wasn't humming, but it was just a little bit of a whistle. It sounded to me almost like a flute. Now, that probably was partly my own condition, but... PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: You were a little bit out and didn't know whether you were out or not, I would imagine. No, I never lost consciousness. ^C: But they had to give you something to take those stitches? They might have given me some kind of anesthetic, some anesthesia, administered, but that's pretty local. They don't give you anything for that. No. I meant that, a local. But you know, you were in a condition... But the point was, I heard what they were doing; I could see what he was doing. Weren't you terrified at any point? You don't sound as though you were frightened at any point during this accident. No. One of those things, that's characteristic of me, if I go into a hospital, I just... Put yourself in their hands? Put myself in their hands. Secondly, when you are that far out and gone, you don't know how far out you really are. But those eighty-nine days... Your leg never really healed completely, did it? Yes. It did? My leg is healed. But it was broken in two places, you see, down below, and at the... Well, I guess I shouldn't say healed, but it seems to me every so oftenï»¿77 PC: (cont.) when you're really tired, you have a limp. DH: Some of that is psychological. It is that I don't trust the resilience in that one ankle. And, also, it is true that if I get very tired, the leg that was injured swells, and the ankle that was injured swells. See, I was hurt both at the ankle and in the main part of the tibia, as well as in the face, you see. But one of the things that I discovered then was that, being so active and so involved, I had to keep myself active. PC: You had a long time... DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH Because you see, one of the things that happened is that my eye was in such bad shape that they didn't even want me to see a mirror, or to see my face. You must have looked just dreadful. That's right. They didn't want me to see myself at all, and they did not allow me to read. I had books that I... I was very lucky with the nurses that I had, because each one of them took a very special interest. One of them kept asking me what I was, was I a movie star? Was I a dancer? What was I? Because... You were obviously a very special person. She couldn't understand. I sent out, you know, over 1,800 individual acknowledgements when I came out of the hospital. The whole thing got so boomed that every church in the city, every agency in the cityâevery church would send me messages that "We prayed for you this morning," or "We prayed for you tonight." People all over the country, people that I hardly realized knew me, would send messages and that sort of thing. So that what I would do was to take these and read them, as I said, or play a game of my own. I'd say to the nurse, "Take the one up there," and I could tell her who it was from. You mean, you pasted the cards around? No, she would take them...when different ones would come, she'd put some up where I could see them, on a shelf, with flowers or something. Then she would hold up a card, and I could tell her who had written it. I practically knew every card. Well, you had to keep your mind active. That's right. That's what I was doing. What about the philosophicalâwhat about your thoughts during this time? Well, you have to live with your thoughts. I've said to many people many times, that though, as a young person just starting out and at an early point in my life, in terms of catastrophic illness... It was aï»¿78 DH: PC: DH: rjC: DH: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) catastrophic illness, because it was very expensive, to have to have twenty-four-hour nursing service for all except about the last two weeks that I was in the hospital. I cut it down to two after a while, but I had three for a long period of time, and I had to have this cubicle. It really wasn't a private room. I also had to have special therapy. It was very interesting that the plastic surgeon who did the face-lifting for Wally Simpson was somewhere in the West Indies. The bone surgeon whom I had, who happened to have been really about the best that there was in Washington, somehow knew him, and he had him come in to see me, because they kept thinking that I was active in public life. You had to look like a human being. That's right, and my face, really... it's just hard to say. My nose was pushed down flat, just like a tin can that you step on. And your cheekbone was gone. My cheekbone was gone entirely, just completely gone, there was just no cheekbone at all. So therefore that made my face have kind of a weird contour, you see. Then, in addition to that, they were worried about the eye, whether the eye would be destroyed. But after a while they discovered that something about the rapidity of the blood circulation... what that really meant in terms of recuperating. But then this man came to see me, and he told this surgeon, he told Miss Fish... Incidentally, Miss Fish then used to come around all the time, so I got the best of what they had in the hospital at the time. I must say I can't complain at all about it. I was black and had to be in a segregated area, because that's the way Washington was at that time So, th is man came, and then he went off to Bermuda, I think it was, somewhere in that area, and he kept in touch with the doctor. But after a couple of months, the bone specialist, whose name I can't recall, said to me that he thought that what I should do was wait until the bones were all healed, until I was off crutches and that sort of thing. So he checked me out regularly. Then one day when I was there he said, "Well, I have to tell you, this is the kind of thing that you often hope will happen but seldom does." But he said, "In a strange way, your cartilage and all is rebuilding, and so, though you will not have a real cheekbone, you will have enough there that will look like..." So you never had any... So I've never had any surgery done. Fantastic! And all I have now as you can see, is a mark across the nose. The scar, but it doesn't show.ï»¿ 79 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: That scar started here and went straight on up to this eyeball. It started at one ear and went up to the other eye. Because what happened was that the glove compartment cut across my face, and the edge of it went into the other girl's eye. When the crash came against the pole, we both hit the dashboard and the glove compartment did it. But I've often said that those were the most expensive, but in a sense some of the most valuable days... There you have a word that I'm fishing for, "valuable." do to your psyche? What did they Well, they gave me an opportunity to just get some sense of my own direction, and... You did a lot of thinking and evaluating. I did a lot of thinking. I was able to review things. The nurse, as I was telling you, asked me if I'd ever done anything like handwork or knitting. I had never done any knitting. So she taught me how to make an afghan. I made an afghan while I was there. The woman from England who was with the world YWCAâwhich was temporarily in Washington because of Pearl Harbor, and the war and they had to move out of Switzerlandâ brought me her collection of Agatha Christie, and I had never read anything in detective stories before. So, I began to readâwhen I could read myself. After a couple of months, I could do some reading, limited, but I could do it an hour at a time. But also, it meant that I had a chance to think, and to get some realization of my own inner strengths, that's all. Well, that's not all, that's important. Well, I mean it really was... Do you ever have a flashback about the accident or has it completely vanished from your thoughts? People said to me, when I was in the hospital, "Well, you'll never want to see another automobile." And I said, "Well, I'm waiting for one to take me out of here." It meant that I had a chance to think through. I never have had any fear of automobiles or anything of that sort. I don't get flashbacks. We'll have to leave your accident, for the moment, and I want to ask you about your appointment to the Advisory Committee on Women in the Services of the Department of Defense, which I've heard you call DACOWITS. Yes. That was in 1942. Yes.ï»¿80 Pc= Can you tell us what that meant? What was the nature of your responsibil- ity on that committee? Did you influence foreign policy? What was it? Well, I guess part of the whole awakening of concern about women was recognized by General Marshall. As he was leaving the office of secretary of defense, he got Anna Rosenberg to come in as the assistant secretary, and Anna Rosenberg realized that there were any number of problems that women were facing in the service, that never got looked at. The whole service was about servicemen, and everything in the service was designed as if it were for men, and then when women were placed in it, women had to just sort of fit themselves in. Pr â¢ The WRENS and WACS is this, or what sort of positions for women? DH: PC: OH: PC: DH: I'm talking about women in all of the services, that's the air force, the army, the navy. You're thinking of the... There were the WACS. Oh yes, the WAVES, WACS, WRENS, the other groups that Ruth Streeter headed up. But every branch of the service had women in the services. I hadn't even realized that. Therefore, this was called Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services. It wasn't any one service. So on the last day that General Marshall was at the Pentagon, we were sworn in by him for this assignment. So I was the firstâI was the first black woman on the very first committee. General Marshall on that day, as he was leaving, had a four-gun salute, so we were ushered into the Pentagon by a tribute; a salute from all the services formed an honor guard on the entrance to the Pentagon, and gave a salute to General Marshall and to us as we took office. Our assignment was to discover what was happening to women and to get acquainted with what they saw as some of their needs and concerns. We were, first of all, given our own briefing; General Bedell Smith of the intelligence service of course, briefed us. We had to learn very early that for us to be useful, we had to be in a sense inside the defense establishment, but yet we had to act like voluntary citizens. Now, I always remember he took us once to Camp Lejeune and they showed us the signs of things to come... Scientific? Well, the kinds of aircraft, and kinds of warfare equipment, things that they would be using, that women would be related to. I always remember his saying to us afterwards, "You had to know this so that you would understand the critical nature of your assignment. But now you have to move about and act as if you have the knowledge of this, but never speak of it to anyone." So it gave you, you know...that realization of howï»¿81 DH: (cont.) the military has to operate. PC: DH: We visited all kinds of installations, in every branch of the service, and we set up policies. I, with Mary Lord and Mary Rockefeller, that's the first Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, we were assigned to look at the whole housing situation. We had a health committee that looked at the diets because what the young women were complaining about was that the army acted as though it only had meals for men. Heavy diet. So that salads and things of that sort just weren't there. They complained about the austerity and the drabness of the army colors and the things that they had to be exposed to, and they wanted things like their stuffed dolls, and they wanted their stuffed animals, and gingham curtains, and I don't know what all. So that we made major recommendations in that direction, about the housing conditions and the things that were needed. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Then, by the time we would get to the next meeting, to our surprise, many of those things that we recommended would be put into action. And we would say, "Well, how did that happen, before the committee met again?" And the word would come back to us: "Well, we promulgated it." And we discovered then that if you did want somethingâyou know, if we did it, it went down the line of command, and they had salads I guess by the time we got home. That must be the way the defense department works. I never knew it. I think you begin to get some appreciation for the fact that if you're going to have a disciplined service, there are just ways that you have to... You cannot have group discussions on every item forever. That's what used to get us, because we would say, "We only made a recommendation. We just recommend. We thought when we'd get to the next meeting, we would discuss it." They said, "No, you're the committee on housing and you recommend that this is what is needed and our job is to see that it moves." So in the different line of command, that would move. How many years were you on that? Well, served, I think it was a three-year term. Three or four years. I served whatever period a term was. It constantly evolved? I mean, the housing was solved and other problems came up? Oh well, I was not only working on housing, but I also worked with Dr. Kenworthy, who was Marion Kenworthy, the psychiatrist. She did the work on the charges that were made about homosexuality, all that kind of problem. So I would work on that committee. Betsy Whitney [Mrs. John Hay Whitney] was on a committee dealing with standards, and so I worked with that. Now, I was cochairperson on housing with Mary Lord, but I also worked on a number of different things. I worked with Bessie Hillman [Mrs. Sidney Hillman] on such things as the...I guessï»¿82 DH: PC: DH: PC: BH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: (cont.) you would call them, recognitions and special celebrations. I worked with a woman from Battle Creek, Michigan, who was a nutritionist from the Kellogg Foundation and she was dealing with diets. So, it depended on where you were going; if we made a trip, a field trip, it might be that one of us from housing, and one dealing with food, and one dealing with standards, would all go together. Then there were times when we would go from an army camp to another army camp. There were other times when we would visit the hospital services. This was all scheduled for you. You didn't have to worry about it. No. You had to have scheduled trips, and then wherever it was, you went by special planes, army planes. Was it a rewarding experience to you? Well...yes it was. It was an interesting experience. Well, let's put it this way, was it more or less rewarding than your appointment and work on the New York State Board of Social Welfare at the end of the fifties? Well, needless to say, as a person with a social work background, I was much more interested in social work. But I suddenly discovered that I couldn't let my feelings about the war affect my concern about young women who were in the services. You see, there was a way in which I was working on social welfare in relation to the services. In addition, I have to say, there is a glamor about the defense service that you just don't have in the social welfare field. It meant that we moved around and saw a whole side of American life that I didn't realize exists. No, I'm sure you don't. It's a hidden... No. Everywhere you go, you go into the officers' clubs, and you're given a very VIP treatment, because you are an official visitor, that sort of thing. And we spent an awful lot of time learning about different kinds of things. I worked a lot on the racial situation, and had any number of young women who were in the services who were discriminated against. So I was always getting involved in other things, because I was on the Department of Defense Advisory Committee. I think it's very different from a board like Social Welfare. ...which is a question of state, for one thing. Yes, and plus the fact that you are making policy there, whereas in the other, you are influencing policy. In which are you making policy? The New York State Board of Social Welfare. In a way, you're making policy at DACOWITS too, because when youï»¿83 ^C: (cont.) recommended anything... DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Yes, you're influencing policy. But what I'm saying is, that with the defense department, there are some things that we just had to hammer away on and hammer away on, because they were in the bailiwick of some other institution or line of command or something. But when I see now what has happened in the services, and when I realize that some of what we were doing way back then contributed...because we began to move on such things as getting young women to have some voice in what was happening, because... Everywhere we went, we stayed in the barracks. We never stayed in hotels, wherever we went. So we also had a chance to experience what life was like. When I first knew you, you were going once a month to Albany, and I felt you really did enjoy that, although often I know it was a drag to have to go. Nevertheless, I had a feeling that you enjoyed that committee, or board. Well, yes, because it was a board that was directly involved with shaping the social welfare policy for the state. It is the policy making, it is a statutory boardâthat is, you're a paid board member for each session that you attend, because it's that important. You know, you're really carrying out a... DACOWITS was an honorary post, and the New York State Board of Social Welfare carried some money with it, right? Yes, DACOWITS was a volunteer post. There was no stipend for your services, no. It must have taken a great deal of time. Yes, it took a lot of time, because you had to literally get acquainted with the services. It's not anything you could imagine. And also, we had to give time for all those long field trips. In other words, we had to be ready to... If they went off to go to visit air force locations, you had to be ready to devote several days to it. In other words, it would never be a one-day thing, because then we would first travel for a couple of days, and then we would come in to Washington maybe for a couple of days. So it took the better part of a week whenever you did it. You'd have no base for judgment and no way to understand it if you didn't get out and meet the women officers. Do you remember how many trips there were a year? Well, there were about four meetings a year, and at least two of the meetings had trips. It's very interesting to me now that Colonel Halloran, who is executive of the WACSâI knew her when she was made the first woman colonelâand now General Jean Holm who is the first woman general, was a major, I guess, when we started. So women have advanced in the services. Then, we went through a whole period of trying to determine what kind of work women could do in the services. That was an interesting thing.ï»¿84 [This is November 10, 1974.] Now, we didn't finish the fifties during our last conversation. I thought we might get up to the sixties by now, but there's so much to talk about. DH: Well, what do you call the fifties? pC: We were talking about things that went on earlier, for example, when you went to India for the School of Social Work, when you went to South America, went to Africa. I think those experiences are important for your history, so if you don't mind, I'll ask you specific questions about those times, those experiences. Now, in 1952, it says in your biography, you went to India to serve as a visiting professor at the Delhi School of Social Work. You are a gifted trainer. One thing I want to know about this is, was your color an important part of the training process in this special situation? Well, first of all, Professor Eduard Lindeman, who was a renowned social worker and social philosopher and related to the New York School of Social Work, had been in India, teaching at the Delhi School of Social Work, where he became ill, and he returned home. So the request was made to the United States because the Delhi School of Social Work was really originated by the YWCAs of India, Burma and Ceylon, with some assistance from the YWCA of the United States. So therefore, when I was asked to go out, it was to pick up where Dr. Lindeman had left off. I always remember that I talked with him about the assignment that I had, which was to teach group work. I remember Dr. Lindeman saying at the time that he wanted me to help teach something about group discussion and how you get people to enter into conversation without battling each other. And he said, in a kind of a humorous way, "Also, not only teach them group work, but try to get them to understand how to enter into conversation that is neither an argument nor a debate." He said they had spent so much of their lifetimes debating and arguing against the British that they have an argumentative approach, even when it's pleasant. And he said, "So, if you could get those graduate students," because these were all students working for a master's degree, "if you could get them to begin to be helpful in that, this would be a very important thing." Well, sadly enough, Dr. Lindeman died before I could get back to report to him anything of my experience. Now, I landed in Delhi, the eighth of August, 1952. And without any opportunity for orientation, I was to take the first-year students out to Alipur village, because almost any student in India at that time who would have reached the point of working for a graduate degree would have been among those few with real advantage. The whole question was that of helping those students, especially those who were more privileged, to learn something about how to work with people of lower class and caste. But you didn't know anything about village life, did you? I didn't know anything about anything in India. I got to Delhi at four o'clock that evening; at eight o'clock the next morning, I wasï»¿85 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH PC DH (cont.) going to the village. But I was one of a faculty group. There were Indian faculty members there, a man with whom I could associate, so it wasn't all dependent on me. But it did mean that I had to take a teacher's role right then at the start. I couldn't go as a learner, a student being oriented. Our first task was to build the bore-holes for latrines and things of that kind, because we simply had nothing but the sky over our heads, and we had to prepare to live there. There were how many of you, approximately? There were about forty or fifty students, almost half men and half women. This was a brand new experience in India for ninety percent of those people...to have something in which both men and women participated was unusual. And I remember some of the women students told me they stayed awake all night because there were men sleeping out there. Now, of course, the way the whole thing was arranged...we had a men's camp and a women's camp, and they were all of them staying in an open field, say a good city block away from each other. But all this was such a new experience that these women students wereâwell, some of them were frightened and shocked. They just didn't know, and they kept wondering, what would their parents say if they knew that they were out there and there were men sleeping down at the other end. As to colorâI went as a colored person but I was an American. And so I had it both ways. The students, from the very outset, were eager to try me out, to see how I would fit in, and that sort of thing. You mean they were testing you? Yes, they were testing, because they needed to know what I was like. One of the students asked me, just on the first day, "Why did they send you out here?" And I said, "Well, what do you mean?" She said, "Well, I came to get a master's degree, and I didn't think they would send an inferior person." What tone was her skin? She was an Indian. So she had a tone to her skin. Oh yes, all of them. A dark tone. All of them were colored. So I said, "Well, what do you mean?" The other Americais who had been sent there were Deborah Pence, who was a white woman, and Dr. Eduard Lindeman, who was a white male. She said, "I thought they were sending an American." I said, "Well, I am an American." She said, "But you're not an American, you're a Negro." So then, that opened up a whole discussion, and I said, "Is it thatï»¿PC: DH: t>H: PC: DH: PC: 86 (cont.) you don't think that I know what I'm doing?" She said, "No, I rather like you, and X like what you are doing. But X want, when I finish my education, to be able to get a job, and I just don't know why they would send an inferior person." Well, that gave me the opportunity to open up the whole discussion of what it means to be an American, what it means to be a black American, and the like. But there wasn't at that point, identification with you because they were dark skinned and you were dark skinned? The overwhelming majority immediately identified with me. The second thing that happened to me was, I had been there just a few hours when they dressed me in a sari. So when I went out to the village, I wore either the sari or I wore, you know, just rough cotton things that I had taken to wear, so that the overwhelming thing was an identification. I ate with them, you know, we all ate off the same table, we all dug the same latrines, we had to do things together. This provided a way for really getting fully acquainted. I remember one day when we got back into Delhi, and I was living at a YWCA resid ence in Delhi, that the women there were talking to me about American women. And they said that they thought they were so homely and so poorly dressed. They said, "You know, we read about American women as being beautifully dressed, and we hear about them in Hollywood, but they look so terrible." Well, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about. It's interesting. Could you tell me why? Well, Chester Bowles was there at that time, and he came out to dedicate a little part of the village where we were, and these women, all of the Indian women, of course, put on their finest saris, and all of us dressed up in saris and went. Well, it was a unique experience, in that, although I've lived in Harlem, I had never been anywhere where I could look at the equivalent of two or three city blocks and see only colored people. It was just unbelievable. They were all colors, very black Indians, different shades, mulatto types and so on, but I had never seen that many colored people. Even in Harlem, you'd never seen that many? Not at any one time. Fascinating! DH- And the most I would see if I went to the Abyssinian Baptist Church would be two or three thousand. But to look out, as you did in India almost PC: any time, at any big gathering, and see twenty-five or thirty thousand colored peopleâI just had never seen it. What did that do to you?ï»¿87 DH: Well, I just found it very exciting. I went back and 1 wrote it in my diary, as I did everything. I always had felt that I was part of a large group, but I had never had that experience of being part of this large a group. So when the Indian women were looking back over the day, I said to them, "I know what you mean." Although there were some rather beautiful [American] women, I said to them, "Those women are wearing cotton dresses, some of which are made of Indian prints." But in India they would not wear stockings and they would not wear shoes, they wore sandals and so on. And I must confess, down in my own insides I kept saying, some of their legs look like chicken in the market or something. But I said to them, "Those women are well dressed..." PC: ...by our standards. DH: PC: PC: DH: PC: DH: ...by American standards. I said, "I looked them all over," because I really got very conscious of it after they said this, and I said, "Their dresses are nicely made." Some of them actually were wearing American-made dresses. Many were wearing dresses they'd had made there. I said, "Now, they're having them made here, in order to give some dori* or someone business, you see." So, I said, "You see, that's it." But I said, "For the first time, when I was at Alipur and I looked at all the dignitaries from the American embassy, the men wearing white suits looked fine, but the women looked dreadful." But I said, "That's because they're up against all those beautiful, colored saris." Nothing's more beautiful than a sari. Every woman is an empress. You know, it really was a fascinating experience. And I remember Anema Bose, who was very articulate, and she was president of the YWCA residence in New Delhi. I lived in New Delhi and taught in Delhi... I explained this to her, and she looked at me and she said, "Well, I guess that is so, because, you see, every time I go anywhere with you, I lose you. You get lost in the crowd, and it keeps me all the time looking." And she said, "But I just thank goodness you're tall. Every once in a while, I can see you over the others because you're tall." But you didn't wear your hair the same. There must have been something about you that had a sort of difference. My hair was not like their hair. It wasn't that I...but she could find me. You were toned in with them. I was toned in. That's the whole point. You're toned in. As a matter of fact, I was amazed how often people would say to me, "Oh, you're an American." And I thought all the time that I stood out like one. But the *dori - dressmakerï»¿(cont.) fact of color, and the fact that I didn't have their kind of silken hairâyet all of them do not have the same silken hair. Some of them come from different provinces, and look a little different, and they have so many different varieties, you see. Well, that was kind of a lesson to me, about the way in which the beauty of whiteness that had been drummed into me, all my childhood... All Negro children had been told that, hadn't they? The lighter you were, the more chance you had. Just today, I was talking to a friend about a little niece of mine whose father is black and whose mother is German. She's studying to become a model, so they wrote and asked me, what could I do to help her? Because she's graduated and living now in Mount Holly, Pennsylvania. It not a very exciting place and very few opportunities. So this Clara Johnson, who is such a fine designer, said to me, "Well, gee, I don't know what we could do with her, because unfortunately, she either had to be pure white or very dark. Nobody wants that in-between mulatto." And all three of us laughed, because both of them are fair, and they both said, "When you stop and realize, in our day, how it was, that the fair black person was considered to be the choice..." that sort of thing So, it's interesting, it's a kind of reversal. Two things happened at the Alipur village that sort of helped me to get quickly related. One was that our job was to go into the village. We lived on the outskirts of the village in this huge field, did our cooking out of doors. While we brought along kitchen help and that sort of thing... Part of the whole learning was to teach those young people how to use their hands. Many of them came out of families where they just had so much unemployment and so much help around that they didn't know how to do anything, of any description. So that was a part of it, to help them understand, but also we went into the villages and talked to the people. And then one day, it was determined. We would bring the children outâwe wouldâto start some activities with the children. Well, of course, at that time I spoke no Hindi, although I later took Hindi from five to seven every morning, but at that time, I hadn't had any chance. I knew nothing of any of the languages, the language of the village or any of them. So when we got out into the village, and in an open field, we expected a few children to come. Well, between four hundred and five hundred came, because we were a new thing. You were the circus that had come to town. Everybody was very much interested, so all the children came, and even little children bringing little children on their hips. It was really quite something. They said to me that it would be very good if I could do something to introduce myself to these children, so they would know that I would be there and would be working with them. Well, a strange thing happened, in that I knew that there was nothing I could say in English to___ There was no English spoken?ï»¿89 PC: DH: There were some children who spoke English. I remember one little boy whose name was Ramapritap Singh, and the evening before this, I was talking with him to try to see where in the field we could take the children. Because of the lack of sanitation, you had to watch that you had places that were decent, because you might just find yourself, you know, in a filthy place. So I was walking over with this young fellow one day, he spoke English, and there were a number of the children who went to schoolâhe was about nine years old. And so, he said to me, "Do you speak Hindi?" I said, "No, I don't speak Hindi." And he said, "Well, then how do you think you're going to work with the people?" And I said, "Well, I will try to see how I can work with the people." I said, "There will be people like you who could help me." And he said, "Well, I guess so. But if you really were going to help, you would have to know how they feel about things, and how are you going to know that if you don't speak Hindi?" Very perceptive young man. Wasn't that perceptive? So I said, "Well, I will try to learn Hindi," and I will try to find out what I can. It always came back to me that he really wasn't saying to me, "Do you know the language?" What he was interested in knowing was, "How do you communicate? How do you know what makes people happy, and what makes them sad, and what they want, and how will you deal with them?" Pp. How many weeks did you have to do all this? dh- This was about the third day I was there. It all came up at the same clip. So the next day, I went out to meet these children, and when I saw four hundred children... I would have turned on my heel and run. I turned to some of the students, and I asked them what they had done with one little child or two or three things. So they did different things. When it came my turn, I saidâi had a few very simple phrases I could say. There is no such thing as saying in Hindi, hello, and there is no such word as thank you. But you use an expression which is utcha, and the way you say that communicates how you feel. You mean variations of it. Variations of it. So someone says to you, "Do you know what time it is?" You say, "Ut-ch^" meaning, "I don't really." Or, "Do you like this job?" Then it means, "Oh yes." Then they say, "Are you going some place?" or,"How do you feel about it?" and you say, "Utcha." [drawled] So that's used so much, I began to catch onto that. So when I saw these children, they said, "Now, what will you do?" The first thing I did was I told them that I was from America. You said that in English and it was translated? Yes. I had a person to translate. I said, "I'm from America." But I have to also remind you, that any time you've got four hundred children, PC: DH: PC: DH: PC:ï»¿90 (cont.) you would also have more than one language, and the only language that those Indian students could communicate with each other in was English, because they spoke different languages. A Bengali couldn't speak to someone who spoke something else, and so on and so forth, so that language was a problem, not just for me, but in the whole crowd. So therefore, after I said what my name was, I decided I would teach them a song. Now in the United States, I would not have put this on the best-song-to-teach-a-child list. But I decided to teach them a little song which was, "Little Tommy Tinker, sat on a clinker, and he began to cryâMa, Ma, what a good boy am I." It's an action song, and so, when you get to "Ma'" you stand up, you go through the motions as if you're sitting on a clinker, then you jump up, "Ma, Ma." PC: It's a version of "Little Jack Horner," isn't it? It's a version of "Little Jack Horner." So I taught them this. Well, you find that children, somehow, grasp something like that very quickly. They just loved it, so that any time I would walk through the streets, some child would jump up, "Ma, Ma," from all kinds of quarters, all over the streets, two or three of them. They thought that was my name for a while, but at least they knew me. They identified you. It was clear enough to be your name. t>H: PC: They identified me, so that they knew that they were talking to me. About the fourth night we were there, we went into the village, to the village square. It is a custom that at certain times everyone goes to the square. And in the square they have aâoh, I forget what he's called now, but he's a man who sings, and he makes up songs to communicate different messages, and he has others, with the zita and all, working with him. And he moves about, all through the town, and everyone comes, and he gives you the news in song. So we went that evening, and we were introduced. This was very important, because there had grown a certain amount of fear that there was some group called social workers out there, and people didn't know quite what this meant. This was especially true in India, because any decent person is called a social worker. And so, what they couldn't understand is, why anyone would go to school to learn to be a social worker. Everybody was a social worker. Every obituary had in there, "He was a social worker," because the Hindu religion teaches that you must be a social worker. A Samaritan. That's right. That whole idea was there. So we wondered what would be the outcome. Some of the young men students, some of the faculty, had gone to get the chief council of the village and talk with them, because unless they approved of us, we would have to pitch our tents, take it up and go back. So when we got out there, they started this evening, and of course, it wasï»¿91 (cont.) all in the language of the village, but after a long while, they began. This man started his chronicle of what was going on, and as he sang, all I could hear was something like, "America," and then "Hi-tee," and then "social worker." That's all. See, those were words he couldn't translate. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Social worker was used as an American phrase? Yes. See, that's what you find all over there. They have some words they can't say, so they say your word. Well, before the refreshments and all the festivities were endedr-^and you know, they go on for like three hours, the whole evening, and everybody's sitting, and they're telling the news and so on, all of it in song. What else is there to do? The whole village is there. And so the faculty person who was with me said, "Well, we're in." Then she said, "What he is saying now..." Then of course, she said to me, "You're supposed to stand up and you bow to him." So I stood up and I bowed to him, not knowing what in the world he was saying, but I learned afterward that he was saying, "We also have..." Probably first it was the Delhi School of Social Work, but also there has come to the Delhi School of Social Work, from America, Miss Height, and she is also a social worker, and she also teaches the children how to sing. So the faculty member said, "Well, we're in." It was kind of a freak beginning, but it was just right. It wasn't what you might have expected when you left the United States. I would have said when I left the United States to any professional worker, "If you're going to teach a song, it should be of high quality, et cetera," and that some of those little action songs weren't the best. But you see, what it did was thatâand no matter what activity they had, they always wanted to sing this song. The tiny little ones who were three or four years old, didn't know one word and didn't know what it was, but they would just hop up and down and do the "Ma" part, up and down, you see. And it was something. Did you ever use that again, having learned how well it worked, partly by design and partly by accident, in a situation like that? Could it be translated into any other situation? No, I think what it would amount to would be that for a person moving into a situation where they were called upon to relate to people, the way that I would translate this would be to say, "Find something out of your own experience that appeals to a child." You see, I didn't have anything in my experience that an Indian child would have done, but I did know something about children, and that they liked action songs, and so on. And I did teach them a few others.ï»¿92 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC; DH: Of course, in a way, you taught that sort of thing to the Baptist children when you were working with them in Rankin. Yes, that's what I mean. I find that you just have to say to yourself, get less self-conscious... Instead of saying, "I'm a professional worker, and if I teach a song it really should be something out of classic music..." But it was that all children like action, and the very fact that they could throw their arms up in the air, all together, and then sit down, and instead of sitting all the way down, you know, jump back up and say, "Ma, Ma," made it a lot of fun. And it also was recreation, so that no matter what activity we would have after that, sooner or later, some one of them would start this song. I also taught them a few others, you see. The other thing is that there were, scattered throughout [the group], children who were in schools where they had learned some English. And so you had within the group other children... Little translators... ...who would carry it. They would pick it up, they would say, "Oh yes, I know." They theji would come to me, "Do you know'Ba Ba Black Sheep?'"" or "Do you know such-and-such a song?" and we would do it. So I found that I, who went as a social worker, used more music to reach... So it's a universal. Yes, that's right. It was more useful to me, as a means of getting related. Tell me, is this the time, 1952âI still don't know quite how many weeks you were over there, but you could tell me... I was there a full university semester. Was this the year in which you became acquainted with Mrs. Gandhi, who became a good friend of yours? Yes. I was teaching at the School of Social Work and living at the YWCA, in a residence on Asoka Road in New Delhi. Indira Gandhi, then, was the chairperson for the volunteer training committee of the YWCA, and I also worked with some special volunteer training for the YWCA. I went all over, to Darjeeling, up in the mountains, toâoh, I can't think of the name of the placeâto Mesoori, to...oh, to Lucknow... Kashmir? I went to Kashmir, but only a visit. To Lucknow, and to Calcutta, and all over. The YWCA set up special training experiences, and... You were training in all these places. I worked with them, yes, and Indira Gandhi was the chairperson for it.ï»¿93 Â°H: (cont.) And that's how I got to know her.. She hers,elf was a Hindu. That's an interesting thing about the YWCA, it has..,., ...that mixture? DH: PC: A great mixture. There is a nucleus of Christian women, but, you know, they're few and far between over there.. Over there, I would think they'd be a minority. DH: Yes- The Christians were a tiny minority. One of the things that used to worry the Christians was that they felt the Hindus sort of adjusted to whatever there was very easily, and so there was always a kind of fear that they might get absorbed into the Christians, you see. I found that there was a kind of openness, and an interest in understanding what it meant to volunteer, and to learn more about how to volunteer. PC: Among the Hindus, you mean? Yes. Many of them had access to certain centers of power and that sort of thing. They wanted to be active, to take an active hand.. So that that's what we did with the volunteer training. PC: DH: PC: DH: But your relationship with Mrs. Gandhi grew all through this time,. Yes. And later when she came to this country. Well, when she came to this country, she was visiting Mrs. Roosevelt on one occasion. Mrs. Roosevelt, at Indira Gandhi's request, brought together a few people that she had known when she was there. I always remember, at Mrs. Roosevelt's home here in New York, she gathered this group to sort of renew acquaintances with Indira Gandhi. And, you know, she made hot biscuits and things of that sort, and we just sat and talked. The thing that interested me was that even then, what Indira Gandhi was interested in was that the YWCA was one of the places where we were not just teaching women to volunteer, say in hospitals and in things of that sort, but that we were interested in women in public affairs. And Lakshmi Menon, who represented India here in the United States at the United Nations, was also one of those women,so that what they were interested in was, that this was a channel for training women to be active in public affairs. The YWCA was? The YWCA was. So that it was not just how to run a meeting or parliamentary procedure, but it was, how to take an active hand in your community.. This was a goal of the YWCA.ï»¿94 It was a real goal, you see. And much of that has been continued. Well, I can't go back to the YWCA because we've done a lot of talking about it, but it'll keep coming in. We have other less developed and underdeveloped countries to talk about, but before we doâyou don't have to answer this if you don't want to. Was the experience of living and working in India useful to your work here? We've already discussed your work in this country being useful to Indiaâcould we turn it around? Did it work both ways? Well, I think that one of the major reasons that the work in India was just so valuable that I can never quite estimate it, was that I had the opportunity to become a part of the country and a part of the people. I was at the Delhi School of Social Work at a very crucial time in its history, when some of the new movements toward China were just beginning, when the whole issue of land reformâI personally came to understand more about land and the relations between land reform and economic growth and development, than I think I ever could have gained in this country. I don't think there's any way to even imagine it. I was at the Delhi School of Social Work at the time that... And then I went into Travancore where, in 1952, there were 15,000 college graduates unemployed. Is that a province? Yes. It's a province which had the highest rate of Communism of any province. The highest number of unemployed college graduates. So that, for me, it was also an experience in coming to see international politics from a non-American vantage point. And then, what happened at the Delhi School of Social Work while I was there, was that some of the students, particularly those who were coming out of provinces where there was a great deal of Communist leadership, began to...they challenged everything. They challenged whether or not social work was an opiate of the people, whether or not even the school itself wasn't a Western way of keeping them... Decided that because the director of the school, Miss Dorothy Moses, had been trained in England and the United States, that perhaps, there was some sinister reason that someone had for trying to call them to... The most that I could say is that it was a kind of student uprising. It was no great shock to you because you'd been with students like this. Yes. I'd been with students like this. But they sought to be as disruptive as they could. Then I also had the opportunity, while I was there, to go freely to the Russian embassy and to see things that were going on. I saw films at the Russian embassy, films that depicted Western civilization, and... Propaganda films? Propaganda films that were done by Russia. One of them especially was on one of their anniversary days, so they showed this as a very special thing.ï»¿95 (cont.) It was magnificent in terms of the buildings, showing Moscow and so on.. But when it got to the United States, it showed a black man sitting in back of a Mississippi farm, and he was very ignorant, and it showed this was the condition that blacks were in. And I'll always remember it, because one of the students said to me afterward, "You see, now that film is what I had thought was what all blacks were." It never said that some were in that position. I don't think anyone could deny that somewhere they got such a picture.. But that was not characteristic. So that, I think that being there at a time of political upheaval.,... The new developments were just being made, the Harijansâthose were the Untouchablesâhad just been outlawed, and people were beginning to move, so there was a lot of ferment. Chester Bowles was there, and trying very hard to get people in the United States to understand what was going on. So that I got a different feeling about both Communism and China and Russia. Did you get a feeling for poverty that you hadn't had before, so that when you went to Mississippi, you began to see some relationship between poverty and poverty? Yes, well, living in Delhi and working there meant that you just walked down the streets and you saw the same homeless people out on the street, day after day. I remember one woman who was near the School of Social Work. I saw that woman pregnant; I saw her birth this child; and I just saw her sitting there trying to feed the child something from her breast. I doubt that she had very much... And we tried all sorts of things. We had students go in to assist with people like that. So you had a chance to follow through with people. You know, it wasn't just like seeing... You go to visit some place, you see a beggar. But instead, when you go every day and you see those same beggars.,.. But even so, the impact is awful, because I remember when I was in Calcutta, and I was only there for two or three days, the impact of that kind of poverty. I had never seen that kind of poverty, or that kind of unemployment and suffering, and the numbers of little children.... It's what you see now on television, in Bangladesh, but we hadn't had any opportunity to see, unless we went there, until thesÂ« last few years, because of the spread of the knowledge. Unemployment is the other problem. I had been in places where you had unemployment, but to be in a place where you have unemployment with no way of thinking how to make enough workâthat, to me, that really was... After all, we had been through the Great Depression, so you knew something about unemployment. Yes, I knew something about unemployment, but not this kind of unemployment. It wasn't that there were jobs and people laid off; it was that people had never in their lifetime had a job. And the sweepers and others whoï»¿96 DH: (cont.) were aroundâyou know, you just realized that labor was the cheapest thing. PC: It wasn't much better in 1960 when I was there. And I don't suppose it's better, it's probably worse now because of the economic situation. OH: The whole economic situation. PC: Well, I'd love to go on because I'd like your story about the sweeper to be on tape, but I think we better go to other countries. In 1959, and again in 1960, you went to underdeveloped countries. In 1959, you went to South America under the auspices of International Seminars. I don't know what International Seminars are, or what you did, or what countries you visited. OH: George Denny, who organized the "Town Meeting of the Air," after a few years organized what he called "World Town Meetings." And after the Nixon experience, when, as vice-president, he had been into these countries and he had been stoned and all sorts of things happened, and there'd been this awful experience with him, George Denny got the idea of setting up a world town meeting, and taking thirty-five Americans into, I guess it was about six Latin American countries. And it was his thought that, in each one of these countries, we would meet our counterparts, and talk about issues, things that were of mutual concern. A mixture of women and men went on this? DH: PC: t>H: Men and women, different political groups, different age groups, Edith Sampson of Chicago and I were the two blacks. There were people from industry and businessâit was a rather interesting cross-section of people. He called it "International Tours." That was just the name of it, but it was really "World Town Meeting." That was the official title under which it moved. In each one of the countries, we would go in, and have a reception, either at the embassy or under some local sponsorship, and then we would have a town meeting. In the town meeting, it was always arranged for two Americans and two people from whatever country to initiate the discussion. So it might go the way of wool and coffee, or sugar, and hoof and mouth diseaseâI don't know, different subjects. Whatever it was that they were interested in. And of course, this was at the same time as the schools in Prince Edward Country, Virginia, were closed because of their defiance of the civil rights decision for desegregation. This was headlined all over the papers. So that when we got into Uruguay, where Mr. Nixon had had the worst experience, and a place that they were most concerned about, because the students in Montevideo would not even allow Mr. Nixon to talk, so he had to be ushered quickly out of Montevideo... I didn't realize it was that rough. That was where he'd had the worst experience. It was very interesting because when we got there, and the discussions proceeded, they..,..ï»¿(cont.) The students from university and others came down from the hills, loaded with questions about the racial situation. I'll never forget that they kept saying, "Well, we understand you've closed all the schools because the whites don't want to go to school with the black people. So there are no more schools." Well, of course, we were trying to say, "No, that's Prince Edward County, it doesn't mean all schools in the USA," but needless to say, the way it was repeated over there, that's the way they thought it was. In Montevideo, as we got into that discussion, they quickly left all the discussions around wool and the other things, international trade, different things that they were concerned about. I remember Zelia Ruebhausen, who was from the League of Women Voters, and a couple of other people had prepared all sorts of things that they were ready to answer. And they were asked to lead the discussion. But the students picked into the group, and said, No, they wanted to hear from us what was happening, from Edith Sampson and me. Well, it was a very strange thing, because in the middle of the discussion, I remember it occurred to me that they were throwing the questions as if every black child in the United States was in a segregated classroom, and now the United States had closed these classrooms, and so it meant that blacks would get no further education. So just by chance, I said, "Well, one of the things I have to point out to you, here is Judge Sampson, she is representing the mayor of Chicago, she is a justice on the courts of Chicago, and as I look at the schools that she has attended, she has never attended segregated schools. I have never been in a segregated school. And there are lots of places and millions of people who have never been in a segregated school." Well, this was like light shining from the East, or something, because all of a sudden they said, "What?" They moved in around us and they said, "Well, how did you go to school?" So then I told them where I went to school, and you know... Things that you would never think about yourself, suddenly became important. Edith Sampson told about herself, and about how she was a grown woman when she went back to law school, and how she finished law school. She told of her undergraduate training in the Middle Westâand I forget the schoolsâand so on. Then I told them about going to schools in Pennsylvania and in New York, and so on, and they said, "Well, how did they treat you?" I said, "Why, I just loved it. They treated me beautifully. But I said, "Don't think I was the only one. I'm not the only one, I wasn't the only black in the school I attended." So they got intrigued They really didn't want to believe you, if they were on the other side. They didn't want to believe us. But they suddenly began to react, and they began to say, "So then what did they do to you, did they..." They asked us intimate questions that I cannot even recall. You know, likeï»¿98 DH: (cont.) "What did the whites do to you when you were in school?" So I said to them, "Well, in my high school, I was a ranking student." I said, "Well, you happen to have here good students, but even those who were not good students were in the class with me." It ended that they were so excited, they began to call others, and they set up a meeting over at the university. They said, "Will you come over and talk to us?" Then we were able to talk to them about what it means to have a Supreme Court decision, and that this was a new thing. Oh, this was after Brown v. the Board of Education? That's right, and that even though Prince Edward County was closing its schools, it was defying what was a new law. And we explained that in the past, there were segregation laws about the schools, and how that worked. And then the law students over there said, "Well, aha. So, yes, then you had a law..." Then we went to 1954. So we found ourselvesâEdith Sampson being a judge and a constitutional lawyer, knowing a lot about the Constitutionâ-having basic teaching about the American Constitution. ^ What language did you communicate with these students in? Were they English-speaking? DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC; DH: Well, yes, they were English-speaking, but we also had interpreters, and each one of us at that time, had a little speech that we could make in Spanish. I could make one in Spanish and one in Portuguese. Did you go to Brazil? Oh yes. Because you still haven't told me the countries, Uruguay, Brazil... Well, we went to Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Colombia. And how long did all this take? It was about four or five weeks, something like that. It was a long trip. It must have been, to go to so many countries. Those aren't little places. Yes. I had just taken office in the National Council of Negro Women as president, and I had been asked to do this before the election, and so as a result, I agreed to come after the convention. So you caught up with them. In Venezuela, that's right. I did not go into Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. I picked them upâsee, where was it? It was either in Chile, I think, orï»¿99 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH; PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) Argentina, I forget now which countries, but I picked them up after they had done the others, but they wanted me in it.t But I think the significant thing was that it was not just what happened to the other people, but what happened to the Americans, because most of the others were white Americans. Well, they were all white Americans, like the head of the Farm Bureau, like a fellow high-ranking in the AFL-CIO. This was paid for by the government? No, no, no. George Denny had a private contributor who contributed to it, and then there were certain things for which each of us was responsible. But you had to carry a portion of your own expense. Some of it was paid for. He had been able to get certain funding for International Seminars. That was what it was called. In a way, it was a very American, with a slight effect of propaganda, kind of thing to do if it was done right after Nixon...when it was discovered that either Nixon or what Nixon represented were so much disliked. I don't know George Denny, so I don't know what his motives would have been, but it would seem to me that it has to be political. It can't just be for the good of the exchange between Latin and North America. Well, you have to go back and see that he had had for years the process, over American radio, called "Town Meeting of the Air." Oh yes, that's the man. And then he had attempted what he called "World Town Meetings." The first one of those, Edith Sampson had gone on, because Mrs. Bethune assigned her, and they went around the world. But they didn't go on the air on this? Nothing on the air, no. We only went on the air locally. No world radioâhe'd given up, but he used this same approach, and so therefore it was not government at all. We had certain, I would say...government encouragement is about the best way I could put it, and in every country, the embassies received us. I remember in Uruguay, when we got to the American embassy that evening, they were having a big party.. The fellows who were there from the CIA came over, and they said to Edith Sampson and me, "You know, we'd just like to tell both of you that you made a difference in our lives." One fellow said he'd been there two years waiting for his family.. He'd been in Rio. And he had just had word that they would be arriving by boat, when he was picked up and sent to Uruguay, because they expected the worst, and he said, "...to have the whole thing turn off with this kind of a climate." As a matter of fact, people were calling us from radio stations. We had to divide; she [Edith] did some and I did some. We went to newspapers. We met all sorts of people. People wanted us to come to their homes, and they would gather people. They just wanted to talk, because they were trying to understand the American situation, butï»¿100 (cont.) instead of their being negative about it...by then even those who didn't quite take, they just asked, "Well, tell me this. What about so-and-so?" It was a real discussion. Again, people in many of these countries were people of color, so once again, the fact that you and Edith Sampson had a skin tone that matched some of the people there, if not all of them, must have been very useful for the United States, and useful for the people in the country, to understand that you wouldn't be likely to be conning them. Yes, this is what I was saying, that the impact on the other Americans in the group was even greater than it was on the other people. Because when we started off, we were very quiet, I know that I was, and answered questions as they came up. There were questions all along the way. But pretty soon when we would have after-sessions to discuss what we were thinking about, many of the white Americans, I know, said to me, "Well, it's absolutely amazing, because..." I'll just take a simple thing, like the whole question about the United Statesâit was not just on raceâthe United States' support of regimes like France, and so on, and the way the United States seemed to have been moving, even at that time, in relation to countries like Cuba. You see, this was very interesting. We got a lot of questions from people wondering what the United States really wanted. For example, in one country the General Electric plant was on strike, and the people were jumping on the labor people there, because they had an idea that there was a sort of international cabal. So there were all kinds of things, all kinds of questions that came up. The whole questions about coffee and American imports...it ran a kind of gamut. Once they got onto one piece of an issue, they went on to others. And I must say, within the group, we had a range. I think there were two or three white Americans who didn't understand what was going on, but to me the most satisfying part of the whole trip was to recognize the extent to which most of those white Americans had never been in a situation where people of color, in another part of the world, were hating them for their racial policy, or were questioning them because of the racial policy, or were trying to ask, "Well, why did you drop the bomb on Hiroshima? Why didn't you drop it in Germany?" It wasn't just one line of questioning, do you see? And these people had never met... Some of them couldn't really get over our sense of loyalty to the country, and yet answering straightforwardly. You have to say, "Yes, true, so many people are out of work, and there is discrimination, there is this and this, but there's also this and that and the other." Do you see? It was this kind of thing. You were always being put on the spot, and yet it was a spot you could handle. But it also meant that those who were white felt on the spot. Because any moment, they almost feared that we would drop it and let them carry it, because they couldn't...ï»¿1Q1 They couldn't, 110. They shouldn't have.. Because once or twice somebody would say something, so finally George Denny, who was a master at such things, said, "It is better that if you are not sure of your position on something, you don't have to speak; you can say, 'I haven't thought about it,' or something.." I would think so. And I think many of them had never experienced such anti^American feeling. No. Anti-Americanism has been fairly new to most Americans. They've been able to travel everywhere and have everyone be their friends. Now, I think everyone realizes it, but up to the last ten years, they didn't. So those people experienced it a little ahead of time. Now, a year later, in 1960, you traveled again. You went to five African countries with the Committee of Correspondence. It says again in your bio "to study women's organizations." What is the Committee of Correspondence? What does it do? How did the committee function on this kind of trip? Well, the Committee of Correspondence was a group of about fourteen women, a very small group, who had been brought together some years prior by Anna Lord Strauss and Rose Parsons and who, out of their international travels, had begun to see a place for helping to sustain some kinds of linkages between women of different countries. So they took up the idea of using Jefferson's notion of Committees of Correspondence that we had during the Revolutionary period, and thought of as a base for getting a small group of women working. It started off with a few, and as they went, they kept the names of women they met in different countries. Then when they returned, they did a newsletter and sent them out. Years after that...they had a staff, lo cated in the Carnegie building on East Forty-sixth Street, and what they did was to use a very small staff, but to stimulate volunteer effort, particularly in terms of international relations of women. What they had asked me to do, when I became a member of the group, was to work with some of the discussions that they had on special programs.. They were funded by foundations, to bring women from different countriesâ for instance, an Asian group. And as they brought these women together, I was asked to work with them, leading them in discussions, helping them to discuss how can women be more helpful in their community, to get out those things that they were concerned about, to see how we could work at that. After a while, this group sought and did get some support, for not only bringing women to this country, but for sending individuals or teams into different parts of the world to do different things. A number of the women from some of the African countries asked for help with their organizations. For, you mean, political organizations, or agencies? No, no, no. Just women's organizations.ï»¿102 PC: Like League of Women Voters, only it wouldn't be that? Or a church group? Maybe it's something I can't relate to because I don't understand the women's organization picture there. DH: The women's organization picture would be, they would have some of the agencies. They have the Girl Guides, the Red Cross, the YWCA, things of that sort. But they also have some organizations, like in Ghana and Nigeria, the market women have organized. PC: DH: PC: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: I knew about the market women, but I didn't know they'd organized. They have organized. Well, that's more of a labor union kind of concept, isn't it? Yes, only it doesn't have the status of a labor union. But it has the sense of collective power among those women who work in the markets, like the nurses, and different groups like that, and then they have social groups and so on. Well, they made a request, and the committee asked me to spend about four months there, to make a study of the training needs of women's organizations in West African countries. And so that is what I did. Oh, you didn't go with a group, you alone were sent specifically to do this? I was the person who did it. So I went, and I spent a certain amount of time in each of the countries. Can you remember which? It said five, is that correct? Yes. They were Guinea, and I was there just after the French had left, and Sekou Toure was in the process of changing the -money, so that that was the first place I'd been where an American dollar wasn't worth anything. They were changing all money, and they were trying to recover from the way the French had left them. Then I went to Sierra Leone, and into Ghana, Nigeria, and Liberia. And in each country, I met with the women's groups. Most of them organized some workshops, and I worked with the workshops, so that I was trying to find out what they needed in training, but also doing some training. During that period of time, I organized, with Madame Sodende, the Nigerian Council of Women. It happened that I was there to hear the last speech from the throne for Ghana, and then the last speech from the throne in Nigeria. So you were right at the turn. I was right there at the turning point. What I did when I came back was to recommend that if the committee wanted to be of real help, that the need was to have someone stationed there to work. So out of thatï»¿103 DH: (cont.) recommendat ion, the Committee of Correspondence decided to send a person, who turned out to be Sarah Lee Owen. I don't think you know her. So she has been there now for eight or nine years. PC: DH: PC DH PC DH PC DH PC DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Oh, is she still there? No, she's now working with the State Department in the United States. She's on leave... On African affairs of one sort or another? Yes. Because the Committee of Correspondence went out of existence. Yes. Is that why she went over to State? Even before that, she had gone to USIA*. Well, again, you must have taken a lot home from your trips to Africa, too, as well as giving a great deal. You must have met a lot of women that you keep in touch with. Oh yes. Is there anybody that you feel touched your life in any special way? Well, there were a lot of people like, I would say, in Ghana, a judge, Annie Jiagge, who had been my roommate in India, in 1952, at Travancore. At the end of the semester, the World Conference of Christian Youth was held at Travancore and I...I had been a delegate to it in 1939, at Amster damânow I was adult advisor to the American delegation, and Annie Jiagge and I lived with the same family at Travancore for the World Conference. She's a Nigerian? She's a Ghanian. So therefore, it was, you know, a great thing to see and meet her again. In Nigeria, I lived in the home of Lady Ademola whose husband was the chief justice, and she was very active with the YWCA, and was really a very well-trained woman who worked at things very seriously. Madame Sodende in Nigeria was a woman who asked me... We went together with the market women. I worked with her, then went up to Ibadan to a meeting where she organized the Nigerian Council of Women. There was also a person up in Ibadan who was a physician. She was a tremendous person. There were people all over. The last point on your trip to Africaâwas there a direct connection between that trip and your appointment as a consultant in the State Department, on African affairs? United States Information Agencyï»¿104 DH: PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: I don't really think so. That was during the period where Mennen Williams was there, and I was asked to serve as a consultant. I really don't know. Well, it occurred to Betty Barnes and to me that it could be a logical step. Yes, it might have been. ^C: But it could also be done for some other reason. I'm not conscious of it, you see. It could be. Well, one of the connections there was, that here in this country we organized a group called the Negro Leadership Conference on Africa, and that was made up of representatives of several national organizations who felt that Americans of African descent should take an active hand in trying to influence United States policy with respect to Africa. With the other man of the civil rights movement, I was one of the cochairpersons of that. I'm not sure that all of us did not get asked to be the consultants to the State Department, because we went on several occasions to do specific assignments that we were asked to. That conference proved a very important thing, because it began to be a link between some of the African representatives who were in this country, and some of the leadership in the black community in this country. In an interesting way, when I was in Nigeria, I was the special guest of Chief Adabo, who later was the Nigerian delegate to the United Nations. Very well known delegate. Right. So when Chief Adabo and Mrs. Adabo were here, he assembled all of us at his home in New Rochelle, to discuss ways in which it was very important for black Americans to know how Africans felt about some of the United States policies. Now, we were very clear about this in relation to South Africa, but the important thing they tried to point out was that apartheid and South Africa's, the Union of South Africa's policies, all of this came through so loud and clear that it was inescapable, that we needed to be aware of policies affecting the distribution and utilization of raw materialsâwhether it was then Angola and Mozambiqueâand how the United States played into Zambia, Rhodesia and so on. What they were saying was that we might get all excited about trying to get American business out of South Africa, and not realize what was going on elsewhere. And I think this is very clear now as you look at American food policy, the Food for Peace Program, Public Law 480. With all that has been said about the Sahara, if you examine the actual food distributions into countries, you will discover that there is a clear political and military objective, for Chile, or other parts of Latin America, for certain parts of Asia that could not quite be found in the Sahara. There is no way of saying that the food has been distributed in proportion to the need. So that the use of food as a political weapon, or use of other resources, you see, and a denial to some of the African needs, is something that couldï»¿105 (cont.) easily escape us. And this to me was one of the most valuable things to learn. And of course Chief Adabo always took great pleasure in saying that he was minister of finance in Nigeria when I was their guest, and that we had a chance to get acquainted before he came to the United States. PC: oh, you mean, he took pleasure in talking about your friendship. Right, he always did that. Every time we would see him, he would say, "Well, I have to tell you that Miss Height and I became acquainted when she was in Nigeria." Also, he facilitated some of my inquiries around Nigeria, when I was trying to see what was going on with certain social service programs, the utilization of volunteers, how government was playing into the development of certain kinds of social services, and... PC: DH: PC: DH: At what point, Dorothy, did you do this? That's when I was there for the Committee of Correspondence. I could not have had as significant an experience with Chief Adabo, without the complete cooperation, you see. Sir Ademola was the chief justice, the first to succeed in Nigeriaâas the British moved out, moved from the throne. I also lived with the chief justice in Ghana, and he was the man who lifted Nkrumah to the throne, so that I was there at that time, and he was the secretary of state. He took me with his family into that sacred part of the whole House of Parliament. I didn't know there was a sacred part. Do you really mean that? Or for very special guests? Well, you can't go inâit's not for tourists. [This is February 2, 1975.] As I'm saying, before we move into the momentous events of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, let's take time to talk about you, Dorothy Height, as a private person, rather than a public figure. And I would just give you some idea. If you would describe some of your life in Harlem, for example your apartment, people who shared the apartment with you, the little boys who used to carry your luggage upstairs, Christmas time with your neighbors, helping people in other apartments with the problems of no heat, no hot water, and the other problems that you found around there, or the other joys. Just a little bit about Harlem and your life in those days. Because I came to New York University at an early age, I have spent the greater part of my life in Harlem. And I really lived in several different parts of the Harlem community. Early in my life, I lived near what is called the Dunbar Apartments. I lived opposite those, lived with my sister and brother-in-law. Later, I lived down in the Morningside area with the family with whom I lived most of the time that I went to school. It was a part of my own independence that I was able to be a part of a family. The mother, Mrs. Maude Myers, was a very fascinating woman who had had an unusual career. Because she was the widow of Will Dixon, theï»¿106 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) composer, she had an interest in music, but she herself was a designer. Long before blacks were admitted to many thingsâbecause she was very fair with red hairâshe moved about into many very interesting places. I went to live with them when I was... Did you pay rent, room and board payments? Oh yes, room and board, it was that kind of thing. I had met their daughter when I was at NYU. She was a musician, and she is a very accomplished pianist. She's now teaching at Howard University in the School of Music. The thing that I think was of interest to me in the Harlem community was âwhere we lived at 114th Street and Seventh Avenue and again on Morning-side Avenueâat that time, those were newly opened to black people. The Seventh Avenue building was a huge eight-and-a-half-room cooperative, that at that time was the equivalent of any we'd see in the finest area of Park Avenue. It was a lovely setting. Whites had gone from it? Black people had moved in. Mrs. Myers, who was a very enterprising businesswoman, was also an officer in the cooperative. It was a cooperative and these people had bought the apartments. It was the kind of place where she could have one grand piano in one end of the apartment, and that was the music room, and adjacent to it was my room, and that sort of thing. And then she could have a Steinway in the front, and then there were living rooms all around. It was the kind of thing that I think most people don't think about there ever having been in Harlem. Certainly I wouldn't. Yes, there were a few Spanish-speaking people, yes. Actually on the northeast corner of 114th Street stood a very famous Spanish church. It's still there, a Roman Catholic church. Two doors from us was the home of W.C. Handy, and his daughters. Mrs. Myers's daughter and I became very close friends with them and it was just a matter of interesting entertainment. Oh, sometimes Mr. Handy would take three or four of us under his wing, and we would go from one club to another where people played. And wherever we went, of course, they played the "St. Louis Blues" in tribute to Mr. Handy. Or another time, Mr. and Mrs. Handyâhis first wife was living then, she's the mother of his childrenâand we used to have evenings where we would sing or he would have different artists. Andy Razaf had just written a song and he would come to try it out. And someone else had just received great accolades for something he'd recorded, so Mr. Handy would have him there. So in my early life, I got to be associated in a kind of musical circle that was very interesting. Except that your music had been classical background, and now you moved into classical jazz. Well, actually Mrs. Myers's daughter Frankie was a classical pianist. I had really an interest in classical music. Most of my experience really had been related to church and church music, that sort of thing. But thisï»¿107 (cont.) was more from an angle of saying how I came to see the Harlem community. It was rich. Yes, it was very exciting. And during those days, of course, the depression hit, and the WPA was set up. I remember that Mrs. Myers had a young fellow named Jimmy who was sort of, not a caretakerâbut because of the size of this place, and she had other property on Seventh Avenueâthis young man had been a helper to her. And I remember when the old Lafayette Theatre was revived, and they began during that period to take on helpers, and Jimmy was one of those who went to the Lafayette Theatre. I suppose that I've always had a kind of social interest in what's happening. I don't even know what they played at the Lafayette Theatre. Well, at that time, they did a whole series of things, largely Shakespearean. Their Macbeth was very famous. But it was a WPA theatre. The important thing was, it was giving jobs to so many musicians and others. That was a very important thing. One of the funniest things that happened there was that Jimmy came home one day and told meâhe was one of the stagehandsâ they were all going on strike. And I began to try to tell him how if you're on WPA, you're on a work relief program and stay by the job. Well, when it was all over, I discovered that the reason they were on strike was that they didn't want to be dominated by two white characters who turned out to be Orson Welles and Jack Houseman. Those were the two. And so I don't remember what it wasâit showed up very shortly thereafterâ what Orson Welles didâand Jimmy forever after would come back to me and say to me, "Well, how did you know?" At least, it helped to get him back on the right track, and he was able to help them hold the fort. But the success they were having with their production had been so great that it had reached the point where it was hard for them to realize how much help they really were getting from these two people that they were so concerned about. Another facet of that whole period for me in Harlem, you see, was that there was a group in Harlem called the American Negro Theater, and Abram Hill and several people had put this together. I never had any real interest in acting, but I had an interest in plays, and they used to do a great deal of play reading. They had a place at 130th Street, one of the Elks Lodges, and you would go there and hear the plays read. That's the first place I ever saw Harry Belafonte or Sidney Poitier. They were just among those reading plays. And Anna Lucasta was one of the plays that came out of that. It was a kind of, what I would say, near starvation thing. I mean, everybody who was there was really doing it because they were interested or some of them did get on WPA, and then on the side, they would do the things that they wanted. The reason I cite this is that my attachment to Harlem was based upon the way in which I got rooted in Harlem, do you see? I've talked about the whole development of the youth movement and that sort of thing. That was one facet. But then there was this whole network of things, in which I was involved, really with different segments of the community.ï»¿108 (cont.) I remember, when I was a student at NYU, I was appointed as a practice teacher at the Little Red Schoolhouse, at Miss Irwin's school. The first black child assigned to that school was a little girl named June Allen, and her mother lived in the ground floor apartment of this building where I lived at 114th Street and Seventh Avenue. Well, it really was her aunt. Her mother was not in the picture and her aunt was rearing her. She was a perfectly beautiful child, looked like a white child, but she was a black child and very conscious of it. It was very singular that when I got into the Little Red Schoolhouse, that little June went home and told her aunt that she'd seen Miss Dorothy down at the Little Red Schoolhouse. The aunt was a very outstanding Harlem schoolteacher. So she came to me and was very disturbedâbecause she wanted to know how did June ever get into a school where she was willing to pay the tuition because she wanted her to have the finest and the best, and she was very culturally inclined this aunt was--she was dumbfounded; this child had come home making Jello! She thought that this was a waste of time and money. Well, I didn't know that much about it, but I had learned from my exposure in my first few weeks in the school that Miss Irwin always said, "You never teach a subject, you teach a person, and you have to give the person something that that person can deal with, so that things will fall in place." So I asked this little child June to come up and tell me what she was doing. Then I understood enough of it to be able to say to her aunt that what June was learning was proportion. And it wasn't just numbers. And that she also had instructions that she had to follow, so that she had to use her mind and all her faculties, and that until... It wasn't Jello, it was jelly. Not the commercial... Oh, jelly. A little more complicated. Not the commercial Jello that would jell anyway, but it was putting in the pectin, putting in all the different things. And of course, it would remain watery until she got the things in proper proportion. So forever and a day for both the aunt and the child, I was always related to whatever they were doing. But one of the interesting things for me was that it gave me a child in my own community who was of the same cultural identification as the other children at the Little Red Schoolhouse. And that I found very interesting, so I didn't make a study of this in any depth, but I found it useful because I could try ideas out with June, when I was working with things. But it also showed me that here was a child, although she was black and lived in Harlem, she was more like the white children in the classroom than she was like the other black children in the community, because her aunt had kept her so sheltered. She was very bright, very precocious, but just sort of like in a little island by herself. She and I became kind of friends, because she, as a young adult, could relate to me a little more easily in some respects, and also because we had school to talk about. I would tell her about the trips that I was taking with the fives or the sixes, and she was a seven. She would tell me, when she was a six, when she was aï»¿109 (cont.) sevenâit was that kind of thing. But I got to know something that I think very few people realize about the Harlem communityâthat it is many communities, and it has a broad diversity, and that it had, as Langston Hughes and some of the poets tried to express.!, it had a cultural heritage that was different as you touched different parts! I look back with a great deal of joy, that I was a part of a lot of developments. When I was in school at NYU, I belonged to a group and we would have, in the Harlem community... Well, we used to have a student group called theRameses. It's made up of black students. One of the significant things was that we would do things like have lectures with Dr. DuBois, like have an afternoon to hear James Weldon Johnson or Countee Cullen or Langston Hughes. And at that time, see, those people were poor. Later you had them at the YWCA? Then I used to have Langston Hughes and others. I'd bring them there__ but that's where I gotâthat's my contact. When I go back and look at it, that's where my contact came. I got to know them as persons, before I became a YWCA staff member, seeing them as an important resource in the community. And that was through the different kinds of groupings of which I became a part. When I was in college, my sister moved up on Sugar Hill. You see, that's up on Edgecombe Avenue, and I had lived with her. That is a totally different kind of thing. Next door lived the Mills Brothers, and all kinds of stars. It was a very famous place then, called the Lincoln something, 321 Edgecombe Avenue, and I lived next door at 323. Lincoln Arms? Park Lincoln or something like that, it was called. But it had all kinds of... not just celebrities, but people who were doing interesting kinds of things. And that I think is a whole side of Harlem now that can easily get overlooked, because even my sister, who lived in that house forty-three years, moved last month to a new place up in the Bronx. But in that period of time, the whole neighborhood has changed. But both when I lived there and also when I lived on 114th Street, as young people do, our idea of an interesting Saturday evening would be to go up on the Hill, to some of those places where you could hear people sing. There used to be at 135th Street and Seventh Avenue, a place called Billy Taylor's__that if you got in there about eleven o'clock, in would come all kinds of actors from downtown, and this quartet itself would sing Rigoletto or whatever they wanted to sing, and that would start the evening. And then from then on, no one would say anything. Fats Waller would get up and go to the piano and play, or Noble Sissle or Eubie Blake orâit was a kind of musical haven, where the people came, and they exchanged. I suppose it was because they weren't making much money that they weren't very competitive. Everyone was about equally poor. No matter how young.ï»¿110 DH: Yes, and no matter how talented they were, they were quite poor. As I said, Mr. Handy or one of his daughters or one of the musicians, Andy Razaf or, I don't know, so many of them would say, "Well, come this evening to such-and-such a place," and you'd just go and it would just be marvelous. So there was a life to Harlem that I've seen go out. Those places now, I'd be afraid to go down, to go near them. PC: Well, that's why there isn't any. People are afraid. DH: And at that time, of course, the white community came into the Harlem community. The Cotton Club was there, and the Savoy was there, and we would go to the Savoy Ballroom for our special activities. Or groups that I belonged to would have their dances there. And everybody thought of it as just the heart of the community life. The Savoy used to have two orchestras, so that they played continuous music. Then they would have the formal dances. Then after the dances, people would have breakfast in different homes that you'd move up to. It's a totallyâit almost seems to me now that it was a dream, because it sounds impossible for it ever to have been like that, when you see what's there now. Now, when I went to Washington in 1939, to work with the YWCA, that meant that I gave up, to a certain degree, many of my associations. But I kept the contacts with people. It was that kind of thing. Because I would come backward and forward, different times, you know, periodically. But then, I decided to come back to work with the YWCA, I was very fortunate. Yvonne Ray, who was my housemate in Washington, also came back to New York, and we were lucky in being able to find an apartment on 152nd Street. At that time, whites had left that area. There were still a few. There were still some living next door. And the apartment that I got was one flight up in a walkup building, but it had been occupied by the owners of the building. It had a balcony in the front, and it looked out on a yard in which there was a stone that said, "1769ânine miles to New York." An honest-to-goodness, legitimate stone. And the house that was there at that time is still there, and some of my friends, the Hilliards, really lived in it. They've since had to move out of it because it's deteriorated so. PC: you mean it was a house that was standing in those early days, pre-Revolu-tionary days? Â°H: Right, a house that was standing in those days, and the three houses that are in there had beautiful lawns and trees, so that I had a lawn and trees at my front window, you see. It wasâthe whole thing was a beautiful setting. And then, in the building itself, a small building, most of the families knew each other, or you soon got acquainted with everybody in the house, and people would visit from one apartment to the other. I had several older people in the neighborhood that I formed a relationship with. Iï»¿Ill (cont.) used to make them Christmas wreaths and Christmas decorations and take them to them. You did that for many years. That's right, and one woman, Mrs. Thompson, until the very end, Christmas didn't arrive in her house till I put the wreath on her door, or brought her a little tree, or did something. I used to make these things up out of different things, from year to year collect them, you know, it was an interesting kind of thing. There was a kind of neighborliness in that whole thing. And I found myself, when I came backâbecause I never lost touch with HarlemâI found myself in 152nd Street treated as if I were a person. The neighbors were all very proud of whatever I was doingÂ» or if it appeared in the newspaper or anything, they all took great pride. But also, T was a political entity in that neighborhood. And that was perhaps the hardest thing for me to give up, to move out of it [in 1974]. Oh, it took you a number of years to "make that decision. I knew it was difficult. But by political entity, can you tell what you mean a little bit by that? Well, I was never a person who went every week to the political club. But whether it was Adam Clayton Powell or whether it was Rangel or whoever it was, they knew that I was there. And I remember when "Skiz" Watson was leading the state senate. He and a number of people were greatly concerned that some people had convinced Congressman William Fitts Ryan to put into that spot a man who was questionable in terms of community leadership. He'd been the owner of a cleaning and pressing establishment. What concerned some of the people was that he had had some bout with the numbers and different things, and there was a real fear that he might, in that office, be utilized by the least desirable forces in the community. And Dr. Kenneth Clark and a number of people talked to Constance Baker Motley about her running for that position, and they had a great many things set in motion. Ray Jones, who was the district leader there, had been very active, and they felt that they needed to appeal to him. Well, Mr. Jones immediately responded because he too was concerned. He felt that it was important to have the strongest person possible to follow through. So Kenneth Clark then came to me, and said, well, that I was in the district, and if I could sort of mount a group who would carry this through, he would be able to help. But he lived in Hastings-on-Hudson and could hardly do anything in that neighborhood, and yet this was important. Well, so, I took it up with them, and we worked with Mr. Jones, ^nd then we went up to see Congressman William Fitts Ryan, and we found that no matter what we said, the congressman was determined to hold onto the man that he had. Kenneth Clark said, "Dorothy Height and I grew up here in these streets of Harlem, and we never heard of this man that you're talking about." And the congressman looked at us and he said,ï»¿112 (cont.) "Well, many people may be like me, they haven't heard of you." So that was sort of like the straw that broke the camel's back, or the red flag that was needed, because this whole delegationâit was black and white and had come from different parts of the d istrict--then set to work, and the night that the nominating group met to make this selectionâoh, there was about an eighteen-inch thick snowstorm, and it was just a terrible nightâwhat happened was that we had some people stationed nearby, and they would ask people, "Well, who are you?" "Well, they told me to come over here and vote for Mr. ..." whatever his name was. PC: Real political hijinks. DH: Hm mm. What we discovered was that many of those peopleâand I forget how many votes now there wereâwere people who were given proxies to vote, and this threw a question around the validity of the election. We pursued the whole thing on through, and although Constance Baker Motley lost that night by something like three votes, we then were able to move toward getting the political machinery set up for having the case reviewed in the courts, and challenging the authenticity of some of the people who cast ballots, but who were not in fact committeemen. PC: This was in the sixties, I think, wasn't it? DH: Yes. pC: I knew you and 1 knew a little bit of this. DH: Yes, that's right. It was in the mid-sixties. I don't know the exact year just now. Well, we carried that all the way through in time. Constance Baker Motley began to feel that she had had it. And she didn't want to do any more. She found it somewhat difficult to have the attack made that she might have known national civil rights, but what did she know about New York and its domestic problems. That was one of the chief arguments that was used against her. And one of the strongest forces working against us was the way in which attempts had been made, and had been made successfully to organize people in the districts to say, "Why, you don't even know her." So we planned campaigns of walking tours with her, and had people who were known in the community to walk through the streets and to introduce her to them. And in the meanwhile, we were able to get her willingness to stay in the picture when we got the mayor, Mayor Wagner then, to say he would hold the fortâhe would do all that he could, and he would challenge the other election. And as you know, the way the story ends is that the other election was considered to not have been under the proper rules, and she became a candidate and was electedâthe first woman elected to the senate over a period of many, many, many years. And certainly the first black woman. To the senate? To the senate of New York State. There had been one woman who served, oh,ï»¿113 DH: (cont.) something like sixty years prior. She was the woman in the senate. And then, of course, she moved off. But, the point that I'm making is that I had always maintained my political connections from that base, and in a sense, had a kind of power base that I was a little reluctant to give up, to move out. PC: Yes, for so many yearsâwhen you're in one place and everybody recog- nizes youâand New York being so big, you go to another area, you almost can't start again. DH: Yes. See, I've worked with Adam Clayton Powell. I've been, you know, an active participant, not only as a voter but on other things. When there were riots in Harlem, things of that sort, I was asked to go out on some of the loudspeaking trucks and things like that and talk to people in the community. PC: Well, it was your community. DH: It was my community. Yes, when I hear people talk about it, like Harlem, I have to say, it is a community and it was my community. And even with much of the deterioration there remain some of these elements. For instance, when I was talking about some of the things that endeared the community to me when I was a studentâI have to say a student, because all my early period there, I came as a college student, so I say, as a student. But the library on 135th Street was sort of another gathering place for young peopleâSunday afternoon forums, and some evenings, they had different activities. The Schomburg collection of black history* used to sponsor different times when they would have black authors come and talk about their books, and talk about different issues. Well, you can't grow up in a community and feel yourself an intimate part of it without, I suppose, being reluctant to part from it. I was active in the Abyssinian Baptist Church as a young person. I used to play on the basketball team, and things of that sort. But I joined the Methodist church, because of the fact that Dr. Lorenzo H. King, who was then the minister, asked me to come and work in the church school. So I went over as a director of Christian education in that church. Then later, when I came back to New York, I helped to organize the Business and Professional Club of young people. Now that club just celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary on the sixth of November. And, it's a part of that whole history. We started in with this club, sponsoring the church as a kind of community study hall, for so many children who just didn't have places to go. We would make hot chocolate for them and things of that sort, just to entice them. But in addition, what it meant was that so many children who lived in crowded conditions, who were doing poorly in school, were doing poorly because they never had a chance to look at their school work. Once they had a place where they could study, and other children came...and then there were things to encourage them like nice snacks, something to eat. People there would *The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Cultureï»¿114 DH: (cont.) tutor if they needed It... reference books, and then every once in a while, we would have some film or something of interest that sort of would stimulate them, encourage them, no matter what they were studying. So those are the kinds of things that I found myself involved in, in Harlem. PC: So Harlem was your home. You spoke of Yvonne Ray. Isn't she re- lated to you? DH: No. She is a friend whom I got acquainted with when I was working with the YWCA in Washington. No, she is not related to me. She and I lived with the same family in Washington, and then when I came here, she decided to come to New York too. She had a twin sister who, like herself, has had a mental health problem through the years, with which she's always been struggling. She's been hospitalized. And that was one thing that I didn't realize till we got to New York, and we'd been here, I guess, a year or so, tough years. And she bought a delicatessen store. Her sister committed suicide, because she, too, had this kind of depression that seems to plague her. PC: It's periodic? DH: Yes, a periodic depression. So, then, after her sister's death and she started this store, she was able to get her brother-in-law to come to New York and to help her with the store. PC: That's Robert Hall? DH: That's Robert Hall, yes. He came to work with her. Then, when she had a mental breakdown and had to be hospitalized, he had to dismantle the store and all that. She was placed in Pilgrim State Hospital.. . [gap in tape] DH: My nephew Dan was placed in the dormitory in a room with a couple of very, very bright fellows, one of whom, when he discovered Dan's shortcomings, just began to put the pressure on him. And they told him that he had gotten out of high school without reading a lot of things. As he told me, they would tell him, "Now, what I want you to do is to write an essay on such-and-such a subject." And then one of the fellows said to him one night, "You know, you are too bright for anything to be this backward." So he would say to him, "You may sit down on the floor while we talk. You just listen to our conversation." Well, this made its impact on him, because it was his own peer group, and they had seenâand what I had seen in his little note of thanksâ a great many of the shortcomings. And Dan said to me, the next time I went down there, he said, "You know, I came to college thinking I was a good athlete and poor student, and I've discovered I was a good student who simply got trapped in being an athlete." He said, "If theyï»¿115 (cont.) had only demanded of meâI think that they just let me by." This was in Long Island, they let him get by. In Long Island. So that he became antiestablishment by his own view, and he gave me the whole theory... This is when he became a radical. Yes. This helped to radicalize him, because he said that there was nothing accidental about this. He felt that it was part of a whole thing, to keep young blacks doing interesting things but not letting them use their minds. And he set out to develop himself. I went down, and I sat one day and I talked to him, and I told him the next day that I would see him and to leave me a message. Well, I got the message, that he'd be by at 6:30 a.m. So T said, he has to be kidding. But nevertheless, since I was working with the YWCA and had to be at a meeting that morning at ten o'clock, I got up anyway. I was up and sure enough, he came by. And he said, Well, he had used the discipline of his track by making himself run a certain distance every morning, and also that he went to the early breakfast, so this would keep him moving. But then he explained to me that he had to do his college work, but he also had to do his remedial work, and he had a reading list of all sorts of books, Adam Bede and this, and that. Finally, I said to him, "Well, you know, a lot of that, that you think you missed in high school, I think someday they'll discover you don't really have to read." I said, "If you're going to read something, add Alice in Wonderland, because I was getting concerned, he was getting so very serious. My sister called me a short while thereafter and said, the sit-ins were underway, and that Dan wanted to get involved with this, had talked to her about getting involved with the sit-ins. She said she was writing him, telling him to stay out of this, because he needed to put every minute he could to getting his studies and getting himself brought up. So I suggested to her that she should just say to him to be sure that he was able to do all the things that he had in mind, whatever he had in mind. Because, I said, "Interestingly enough, he said to me that you had spoken to him. But he said he understood what you meant when you said it wouldn't do any good to have his freedom if he didn't have his education, but he wondered whether you ever thought that education isn't much good without your freedom." So I said, "Now, when he starts thinking like that, I wouldn't tell him, stay out of sit-ins." I said, "My experience with him is that he hasn't gotten into the sit-ins because he literally has about an eighteen-hour-day program." He went to one of the professors in English and asked her to help him, and she said to him, "Flattery will get you nowhere." And he told me, this was a teacher that he had thought very highly of, but he said, "Now, for her to thinkâshe doesn't really believe that I literallyï»¿116 DH: (cont.) want to get my head on straight and to learn something." But an accounting teacher became just, oh, someone he simply adored, because this man took him seriously. I knew a woman who was heading one of the departments, and she took him seriously. She said that they felt that he was seriously interested in what he was doing. By the end...as a student who went there with all these conditional remarks...by the end of the first semester, he was on the dean's list, and he never left it. When he told me that the undergraduate chapter of Delta Sigma Theta on the campus had asked him to make the speech to present the Delta girl in the Miss Homecoming celebration, I knew then that he had gotten his English in command, because they certainly wouldn't have risked somebody who wasn't going to do it well. PC: What happened with his radicalism though? DH: Well, he was the first student at Tennessee State ever to head the student government, who openly denounced all the organizations. He became an Alpha Phi Alpha member, but he did not want his fraternity to support him. He ran on a ticket of increased student voice and changes in the school situation and so forth. Zelma George of Cleveland told me that her mother was sort of a patron saint of that school and that Dr. Gray, the president, said to her that in his experience he had never seen such a change. When Dan took over the student body, he moved for more discipline among students, and it was the best year he had seen under student leadership. But you see, when he was elected, he was not committed to any group, so his fraternity couldn't say that he owed it to them, and the sororities couldn't say, and yet he polled this great vote. PC: But a lot of this was your guidance, wasn't it? It seems to me whenever he got into the crunch, he... DH: He always called me or he always talked with me. Ralph Bunche and I were his idea of what people were doing. This was a part of his whole attitude toward things, and he would test things out. I had different opinions. You know, I was not always in agreement with what he was doing. But in addition, when he graduated, Chrysler sent out recruiters, and I met on the plane the black man who was doing the recruiting, and he told me that Dan had come to Chrysler. This was after his graduation; they had recruited him for the executive management training.. Before his graduation, he had joined the debating society and had been to Vanderbilt, and UCLA and different places, debating. PC: That's again like you. Â°H: Yes, he liked that sort of thing. He had taken a very active part in a lot of the different social changes that they were trying to make around there. So he got to Chrysler, and he was in the executive management training program, and this man met me and he said, "The people at Chrysler tell me that if I could produce one like him a year, they would just feel thatï»¿117 DH: (cont.) that was the greatest." He said, "We just haven't any students like that." But an interesting thing happened. His whole social change, his attitude about things, his analysis of things, his seeing things in a political sense as well, meant that by the end of the first year, he had decided that this was really getting him straight into the heart of the Establishment. I spoke in Detroit a year or so later. He came up on the platform, with his long hair and his beard, and a woman who was there from the mayor's office saw me speaking with him, and she said, "Oh yes, you know, Dan and I were very good friends when he was interned at the mayor's office." He said, "Oh yes, and I haven't had a chance to thank you, because it was in the mayor's officeâand I enjoyed itâ but it was right there that I decided, I didn't belong to that part of the Establishment, that I had to be part of the force to change some of this." And so that's his whole... PC: I thought there was a pattern there. DH: He's written a book on the political climate of change. I took a YWCA group to Detroit and asked him to come in and talk with them. It was all on black empowerment, at that time, and, you know, he scared some of the women when he just said straight out, that he questioned whether or not, in this country, that black people, black empowerment would mean very much until there was real change. And people pressed him, to try to see what he really meant, and some of them said, "Do you think it will take violence?" And he said, "I think that if it takes violence, that violence should be used, in order to bring about the change, because everything is so entrenched." PC: He's gone through many periods. DH: He's gone through many. PC: But you've always been there for him to listen to. Â°H: Oh yes, and he talks to me. That night, I sat up and talked to him, when I was there with the YWCA. I talked to him till about three o'clock in the morning. pC: That was all I was trying to get to, as a part of you and your relation- ship with a terrific young person who happens to be a relative. It could have been another specific youngster. DH: Sure. pC: Now, you talked about his reading and all the reading lists. At that time, before you were running around the world, not only the country, but the world, did you have time to read? Did you do much reading when you were a younger person? Not as a student, I know you read, but when you became a YWCA executive?ï»¿118 DH: Oh yes. As a matter of fact, a friend of mine once said, "Well, whatever it is, Dorothy always reads a book about it." And so she used to ask me, "Do you have a book on such-and-such a subject?" Now since...really since my elementary school days, reading has always been... PC: Do you read specifically around whatever you're interested in? You don't read for fantasy life or escapeâif you're on a committee for something, you read a book that has to do with that committee, that project, or that idea? DH: Yes. And then I read fast, for one thing, and I tend to read things in which I have an interest. For instance, I read a lot that has to do with hunger and malnutrition and things of that sort. I read anything that seems to have some bearing on civil rights. Biography? Do you read biography at all? DH: Yes. I like biography. I don't get as much chance for reading some of the things. I have a "to be read" stack that gets higher and higher, of things that I really want to read in depth. But what I tend to have is a patternâa great many things come to me, for one reason or another. PC: You mean books? DH: Books, pamphlets, magazines. And I tend to try to keep up with them. I have such retention that chances are that if I find myself at some point wanting something, I'll be able to identify where it was that I saw something about that particular thing. Now, that's a characteristic I've had since childhood. I can almost tell you the color of the book. PC: And probably the page. DH: Pretty much. I can say...like right now, I'm looking for a quotation that is in a book by Rollo May. It's from Kierkegaard. The title of the book escapes me, but I knew exactly where it is in that book. It'll come to me. It hasn't come yet, but I'll finally pick it up. PC: That means you read a book by Rollo May and that wouldn't be directly in your field. DH: Oh no. I don't read in any field. I mean, I can't say that I read just in a particular field. PC: But what you don't have time to do is read the novel of the year. DH: Yes, I seldom get to do that, the way I'd like to. PC: Well, it was my hunch, but I thought I should find out. DH: I do a lot of reading while I'm traveling. Since I travel so much...ï»¿119 PC: But still you probably take a big briefcase with reports in it, do a lot of that reading. DH: Yes. But I read a lot in the field of education, for example. PC: Of course, we're into that now. Was this true before, too? I'm trying to get the fifties and sixties in this because I know how little time you have now to read. But earlier, when you weren't as recognized as you are now, there should have been a little more time, I know there wasn't much, but a little more time to read. That's what I wondered about, whether there was more time and you did read different things than you do now. Can you remember your reading pattern? DH: Well, I like to read something that is pretty current in theology. I have an interest in religious material, especially theological material. I used to read a lot of things likeâwell, about anything that I'm doing, like I read a lot of crochet books, and I used to read a lot of canasta books, when I used to teach canasta, things like that. But I like to read around issues. PC: So you don't read for escape, really. DH: When I was in the hospital, at the time of my automobile accident, a friend from England whose world YWCA office was in Washington temporarily, knew that I couldn't have visitors, but that I could read and I liked to read, and she brought me her Agatha Christie collection, and I read all those. I would say that was the fullest dose that I have ever had, of just reading just to read for the fun of it, you know. And that three months, I pretty much readâwell, I read every Agatha Christie. I think she brought me about fifty or sixty. That sort of thing. PC: That establishes pretty much how it has to go. It isn't only be- cause you need to read those things, it's because you want to read those things that have to do with your life. DH: Yes. pC: Now, you don't need to talk much about this, but I know from experiences that you are a good cook and enjoy cooking. DH: Yes. PC: And that now in your crowded schedule, you probably have very little time to cook. Did you do more cooking when you were living in Harlem, in earlier days? Again, not when you were a student, but in the fifties to the middle sixties? DH: Yes. I used to have more time, and I used to have more time at home to do things. I look back now and wonder, how was it that I used toâ with different friends, I'd have a group of people in, we'd play cards, and that sort of thing. That I used to do. I think, another thingï»¿120 DH: (cont.) that has happened is, Robert is quite a good cook and he likes to cook, so that when he came to live in New York, he started cooking. You know, he would cook. For instance, I'm either gone, or I have a dinner meeting, or something... PC: You couldn't do it now. That's why I'm asking whether you could have done it. DH: But way back then, I used to do it, and I loved to do it. PC: First of all, I've eaten at your house, I know how good it is, and you did have time once, at least. You came to our house and helpedâ it was so good. DH: Yes, and I used to say that when I retired I was going to be a short order cook, because I love to cook. For one thing, I am not an inspired cook. I cook by a recipe. I have recipes that I know, and I use those. But also, 1 like to take recipes and develop them, that sort of thing. PC: Well, that's inspiration. You can't do that if you don't have some flair for it. DH: I do have a flair for flavoring and things of that sort. I used to make... PC: Someday maybe you'll go back to it, if things ever let up. If they ever did, I'm sure you would do it for pleasure. DH: That's right, I really like to do it. And I like to entertain. That's the other thing, too. I like to cook and I like to entertain. This is all part of what I like to do. PC: DH: PC: DH: It's just a part of your life you haven't got now. Right, it just seems impossible. You said you read about crocheting, aboutâperhaps you read about knitting, Now everybody who thinks about Dorothy Height carrying a piece of work around thinks about needlepoint, during the last few months. I want to ask you whether you do this because it calms you, it intrigues you, it makes meetings more bearable, or any other reason? Well, first of all, I have both a life pace that requires activity... I mean, for example, I seldom do nothing. I find that even to rest, I have to do something. I always keep something by the telephone, so if I have to telephone, I can pick up a piece and I can work on it, something I can do. I find that gives me a feeling of usefulness, and yet it isn't pressured. Nobody is telling me that I have to meet a deadline on a piece that I'm making. I don't like that kind of pressure on handwork. The other thing is that I find that where I have to go to many meetings that I concentrate much better on what is going on. I can listen, I'm a person who would never, nevei; never whisper in a meeting, and I supposeï»¿(cont.) it's because I've tried to conduct meetings with people whispering, and I hate anybody to whisper to me. I'd rather they'd write me a note in a meeting. Because if I'm in a meeting, I want to hear what's going on, and if I don't want to hear what's going on, then I get up and I leave. But if I'm there, I want to know what's going on. I find that I learn something about things that I'm not too interested in sometimes as well as things that I'm interested in. But if I have something like a piece of simple handworkâI don't go into a meeting with anything that I have to figure out. Nothing that needs concentration. No. I have to make sure that I already have it under control. But what I find is that with the pace that I move during the day, that like every person, the chemistry of your body reaches a place where you feel slightly depressed or slightly discouraged. I find that when I get that kind of sense, I go home, and sometimes it may be eleven o'clock at night, and I start from eleven o'clock to twelve o'clock, and I crochet or I knit, I do something. I associate it with the fact that I learned to knit when I was in the hospital, and in my mind I think it has a therapeutic value. It therefore becomes almost therapeutic for me. I find that I can go home, and I can be as tired, and discouraged, and if I can sit down and... Do you listen to television or radio? I usually turn on the television. And I may or may not be listening to what's going on. But if I sit and make something, there is a sense of accomplishment. You see, so much that I work on is going to happen some time by the next century. And I don't see the change. I have to keep myself in a mood for, you know, going back into it. Otherwise, you're too discouraged. You couldn't go back. Well, plus the fact that I like it. It's relaxing. I find it way... to me it's entertaining. I don't smoke. I really don't drink. I think it's a variety of things it does for you. Yes. But I also have a feeling of accomplishment. Now, when I knit something, or make something, as I was doing the other day, that is just kind of so-so, I lose interest in it. I have to keep moving to some new idea. You don't want to do the same thing over and over, follow the same pattern, make the same vest. No. I have to keep moving to something different. Well, I think we've covered everything that I had down, about your days before I began to know you in the civil rights movement. When we talk about the civil rights movement, we do have to go back to beforeï»¿122 PC: (cont.) the time I knew you, because in most Americans' minds the big push began on May 17, 1954, with the Brown v. the Board of Education. That may be a white interpretation of a black movement, but it is a sort of general jumping-off point. We can use it, unless you want to go back of that. DH: Yes, that's all right. PC: Do you remember your own reactions that particular day when the decision was announced? DH: Yes. I do. I remember it because I had been in Washington, D.C., many years prior, when Charles Houston, who was the counsel for the NAACP in Washington, had said that they were going to move for such a thing, and he had discovered some of the laws that were...since the Reconstruction era had been lying dormant. But I remember when he called together at Howard University a large number of educators: Charles Thompson, Kenneth Clark, a number of them. So that I'd been aware of this whole drive since the days when I worked in Washington, back about 1941, when they really started the effort in this direction. PC: School desegregation. DH: Yes. But I think the thing that got me the most was the nine to zero decision. I never anticipated it would be that way. PC: It was the nine to zero Supreme Court vote? DH: The Supreme Court vote. That was the thing that got meâthat I was interested in. I can remember getting on the phone, calling and saying, "Well, did you ever think this would happen?" PC: That particular day when it finally happened? DH: When it finally happened...when that decision came. PC: So it had to be a landmark decision. I can think of many, many people who know exactly where they were, it's like, the war broke out and where were you? When Kennedy was shot, where were you? The same thing with that day. Â°H: That's right! That whole day was just that kind of thing. When this decision was given, I was really just sittingâwe were in our office, at the YWCA, and we rushed out to get the news about it. As I said, the nine to zero decision seemed to me so great that it gave more of a sense of hope. I really felt that we were at the end of a whole era and that something new had really happened. I remember the jokes that people began to make about it, oh, like the person who went into a restaurant and asked them if they had any black-eyed peas, or any chitterlings, and the waiter said, "No, we don't." And he said, "Well, then y'all are not ready." Because the whole sense of integration having been made real was I think...was very, very clear atï»¿123 DH: (cont.) that time. PC: Alas, it did take a number more years. DH: At that time, it was thoughtâin fact, it was like this, it was abundantly clear. PC: DH: Did that decision have any major impact on the organization of the YWCA or lead to any changes in their policy or their program? Well, modestly or Immodestly, what I think the YWCA was saying was, "In 1946, we took this position. Now the Supreme Court decision has caught up with where the YWCA wasâwith our position." PC: They didn't have to make changes, you tell me. DH: We had already initiatedâwe had already adopted an interracial charter. But the decision to be something that gave a new impetus, so that immediately we began to ask what can we do to help communities gain acceptance of this, and integrate the classrooms? This was the kind of thing that we got into. PC: That's a program. DH: Right. Because really just as those who were working for it were de- lighted, those who were resisting it were overwhelmed, and you had to give them some kind of a new sense of what they could do. People just didn't have the slightest notion of what to do. I remember we developed in Jacksonville, Florida, and several cities, groups of women who were prepared to move into neighborhoods, and teams of students, black and white, who would go from door to door, talking to families and saying, "Take your child by the hand, and lead him to school in September." PC: In a way then Jean Fairfax, when she did that in Jackson, Mississippi, was following the same... DH: ...same principle. PC: Ten years later. DH: That's right, because ten years later, there was still resistance, because there was still the feeling that somehow or other, this decision would be upset, and would not have to be obeyed. PC: That I didn't know. I just thought they would not upset it, but just not obey it, because it hadn't been obeyed for ten years. DH: Well, the truth is that with the quality of national leadership that is so up and down on the issue, there still is a great deal of feeling that perhaps the issue will be, you know... PC: Well, the issue of the vote I suppose gets shaky every so often, the Voting Rights Act.ï»¿124 DH: Yes, but the challenges that come out around the issue of busing, those challenges in themselves are ways that people have of saying, maybe now we don't have to do it. But the Kerner Commission was right in saying that our problem is that we lack the will. See, there's a kind of lack of will to see this thing accomplished that is so devastating. PC: From what I'm reading of what you're saying, the leadership and the members of the YWCA were for the most part supportive of this ruling, but some were negative. You could bring some along, others you couldn't bring along, is that it? DH: I'm thinking, say, the YWCA in many communities was ready to move, but its community wasn't ready to move. And what I find is that that was characteristic of so much of the white population, that the YWCA population reflected the community, and there were people who felt that somehow or other, there would be a great change made, and the change will say that you don't have to desegregate. And that's what you're seeing that's still going on. Now, the tragedy is that as far as the YWCA is concerned, we pushed the South very hard, and the South moved. PC: Well, there was a film on Selma, Alabama, the other day which showed how in the eleven years since you and I were in Selma, Alabama, there was the tremendous change: acceptance. DH: Acceptance, and you remember how at that time every adult who had a child in the family who had been out there trying to get people to register to vote was considered a personâcalled "contributing to the delinquency of minors." Now, today that situation is so changed that it is hard to believe it's the same placeâat the very same time that Boston is finding all the resistance. The issue now has shifted to the North, where there is this resistance. But you see, there was great resistance in the South at the outset. PC: Well, they were so frightened. And the North was so scornful. Now the North has suddenly realized its problems and doesn't know how to cope with them. DH: That's right. PC: Now, at that point, Dorothy Height, you were the fourth president of the National Council of Negro Women. I think you had just come in, in 1954? DH: No. No. I became president in November, '57. PC: Oh, then I'm wrong. I was wondering whether it was up to your leadership to get our members to move on this, but it wasn't. DH: No. PC: So let's skip that, because there's enough that the Council has done on this. Let me ask you to give us a little portrait of Dorothy Tilly'sï»¿125 PC: (cont.) efforts to stop lynching, which was a way of death perpetrated by white men on black men when you and I were working in the early days. I think you knew Dorothy Tilly before I knew her, in the South. DH: Yes. PC: So you could certainly give a clearer picture of her work. DH: I first got to know Dorothy Tilly as a Southern white woman, who was really speaking out and working for justice, many years ago, through the work of the United Methodist Women. In the height of the whole struggle, Mrs. Tilly organized what she called the Fellowship of Concerned, which wasn't an organization, but it was an effort to get concerned citizens, especially those who were white but also including those who were black, to be a kind of network across the South. So that when there was a lynching or when someone was thrown into jail unjustly, one could telephone the other one, and they would express their concern. Mrs. Tilly called together such a group. I remember Mrs. Roosevelt was there, and she spoke about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and how all of this was really related. Mrs. Tilly had Morris Abram, who was then a young Atlanta lawyer, come, and he did, oh, a prophetic thing on the implications of the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for the South. Mrs. Tilly didn't try to deal with the nation, she just dealt with the South. She organized groups of women who would go into the courts, and they would sit in the courts to see how justice was meted out. I remember her telling how at one time her husband picked her up to take her to the courts, and he looked at her and said, "Well, we're going by Rich's and buy you some earrings," because she had left her earrings at home. He said, "Just because you're going into battle doesn't mean you need to look like a battle axe." The thing that she would do with these womenâthey would go into the court room, and they would wear their white gloves and their little hats and sit there, and the judge would say, "Is there something I can do for you?" and they'd say, "Oh no, just listening." They were told never to answer anybody or ask anybody anything. But their presence meant a lot, because they saw things change. They saw people much more conscious of what was going on. This was the kind of thing she did, and she called it the Fellowship of the Concerned. She held meetings about it. And that's why when you and I were going into Seltna, who would come into that situation, because we were going in to try to see what had been happening to women and children in the Selma situation. [This is March 28, 1975] I'm going to repeat a question that we asked in our last session. That is to ask Miss Height about the 1954 Supreme Court ruling of the United States, perhaps one of its most important rulings, which was Brown v. the School Board of Topeka, Kansas. I want to know whether you remember your reactions on May 17 when the decision was announced, where you were, anything about itâanything you want to recall about it.ï»¿126 DH: (cont.) Yes. I don't remember exactly, but I was attending a meeting when the word came in, and it was just like declaring a holiday, because immediately the whole feeling was, "Well, at last we have made it." That Plessy v. Ferguson, separate but equal doctrine, was dead forever. I remember that that evening, I was with some friends and they were telling stories about black people who went into restaurants that afternoon, and asked for black-eyed peas or chitterlings or something of that sort, and the waitress in these newly-opened institutions, you know, began to say, "Well, we don't have that." And then they'd say, "Well, that means that you folks are not ready." So there was a kind of an air of celebration and jubilee around the whole idea because people had worked on it so long. I had a very special recollection of the earlier days when I worked in Washington. Charles Houston, who was then with the NAACP, had initiated some of the very first work that was done to begin to challenge the separate but equal doctrine. And it just seemed like, you know, this was a great milestone. pC: But it wasn't an integrating of public accommodations, the way the 1964 Civil Rights Act was, so why would they go into restaurants when it was school desegregation? DH: Well, it just so happened that this was a thing that happened around the whole idea of opening up the schools. Schools were so symbolic of the whole pattern. And I think the thing we have to bear in mind about the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision is not that it dealt with schools, but it dealt with the separate but equal doctrine. You see, the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896 had upheld the concept of separate but equal, and the schools, like the armed services, were more symbolic of the way that separate but equal doctrine had been embedded in American life. The people who had worked on it saw that what had to happen was, to get a reversal of the courts, and that was a part of its significanceâ that here was the Supreme Court issuing a ruling that struck down the earlier one. So that integration in the classroom became a subsidiary issue. But the important thing, I think, about Brown v. Board of Education is the elimination of the concept that separate but equal was indeed equal. Nine versus zero. See, that kind of decision was so clear-cut, so unequivocal that that was part of its significance, tooâto think that in this country, with its deeply ingrained racist doctrine, that you could get a nine to zero decision. So that that's one decision that cannot be questioned. It was very clear. Now, the fact that it dealt with elementary schools, when you get into it technically, did affect the scope of its activity. But I don't think we ought to let the school issue overshadow the fact that it was really striking down a whole idea, because the Plessy v. Ferguson decision had been rendered in relation to transportation, not schoolsâit was more pervasive than just transportation. And that meant that you had some seventeen states that had laws that were based upon that. So it took...ï»¿127 The separate but equal... Yes, it took the ground from under that. It began to weaken that whole base, because up to that point, we had such strong laws of segregation. I think that for many people, particularly blacks, there was a kind of faith that made people think that, just as rigidly as the country had upheld its segregation laws, based upon Plessy v. Ferguson, they would then reverse them, based upon the Brown v. Board of Education. But that is not what has happened. No, we forgot about how deeply ingrained racism is. That's right, because the period from 1896 to 1954 had had so much based upon practice that this whole concept which at first got going in relation to one thing, had now begun to reach into every aspect. You see, it was not just transportation. Waiting rooms, drinking fountains, everywhere you went, it was separateânot necessarily equalâ separate facilities. Well, I think the decision, if you read it, says very clearly, the very fact that you make people separate is a determination that they are not equal. And that I think was the crux... It determined their position in society. Right. Do you remember anything about what that decision did to the YWCA? Was there any special impact when you were working at the Y at that time? Oh yes. Immediately it became necessary for YWCA people to see what they would do to help implement and to support the Supreme Court's decision. We set up special projects. For instance, I remember in Jacksonville, Florida, and in several other southern communities, black and white women came together and developed projects of saying, "Take your child by the hand when September comes and take them to school," with the idea of helping to build some ground swell of support behind the new decision. There had to be an intensive program of education as to what it meant. But you know that almost as soon as the decision was passed, and guidelines began to get developed through the Office of Education, immediately there were all these different ways of trying to get around it, ways of circumventing it. It's very interesting that the same pattern is showing up in 1975, when there are affirmative action programs that have been legislated which affect racial groups as well as womenâmany businesses and industries are finding ways of seeing how they can meet the letter of the law without really meeting the intent of the law. And I think this is a part of what is almost a pattern in this countryâthat if we can just do something, like take one or two black children into a school, then you couldn't say that that school did not have black children.ï»¿128 PC: We're devoted to tokenism. DH: Right. So it was this kind of thing... PC: But some things went so farâI think that's why Mississippi passed a state law that schooling was not required, there was no compulsory schooling. DH: Well, there were places, we have to face it, like Prince Edward County in Virginia, where they closed the schools, rather than obey the ruling, and where private schools were set up for white children, and black children were left without any kind of schooling, until finally some special projects were developed to deal with them. There was also a great tendency then in some places to say that they would have what they called private schools, yet if you really looked it up, the white power structure was using public funds to support those schools. PC: is that still happening? DH: That's still happening, and that was another way of getting around desegregating the schools, and I say desegregation because I think that was the step that the Supreme Court's decision set in motion, trying to desegregate. Another thing that happened was the immediately, there was a sudden spurt of new school buildings, new school construction, in many southern communities. They immediately built brand new schools for the black children, so that it could be saidâ"Well, that's by far the best school in town." But, unfortunately, there was enough persistence at the federal level to insist that those schools should be open to all children. PC: Did the National Council of Negro Women take part in desegregation in various parts of the country? DH: I think you have to bear in mind that black people had not lived in an open society either, and therefore, there were many things that had to be done. Perhaps one of the most crucial was that black teachers began to lose their jobs. The way in which localities interpreted the new school guidelines was that they would close the formerly black schools, if it were inadequate or if they hadn't built a new one, and they began to dismiss administrative staffs, school principals as well as teachers, in the black community. So the loss of teachers who were black was tremendous. Then another thing was that there had been a great push earlier for the equalization of teachers' salaries. We found that many of the women, related through the National Council of Negro Women, themselves were the victims of this new step. They had just won the right to have equal pay for equal work, and then along came the desegregation, and the mood was to say, "Well, you say you want blacks and whites in the same schools, and we have picked the people who will do it, " and therefore there was this loss. So we did very special work on trying to salvage teachers, and trying to find some way that there could be an equitable distribution between the black and white teachers and principals, rather than the basic assumptionï»¿130 DH: (cont.) that blacks were to be integrated into the white situation, and only those taken who were qualifiedâso-called qualified, and by qualified they also meant those that they felt made the school quali-fiable. In other words, that school wanted to be able to qualify itself, to be able to say it was meeting the federal guidelines. So they would take just enough people to make the school qualified under the guidelines, you see. PC: And many of our members were teachers. DH: Many were teachers and principals and the like. PC: So NCNW did get in there and try to work in that situation. DH: Oh yes. PC: Now, I have to jump again and bring us up to a little bit later date, to ask you to describe the Taconic Foundation and the role that its president, Stephen Currier, played in forming the Council on United Civil Rights Leadership. DH: Well, as I look back now, it almost seems providential that the... PC: Excuse me, that was about 1962, is that right? For the record. DH: No, it was earlier than that. I think it was about 1960 or '61, that the Taconic Foundation, under the leadership of Stephen Currier, decided that it wanted to make a major piece of its work deal with the furtherance of civil and human rights. And so Stephen Currier provided Whitney Young, who was then with the National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph, who was the leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the AFL-CIO; Roy Wilkins of the NAACP; Jack Greenberg, who was with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; Eric Lincoln, who had done some studies of the Black Muslims; James Farmer, who was then with the Congress of Racial Equality; and John Lewisâno, it wasn't John Lewis at that pointâand me, to meet with them, over a period of months, he gave each one of us an honorarium in order to make it possible for us to block off a period of time, and we spent whole days at the Taconic Foundation. The thrust of the work was on delineating the present status and the future of black people in the United States. We chose particular areas, and each one of us soon became a resource person with that area. We in turn brought together a nucleus of people who would help us to discuss that particular area. I, for instance, did this around the role of voluntary agencies, because I think many people didn't realize that, in terms of segregation and discrimination, there was as much in voluntary agency structures as in the broader corporate community. So that each of us took specific areas and then got particular people to help us write papers. The whole idea of this was to begin to chart some of the things that we would like to see happen over the ten years that would follow, and therefore to begin a kind of program for action related to that.ï»¿131 PC: John Lewis came into this at some point? DH: Well, actually what happened was that when we were meeting, I raised the question about the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, called SNCC, because of the fact that they were very active at that time in the whole civil rights struggle. Incidentally, I forgot to say, the other person was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. PC: Well, of course. DH: They were working very hard in the South, as was Dr. King with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and there was some reluctance because, like most young people, they were doing some rather kooky things, and at some points, the NAACP was having to mop up behind them. As young people will do, they cared less about how the elders looked at what they were doing. Part of their value was that they had their own forms of protest, and they were nonviolent. So I raised the question and expressed the concern, because it seemed to me that, representing the interests of women, I could not just say, "Let our young people go." After some discussion, it was agreed to ask John Lewis and/or James Forman, who were with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, to join the group, and so they did. Now, it was at the time that Medgar Evers was assassinated that Stephen Currier called us all together and said that what we were working on was very important, but the whole thing had quickened. And I think one of the things that we kept saying to ourselves was, that if Stephen Currier had not called us together, we might not have been as unified as we were, though there was still great diversity among us, you know, in our approaches and the like. It was when John F. Kennedy was still president. PC: That was in 1963, Medgar Evers was murdered, I believe. DH: Yes, I am not sure of the exact dateâif '63, it had to be early '63. And what happened was that Stephen Currier, at that point then, asked us what we felt needed to be done. And the whole group said that we saw things that needed to be done, but each one of the organizations in its own way was hurting for financial support. No one had as much personnel in the field as it felt was needed, and yet it was felt there was a need for some kind of a concerted approach. And so Stephen Currier decided that he would use the Carlyle Hotel, where we had been meeting over a period of time, when we were all at the Foundation, and call together people he thought were men and women of conscience who would be concerned about the Evers assassination. He sent telegrams to about a hundred people, and I think that ninety people responded to an early morning breakfast. This was held on the same morning that Evers was buried in Arlington Cemetery, and each one of us was asked to speak briefly on the situation from the vantage point of our particular groups. It was very interesting that the response there was very good. A numberï»¿132 DH: (cont.) of people contributed funds that were tax-exempt and there were some who contributed nonexempt funds to really try to stimulate the whole action. Therefore, it was felt then that there had to be some formulation, and that's when it became the United Civil Rights Leadership. And it was under that particular banner that we really set to work. PC: My next question is about the March on Washington. Were the plans for the March on Washington already under way at the time of the breakfast? DH: Oh no. Oh no. PC: The breakfast I believe was in June, because I remember I was there, and I remember it was a lovely morning and warm, so I think that it was in June. DH: Yes, it probably... PC: That meant that the march got going very fast because the march was August 28th that same year. DH: At that point, there was no thought of a march. As a matter of fact, the study of the status of black people in America, and the kinds of programs and action that seemed to be needed, was the focus up to that point. It was the assassination of Medgar Evers that became the pivotal point, and the group was galvanized to realize that it had to do more. PC: You mean these people who had assembled? DH: These people who had assembled. And then that's where you could say, the essence of a civil rights movement was somehow crystallized. PC: So really, it was Stephen. DH: Actually, it was Stephen Currier who was the catalyst and the initiator, and who did a very good thing by these meetings which were about every three weeks over a period of about a year. It was the rare occasion when the principal person did not come. People tended not to send a substitute. Each one would quickly testify that this they found a very valuable kind of thing to do. You know, they were pleased to do it. They felt the need of it. They felt the need of each other. They felt the need of something that was unified. And I think that the reason I said it was kind of providential was that at the time of the Evers assassination, and a lot of the events that followed, people began to pick up on the thing that had been generated by the Freedom Rides and by some of the SNCC actions, sit-ins and the like, but they were not adding up to the same kind of impact. And the fact that there was this concerted effort was due largely to the fact that people were already together. I find it hard to imagine what might have happened, had you had the Medgar Evers' s assassination without this prior unified kind of approach.ï»¿133 PC: You mean everyone would have gone off in a different direction. DH: I don't want to be judgmental and say they would have, but I'd say, it would have been a harder thing to have gotten together. Which method did you use? Did you then follow CORE or would it be the NAACP, or would it be the Urban League? And needless to say, you would not expect all the great giants to be following the National Council of Negro Women! PC: No... DH: Therefore, the chances are that there would have been some kind of pulling together. But... PC: But it would have been late. DH: It would have been late, and it would not have been possible to have achieved what seven, eight or nine months of meeting together had achieved. There was a meeting of minds, and there was a lack of a competitive spirit. There was more of a sense of a common destiny, and more of a willingness on the part of all to recognize different virtues, different tactics. The Urban League did not use the same approach that SNCC used nor the NAACP, but since the situation was so bad, one could not be sure that one method or the other was the only method. And if other groups in the community could use multiple approaches to deal with their problems, so could we. That was one of the valuable things that led to the United Civil Rights Leadership and then, you know, immediately we began to get the button. Yes. But I want to ask you, before that, a little bit about the march. If the March on Washington was determined after that breakfast, how did it come about that Bayard Rustin and whoever else were the leaders... Well, Philip Randolph, who had several times before called for a March on Washington, once again began to say, "We need to march, both for freedom and for jobs." And then Bayard Rustin had been associated with Mr. Randolph and worked with him over a period of time. I have to say, over the protests of some people who, at that point, did not want to see Bayard Rustin in a position of leadershipâMr. Randolph said that he had confidence in him, and he wanted him to develop that march. And so Bayard Rustin did, and of course all of the groups, you know, cooperated with it. But the March on Washington really was put together in a period of about seven or eight weeks. A remarkable job. That's right. But you see, the other thing that I think we don't want to forget is that it wasn't just an organizational feat. It was that theï»¿134 (cont.) climate in the country, the number of atrocities and things that were happening... The children were bombed in Birmingham... Right... I've forgotten myself right now but I know there was... And then you had the hangover from the Emmett Till case, and then Dr. Lee disappeared somewhere in Mississippi. First one thing and then another had kindled a climate, and there was a kind of awakening of conscience on the part of the majority of the white population, where people were indeed upset, and I remember hearing... Television was picking it up. President Kennedy said to a civil rights group once when we were at the White House that Bull Connor, down in Alabama, who was seen on television and in newspapers with his foot on the neck of a black woman who had been knocked to the street, and to the ground, might prove in time to be the best friend of the civil rights effort. Very clever of him. That was really very important, because a lot of people who were not worried about segregation or even discrimination responded when they saw something as blatant as that kind of actionâor when they saw children and youths being washed away with fire hoses. Cattle prods were used all down through Alabama, Louisiana. And I remember that James Farmer, on one of the Freedom Rides, was put into the jail at Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana, and then when he was released, his friends had put him in a hearse and carried him out as if he were a dead body. Because they would have re-arrested him? Ridden him out of town on a rail? Well, they might have lynched him. It was such a mob action. So when we look at it now, we have to be aware that there was a great tempest of violence and hatred and unleashed hostility that just created a climate in the country where people of goodwill wanted to do something to express their feeling. And Philip Randolph built upon this and called for the March on Washington. And of course all of the groups joined in that. And many white groups, liberal groups, church groups, labor groups. Oh yes. Two hundred and fifty thousand people by count. I'm not sure how many by actuality. I think more. Well, there were whole busloads of people from Protestant, Catholic, Jewish churches. There were all sorts of organizations and agencies that really got into it. And that's how, the day after the March on Washington, you were able toï»¿135 PC: (cont.) assemble a group of women representing many organizations from many states to stay and discuss what should be done about the times. DH: Yes. You see, what happened was that everyone had been urged to leave Washington after the march. But what I felt was that if we could gather under the banner of the National Council of Negro Women a really representative group of women to look at the issue of, after the marchâwhat we could begin to work on, some of the things that needed to be focussed on, to achieve the things the march had been designed to bring attention to. And so that's why we met af terward. PC: Do you remember any of the particulars of our discussions or work- shops? Or what we did? DH: Well, one of the things that came out was that up to that point, as I represented the interests of women in the whole civil rights leadership group, I had found that it was very difficult to get people, who were oriented toward laws and practices like that to accept the fact that the conditions affecting children, and affecting youth, and affecting women, whether they were services like child care, or whether they were things related to employment opportunitiesâthis was all a part of civil rights. And I found that one of the good things was that when the women came together, they were very articulate about it. They saw the relationship between decent housing, and schooling, and child care, to employment, and employment to job opportunities . So that I thought was the strength of that particular meeting, because it gave a kind of validity to the things that the National Council of Negro Women was organized to deal with, but which somehow got subdued as you were thinking purely of getting a Voting Rights Act, Now, this didn't mean that we didn't work on the Voting Rights Act, or work on the civil rights legislation. But it meant that as we worked on those things, we had to be concerned about what was happening to children, what was happening to young peonle, that sort of thing. ^C: That's the way I remember it. I just wanted to be sure.. Do you remem- ber that some of the SNCC young people came to our meeting, and they told us what had happened to them down Southâand you and others of us told them that that's what we were there for. It was the National Council of Negro Women and other women who had come to this meeting who wanted to help in any way that was useful. So you received a telephone call in your office in October of 1963 from one or two of those people in Selma, Alabama. DH PC That's right. Do you want to talk about that? ^H: Yes. I think one of the things that happened, in that meeting at the close of the march, was that having young women who themselves wereï»¿136 DH: (cont.) the victims of mishandling in the hands of law enforce- ment officers and all, kind of sharpened up the fact that we had to be concerned about what was happening to young people who were trying to achieve for themselves and their families their basic civil rights. In October, I got a call from James Forman, who was the executive of SNCC, who alerted me that Prathea Hall, who was then a SNCC staff person in Selma, Alabama, was going to call because the situation there was very critical. Practically none of the black population in Selma, Alabama, in fact in that whole county, Dallas County, was registered to vote. And these young people had organized a plan for training the children and youth in what basic voting rights were, and they were trying to register their parents and other adults, get them down to the registration office. They were trying to get them registered to vote. Well, in the course of all this, some 300 of them were arrested. The thing that concerned Prathea Hall was that parents had been running around trying to find their children, because there was no jail in Selma big enough to hold 300 of anybody, and they wondered then where the children were, and they had gone from place to place. Well, obviously, what the authorities had done was that they had just used anything they could findâany place to put them. They asked whether the National Council of Negro Women would come into Selma, really to help support their efforts and to take part in a meeting that they were going to hold, to try to see what they could do. They really were trying to build more of a climate of support around these young people, and also to bring to public attention the way they were being treated. Well, I asked you and Shirley Smith, who was with the National Women's Committee for Civil Rights, which had grown out of President Kennedy's effort to enlist the services of women's organizations on behalf of civil rights, and Dr. Dorothy Ferebee, who was a physician in charge of health services at Howard University, to go into Selma. We in turn decided it would be very useful to have a southern white woman, and so we asked Mrs. Dorothy Tilly, who was with the Southern Regional Council and the United Methodist Women, if she would join us. And if you recall, we then went to Atlanta, and when we got to Atlanta and we talked to Amelia Boynton and one or two other people over in Selma... PC: Well, we couldn't get all our telephone calls through. T<7e had a terrible time. DH: That's right. PC: We tried to reach them. What we discovered was that our calls just did not get through. And Mrs. Tilly felt that perhaps she would have to go a little later. She just wasn't able to go with us. PC: I think she was due at a meeting or something.ï»¿137 DH: Yes, something was going on. Dr. Ferebee and you and I and Shirley Smith then discussed the whole thing and decided that we would continue on. When we got into Selma, we were met at the airport by James Forman, and he briefed us on the situation we were going into. And I'll never forget that when we got into the town... PC: Well, remember, first we weren't going together. We were going to be separated. But then one car didn't come, so we had to get to town, two white women and two black women. DH: That's right. pC: That was pretty dangerous in itself. DH: Very dangerous, and if you recall, as we were riding along, we saw one or two cars that were in some kind of surveillance of our activities. But we eventually got in to the church, got to Selma. We got there in time to go to the church for the rally. PC: Wait a minute, we got there earlier, because they, the SNCC workers had gathered the children together to talk with you and Dorothy Ferebee, specifically. DH: Yes. PC: Shirley and I happened to go along because we were driving you. We shouldn't have been there, but we were. That was before the giant rally. That was in the afternoon and the rally was at night. DH: Oh yes. PC: They were asked to talk to you two women, to tell you what had happened to them. DH: Yes. PC: And that's the way it went. DH: We found there the children and a large number of parents. I remember, one mother pointing out her little eleven-year-old daughter, who was just skin and bones. She looked like any one of the starving Biafrans. And she said that this child had a very special stomach condition, and had to have special food, which, once she had found where her daughter was, in the place that she was being detainedâshe went out to the place and carried some food. She did that every day. But after about a week or ten days, as the children were released, when she went to pick up the child, one of the guards told her that there was a large package over there that belonged to her. It was filled with maggots and other vermin, and of course the child was physically... They had never given the child the food. I remember when we asked the children what it was like they said that they had been served bollweevil gravy. Dr. Ferebee talked to them about what they had had to eat, and how they had beenï»¿(cont.) treated. They simply told horror stories. One of the teenagers told us about the way in which some of the guards had tried to come into the area during the night where the teenage girls were, and how they all huddled themselves up so that if an effort was made to attack any, they could all fight back as a group, and the way in which some of them would stay awake and watch, while the others slept, and then they would take turns doing that. There was a kind of bravery about these children, and a kind of determination, you know, that was remarkable. I remember one little boy who was very articulate. He had a whole lot to say about all the different kinds of things that happened. And after our conversations with these children and with the parents, and after we had heard all their stories, so much that was bad had been said that I looked at this little boy and I said, "You know, you talk about all the people here as if they were so terrible. Don't you think there are some good white people in Selma?" And in a kind of flush he stopped talking. After a while he came back and said, "Well, there must be some." But the way he said it made you know that he had never heard of them, and he questioned seriously that they were there. I think that you and Shirley Smith from your experience would know that with the whites that you were seeing on the other side of town, that they were... There were very few. They were terrified, and they didn't understand the situation; they didn't know how to break through the situation. There was no organization of the white women at all. There probably were more than the few we saw, but they didn't know how to get to each other. They didn't dare talk to each other. Both sides were closed camps. And within the white community there was probably less talking than in the black community, where it was being done to them. But there was great fear in the black community, too. You remember the mothers of the black children, who if they went to ask where their children were, were threatened. They were not only threatened, but they were immediately accused of contributing to the delinquency of minors. And if they were found driving children who were not their own in any kind of car, they were given this charge- The children told the story of what it meant to them, that no matter where they were going, they had to walk, because aside from their own parents, any other adults were either arrested or molested in some way, as contributing to their delinquency. That's what happened the night of the rally. There were so many teenagers on the porchâI don't want to jump too far aheadâbut we found out later that they were gathered there because nobody would take them [home]. They had to figure out some way of getting home. And they really felt that they had to walk in a body. One of the unforgettable pictures for me, on that night of the rally, was the scene as we came from the Baptist church, and there were all these yellow hats...ï»¿139 PC: Helmets. DH: Helmets, yes. They were police and auxiliary police. So there was a way in which the police department augmented itselfÂ» PC: DH: There were troopers. There was the regular police and there were state troopers. DH: That's right. And Bull Connor, chief of police, simply designated anyone he desired as an auxiliary policeman, and anyone seeing this would have thought it was an armed camp, because you had all these police who had surrounded the whole place. And many of the teenage young men, when the time came to leave the church, were afraid to go out on their own. You remember, they waited until some adult came. And then they would latch onto that person, as if they were their son or daughter, to walk out of the church. Otherwise they would have been picked up again. PC: Do you remember also how many more women than men there were in that church? Is that characteristic? DH: Yes, that's pretty characteristic of the whole civil rights movement. And I think several things influenced that* One is that the vulnerability of the black male, in many of those communities, was something that added to the fear in the black community. It was interesting to me that when you could see an audience, like the one that we had there, that you had predominantly women and children in the audience, and predominantly male leadership on the platform. That's kind of the way the whole thing went. pC: I think we ought to say that that rally was for the Freedom to Vote Day. They were going to try to register to vote the next day, and the SNCC organizers had hoped for, and had gotten, a tremendous reception in that church. Not that I think many people registered the next day, but the crowd was enormous. DH: Part of the reason that many hadn't registered in Dallas County was that the experience this group found was that they had lines that went around the block, but that those who were handling the voting registration would only take one person, and keep that one person an hour or so, and then they would take anotherÂ» Then they would close for lunch. Then they would consider another. Then they would close until the next day. In the meantime, all these people were aware that employers and others of the power structure would either ride or walk down the street and go by the line to see who was on the line. ^C: And take pictures. They took pictures of them. None of them knew why their pictures were being taken, but that was a very threatening thing to do< DH: Their pictures were taken. In addition to that, a number of them lost theirï»¿140 DH: (cont.) jobs. Remember all the women who worked in one of the hospitals.. PC: Yes. DH: Every one of them who was found out there working for voter registra- tion lost her job. And those women were employees of many years. But the whole... pC: I think they not only lost their jobs but they had cattle prods [used on them]. Â°H: That's right. The whole climate was one of intimidation, and an effort was made to frighten them, so they would stay away from the registration lines. PC: That was the entire thrust of the SNCC movement. They weren't interested in integrating anything, only in voting. DH: Oh no, this was voting, and I remember...you may remember too, in Mrs. Boynton's kitchen*.. PC: No, I wasn't allowed in there. DH: Oh, that's right. PC: We were divided, black and white, DH: That's right. Well, that evening, when we got to Mrs. Boynton's home, the children who were carrying major responsibility came in, and I remember one girl who was about fifteen, and she said she was having trouble at home because her mother couldn't understand what in the world she was doing. She said she felt that her mother was worried lest she and all these boys were just out having a good time. And she said, in a very proper way, "What do you do when you're really trying to say to your mother that you are working so that she won't need to be so fearful? That if she could get herself registered, and if she were a part of the electorate in the community, she would not need to be so fearful?" She said that this baffled her, that this was what she was concerned about. And she told about how many miles per day she was walking. I sat in with what you might call the little executive committee of the voter registration group. pC: I didn't know any of this. Â°H: They were all teenagers, and they outlined their whole strategy* They knew that they were being picked up any time after about 8:30 in the morning, so that what they did was that they made lists of people, and they decided on who could get to whom, and they would call the people up at night and say, "I will be at your house tomorrow morning at six o'clock." And so by about 7:30 in the morning, their work was done, because what they discovered was that the authorities came out to look for them around eight o'clock. And so they had a wholeï»¿141 DH: (cont.) strategy of how to talk to people, and what they would explain to them, and how they would try to build in those people some determination to stand on the line. They said that many of the people would have registered, but what worried them was this standing on the line and having your picture taken, and then the line never moving, so that it took simply days and days and days to register. PC: They also gave them a terrible form to fill out, an impossible form. DH: An impossible form... pC: If you were a Ph.D. you couldn't necessarily fill it out correctly, because they would turn that question another way round. DH: And all kinds of questions for people to answer, and these young people were sitting down with people and helping them to answer questions and to be prepared. Another thing that came out in the discussion in Mrs. Boynton's home was the fact that the teenagers were being harassed by the police, and no matter what they didâthey could simply be walking down the street, and a police car would come up and say to them, "Get in here." They would take them down and search them. That in itself, you know, frightened some. But the good thing was that they saw that their role was to do something their parents couldn't do, that the parents could not have gotten out there in the same way. And they said people would come to them from the authorities and say to them, "Whose child are you?" And they would give some kind of name, not their right name. They would do all sorts of things to avoid having their parents punished. PC: Well, I'm sure you learned a great deal more in Mrs. Boynton's kitchen than we ever learned with the two ladies we met with. As you know, for us that was a disaster, because the Sunday after the four of us had been in Selma, Alabama, the newspapers came out with a story that we were at the rallyâand it was all right that Dorothy Height and Dorothy Ferebee were at the rally, but Shirley Smith, unidentified but a white woman, and Polly Cowan, identified as a woman from New Yorkâthis was reported in the papers. Remember, we saw the press. We should have known that something disastrous was going to happen, only this was the first time I had been in such a situation, and Shirley didn't give her name but she was a white woman. We were the only two. So that everything that we tried to build up to get a meeting between the white side and the black side of town with Mrs. Tilly dissolved in the newspaper account, because they read in the paper that those two white women had been on the black side of town at a rally. DH: Yes. Then you know, that as we had left town very early that morning, that we left before nine o'clock, the police went to Mrs. Boynton and served a summons for me and Dorothy Ferebee, saying that we had contributed to the delinquency of minors. And so, to my knowledge, that summons must still be out, because I never answered it, and James Forman alerted me to it, as did Amelia Boynton.ï»¿142 PC: Well, it can't be served in any place but Selma, Alabama. DH: That's right. PC: However, if we hadn't left town early, I wonder what would have happened? It was a very dangerous situation. DH: Very dangerous. Yes. PC: Now, as a result of that, let's evaluate our trip. I think we can do it by talking about the next thing that happened. To my knowledge, that was the meeting, the Off the Record* meeting in Atlanta, that you... the National Council of Negro Women and the YWCA, the National Council of Jewish Women, Catholic Womenâis that about it? Â°H: And Church Women United. ...Church Women United held. I think the very fact that you were able to get this together evaluat es the trip itself, because it grew out of that [Selma] trip, so maybe we should talk about the Off the Record meeting. DH: PC Yes, and I think we want to take into account that Dorothy Tilly moved in right behind us on her own, and made an effort to reach some of the women in the white community, and found it just immensely difficult. Because the newspapers had reported us. DH: That's right. And the white women wouldn't talk to Dorothy Tilly. ^H: They would not speak with her at all. This was true even of the church women. And they gave every excuse, and they said that it was really a threat to their lives to meet with her. But the good thing was that she went, so that there was that kind of testing, you see, that she could do. Now, after thatâwell, even before that, we had had the meeting, and had discussed the fact that what was needed was to put together a coalition of women's groups who could try to see that there was a protest, but also some kind of action program, on behalf of women and children and youth who were caught up in these jails for civil rights activities. And so we met in New York and decided that what was needed was to have a meeting in the South, to bring together representatives from some of the highest tension points. Southern cities. Southern cities: Savannah, Georgia; and Albany, Georgia; Montgomery, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi; and Charleston, South Carolina; Atlanta itself. Let me see, there was another, I think Danville, * Off the Record is the name of the group.ï»¿143 (cont.) Virginia. What we were aiming to do was to get a representative group who would hear firsthand from some of the young women and then project some way of working together. I remember that when we were organizing ourselves, we didn't call ourselves anything. But Ethlyn Christensen of the National Board of the YWCA said to me, when we were getting ready to leave for Atlanta, and we were going to meet in the Americana Hotel there, she said, "You know, we will have to have some kind of name to put up on the bulletin board, of what this meeting is. We cannot say, a coalition of women's groups related to -what is happening to young women and children and all that, we cannot do that." So we decided to call it Women's Inter-Organizational Committee, the initials of which would be WIC, and because there was nothing else like it on the bulletin board, the women found their way to this meeting. I remember that in some of our discussions that we were finding that people were so interested in what was going on, and [suddenly] someone flashed a camera and started to take pictures. And that really started a riot. That started something. That's one of the reasons we knew we could never take cameras into the South [when we went to Mississippi]. Yes, and one of the Jewish women just about had a stroke. She said, "Well, I'll never be able to come back to Montgomery if you take pictures." And she was so nervous. At a later moment, I talked with her, and she said that she didn't know what to do, that she had come partly because her mother lived in Atlanta, and because of the fact that she was interested in seeing what could be done. I recall that at one point she told me she had been out to visit her mother, and she told her mother that she just didn't know what she could say when she went back, about where she had been and why she had been in Atlanta. She said, "You know, I never thought of my mother particularly as a liberal," but she said, "My mother said to me, 'You tell them that you came to Atlanta to visit your mother.'" She said that just lifted a whole thing over her head, and she could listen better. Because before that she kept wondering, why did she ever consent to leave Montgomery, Alabama, to come to [such a meeting]. That was a meeting that frightened them, frightened all the women in the South, black women as well as white women. And then, remember, we had an evening's discussion, where we had some of the young women who had been in the jails, Joyce Barrett, and the Christian child was one who was then seventeen years old, and she had been in jail eleven times. She was from Albany, Georgia. And then there were some students from Spelman College who came to tell about what they were doing as students in Atlanta, and the strategies they were using trying to open up restaurants, department stores and other things in Atlanta... Atlanta, which prided itself as already having opened and we discovered it was not opened. That was pretense. That's all.ï»¿144 DH: And there'd been great publicity given to the few little breakthrough points, but there wasn't that much at that time. The thing that happened was thatâI remember on the last day, I was asked to chair the discussion, and suggested that all of the groups meet by their communities, so that it was the black and the white women from Charleston, South Carolina, and the black and the white women from Jackson, Mississippi, and all around it went. They were to answer the question as to whether or not it was, as many were saying it was, a handicap to be related to a national organization. And I asked them to tell us honestly whether it was a help or a hindrance to be related to a national body at that time. Several things came out of all of the discussions. One, they were so thrilled to get to know each other, and place after place they said, "Well, I didn't know there were white women thinking like this," or "I did not know there were black women thinking like this." "We didn't know..." pC: They didn't know there were black women who had the education, or who had the grace that those women had. DH: That's right. And they said, "We did not know that each other was in the community. We will now maintain our contact with each other." It was a group from Jackson, Mississippi, where Clarie Harvey in reporting said, "Yes, indeed, it is a value to us to be part of a national organization, because we have discovered here... PC: she was from Church Women United, then called United Church Women. DH: She said, "All of us come from Jackson. All of us have been working with the Freedom Riders or with different kinds of things in our community. But none of us knew that the other was there. So we're going to stick together." But in addition, she said, "We want you to know that we need to be part of a national organization, because you can operate like a long-handled spoon, and you can stir us up, just like you have brought us together." So they all expressed appreciation for that. There was a kind of vitality in the discussion, as each group reported on what it saw itself doing, both as individuals and as groups, when they went back into their communities, and what kinds of help they thought the national bodies could give. This was kind of repeated again and again. Then, when we got to the conclusion of it all, there was a feeling of solidarity in the group, and the whole climate of fear that had prevailed and the cautiousness of the early hours had disappeared. There were still people who were worried about how they would be received back home and how they would fit in, but there was something new that had happened. pC: How many days did we meet, two? DH: We met, I think it was two or two and a half days, something like that. There was also another very interesting thing, and I don't know who it was, but somebody said, out of that experience, "You know, we may not be able to bring great light back into our situation, and to overcomeï»¿145 DH: (cont.) these things, but just like a candle had a wick, and it gives a little light, each one of us can be a wick." And they picked up that idea of the Women's Inter-Organizational Committee and called it WIC. And it was out of that meeting and that coalitionâwhen the poverty program was initiated, and the Women's Job Corps was set upâthe task force that Sargent Shriver had appointed, that was working on Women's Job Corps, the task force recommended that in order to get a wide diversity of young women into the Job Corps, the same coalition be asked to do it. And then, immediately, we were stuck with the question of what to call it, once we had gotten over some of the blocks, like, for example, the churchwomen---who were then a part of the National Council of Churchesâhad to be assured that any government contract to recruit young women for the Job Corps did not violate the principle of separation of church and state. And so that involved a whole piece that had to be done. The National Board of the YWCA felt that it could not continue with this, so they did not do so. But the rest of the group stayed together, and when it was finally determined that the groups would take a federal contract to recruit young women for the Job Corps, the question of what to call it came up. But by that time, there was across the South a sense of the way the WICs who had been at the prior meeting at Atlanta had gone back into their communities and had begun to work. And so it was felt that there was something about holding onto that idea of being a wick that was very important. It got to be called WICS. pC: It's still called WICS. DH: Well, it's still called WICS because, when we were trying to think of a name, Helen Rachlin said, "Well, if you're going to want to..." PC: she was then with the National Council of Jewish Women. Â°H: She was then with the National Council of Jewish Women, and she said, "If you really want to hold onto it, you could say Women in Community Service, and that would give you the same initials, WICS." In reality that's how the coalition, minus the National Board of the YWCA, named itself. PC: National Council of Negro Women, National Council of Catholic Women, National Council of Jewish Women, Church Women United... DH: And the National Council of Negro Women, those were the organizations that became the parent body for WICS. And Pearl, who was then the president of the National Council of Jewish Women... PC: DH: Pearl Willen. Pearl Willen really kept saying, "We have to build on that experience in Atlanta, and now take some positive steps. So that it's very interesting, this year WICS will celebrate ten years of working withï»¿146 DH: (cont.) young women in poverty, and with helping them to get to Job Corps and developing supportive services when they return home. PC: DH: DH: DH: So if nothing else came out of the Off the Record (or WIC) meeting in Atlanta, WICS came out of it, and that's enormous... DH: Yes, it's a kind of coalition of women of different races and faiths working together. In recent years, the group, the original charter member organizations, has been augmented with the addition of the two Mexican-American groups, the GI Forum Auxiliary and the League of Latin-American Citizens, and these two groups have become a working part of the whole coalition. Well, I'm not saying that it's the only thing that came out of that Atlanta meeting anyway. Probably some things we don't even know, in various cities, came out of it, and we do know thatâat least I believe thatâthe Wednesdays in Mississippi Project came out of the Atlanta meeting. Oh, sure. What you think and what I think might be different. I think you ought to talk about why you quickly accepted the idea of Wednesdays in Mississippi, and then spun on and on, used your imagination and made it become a reality. Well, if we can go back.. PC: Yes, let's go back. DH: ...to the summer of 1964, you'll remember that Bob Moses and a group of SNCC young people had conceived the idea that since there was such resistance in the South, and Mississippi was one of the strongholds of resistance, that it would be very good to do a demonstration program of a Freedom School. PC: Bob Moses was attached to SNCC, wasn't he? Yes. So he decided that they would set up a thing called the Freedom Schools in the state of Mississippi, known as the Great Mississippi Project. Julian Bond was working in the Atlanta office of this. They recruited young people from most of the northern colleges, with the idea that they would go into the South and contribute their services in these Freedom Schools, that they would live in the community, that they would relate to the people, and that they would help these children not only to get their ABC's but also get a sense of their rights and that kind of thing. Well, you may recall that for some unknown reason, a reason I can't remember, you went to Europe with Lou Cowan on one of his major projects. While you were there you wrote me a letter saying that maybe, since people in the South were saying these were all young Communists coming down there, and they were all rabble-rousers andï»¿147 DH: (cont.) they were all there for destructive purposesâthere were all kinds of threats to their livesâand your suggestion was that you had an idea that perhaps if what you called "the Cadillac crowd," some women who had such standing in the community, who would be interested in the young people who were there, could team up...go down, say, for one day a week, say Wednesdays, to spend that day in Mississippi, seeing what was happening, and sharing some of their thoughts and ideas and program activities, to help enrich the school programâthis would be a valuable thing. Well, the thing that appealed to me was that it meant that you had children who were going to be in there, but that there were other people who had young people in their families who were going to be in there, and that if we could get some kind of a linkage to these young people, that this would be a way of building some bridges of understanding. If we could locate some of the white womenâand the reason I think it appealed to me was that I remembered the reaction of those women in Atlanta who said, "Well, we need somebody to come in and bring us together, as well as to stir us up." PC: No, Jackson. OH: Jackson. What did I say? pC: You said Atlanta.. DH: Well, the meeting was in Atlanta, but it was the women,... pC: ...women in Jackson who gave us a good break.. DH: Therefore, we already had a contact. We already had women who had said to us, "Come in." And it seemed to me that since we could build upon that, and now take up those womenâJane Schutt and Clarie Harvey and others who were thereâif we could pick up with them, this was a follow-up on what they had told us, and that we were not therefore imposing. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: We had been invited, really. We were invited. We were accepting their invitation. And that, to me, was a very good thing. And as you recall, you said that if we could do it, you would try to get some way to help us support it, and that we would initiate this idea, and we set out to try to see what could make it come true. I remember that when you came back, we called upon Shirley Smith to come up, and we began to work, and they too knew what was involved. If I'd known then what I know today, I never would have had the courage to go on. That's right. So much was involved.ï»¿148 DH: It seemed so simple. And yet we knew the danger, and we knew the risk that was involved. But I think the other thing that we cannot overlook was that we knew we already had some linkages with women who wanted to see some change in their communities, and who would need the impetus that such a group could give. So we went through the whole process of designing and redesigning. I don't think any president ever had more drafts of a speech than we had of how this thing was to proceed. PC: And every single piece of paper was written and rewritten. DH: That's right. PC: And written again. And we had to find staff people who were willing to go in. Staff people, black and white. DH PC DH: Black and white. And we were fortunate in that Susan Goodwillie, who was working with Shirley Smith, was also working part time with the National Council of Negro Women. So as a young white woman, she had already some sense of how you operate on both sides of the railroad tracks or the community. PC: And connections with people that were very valuable. ^H: Right. And then we found... PC: ...you found, Dorothy... Â°H: Doris Wilson who had been a staff member for the YWCA and was studying, and she was in between finishing her studying and going on to a job, and she was interested in working for the summer. We then found Ann Hewitt, a Mississippi white woman who... pC: While in March, Shirley and I went back to Mississippi and found some more, some twelve women, black and white, who were led by Clarie Harvey, but they became leaders on their own, and that was when we found Ann Hewitt, who was very eager to help. She had not come to Atlanta for some peculiar reason, but she was more than eager. Then she became sort of the anchor person, in the white community. PC: DH: PC: DH: She's the one who rented the apartment, or we never would have gotten an apartment rented for someone from the North. Yes, she rented an apartment in Magnolia Towers for the two white staff to live in. And then we had the help of Mrs. Sanders, who was owner of a small shop in Jackson... ...black woman... A black woman, and, as well as Clarie Harvey, in trying to locate a placeï»¿149 (cont.) where the black staff could live. It was very interesting, you see, because even then, the black community was more unified than the white community. Maybe that's a very important factor in presenting a model for change. All the way through, the staff person was in a home, and every one of the black women who went South, went to Jackson in 1964 to 1965, was housed, and almost always in a gracious helpful manner. The white women were housed in hotels and motels because no one dared to house them, until the last team in 1964. Yes, no one wanted to be identified with it, because they didn't want to be associated with so-called troublemakers. I remember that first day that we went there, and as we got down there, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had just gone into operation. Yet, you recall, when we got to the airport, those of you who were white had to go one way, and those of us who were black had to go another way, and then later, as we went from Jackson to Hattiesburg, we could hear walkie-talkies... We went in separate cars. We went in separate cars, but we could still hear the walkie-talkies saying, "Follow that white Chevrolet. Now they're turning," you know, giving instructions. So the police were on our trail everywhere. Always. And of course, that first night that we were there, Dr. King was having a rally, and after the rally, Marian Logan and I with Clarie Harveyâ we'd had no dinnerâand Clarie Harvey tried to get us food at the Sun and Sand, a restaurant in a motel there. And when we got there... After we were seated, we noticed that the hostess was very cool to us, but Clarie Harvey reminded us that the Civil Rights Act had passed and that this was strictly legal. I remember that the owner came a while later and said, "What are you girls doing here? Where are you from? You must be from out of town." And Clarie Harvey was the first one to speak. She said, "Jackson, Mississippi." He said, "Well, then if you're from Jackson, you must know how dangerous it is for you to be in here. You know that your people are not supposed to be coming in here." And we watched and saw that one by one as people left the dining room, no one else was entering, but that there were some rather strange-looking white men in some kind of uniform who were beginning to close in around us. When Marian Logan asked the hostess for some matches to light her cigarette, she said, "If you want them, you go over to the counter and get them." We ordered our meal. Marian had ordered fruit salad. I thought you ordered the fruit salad. Well, I think maybe both of us ordered fruit salad. Meanwhile, we looked up and we saw all of the black help from the kitchen looking through the... Suddenly it occurred to us that it had been the agree-ï»¿150 (cont.) ment of our Wednesdays that we would not go anywhere without keeping each other informed and without letting John Dohr... PC: You wrote these rules, and then you paid no attention. DH: Those rules suddenly came to life for us as we sat there and saw all the things that were strangely happening around us. So then, Clarie went to the phone and she called in, so that it would be known where we were. PC: Oh, is that why she went to the phone. I knew she went, I didn't know why...to her "checkpoint." DH: Well, we just thought it was important for somebody to know where we were, particularly with the management acting as it was, and with the fact that by this time, we were the only people waiting for food in the dining room. The others were just sitting around as if watching us. Then we noticed that some of the black help began to move through the dining room, sort of emptying ash trays that had been emptied and doing kind of odd things. And then, our salads were served. Needless to say, these were the largest, most luscious fruit salads I think ever made, because it was almost as if they put every piece of fruit they could find on these plates. pC: Probably did. But we nibbled at it, and really felt that what we had better do before the time got too late was get out of there. You'd already been there quite a while. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: We'd been there quite a while, long enough for all kinds of strange-looking men with peculiar badges and one thing and another to appear. As we were leaving, and paid our checks, one of the men who was standing at the cash register said, "Well, you know that you're not supposed to be in here." Was he an employee of the motel? No, he was one of the strange-looking men who was some kind of a sheriff or something. But we said nothing. We paid our check. But as we walked out, what we saw was that all of the black help at the motel had lined up, and they had formed a kind of assembly line that we had to walk past as we went to Clarie Harvey's parked car. And when we were moving on and moving toward the parking lot, one of these young men walked up, and he said, "Well, I just want you all to know that if they bother any of our women here tonight, they will never forget it." I never knew about that. He said, "We want you to know that they know that we are watching them, and we heard what they were saying and what they plan to do, but we want you to know, it's not going to happen here." And then we went on and got into Clarie's car. Needless to say, that was the longestï»¿151 DH: (cont.) distance we had ever traveled. PC: Were you and Marian staying with Clarie? DH: Yes. And so it really meant for us that we were just uneasy the whole distance. PC: Well, almost all the rides were uneasy the whole summer. DH: Yes, but the thing I thought was significant was that all these black porters and kitchen help and all stood out there, and not a soul said another word to us. But it was a very frightening kind of moment. Clarie Harvey had felt that because one or two of the hotels there had shown a little different attitude earlier in the day, that the same thing would be so here at Sun and Sand, but it was not so. PC: It happened after a while. DH: After a while, yes. PC: Resistance was very high. Then the next day when we were in Hattiesburg, we had a little flurry also, that I never understood. We were all together at that point. DH: Yes, you remember we went into this church, and we were observing the Freedom School, and suddenly we heard this peculiar sound in the vestibule. Someone noted that there had been a Molotov cocktail thrown into the vestibule of the church, but somehow or other, it fizzled and wasn't able to do its dirty work. When that was discovered, I think one of the most exciting experiences was that a young white fellow from Oberlin went to the pipe organ and began to play the "Hallelujah Chorus," and everybody burst into song. It was like suddenly lifting all this that could have been fearful and dreadful off everyone, and getting a sense of solidarity among all the people working there. See, because what you had wasâwhat we discovered was a high quality of really dedicated young people, black and white, who were in there working. They were very different from the authorities who were kind of following you around in the place...the sheriff and the state troopersâthey were very different from them, and very different from some of the people in the community who were doing different things to harass the workers in the school. You may recall that that evening we met and talked with a young man, young white fellow, who had been there working, setting up the school and trying to get things moving. He was a young minister, and he was in deep trouble because it seems that he had sent a check to the bank and it came back marked "insufficient funds." Instead of giving him the opportunity that banks usually would give for a person to make that check good, they had taken this on as a criminal offense, and they were really harassing him about it. Now, this was a kind of a pattern, so that a parking ticket or a check, even though it might have been aâyou know, the deposit might have overlapped, or there could have been any number of possibilities. Despite that fact, immediately the person was accusedâand all this surveillance...ï»¿152 PC: You remember, even the stop signs in Mississippi were backward. If you stopped at the stop sign, you could be arrested as much as if you didn't stop, because if you were a Mississippian you knew that you weren't supposed to stop at that stop sign. They were put up for people who didn't know any better. DH: Yes, and they were not the regular traffic signs. They were just signs that people painted with a brush, that said STOP. PC: And if you had a rented car, which we did, and so did most of the rights workers, you were observed immediately. You were from out of town, and so you were a dangerous person. DH: Yes. PC: There were hundreds of ways that they invented, very clever ways of inventing harassment that were very hard to override. But we can't talkâoh, we could go on and on and on, because every woman had experiences, but it's most interesting to talk about Miss Height's experienceâand to actually know whether you thought that summer of 1964 with forty-some women going in under the banner of the National Council of Negro Women, with the cooperation of some other organizationsâwas of equal value to the southern women as to the northern women, those of us who came in, and those we saw? DH: Well, I think, without a doubt, I rememberâI wasn't thereâbut I remember the white staff reporting a meeting in Jackson, that they held during one of our business sessions, in which they found young mothers who were out of the white community, who were saying that they would not give up the chance to be at this meeting, but they also had to get home before their husbands got home from work because they couldn't take a chance on risking their marriage. Yet those same women were saying that they felt that they did not want to rear their children in the kind of climate that was then prevailing. So that we have never really documented all the ways in which, in different parts of the community, people got new hope and a new sense of support, and, you know, a new willingness to try to see what they could do. I think that the fact that blacks in the community began to sense that there were whites in the community who were concerned and who were willing to work was a very important thing. I remember the time that we were holding one meeting, and Mrs. Sanders talked about what she had done during the Freedom Rides to provide... ^C: This was part of Womanpower Unlimited. DH: Yes, part of Womanpower Unlimited...and what she had done to provide food and to get a house that was vacant. She had that house set up so that people coming in with the Freedom Rides would have a place to stay, only to discover that some of the white women could say, "We couldn't do anything, but I sent some sheets," or "I contributed towels. I did different things like that." And their sort of matching up ways in which from their different vantage points, they had been trying to do something. This was in itself another way of sort ofï»¿153 DH: (cont.) building community linkages, strength. PC: Through those summers, I think the Human Rights Commission and the variousâI've forgotten the names of the organizations that began to grow upâhad black people and white people on them. So that by the end of 1965, I think there was a lot of desegregation of organizations and commissions. I don't know about the men, but I do know about the women. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: The women were more identified with it than the men. But in addition, I think that the climate has to be assessed. It all sounds very simple now, but the fact that every step that people took was watched. And you remember how, when we were preparing the staff to go down, we had to role play. You did that, and it was marvelous. ...how they would answer people who said, "What are you doing down here for the summmer?" We couldn't very well say, "I'm here with Wednesdays in Mississippi and trying to bring about..." And paid by the National Council of Negro Women. It was all that sort of thing. I've forgotten what they came up with. There were historians or anthropologists... We also said that one of them could say that she was developing a cookbook and collecting southern recipes, because that was a kind of... Lou [Cowan] said they could work for Chilmark Press. So they were doing it for Chilmark Press- And the thing that you have to realize is, that was a time when a nonconsequential identification was more important than one that was dealing with real problems. You see? I don't mean that cookbooks are nonconsequential. But in comparison... But in comparison, you had to have something that, if need be, was unquestioned, and that would just make small talk. I think another value in the Wednesdays experience was that people who went had skills that they could offer. You know, like Augusta Baker and her... That was 1965. ...and her coworkers who later went, working with children's literature and that sort of thing. But in the '64 period, the fact that people listened and looked and were able to come back and go into their own communities, whether it was in Minnesota, New York, or whatever state, and they were able there to share something of what they had seen... And a great deal of material was sent down that the Freedom Schools needed, also brought in by the women and then later, more material wasï»¿(cont.) sent, books were sent, paper was sent..,. Records, and pencils, and things that they needed to enhance their work. And then many women went out and explained, as you say, either to a large, set audience or to groups of friends, about what really was going on down in Mississippi. It was a little bit difficult even in the North to untangle the story. Also, it was easier to get Bull Connor's story over, or Governor Wallace, or something of that sortâthe kind of thing they were doing at that timeâthan it was to communicate to people in northern communities these little strands of people trying to bring about change and trying to work for change. I think one of the by-products, of that period was that many of those women went back to their communities and said, "You know, I went down there to see what was happening, but I came back here to find that not much is happening." You know, the same Supreme Court decision had affected the North. The same Civil Rights Act we were all working on affected the North. But there was very little that was happening. And it was the way in which those women were able to share that experience and to talk about it, and get their stories across... And they said that they began to look at the racial factors there, and see what was happening. I think that was all of great value, too. These had small but important influences. Now in 1965, the National Council of Negro Women once again sponsored Wednesdays in Mississippi, and that summer, part of our emphasis was on the Institute for the Desegregation of Schools, at the University of Mississippi. And you were the first black lecturer who went to the University of Mississippi. Have you any recollections of that particular moment in your life? Yes, I remember Kate Wilkinson on the faculty ithere calling me and saying that they had received a grant from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Office of Education, that provided for the preparation of teachers and school administrators for how they would handle a situation if they began to desegregate their classrooms and their schools. And she and Dr. Roscoe Boyer, who was heading the education department there, very much wanted the first class that was held to be successful, and from our prior association in the YWCA workâ she'd been a part of the training program I directedâshe was eager to have me come down and do those first classes. Well, no sooner had I agreed that I would go than they were confronted by another thing, which was that not only the faculty had to be of mixed racial background, but also the student body, because it was a federal grant. And lo and behold, they were getting white teachers and white supervisors and superintendents, but no blacks. Actually, theï»¿155 (cont.) blacks were afraid to go. Finally, they persuaded the principal of a black school at Oxford and his wife, and they in turn persuaded one or two others to come to the course. The seventy-five dollars a day that was being paid to the teachers and principals who were coming was a real carrot, because considering the level of lots of their pay, this was really big money. And it was clear that without the payânot only was it that they couldn't afford it, but they wouldn't have bothered to make it a point. I guess Roscoe Boyer knew that when he built in the pay. That's right. It was a two-week institute, wasn't it? It was a two-weeV institute. So they got quite a bit. I was there for the first three days, and my job was to help them to understand the Civil Rights Act, the civil rights movement, and the way in which the schools were part of the whole effort toward civil rights. When I went in there to stay at the faculty club, there was real fear as to what was going to happen. No black had ever stayed at the faculty club. No black had ever stayed there. And Ann Hewitt had made a plan for having supper at the residence of one of the oldest citizens of Oxford, and she had come down from Oxford [Mississippi] bringing with her... She'd come from Jackson. From Jackson, bringing with her all the makings of a hot tamale pie and other ingredients for supper, so that she could have a dinner party for the faculty to meet me, after the first day. An arrangement was made for someone to stay in the faculty house near where I was, so that in case there was anything that happened, we would be well covered It was very interesting because, shortly after I arrived, there was a kind of climate that let you not fail to remember that this was the place where Meredith had gone through such a battleâJames Meredith. And where there'd been real bloodshed on the campus. As a matter of fact, Dr. Boyer himself showed me in the cement, where the footprints in blood had been. Some of the newspaper reporters, among others, had been killed, that awful night of Meredith's entry into the school. So as soon as I got in the next morning, Dr. Boyer received a call, questioning my presence and how I got there. But the word came back very promptly that the chancellor had approved it, and it wasâyou know like a miracle. From then on, no one said anything. But that morning earlier, when I'd gone down to breakfast, there was a kind of strange uneasiness around everything.ï»¿156 DH: (cont.) I think the thing that stood out for me was the realization that here were people in the field of education who, when I showed them the report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and what it had to say about the desegregation of the schools, felt that this was a Communist document. They simply could not believe that in the United States of America there was anybody talking in the terms that these people were. I had some consultative sessions, after the class discussions, and I remember a teacher from Holly Springs expressing to me her fear of having children in her classroom who were black and white, because she felt that the white children would all get syphilis from being in the classroom with the blacks. And 1*11 never forget the look on her face when I asked her what age group she was dealing with, and she said, "the second grade." Then I told her that maybe she had forgotten how syphilis is passed on from one person to the other, and therefore I didn't think this could be a problem with second-grade children. It was the strangest thing, because it was very clear to me she had not the slightest idea of what I was talking about, because she kept saying, "But they all go and sit on the same toilet seats." PC: The old way, the old thought. DH: That's right. And so, I then found myself giving an elementary lecture in health education, and sex education, and the nature of venereal disease, to try to get her to see the fallacy of her argument. Well, I think eventually she got the point, but it was not easy. But the thing that I think was interesting was, that I got a letter from this very same woman later. After three days, some of them began to internalize what it was all about. But it was like the first time in their lives they had ever heard anyone in a non â I can't say threatening, because they all felt threatened, despite whatever reference I made, but in a nonbelligerent way, talk about the whole thing. And there were some very strong people in the group, some very good people. I remember breakfast that Dr. Boyer arranged with me to meet the superintendents of schools. This in itself, you see, was a whole educational process, for those top men in education to have breakfast with me, when many of them in their whole lives, I'm sure, had never sat at a table to eat breakfast with a black person. PC: No, I don't imagine there was a chance till you came along. And so, when we were with them, I remember the superintendent from Natchez saying that he really had some real problems with this whole question of desegregation of the schools. And he said, "If you ask me what I'm going to do when I go back, I'm not going to do anything. I'm going to leave things as they are. But," he added, "I chose the best teachers and the best principals that I had, and brought them to this course. And I have a feeling that they will begin things, and eventually I'll be able to say to the board of education, 'Well, you see, this is what people want.' When that time comes, 1*11 be ready and I'll have the people ready to support it."ï»¿157 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) In other words, there was a way in which, just as some people were trying to think of how to block desegregation, there were some others in the white community thinking of strategies that might sustain the action. There was one superintendent from a school, a place that I don't remember now, who outlined all the things that they had done already, so there were some who had really advanced, and they had been preparing to come to this point. I think too, you stretched them so much in that first visit that as more black people went in to talk to them at the institute, their ears were opened. They were able to hear, and as you talked about Augusta Baker, who went in and talked to them about school libraries, and Ellen Terry went to talk to them about story telling. I can't remember who all went to the institute, but... Yes, but you see, actually, it was very clear that the pattern of racial segregation in the South has handicapped the black community, but it has also handicapped the white community. I knew Dr. Katharine Rea, who was the dean of women there at University of Mississippi. She had me meet with the leaders of student organizations, They were very busy getting ready for Miss Homecoming or Miss Mississippi or Miss something else, but they simply couldn't deal with what they would do as black students came on campus. And there were two black women students there who were especially good students, but who were having a rough, rough time. I remember, you talked with them. Yes, I talked with the black students, and then Dr. Rea had those black students and the white students meet together with me. That was probably one of the first times that they had sat down and had begun to think that in their plans for freshman orientation, they should have something that dealt with how you welcome newcomers, and how you especially welcome newcomers when they are of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. And it was like opening up a whole new vista for people to think about that kind of thing. The employment pattern that I found in the university was that even with the Neighborhood Youth Corps and poverty programs, that the people there were resisting and would not have any of those young people because they were to be paid $1.20 an hour, and the university was paying fifty, sixty cents an hour. So you see, everybody was in a depressed economic situation. One day, in a discussion, I was illustrating something about teachers and salaries, and Dr. Boyer asked me to pick it up the next day and carry it through, because these people, largely from the white community, were earning like five and six thousand dollars a year, and they were teachers. When I drew some illustration about teachers' salaries and the way in which people were working to equalize them, the things that have come about, some of them kept saying, "Why, nobody could earn eight or nine thousand dollars a year; that's impossible."ï»¿158 (cont.) And so Dr. Boyer said, "Well, you need to help them understand that, because then they begin to understand that in the state of Mississippi and in the rest of the South, both the state and the locality are too poor to maintain the two school systems. So that all of them come out with lessâso they're all at the bottom of the economic ladder in the whole educational system. And if they ever saw the point of having a unified school system, then they could all have a decent salary. This was not just that we were discussing civil rights, but we were discussing some of the common issues that affect education, and the way in which they had to look at the separate school systems as an economic issue, and look at their tax base in a realistic way. And many of them began to say, "Well, we will never have anything if we keep going like this. We've got to do more, to have better books and so forth." PC: DH: PC DH PC DH PC: DH: And I did some training with them on how to work with their colleagues and others back home, so that they began to get some sense that it wasn't just that they had come to this course, but that they had a mission, when they went back, and how they could look at that. But you know, it was no different from saying, if you had gone off to a meeting of the National Education Association on curricular development, and you were the representative of your school, how then do you go back to your school and share what you have learned with the other people? And a part of what I was trying to do there was to get them not to see this as some great controversial issue they had to take back, but that it is the same thing, always, if you are a delegate. How do the people whom you leave at home benefit because you were the delegate? Had they ever been delegates? Did they understand the concept? Well, they in all instances were representatives. They knew that, and Dr. Boyer never let them forget that they were representatives. In addition, they were paid, and they never missed a class. That was really fascinating. And no matter what you called them for, you had a full house. They all came. There were two or three diehards who found it very hard, but others began to take them on, and it was very interesting. Was there a second year of that? I did it for three years. Did it get easier with each year? Or were there problems? Well, as we went on, the problems were clearer. The first year, it was all so theoretical. Do you understand? The first year they had not done anything about the schools, but by the... ...They'd been involved in it. They'd been involved, and they'd had children of different backgroundsï»¿159 DH: (cont.) in the classroom. I did some things...on you understand, difference, how you deal with difference. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Didn't they by that time also work with black teachers, white and black teachers working together in the schools? Yes, and by that time the group had changed, so that you had many more black teachers who were there. But the first year, and really the first two years, Dr. Boyer lost some of his budget because he had space in the men's dormitory for some of the male teachers and space in the women's dormitory for some of the female teachers, but though it was forty or fifty miles, they were afraid to stay and they drove back and forth. They were afraid to stay there. And they kept saying to me when we got together or we ate in the dining room or something, they would say to me, "Well, who's looking out for you? Are you staying? Well, where are you?" They were worried about it. There was no question, they were worried about what was happening, and I reassured them. The second year, they didn't have to have a guard for you, did they? oh no. Even the first year, after the first day or so it eased up. But there was a climate in which the blacks were just plain afraid. They said, "No need of our providing something. We'll be here and something will happen to us and it will be too late," so they drove back and forth. Well, that's the end of that, I think, and I don't want to start you on anotherâas you see, I have a lot of questions including some of the poverty programs, and NCNW programs that grew out of the Wednesdays in Mississippi operation and Operation Daily Bread, but I think that we'd better hold them because you've been talking for a long time. Yes. May 25, 1975. Miss Height's settled down for another discussion about her life. I want to ask you, Dorothy, about the Taconic Foundation once again, and the role played by Stephen Currier in uniting civil rights leadership, and how long the council continued to meet and work together. Well, actually, it was at the time of the assassination of Medgar Evers, as we've said before, that Stephen Currier initiated the bringing together of the civil rights groups to get some support. He held a breakfast, and he got the first financial support, both tax-exempt and non-tax-exempt contributions. Well, then, that posed the whole question because there you had the NAACP, the National Urban League, SNCC, CORE, the National Council of Negro Women, the Legal Defense Fund of the NAACP, and the A. Philip Randolph Institute, as well as the group Eric Lincoln represented, which really had more to do with the terms of the Black Muslims and that sort of thing. Youï»¿160 DH: (cont.) had all of these organizations, but to give assistance or to receive funds, there had to be something new created. And so, the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership was organized, and through it tax exemption was secured, and this became the medium, really, for directing more support to the different groups. It operated with a kind of rotation of leadership, with Roy [Wilkins] serving at a time, with Whitney [Young] for a time, and that sort of thing, so that's the way it was chaired. Several projects were attempted. One was putting together, really promoting the record that had been made at the time of the March on Washington. PC: oh yes. I'd forgotten that. DH: Called We Shall Overcome. ^C: And all the groups sold them. DH: And all the groups sold those records. In fact, that effort had been begun earlier, and the concept of United Civil Rights Leadership was utilized to initiate it. I think the concept of United Civil Rights Leadership really began at the end of '63. PC: Did the council adopt the Equal button or did just a few groups? DH: No. They adopted the Equal button, and sold the Equal buttons, and then were considering several things, like a closed circuit telethon, and the rest, but there was never any real agreement on those. But the meetings of the council continued, and we worked pretty carefully together. When President Johnson, for example, made his famous speech of "We Shall Overcome" at the joint session of the Congress, that was in '65...the groups were brought together... PC: They weren't working together every week? DH: Not every week, but they were working together as an entity and keeping abreast of what was happening, meeting regularly on legislation, and things of that sort. The Voting Rights Act, you know, was a very crucial factor. The March on Selma was really the crucial turning point to achieving the Voting Rights Act in 1965. And as late as the time that Martin Luther King was assassinated, the group was still intact, although the meetings weren't so frequent. But at the time of the assassination, I remember that I was in Aurora, Illinois, but Lee White in the White House called all of us to come to the White House to meet with the president to discuss what could happen. So that in effect, the United Civil Rights Leadership was the mechanism used by the leaders of the civil rights movement, both for making some kind of joint decisions and also as a channel for support. PC: Was Stephen still interested at that point or was he more interested in "America, the Beautiful" with Lady Bird Johnson? DH: Well, Stephen Currier's role in it began to lessen when there was a kind of turning point in the whole movement. I think that was in 1965,ï»¿161 I had that feeling that he began to turn to other things. I think he began to feel that he was not needed quite so much and that there needed to be more clearly direct internal leadership g iven. I think he alsoâI may be dreaming thisâI think he got put off by Black Power. He didn't understand it as well as he might have. Well, I think what happened was that at the time of the Meredith march into Mississippi and the cry of Black Power in 1965... '66; '66,1 have here. Was it '66? June of 1966 was that march. Well, that was the beginning of the whole Black Power thrust. Before that, the council meetings had become less and less frequent, and there was also the fact that Dr. King had begun to accentuate his concern about the Vietnam War. I think that, in some respects, Stephen was among those who felt that this was diverting some interest, and I think that most people in the civil rights movement could not quite see what Martin was driving at. But I always felt that here was a man who was committed to nonviolence, and since war seems to be the ultimate in violence, it was to be expected that he would be against war, as were all the other groups. But once he began to focus so on it, I think that his participation in the council began to lessen, so that he began to send Andy Young or someone to represent him. See, a part of the uniqueness in the civil rights movement was that you could say it had the undivided attention of the principals. I think that was what made it strong. So that whenever there had been meetings of this group, it was given a priority. Everybody did. And anyone who had to have any kind of conflict, usually resolved it in favor of the civil rights group. But as time began to go on, and some of these differences and interests began to come up, you began to see a waning of this strength and trust. But it was also because of the changing situation. When James Farmer was replaced by Floyd McKissick, Floyd McKissick came in with a much stronger separatist line. Then, when Floyd was replaced by Roy Innis, Roy Innis came in with the whole view that the rest of you are integrationists, and I am a black nationalist, or separatist, or whatever you want to call him. Well, there was no single thing, there were a lot of different forces that were at work. And the young people by this time, were so sure that even the best white leadership was not good enough, that you had to have clear black direction and black leadership. So there was this strong emphasis on Black Power with them. They probably had very little use for Stephen. They couldn't see what you all, who had been there for a long time, saw that Stephen did for civil rights, brought it together. They were separatists, and theyï»¿162 pC: (cont.) didn't want any part of any Stephen types* It wasn^t because he was Stephen. DH: No, no, no. It had nothing to do with him. That's what I was saying, it was part of a whole. It's a development and a whole awakening. I think that one would have to say that, just as time has proved that the early reaction and resistance to the war that young people displayed, and almost at the same time, the amount of black young people who were drafted, so they had a kind of feeling that their identity had been lost, even in their own struggle... And therefore, they had to reclaim their own identityâthat that was what they were engaged in. I have the feeling that even someone as committed as Stephen became interested in urban America and keeping America beautiful, and beautification of America, all of which was sound. He began to move in that direction when it did not seem that he was needed in exactly the same way. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: He didn't feel that he was appreciated. Now, I have no condemnation. I don't want to go into my own history, but I know exactly how he felt. Yes. Because it took me a summer, and you, to get me out of that feeling of being blown away and no longer needed, and discarded, and so on. That's right. Stephen didn't have you. He didn't have anyone to explain to him that these are logical steps that must take place in a movement. There are times when I think even the best of us would have to say that it is a very difficult thing to answer to the incoming, growing, new generations, who keep asking the questions: what makes you think that this is solving our problems? You see? In other words, as they begin to ask the questions, they ask them in ways that all emancipating adolescents ask them. They never ask them kindly. They ask them in the worst ways. But this has nothing to do with race. All the young do this. This is the nature of things. I'm not all that Freudian, but, you know, even the concept of the young that kills the mother in order to live... I mean, the point of it is, this is part of the nature of things. But I think that part of what they began to do was to accuse the elders of the civil rights movement of maintaining for them a heritage...an inheritance of dependency. They could not see that, in a sense, just because people were white did not mean that they were not concerned about human rights. In a sense, they tended to see white as white, and not persons. I suppose, if you look at it maybe a hundred years from now, as social analysts will look at it, they will say that was a little bit of what America created, because she treated all people of color as if they were colored, never persons. So it was probably a natural development that young blacks coming up in that generation would thenï»¿163 (cont.) reach a point where they treated everything that was white as white, you see, and in fact, they went even further than that. They almost went back to Africa. They became black Africans in the United States. They didn't want to be identified with their immediate past, you see. So that I think, that was hard. Their immediate past was Aunt Jemima and Uncle Tom, and they didn't want that. That's right. And, I remember one young fellow, Ralph Featherstone, who was very active in SNCC, said at one time in a meeting where he was representing James Formanâhe turned to all the people in the civil rights movement and though Stephen was there, he was not talking to him, he was talking to the black onesâso he said, "We have our problems because you are the buffers. You are too understanding. So that you identify with the white liberal, and you could understand. If you didn't understand, then it would be easier to attack the enemy." Do you see? Now this is a point of view that you have to see. That's not a stupid point of view. There's a lot to it. No, because of the fact that you are so understanding, you are delayingâ this was their feelingâyou delay the day when we will have our freedom. And then, as you look back over it now, for all that had been happening, it took the marches and the Selmas and a more militant attack on the problems to bring about any change. And still is going to take more... And as you move into it and you see what is happening at the present time, the interest has shifted now, you know. The blacks are no longer a concern, it's going to shift to different, other groups. This is the way the country deals with it. The black is no longer the "in" group, and the needs of the black community... No. I think we have a short attention span, and go to another project. That's right. That's right. But we'll have to come back to the problem of black people because it has to be solved. It can't go forever. It has to be solved, and you see, what some of the most embittered young people began to see was, other people have the option, they can move to other problems. But if you're black, you don't have that option. You either then go into drugs or you give up, or you do something. You know? Or you stay by it, and I think that's the tough part. Well, I have a lot of questions on this, because Holly and I have been talking about it, but we have to get back to your history. These are just questions I'm mopping up from some part of the earlier tapes. When we discussed the second summer Wednesdays in Mississippi, we didn't get to the programs of the war on poverty. One of these programs was Head Start. Did the National Council of Negro Women have aï»¿164 PC: (cont.) section in Jackson which worked with Head Start? And how did black and white women work together? Do you remember this part? DH: When we first went into Jackson, we had a group of women led by one or two middle-class women, who really gave you the feeling that they couldn't get their hands dirty. Now, during the period of the Freedom Rides, they had been very helpful. They had provided food, they had provided sheets, and they had housed people. They had met the immediate needs, but it almost seemed impossible to get them to identify... PC: They were so middle-class. DH: So middle-class. It was a continuing problem.. But I have to say that one of the most exciting things that had happened is that when the Mississippi Head Start programs and the poverty programs were threatened, and it looked like these programs would be taken away, some of these women were among those who really rose up in protest. PC: DH: PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: Recently? This is just in the last... No, this was way back. Way back. But at the very beginning, they didn't see it in the way that you had hoped they would see it, is that right? No, at the beginning they didn't see it. As a matter of fact, as I said, they met the obvious needs, like when people were hungry they fed them, and they did those kinds of things. Pr â¢ Well, now, did we have a section? Where did Edith Sampson come from? Was she a member of a NCNW section or did she just come up to the top to work with Ann Hewitt? You mean Sanders. Sanders. Noâwell, I'm not sure, but the woman who was the- director, and Ann Hewitt was assistant director of Head Start., I know she was a friend of ours, because she housed people the summer before, and she was a schoolteacher, I believe. But she became the director of Head Start, and I'm not sure whether that was through our efforts [WIM's] or through our council. I know that we had a great deal to do with it. I think it was through our efforts. I think that it was when Head Start was threatened, and, you know, Ann Hewitt could probably tell you how that got started. At the point that it was threatened, these women began to...not only to protest and fight for it, but they began to do some alternate things. After a while, they organized a section of the National Council in Jackson, and decided that one of the needs in the community was for a twenty-four-hour child care and information service. Among other things, it was not only that children needed day care programs, but there were children who were lost and in the streets, and wandered away from home, or who were neglected, and who needed some placeï»¿165 DH: (cont.) where they could be cared for. And so Mrs. Mosley and a group of women got together and they first rented, and later they bought a house, and set it up with a staff of about nine or ten people, all of whom were volunteers. They were able to work with the person who handles the emergency food program, and they got the food from there. They put in their own furnishings. PC: How did they get the money? This isn't part of the program of the war on poverty. DH: No, they had no public funding. They raised their own money, and then they got different women who had retired from teaching. A retired principal and other retirees became the staff, with the use of some teen-agers. And they kept this going as a twenty-four-hour service. And it is still going. PC: Is this a section without white members? Do you remember? DH: Well, no. Mrs. Schutt...they've always had white members, so some of the white members helped, and some of the black members helped. PC: This other question is, how you solved the black women and the white women working together as early as 1965? DH: Well, you remember, when we went in there, we found that there were a few white womenâAnn Hewitt, Mrs. Schutt, and I can't think of... PC: Frances Robbins was working there. DH: Yes. PC: I think Mrs. Couch... DH: Patt Derian. And there were different women, white women and black women, who did particular things, and they had worked together. Also, some of them had been active in dealing with some of the problems arising around their television station. PC: Yes, they had. They worked with the United Church of Christ. Â°H: Right. The television station had not only ignored blacks but had had derogatory programs, and so... Oh, I know who you mean when you said Sampson. It's not Edith. PC: No. That's right. Edith's the judge. There's another... DH: PC: DH: No, I know who you mean now. Mrs. [Esther] Sampson. I remember exactly. She had been a social worker, and they encouraged her to come and take the Head Start job. Yes, she worked with them. And then, she and a group of other women took an active role when the local television station became so racist that its application... Asï»¿166 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) a matter of fact, they monitored that station and participated in challenging its license, and of course, it changed its policies. So that there's a kind of an activist nucleus there, in Jackson. Do you feel that they began to work together better as we got to know them, and they came to events that were given for us, [Wednesdays in Mississippi groups] and they began to put us up in their homes, and had all that experience? I think that the fact that Jackson was kind of a central spot for the whole Wednesdays operation meant that they had more contact than any city. Then each time, as they met different women from different sides of the color line, they began to get acquainted with other women, and I think one of the things they found of most value was that after all of our work and our trips throughout the rest of the state, was the debriefing and the opportunity to sit down and talk about what was happening. This, to them, was opening up a whole new network of communications that they'd never had before, and I think the healthy thing is that they have kept it going. Till now, you know, one of our strongest spots is Jackson. Is it? Yes. I haven't been there in so long, I'm glad to hear it. But that really was quite eventful, in Mississippi, to have the black and white people work together. Of course, you couldn't get federal funding unless you had a black and white staff. Therefore, to get what they wanted, if they wanted Head Start, for example, they had to have us. But the fact of working together is quite different from just sitting in a meeting together. Oh yes. And the fact that they have a sense of common struggle...because it was just as difficult for the blacks to work with the whites, as it was for the whites to work with the blacks. And so, whoever ventured forward, you see, helped to get more and more courage. Now, taking it away from Mississippi for a minute, to stay with Head Start, do you remember what we did, the National Council of Negro Women, in Head Start through the rest of the country? How often were we involved in Head Start? Not exactly, but were we often involved with the Head Start centers? Well, first of all, almost 4'0 percent of the Head Start in the country was in the state of Mississippi; there were so many Head Start units in Mississippi. Then, there was the challenge to the Child Development Group of Mississippi, the CDGF, and all of their funding was withdrawn. Well, we entered the struggle for that. Then later, when the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was confronted with an idea that John Bell Williams, who was the governor who was against any federal programs that furthered integrationâthat was hisï»¿(cont.) view of looking at it. While he was governor, he vetoed again all of the Head Start programs, and this time came up with the idea that Head Start teachers should be fully qualified. Now, what that meant was, that the value of Head Start up to that point had been the use of indigenous people and paraprofessionals, with a limited number of highly trained people, who were able therefore to deal with all sorts of problems that arose. It was very significant that Colonel Harper, whom we had met at Indianola, was one of the people who was backing this whole position of getting qualified personnel. Well, what we were able to help Colonel Harper to see was that immediately that could get rid of most of the black leadership, despite the fact that the program had been so effective. I was a part of a panel with Judge Polier and the young man who headed the Mississippi Council of Human Rights. Yes, who was he? His name I can't remember now, but he called the Southern Regional Council. Paul Anthony, a Southern Regional Council executive, set up a public hearing. I went down to be on the panel for that hearing, and overnight, twelve hundred people came from across the state, and we sat and listened to all kinds of testimony. I'll never forget a grandmother who was some eighty years old, who said that she had no training, she had nothing, but when Head Start came she was able to help the children. She found that what many of those children neededâwith their parents having such a hard struggle and working long hoursâthat most of what they needed was just loving care. And she said she looked forward every morning, and the children looked forward to her being there. She said she couldn't teach them their letters and other things, but she could be there with them, and she gave them the care that a loving grandmother could give. And she taught them things about how to behave, and she did different things with them. And we heard the testimony of, you know, people like that saying, "What will happen to my life now? I have nothing, but I at least was helping people." There were people who had been teaching, who came and told about how they not only had the Head Start program, but like in all of our programs in Mississippi, we're a feeding station. We feed people who have nothing to do with the program, but they told how they prepared food for them, and the kinds of things that they did. They talked about the children who were handicapped, and how some children could not read, or were blind, and the like. And they told of ways in which those children were discovered through Head Start. In many of those rural areas, children like that are just left to wither, you know. Their sight, their hearing, their teeth, all of this was examined before they went to... That's right. And when they got to Head Start, they got these kinds of things, and people justâit was just heartrending to hear their testimony. Well, we came back and developed a piece and presented it to Secretaryï»¿168 DH: (cont.) Richardson, arid it was very fortunate that at that time James Farmer was the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. So he arranged for all this to be heard, and the federal government, in such a program as this where it is a hundred percent funded, could override the governor's veto. So, we brought back all of the testimony, and they then did override the governor's veto, and continued the Head Start program. So that there was a constant battle about it, because Head Start was feared by many of those in the Mississippi government, because of the size of the black population, and their fear that there would be a political awakening. PC: Which in many cases, there was. OH: And, in many cases, there was. Because having gotten people together with Head Start, then it was perfectly possible to tell them to come another day, and they would deal with voter registration. So Head Start was a major channel for getting the black vote registered. PC: A double whammy it gave really, the parents... the children and their parents. Now, I wonder why we have so many sections in the state of Mississippi? When I was last there, there were twenty-five. There may be more. Is it due to Head Start, housing, day care, feeding stationsâas you call itâall of it together? Have you any theory about this? DH: PC: DH: ?C: Well, I can only go by what the people say. What they said to us, and you heard them as well as I...that during all of the civil rights struggle, many groups came in, but that we of the National Council of Negro Women never left. We just moved from one phase to the other, and the fact that we stayed by, and the fact that we were identified in their minds with doing somethingâit was either building housing or providing pigs or providing gardens or, as you remember, in Wednesdays in Mississippi, you carried tools and art materials, and records, and books. We became identified in their minds with helping them to meet their needs, so that what has happened is that we have become organized in every part of the state. For instance, around the Okolona Center, which is in Chickasaw County, there are little places all through there that now have sections. That, I didn't know. That's right. Someone came the other day and said, "I'm from Mullins, Mississippi." I didn't know that there was a place called Mullins. So that we're in all kinds of small areas. We have the Fannie Lou Hamer Day Care Center in Ruleville which services all sorts of counties all around. We find sections growing up all through those areas. I think that the heart of it is that people have an idea if you join the Council, you're not only helping yourself but you will get some help. In addition, we set out to have state organization, and Mrs. Mosley of Jackson, who has proven to be a very dynamic leader and who...we've seen her develop. I would say so. I remember her.ï»¿169 DH: She really relates to the people. PC: At the beginning, she was a lady, and that was that. She really didn't understand. DH: That's right. But she really has organized the state of Mississippi, and when I tell you that she extended an invitation for us to hold our national convention in the state of Mississippi, that, you know, was the farthest from anyone's thoughts a few years ago. We can never have a small meeting in Mississippi. Every meeting in Mississippi is a big, overwhelming... And, even now, I'm trying to meet her request to come to hold a statewide meeting. We use the people from Prentiss Institute* to help us train the families in how to deal with the pigs, and one of our state organizers is from Prentiss, and she, in turn, has organized the areas all around the Prentiss Institute. You see? We have developed housingâhome-ownership for low income familiesâin six counties. In all of those counties there are sections. In all of the housing developments, there are sections of NCNW, so that there's been a growth that's kind of related to what the people have been doing, and each one in turn, like Mrs. Devine, Annie Devine... PC: is she still working with us? DH: Well, as a volunteer now. But Annie Devine in Canton...they have set up an all-day day care center, and they have been working with that, as she is there in Canton. We've worked with Liberty House, well, that's just fourteen counties. Well, all of those counties are organized. So that there's a way in which you can say, all of the Council work in Mississippi is related to action of some kind, which is very interesting. It's our best example of how self-help becomes reality. How do you help people to help themselves? PC: Well, they used to talk about the National Council of Negro Women being a group of women who gave tea parties. Now, this shows the real face of the Council and the work that it's done. DH: DH: PC: DH; Right. The prime example of what we need to have happen in every state. Now, there probably is something here on voter education, which you referred to a little earlierâthe National Council of Negro Women's work in voter education and voter and registration programs. I only know about the one in New York, but you indicate that there are many other efforts at voter education and registration. Have you got some examples? Well, yes. For example, one of the key things that often gets overlooked is the United States Census. The Census? The Census. This is because of fear of being misused if they register or if they are known on the part of many blacks in many of the communities, *Prentiss Normal and Industrial Instituteï»¿170 DH: (cont.) For instance, people who are limited in their educational background, who perhaps have migrated from the South and who have never registered or voted, have an idea that if they have a parking ticket and they haven't paid it, if they registered, they might get arrested, or if they are reported to the Census that they might get arrested. So that closely related to voter education and voter registration is the issue of the Census. In many of the large cities blacks are just in the undercount. The 1970 Census reflects a 7 percent undercount. Now, that's a very serious matter, at a time when revenue-sharing funds will be based on population. So that if you're not counted in the population, your needs are not considered, and for blacks who weren't considered anyway, and then to be there in smaller numbers than reality was only to mean that they would surely not get counted, nor have their needs given any kind of recognition. PC: Is that true in a rural population too with blacks? It's true in rural and urban, that's right. In large cities, like Chicago, for example, the Council women set up places for really helping people to get into the Census count. In most of the large cities across the country, we took an active hand in helping to interpret what the Census was about, and to try to get the people to answer the questions, because in whole neighborhoods there was a tendency to just be shut out. Well, likewise, in those same kinds of areas, there were voter registration programs. I would say 60 to 70 percent of local sections have some kind of voter registration program, trying to get people to get every member to register, and every member to contact other people, even if they did not go out and do a major job in the community. I think that we participated especially in the South with the Southern Regional Council, in intensifying the voter registration as part of the whole civil rights effort. Doris Dozier and the rest of our staff down there were working as much on that as they were on anything else. PC: Of course, we did have the WMCA* Call for Action, voter registration here in New York. DH DH PC DH: Yes. In the summer of 1964. That's right. Almost completely staffed by persons who were recruited through the Council. And I think that was a learning experience, too, for people. And it had a great impact on the board of elections' policies in the city of New York. You remember one of the things we were doing was trying to get some extension on the time permitted, and some expansion of the number of places for registration. And so, we were a major factor in their getting firehouses designated. Then, the next year, '65, when the League of Women Voters started to expand their registra-* WMCA are radio station call lettersï»¿171 DH: (cont.) tion program, the chairman of the board of elections referred them to us, because he said that had developed the best information that they had available. ^C: And before we began, they were supposed to be the source. DH: They were supposed to be the source. We became the source, and then they used the information that we had gathered. And through that, not only were a number of people brought in to register, but we were also able to show some of the flaws in the policies, both for the regular registrations and for the absentees, and changes were made in both policies. ^C: And we were able to allay the fears of people who would simply telephone us anonymously. DH: Yes. PC: And say, I have done such and such. Am I eligible to vote? They would have been afraid to go, or never would have gone to some booth on the street or... DH: No. PC: No. But an anonymous telephone call is the simplest thing to do. And WMCA Call for Action research was done completely, so we always had an answer. DH: DH: That's right. PC: That was very exciting, because one felt that one really did give people a chance to vote who otherwise would have been, as you say, afraid to because of a misdemeanor, or whatever was on their record. Or they didn't think they'd lived long enough in one place, but they had. Yes. I think that one of the crucial things that happens, in large cities as well as in small ones, is that people simply do not know either what their rights are or how to exercise them. And we had people going through the streets and into different areas, explaining to people about the vote. I remember one time in the Harlem community that one of our volunteers was talking to someone sitting on one of those stoops in the heart of Harlem, and then by just saying to them, "Well, come and go along with me." But, a young woman who was on welfare was seated there at the same time, and one of these men was saying that he had no job, no need of his voting, what difference would it make. And this young woman asked our volunteer any number of questions. And then she said, "According to what they're saying, you can just sit here and you will never have a job, but if you get up, you might at least be able to get yourself registered, and vote, and you might be able to do something for yourself, so at least try it." And so then she went with the volunteer to the other places and convinced other people. I think that's kind of characteristic of our way of work, that it is helping people themselves talk to their neighbors, rather than for us to do it all.ï»¿172 PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH PC: Yes, We've become an educator who then educates outward all the time. That's right. pC: One other thing I'd like to clear up. When we talked about the Job Corps as a poverty program and the membership in the Job Corps, you said the YWCA pulled out after the initial part of that effort, but I did not ask you to tell the reason. Since the YWCA is an important part of the original WIC and of WICS, what happened? I think largely it was that, when the idea was presented to the National Board, [YWCA], it came at a time when I happened to have been on leave from the National Board. And at that particular board meeting, when it came up and they were saying that volunteers would be helping with counseling and different things, many of my colleagues, who could only think about that in professional terms, began to say, well, the YWCA could never be in the position of saying that you could do adequate counseling simply with volunteers, and... That wasn't the purpose, the adequate counseling, was it? Well, WICS do counsel. What they had to stop to think about was that there was no way und er the sun, with a half million young women on the poverty level, that you could expect to have enough employed professional counselors to deal with it. For many of these young women, most of what they need was information about what's expected of you in the Job Corps; and if you have a baby at home, how do you see that that child is cared for; if you need a school record, or if you have to meet certain requirements, how you get those things. Mildred Jones, who was then representing the National Board on this, said to me when I saw her, "Well, I'm sorry that you weren't here, because you could have interpreted this, you see, but by the time two or three national staff members expressed their concern lest the YWCA find itself condoning sort of an unprofessional approach to counseling," she said, "I knew that they would not vote to be a part of this." Since that time, the YWCA has developed a way of using the YWCA residences for what was called the Job Corps of YWCA. Thirty-one YWCA residences have been used for young women leaving the Job Corps, at the time that they needed to have some place where they could live, and get their own start, and move out. So it is a part, but it's not officially a part of WICS. It is related to Job Corps, but it's not a part of the WICS coalition. Where were you when you were on leave that time? In '64, I took that period of time to concentrate on the Council's work. I took that particular fall off. It was the fall of '64. It was a time when you should have been everywhere, I guess. Now, again back to the YWCA, Young Women's Christian Association. When the civil rights movement was well under way, some of the national organizations which were already integrated had to give leadership to those minorityï»¿173 (cont.) persons who had integrated them and to reevaluate their positions in regard to across-the-board integration. Was this true of the YWCA? I know you were already in a position of leadership... Were there other black women who were in a position of leadership, or did the Y shift its emphasis? It's very interesting that you asked that question because this week I was asked by a bicentennial group from the state of Michiganâand I don't know why it was they who asked the questionâbut they called to ask the question, who was the first national staff member for the YWCA of USA, what black woman? And I told them it was Elizabeth Ross Haynes, who became a staff member in 1911. Now, you see, there was a member of the national staff who was a black woman before I was born. And this, I think, is one of the things that is significant about the YWCA as a -national movement. Because in addition to Elizabeth Ross Haynes, there were two sisters, Eva Bowles and Fordella Wynn, who were both on the national staff. Eva Bowles? Bowles. B-o-w-l-e-s, and Fordella Wynn, W-y-n-n. They were two highly trained, very effective women. Actually the latter two, Eva Bowles and Fordella Wynn,represented the National Board in December 1935, at the meeting Mrs. Bethune called to organize the National Council of Negro Women. So that they held a position, a national position of leadership among black women. Many young women, like I, found that... When Mrs. Wynn met you and she would sort of put her hands on you, and say, "Well, you really belong to the YWCA." She was almost evangelical in her approach. And I think many people felt as I did. I became a member of the YWCA staff in the year that Mrs. Wynn retired. But for several years, while I was in college, and every time she would see me, this is what she would say, "Well, you really belong in the YWCA." Now, I say that because the YWCA was in a different position from some other organizations. It had a different kind of history. Even though it might have been bettering race relations, or whatever you want to call it- âin 1912, it had a national department of colored work. And the purpose of that was to really develop the leadership of Negro women. They had what they called the Negro Leadership Conference. But did they want to keep those women in Negro branches or did they want to bring them up and mix them up with everyone else? You have to look at it historically. When the YWCA, in 1895, organized a Negro branch in Dayton, Ohio, and when it employed on its national staff, in 1911, a Negro staff, and when it had that staff in key positions all through those yearsâthere's always been someone at the top level. You have to stop and think about that. You're talking not just about the secretaries at the local level; you're talking about a key person at the national executive level in the YWCA national. When it did that, it was unmatched by any other major group drawn from the major white population in this country, so that, at that time, the flourishing Harlem branch, with 280 rooms, you know, was this tremendous institution; theï»¿174 DH: (cont.) Indianapolis branch, which was a seven-story hotel that housed both men and women, and a big service component; or Detroit, with the Lucy Thurman branch... PC: These were black? DH: These are all black. Or, go right around the country. Do you see what I'm saying? We miss the point if we look at them in the light of today. You have to look at that moment in history and see that that was as far forward then as affirmative action is today, because there was no organization that was predominantly out of the white population, that offered the same kind of executive opportunity. PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: What do you think about 1964, '65, '66,when the Y recognized the importance of having a black board and staff? Was there then a reorganization? They had board and staff all through the years. Remember, I came on the national staff in 1944. I came on the staff at a time that it was in the midst of making a study of its interracial practices. Out of that study came thirty-five recommendations that called for integration of Negro women and girls into the mainstream of association life. This was a kind of call to move away from the branch toward an integration; that was the way it was looked at. And in 1946, the national YWCA adopted an interracial charter, and that was a strong driving force. But in 1933, it had taken a strong action at the time that there were so many things happening in the South. And in 1936, when the Scottsboro case broke loose, it had sent Mrs. Allan Knight Chalmers into Decatur, Alabama, as a part of its public affairs action. So that it has had, over the years, for decades, a two-fold concern about the racial matterâone in terms of outside legislation, the other in terms of its internal life. Now, the turning point in '63, or '62 and '63, was that as the drive toward full equality in the civil rights movement picked up momentum, I worked with the National Board and we had a direct meeting with the representatives of the civil rights movement, Whitney Young and Roy Wilkins, the whole group. They all came and talked to the National Board, and what they said was, "Unlike many other groups, you are in a very favored position because you are not an all-white organization." Do you see? "You already have people..." pC: Yes. Therefore, they said, "But you don't want to rest on those laurels. You now have to move even more aggressively." And that's when the National Board, after that meeting, decided to use capital funds to make a bold assault on racial injustice, and it began to move more vigorously. And I think that this is part of the uniqueness of the YWCA in the American scene, that because it did have racial branches, it had black women. You became head of the Department for Racial Justice, didn't you? Well, I came on the staff in 1944 to be the secretary for interracial education. I had come in to follow up the interracial study.ï»¿175 DH: (cont.) I had worked on that. And then, in 1949, I joined the training staff and later became the director for training. So that it was all these years later thatâwhen they were working on what was called an action program, to get every association in the country to drop every vestige of segregation or racial discriminationâthat I was then with Florence Harris, a white member of the national staff, and the two of us became a team to work on helping associations really eliminate all the barriers. And then, as the civil rights movement grew, by '63, I was asked to leave the training and concentrate on the racial justice. PC: I should have remembered, 1963. It's in your papers, Dorothy. Now, can we go back to the nationalâI keep moving you back and forth between the National Council of Negro Women and the Y. This time, I want to go back to the National Council of Negro Women, and ask you what the staff in the early 1960s... Again, we eventually had to integrate, or did integrate at your discretion and the board's discretion. In the 1960s, do you remember the size of the staff and then what it grew to be, including the southern field staff? Well, let me put it this way. It seems to me that when I first met you and the members of the staff of the National Council of Negro Women, there were about three staff members... DH: Yes. Two full time and one part time. PC: Now, then, as we picked up momentum because of the work in the war on poverty and in the civil rights movement, and all the other things that you urged the board to move on, how large did our staff get to be? OH: Well, I would say, at least over the period since about '63, at that time we had three staff people. Then you remember we had part-time help with people like Susan Goodwillie. We have grown now until we have a base staff, I would say, that's around sixty. Now we have, also, like what we were doing with the women on housing and some special projects, until, as these have gone on, in January of this year we had a hundred and one people. PC: Now that is really quite some growth in less than ten years. Yes. So that's what we have. That was including those special projects. Nov/, probably because of the nature of our work, it will always go up and down. DH: DH: Oh yes. That's right. There are different pieces of work. We had hundred and one In .Tanuarv. hundred and one in January. ^C: And some of those people were in the field, right? Had to be in the field. Oh yes. For example, that's the whole staff at Okolona [Day Care Center]. When the Appalachian Regional Commission decided to provide the matching funds for that, their first step was to increase the staff and raise the salaries. Now, that is a forward step for the state of Mississippi. So that we had the whole staff at Okolona; we have a whole contingent of staff at Ruleville in the Fannie Lou Hamer Day Care Center; we have staff at Liberty House. Then we have the people who are working in fourï»¿176 DH: (cont.) cities on staff related to the Women in Housing Project. PC: Now you're picking up new staff for the Women's International Year. DH: International Women's Year. PC: Right? DH: Yes. PC: So as things drop, other projects pick up. DH: That's right. So you make shifts that way. PC: l\hich really puts you in big business. Now, I had another question on that. I don't know if this is just my point of view, because I was there during that particular time, or whether it was true that there were problems in integrating our staff in reverse. The black women, mostly the young women, not the older women, really did not want to work with the white women on the staff. You were clever enough to pick, for the most part, young women who had been SNCC workers... DH: Yes. PC: ...who knew something about the work that they were required to handle and who were idealists, but in the course of their experience, they had very little desire to be with white people. Did you feel that, or was that just something that occurred to me? No, that was quite true, but that wasn't always their viewpoint either. You have to bear in mind, if you take the summer of '64, the Mississippi summer, and the experience that Bob Moses and his group had, I think you will see the same thing happened to us. That is, when the young people started in that summer, they were all very happy to be together, they were black and white, that was a part of their pride. But one of the things that happened in the course of that was that blacks who had gone to southern schools discovered that white students from the Ivy League schools had certain advantages over them. They had spent the same amount of time in school, often it cost them as much money as they could afford. And yet, there were things that were lacking in what they had learned. So they developed a kind of resentment about this, and also, not so much about the persons as about the system of education. And the same thing happened in the Council. The SNCC people were the ones who had had the most interracial experience. You have to bear in mind that a person going to a school in Harlem isn't going to have that much of an integrated experience. But a lot of those young people in SNCC who had gone down into the Deep South had worked with white students, side by side. So that once the whole Black Power thing hit them, then theirs became a kind of resentment and almost a feeling that anybodyâany white who was among them was probably there to spy. Yes. That was the feeling I had. That we were the CIA agent types.ï»¿177 DH: And some of them would say, well, you know, only the people who can't make it in the white community would ever want to be bothered with us. Why would they want to be bothered? PC: That I didn't know. That's a feeling of inferiority. DH: Yes. They had a feeling that something must be wrong with them if they want to be associated with us, because we're blacks. That was the kind of feeling. So you had... PC: They didn't want to room with white staff members. DH: No. PC: Some of the black staff members that were running this program had a very hard time because of this feeling. DH: But it's also very interesting that over the long haul, you see, a lot of that kind of leveled itself off. PC: Yes, and who had the foresight? Only youâyou knew that it would go away. ^H: Well, you just had to stay with it. PC: You told all of us that, but it's hard to take. = It's so hard to take. PC: You were the one who integrated the staff or it wouldn't have been integrated. Yes, that's right. Because, you see really, that's the nature of social change. PC: I wouldn't have known that. Did you work with these younger women in training situations, or role playing? Or anything that made them finally get past that, or was it just...time? No. I think it was the fact that they saw that we were not being dominated by anybody, you know. You would say, well now, just because you have an idea, that didn't mean that the white person thought it up. What difference, if it's a good idea, whoever thought it up? So I think it was just a question of really trying to help people see what the task is at hand, what is it that you're trying to do. Well, that's training. Yes, it is training, in a way. So that you have to work at that. You have to see what is the task, what is it you're trying to do. We're not here to integrate with white people, that's not our goal. We're working together.ï»¿178 Do you remember the time at Cappahosic, [Virginia], when it [segregation] was most severe? DH: Oh yes. It was very severe. The other thing you had to bear in mind was some of it was unreasonableness, you see. I had a young woman come in who was a trainer. Remember Hilda Fortune? And she worked with them and she tried very hard, and I think did as good a job as anyone could do. But... PC: Well, they were young... DH: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: The thing that I think though that we all have to look at, they are products of the American society, and they have the feeling, well, we're shut out of the white community... PC: That's right. And therefore, they had an idea, we can now make our own community, and remember, they went through the whole stage. They didn't want anybody in their schools or in their streets or in their community. Anywhere. So that was a whole phase. They had to wear their dashikis. Pf- Didn t they want some southern states to call their own? Let everybody else go away? Yes. But...for example, say Frances Beal of our staff was as militant as any. But she took a different view after she began to work. Do you see? When they sat down and worked with white staff, they came to a different view, but when they were simply sitting looking at each other across the way, the white staff sometimes read into everything they did ---something that wasn't there either. Yes. And so you can read into it. Read it, racewise, and so on. And so I'd think sometimesâevery once in a while, you would have to help some of the white staff, not just say, well, it's no need of my talking to her because of this or that or the other. Do you see? So it was a kind of a hard thing, but I think it's the nature of change. You know, it's part of when people are in the midst of changing. You will be interested to know that a young woman who came to one of our groupsâ brought by Prathea Hall Wynn, to be a sort of governess for her childâ this young woman was so black conscious, she went with us on a training program to Puerto Rico, and she taught all those little children how to make a fist and say Black Power, and this and that and the other. Well, a few weeks ago I had to go out to Queens College, and she came to the hearing at the Ford Foundation. Oh, she did? She came up to me afterward and she said, "Are you going out to the college?" I said, "Yes." She said, "Well, I'll drive you out." So we drove out and she was telling me she's now teaching at Brooklynï»¿179 DH= (cont.) College. Well, last Sunday night at the NCNW dinner, she was one of those who got an award for raising $250 paying her own life membership. And so we talked about going backward and forward, and she said, "Well, you know, you can't be angry all your life. You've got to get on to doing something." I.think that what many blacks who have had my kind of training and experience with many whites don't realize is that black young people have a whole lot to be angry about, and that anger would never have been accentuated in exactly the way it is without that Mississippi summer. They had to rub shoulders with young people from Yale and Harvard. PC: Whom they never would have met otherwise? DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: No, they never would have met, except one at a time. But when they began to analyze, and when Stokely [Carmichael] and some of them began to analyze what happened to them, and they realized all these young people came down there, they knew things that they just had never heard of before. I'm talking about those who were the products of most of the southern black schools. They also realized that there they were. Do you see? They had neither the economic, nor the social, nor the educational equipment, and they said, this is just a scheme. One of the things that I wanted to tell you, my young nephew was one of the twenty-five non-Mississippians admitted to the University of Mississippi Law School last week. And here he is, born in the city of New York... And he chose to go to... ...graduated of a school up there. When I helped him to go to Tennessee State, because he was such a good athlete, and when I got his first note thanking me, I just wondered what in the world I had done, because his spelling was just not there, he was just completely off. When I saw him down there, he said to me, "Well now, Aunt Dorothy, those people up there in that school had me thinking I was a good athlete and a poor student." He said, "I've got the brains. They were just letting me run and get medals and do things and all." And he didn't get mad about it until he was working in the summer down in Wall Street, and all the students from Harvard and Yale would come in and they'd be talking about things, and he didn't even know what they were talking about. A terrible feeling. And he said, he had such a feeling that, well, he just was sort of doomed. But then he decided...he saved his money and he said he wanted to go to school. He asked me in late September, and I knew Tennessee State had a good health education program, and Wilma Rudolph had just won the Olympicsâand so, I said, well, he can at least go down there. He's a good athlete. The first few weeks that he was there, he was living in a home in the community that a friend of mine got for him because schoolâall registration was closed when I called them. And the man said, We've turned away so many, if you just tell him not to say he's just registered.ï»¿130 PC: Only a Dorothy Height could pull that off. DH: That was a Thursday and the dean said, when the president told him to talk to me, he said he'd have to be here Monday. And I called Dan and told him, and Dan said okay. He was there on Sunday, and he had all his money intact. He didn't need money, he didn't need anything, he just wanted to get in. Within the first two or three weeks, when they began to sift the student body down, a space opened up in the dormitory, so he took that space, which fortunately was with some top flight students. He told me how those students took him and sat him on the floor and said, "You just sit there and listen, because," they said, "you've got to get yourself together." And they would sit and discuss their English and their compositions, and they would give him assignments like write them 500 words on such and such a thing. In the meantime, all the sit-ins were going on, and so he wrote my sister saying that he didn't know what he was going to do because they wanted him in the sit-ins, but he said he was having a hard time. So she talked to me, and she said, "Well, what shall I tell him, because what good will it do him to be out there sitting in for civil rights and not getting an education?" So I said, "Yes, but the way many young people look at it too, is, what good is an education without civil rights? So you have to let him decide what he's going to do, because among other things, he has to live with his peers. He's had to find a way." I was impressed when I went to Nashville a few weeks later, to discover that he had worked out a way, that he did some sitting in, but he told them all, and these other fellows helped him, that he had so much to catch up. But he went back and he got a whole list of the books that he had never read in high school, and I sat down with him and I said, "If you never read Adam Bede, you will live." Because I just thought that he was getting overly serious about it. And I said, "Now here's Alice in Wonderland, now read that." I was just trying to pull him away, because he was so intent and so intense about the whole thing. So, after that, he came up at Christmas time and he said, "Well, Aunt Dorothy, I want you to know that I'm on the dean's list." His first grades were all A's! Here was a boy who spent an extra semester in a Flushing high school, because he just didn't have this academic work, and he himself had come to think of himself as a great athlete and a poor student. He came up to see me at Christmas and couldn't stop talking about it, you know, about the steps he had taken. And when I was there, he made a date to see me, and he said, "Well, I'll see you in the morning." Well, 6:30, my bell rang, and so he said, "Oh, Aunt Dorothy, I forgot to tell you it would be so early." He was on his way, so he came back. So I said, "Why get up so early?" He said, "Well, I should never be in physical education." He said, "Just because I don't smoke or drink and I've done all these things." He said, "I'm using the same thing I would use, using that same discipline, to get myself up and to keep myself physically fit, so I can make up." He said, "I've just wasted a life in high school." So he was, you know...he was driving so hard. He had a girl friend who was at Morgan, so he wanted to know if he should go to Morgan. So I told him that my first estimate was...if you're doingï»¿181 (cont.) well down there, you'd better stay, rather than to go to Morgan, because Morgan is so academically oriented. But by his second semester, as far as he was concerned, academically he had pulled himself up. By that spring, he sent me a note and said that the Delta girls had asked him to make the speech introducing Miss Homecoming. I knew then he'd gotten his English up, because he never would have done it. You know, he would never want to go up there stumbling, and so on. But he's a good example, you see. He has just gone on and on and on. But he hates New York City. He hates the educational system. PC DH PC DH PC: DH: PC: Well, it didn't do right by him. He became a real politically oriented, anti-the-system, young person. Why does he go to the University of Mississippi? Well, what happened to him was he was the first student at Tennessee State to run for the student governorship without the endorsement of a group, because he wanted to run on an independent ticket. And Zelma George, who was at the U.N., told me once that the president of the school said to her that once in twenty years a student like this comes by. She said that he said, "He has the personality, he has the brains, but in addition, he won that election." And he said that for the first time, he felt that the student government was operating with some sense. Because he's a highly disciplined young person, you know. Well, then, he was recruited to Chrysler in that recruitment program... went into their executive management program, and they then placed him in city hall. I was there speaking once when a woman from the mayor's office saw him come in with his dashiki and his long hair and his beard and all the rest of it, and she said to me, "Well, Dan and I worked together in the mayor's office." And he said, "Well, yes, Miss So-and-So, and I've often wanted to come back and thank you, because my life had been messed up before and I got hold of it, but it wasn't until I got into your office that I realized that I didn't belong inside the system, and so I left you and Chrysler." And he said to me, "I'm not going to be a black guy in a gray flannel suit," and he said, "That's what that was." This young man could choose from a great many schools, so he has to have a reason to want to go to law school at the University of Mississippi. What is the reason? Well, as he has moved along, he did some teaching at Wayne, and some further study at Wayne. He's got a tremendous organizing ability. He's written a book on political organization or something of that sort. He became really disillusioned about big cities and about the North and so on, and he'd been saying all the time, I really want to live and work in the South. It's going to be fascinating to watch his career...ï»¿182 EH: He said,"I must go back and work In the South." PC: DH: PC: DH: ?C: DH: Well, you really will have to tell him, or have you, that you were instrumental in opening the law school. That's what I told him. And he wanted to work in Greene County for the National Council, if we had gotten a contract in there. pC: You mean on housing? The housing project? He would like that. He's done a lot of work with young people with drugs and things of that sort. He likes to work with helping people discipline themselves and organize what they're doing and that sort of thing. So, after that didn't come through, I referred him to the Lehman Scholarship Fund to see if he could get a scholarship. But he was too late at that time. So then he applied to Old Miss and he called me about ten days ago; he was so excited that they only took twenty-five out-of-state students, and he was one of them. He feels that he didn't want to go to Yale Law School or something. The point I'm making with him is that I know him quite intimately, and I could see the same thing that happened to him has happened to other black young people that I've been working with, all of whom haven't had as many positive things to take a turn. Do you see? Because what happened to him was that he was completely disillusioned, despite the fact that the Chrysler recruiter who saw me said, if he could just go find one of those each year, he would be delighted. But you see, his whole point is that it is not an accident that someone like him gets pushed through, and even held over an extra semester in the Flushing High School, and gets the feeling that they can barely make it. He was out of school a year, and he was so successful in Wall Street, and he says, "When I stop to think of it, I could have been going up and up and up in the National City Bank, and just been one more person, one more cog in the wheel." Well, he'll be somebody to watch because he'll be typical of a certain number of people in his generation. But I also think that underneath it all he is reflective of what happened to black young people. Oh, I thought that's why you brought it up, not in a miscellaneous fashion. Right. That it is, they really feel that if you go to school in Harlem right now, you can count upon the fact that the longer you stay in the school, you may be sure of being one to three years behind. So that, you just never catch up, you see. And what he saw when he got into the South was the number of young people who came into the school, and he said, some of them had never seen an inside toilet, had never been exposed to anything, and people used to laugh at them and so forth. And he said, "But you know there are cities, and I've been up North, grew up in New York, lived in my own home in Long Island, and did all these things; but I'm not prepared either." Do you see? So that there's an anger underneath it, and the thing that I see that has happened to Dan is that he has worked through a very, very militant political period.ï»¿183 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: (cont.) I went out there about four years ago...to Detroit, and he came to talk with me and I asked him, since I was doing some racial justice institutes for the YWCA, if he would speak and share with them some of the current thinking of what was going on and so forth. He brought with him a young man from DRUM. I don't know what it means, but it's an organization of workers in the auto industry, who all are sort of revolutionaries. Well, you can imagine the reaction of people when some of the women asked Dan questions about violence and things of that sort. And, without any hesitation, in as refined and gentle a voice as you'd ever want to hear, he would just say, "Well, you're in a political system, and if the system doesn't bend itself to insure freedom and equality for all people, then people have to bend the system." So they would say, "Well, what do you mean? What would you do?" He said, "X would go as far as necessary." He's young and that's fine for him to say. That's right. And so they would say "Well, now, what do you mean, 'as far as necessary?'" He said, "If it requires violence, I would say it would take violence." He said, "I do not believe in violence, but I am prepared to say that I don't know what you call Vietnam." He said, "I call that violence. And I think the United States is in there," and he went off on his view of that, you see. So what I'm trying to say is he had very clear political views of things. He's going to be able to handle whatever happens in Mississippi, because he'll understand it. It's by design he's going there, because he says, his point is that he wants to be in the kind of environment in which he hopes to work. And he wants to be a lawyer in the South, he does not want to be a lawyer in the North. And he thinks that he can be of some help to black people. Of course he can. Certainly. But he wants, therefore, to get his education and get some of the, you know, the milieu... Now, I have a piece of paper here, a Xerox, a quote of yours, from The New York Times on Friday, June 7, 1974, when there was a piece on volunteerism. And since you have a special gift and desire for using volunteers, let me quote this from you, and then we'll discuss it. I'm not going to quote the whole thing. But this article describes you and the Council, and then it quotes you. You said, "The funny thing is, at times all you need is a Band-Aid." This is an answer to somebody who said a volunteer is like a Band-Aid. "And if you don't have it, it could be crucial, and could grow into something worse. Most black women's organizations wouldn't be here at all if it weren't for volunteers," Dorothy Height continued. "You have to work in both directions, social service and change. While you work to open the doors, you have to salvage the talents, interests, and spirits of people so they will be ready to walk through those doors." Do you remember saying that?ï»¿184 Yes. Well, that's because there has been a recent challenge coming from some elements of the women's movement, who hold that volunteering is sort of a feminine activity that displaces people who might otherwise have jobs, and that if women didn't volunteer, then a society that sends a man to the moon would find a way to pay for the services that volunteers render. I happen to believe, over and beyond that, that it would be a pretty sad society if it paid for everything that was done for everyone; that volunteering and volunteerism should not be seen as over against work, that there are jobs for which people would be paid. But, for example, they were saying that all Gray Ladies in hospitals, if they were withdrawn, would be replaced with workers. There would be no hospital that could afford to have somebodyâagain, you know, their inference that voluntary activity is like giving a Band-Aid for societal need. But my point is if you need A Band-Aid, you need a Band-Aid. There's no hierarchy in terms of need. If all I need is a Band-Aid, that's a very crucial need to be met, and if it isn't met... PC: !t isn't only a Band-Aid, Dorothy Height, I don't know if they realized when they were talking to you about this, that you are a volunteer as president of the National Council of Negro Women. What kind of Band-Aid is that? DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Well, that's what I'm saying. That's the base of the organization. I'm saying that they are not willing to acknowledge that there are many different levels at which services are needed. I would take their simple thing like saying, eliminate the Gray Ladies, and say, there are things Gray Ladies do, like hand somebody a magazine or read to someone who needs to have something read to them, that, well, you couldn't afford to pay for, and it would be a very foolish use of paid time. If those women are willing to give their time and it means something to them, volunteerism is reciprocal. It's like the grandmother you discussed earlier at the Head Start program? Yes, when she was saying, "What will happen to me now? What do I have to live for?" And she's not displacing a soul from a job. Also I think they draw a finer line than I can afford to draw between service and advocacy. When we went into Mississippi and carried crayons to the Freedom Schools, that was a service; but our presence was an advocacy of the Freedom Schools. Do you see what I mean? Yes. So I can't draw that line. And when we can sit here now and look back and see all the things that have developed since, you realize that what those people needed most was something that helped them to discover their own capacities and what they could do. And what I,..ï»¿185 PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: PC: Well, Mrs. Mosley whom you talked about, and who I remember as being just sort of...she seemed like an old woman when I first met her. She seems like a middle-aged woman now. That's right. Pr â¢ And working ten times as hard. That's right. Also, when we were working on getting housing, I guess you could say that was a service. You see, they want to put the service volunteer at a low levelâwell, anyone who lives in a community, like the black community that has such critical needs, knows that it may be a service to give someone a hot meal, but it may be that if they don't get the meal, you know, they won't make it at all. So that, in all the work that we try to do in the National Council of Negro Women, it has been to say, yes, we will work to see that people get a pig to' eat, but while we're doing that, we will work on advocacy. At the Department of Agriculture, we appear on Capitol Hill in testimony, we do other things. You cannot separate. You see, it's the need for service that often tells you where an advocacy must take place. So if you talk about institutional change versus service, that often it is seeing what is needed,that you say, "Well, something's got to be done to change this." I always remember Mrs. Roosevelt's telling about her visit to the Philippines, and when she was there she saw the people down on their knees with little whisk brooms sweeping the floors. And then, when she was talking with someone, and they were saying how much tuberculosis there was, and all the diseases that people had, and she saidâ it sounded like a simple thingâbut she said, "Have you ever thought about putting longer handles on the brooms? Then they wouldn't inhale all the dust off the streets." Now, if she had never seen the people with the brooms, she wouldn't have had any idea. Do you see? She was one of the greatest volunteers of all time. At so many levels. Advocacy. Tremendous advocacy. That's right. And I heard her get an award for her years of voluntary service, at one point, and I remember her saying that she learned as a twenty-one-year-old Junior Leaguer the importance of training as a volunteer, because she learned then that, without training, she could go into a hospital, and as an untrained volunteer, undo all the good work that the doctors and nurses had done as professionals. And she urged those women that day to take training seriously, "because," she said, you need it. You are working in partnership with professionals." And that's the thing that I was feeling. Well, another thing about volunteers. You serve on a lot of boards and on some of them, I'm sure, you have wanted to get off, because you haven't gotten anything from it. On others, you told me, the amount you've learned. So, in your volunteer life, it's almost like taking courses, in some of theseâfor example, the DuPont awards, learning so much about television and television content, and how it gets on and how it doesn't get on, the whole distribution pattern, and so forth. The most recent one that I know of, what is it called, the press council?ï»¿186 DH: National News Council. pC: The National News Council. Yes. Or the one you're doing in Washington on the biology...you'd better continue. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Well, that's a federal commission on the use of human subjects for biomedical and behavior research. That has to do with the whole thing, not only of research on the fetus, but also of the wide range of ways in which human beings are made the subjects for research, and establishing good conditions of it. Well, like everyone else, when two little girls in Alabama were sterilized, I joined in the protest. And when the men at Tuskegee Institute were used as the subjects for a syphilis experimentation without their knowledge, I joined in that protest. I have learned, in working with that commission, about what informed consent is, and what the criteria would be for different protocols of research, and of the relationship between them, you know, the...well, the whole question of fetal research, intra-utero and extra-utero, and research on fetus as a result of abortion and so forth. There's a whole range of things. Did you do anything about the sterilization of the girls? Is that what you said? No. I mean, I protested that, but, you see, here is a commission that is designed to say, what should the federal government do to set up criteria. So now it's a challenge. I said that the girls' parents should have known, then you have to come through with a clear definition of informed consent. You can't just say, well, I think they should have known. What is informed consent, where people are illiterate? And who gives the information? And how do you get thatâhow do you make sure that the rights of people are being protected? This is far-reaching. Do they use 'genocide?' at all in this board, or is that a word not used by scientists? Is it an unscientific attitude? No, that would not be used. It's not used by the scientists. But we have public hearings and we hear from different groups, so we do hear___ In this committee... Oh yes...once you get out of public hearings. Actually, I would say that I am not, at the present time, a member of any board for which I do not feel that I get as much, if not more, than I put into it. Because it's one of the ways that I have an opportunity, in a sense, to work on a peer level that often is hard to find otherwise. I sit in this group of eleven persons, in the council of the National Institutes of Health. I'm one of the few lay persons, but I am representing the public interests, and so, it makes me have to read and to keep up with the materials that are submitted to me, and that sort of thing. But it also keeps me alert. What I find is that it is perfectly possible to work yourself to death, but you're simply using what you already knew. From previous experience. But I find that these boards are places where I open up another wholeï»¿187 DH: (cont.) series of brain cells. For instance, with the Council of Better Business Bureaus, there's a whole thing on the whole consumer business of fraud and all the rest, you see. One day, we'll have to take a session and run down all of these twenty-five boards you are on. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Because each one is related to some crucial facet. But for me, it's a different level of operation, I guess that's the best way I can put it. Because I learn something. I participated in a discussion last Thursday at the Lilly Foundation on volunteerism, and one of the crucial things that was being said there, that I think has to enter here, is that for a long time, the volunteer was thought of as simply the person who could afford to give some time. But you haven't thought that ever. In general, that's thought of. That's generally thought of. But you see, now at last, it has taken me a lifetime to gain recognition for the fact that a lot of people who have to work every day do give time, and have found ways to do something in that community. Do you see? And now, this has come full circle. In fact, the Foundation is setting up a consortium of foundations, five foundations, major foundations, to enter into a relationship with a group of organizations really to preserve the whole voluntary concept, feeling that as government is expanding, business and industry... Lots of places would burn up if we didn't have voluntary fire departments. That's right. A whole series of services like that, which people are delighted to do. You don't become a voluntary fireman unless that's your thing. But it will be interesting to see what they'll come up with in the Lilly Foundation. Let me go over this one second. You may not have a way of answering this. As a volunteer for the National Council of Negro Women, and as a staff member for the Young Women's Christian Association, how can you figure out how to divide your time? Fortunately, other people divide my time according to what chair I'm sitting in. I find that I can't do it that way. That's why I said it would be hard to answer. If I'm with the National Board, and there's something related to the Council, I work on it. It seldom happens the other way around, but most of the time, I have had the freedom, I suppose, that one gets after thirty years, but over the years, because of the fact that what I was expected to do in my job, I have delivered. What it has amounted to for me is that I have over the last, I would say, twelve to fifteen years, utilized most of my free time that I earned on the job in the National Council. In fact, I have. And what it has meant is that I have had practically six and a half days...ï»¿188 PC: But what do you count as days, since I know that you often will go from the National Board to the National Council at five in the evening and stay until nine o'clock or ten o'clock, or go off to another meeting from there. But, you see, I can't even go by that. Because, sometimes when I get there at five, I have spent one or two hours during the day working on something that is Council business, you see, though I'm at the National Board, maybe sitting in that chair, since people know me at both places. PC: They call you at both places. That's right. Very seldom am I called at the Council for the Y. But there's almost no time when I'm at the Y that I'm not called about the Council. Most of the time, during the day, I'm there. Last year, I did get a grant from the Field Foundation that made it possible for me, therefore, to put myself just on a very limited time with the YWCA. That expired in February, so I don't know now, I'm sort of now still half-time with the YWCA, but I'm trying to see if I can work out the Field Foundation thing. They say they'll pick it up in the fall. But in the meantime, I've got to get through this period. But the thing is that where I've come now is a place where I realize that my greatest value to the Council would be in solidifying the gains that have been made in trying to lay the base to develop a solid base for the future, and that I have enough contacts and the like that I could be more useful than only concentrating on the fund raising and that sort of thing...the undergirding. That's where I see myself moving. That's what I would like to do. And I hope that the Field Foundation could make it on a three-to five-year period, which would give me enough time to get that done. What it amounts to is that now I am pretty much about one day or a day and a half at the most at the YWCA. The only thing that is absolutely certain is that I'm on part-time pay for the YWCA, and I have been using the salary to employ other people to do that work. Because what I found was that I was simply working seven days out of seven. PC: Well, that's why I think it's important for the record, because it's a hard thing for people to understand how you possibly can do these two jobs, let alone the other boards on which you serve. DH: On all the other boards on which I serve, I represent the Council, so that many times, you see, although I'm at a board meeting, it has nothing to do with the YWCA. I'm representing the National Council of Negro Women. So what I found was that I had no time. In my job, at the YWCA, I get a week's vacation in the winter; I get a the summer, but I can't remember... PC: DH: PC: You never took it. Well, because I used it up. You see. Used it up working for the Council.ï»¿189 I used it up for Council work. So I would just charge this against my leave. So that if the Council had something and I needed to do it, I would just put myself on leave, you know, on vacation leave. So that, therefore, I was constantly using it up. I dare say it's an exceptional way of working. As I say, it's important for the record, because there aren't many people who can really do two full-time jobs. I know a lot of people who can do a lot of jobs, two hours here, not necessarily thinking about how much time, but it amounts to a certain number of hours a week on each. But it isn't a full-time thing. This is full-time, and because of the fact that I was active in the civil rights movement, the job I had in the YWCAâwhen my job shifted to the Center for Racial Justiceâbecame a little bit less strenuous. Before that, bear in mind, that I was director of the YWCA State School for Professional Workers. This meant that every summer I had five weeks out of the office when I was directing a training school. It meant that during the year I would have a week at a time when I would be directing a training event; I had to prepare the faculty and prepare the teaching materials, write the pamphlets, maintain all the contacts with educational institutions and with the network in the social welfare and educational fields. So I had a whole series of relationships that I had to maintain. Since my shift to racial justice, therefore, my participation in the leadership of the conference on civil rights became something that had double value. I can't sneak away from the job. Any judgmentâas an executive staff member, I have to exercise judgmentâI would say that a particular thing had no bearing on the YWCA, then what I would do would be simply send a relief slip and say I would be gone Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. And I've been very lucky in the kind of secretarial assistance I've had, you know, a person working with me who identified with what I was doing. I could always call my office and keep things moving, that sort of thing. But many a time, I've been out in the field, in a hotel room, and I would write what document was needed and ship that back, and I went on to something else for the Council. It's been that kind of existence... DH: Someone asked me the other day, how did I ever do it. And the only way I could think of... And when I sat down on a plane afterward, I realized what I should have said was, a lifetime of preparation has gone into this. I couldn't have started it then. Do you see? What I dis-coverd was that there might have been personal things that I might have pursued. Like everyone else, I love the theater, I love music, I love a lot of different things. But my priorities have been related to my goals. And so I've therefore been trying to say, "Well, in order to get this moving, I have to do this and I have to take this step." There have been times when the Council staff and the Y staff have been off on vacation, but I've been working. It's been that kind of thing. It reached a place where I felt last year that I simply couldn't keep that same pace, and that at the same time, that there were things thatï»¿190 DH: (cont.) I thought the Council needed that I wanted to do. PC: So you slackened off a little on one... DH: Well, the only way I could do it was that I just put in time and so my take-home pay from the Y is about the pay of a day a week. I could pretty much, by using the salary that would ordinarily be paid to me, get other people that I've contracted with to do the affirmative action institute. That's why the major piece of work done this year, in the last three months, has been out of my office. But I haven't done it personally. ^C: You've supervised it. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC PC: But only because they're cutting the staff and still cutting further, you know, I don't know how tight. I think that may not be possible in the fall, I don't know. What? The day a week, or the staff people in your office? Well, it may be, with their cutting of the staff, there might be a feeling that they can't... We're having a tremendous reduction in staff at the moment. So, I don't know, a lot depends on how we come out with assistance. They at least have to have one salaried person for my office, so there're two of us. We're left intact, but what trimming they do, and if they decide they can't contract, I don't know what will happen. This seems like every agency. I guess you don't want to go into a fresh question, but 1 have a few more civil rights questions that we could start with next time, about our sponsorship of the black civil rights students in school. Yes. I must bring you tomorrow a newspaper clipping on the death of Max Yergen, because you remember when we were talking earlier about the thirties and all, I couldn't remember... But there are dates in there about him, and about Russia and all, that go back to the National Negro Congress. You remember we were discussing that. When did he die? When was this in the paper? It was about six weeks ago. The New York Times. Must have missed it. [This is October 5, 1975.] I do think we should get onto International Women's Year at Mexico City, and then we can go back to anything you want if we have time. This is out of sync with your oral history, because the date is wrong. We were about up to 1969, and now we're going to go to the summer of 1975. But since that was your primary performance for the six months around that time, I know you have a lot to say about it. But before you tell us exactly what happened, would you give a summary of what the International Women's Year was all about?ï»¿191 DH: Well, the United Nations, over a period of time, has in different years, designated a particular emphasis. For instance, there was the whole period when it was on the elimination of racial discrimination. There have been years dedicated to particular rights that they wanted to stress. The secretary-general of the United Nations presented to the General Assembly, with considerable prodding from many of the women's groups in different parts of the world, the idea that 1975 should be designated as International Women's Year, and that it would take as its theme equality, development and peace, stressing the three essential elements in which, it was felt, women and the achievement of the rights of women would make some contribution. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Unfortunately, the action got through the General Assembly late, and as a result, there was not the kind of funding for it that would have been hoped. The different member nations were called upon to take a hand in the celebration, and to appoint missions, and to make it a worldwide celebration. One of the elements that was thought crucial was to have an International Women's Year Conference, bringing together women from all parts of the world and having the governments themselves represented, to consider the status of women, the rights of women, but also the involvement of women in all aspects of their government and national life. That was the U.N. group. Yes. And the United States was therefore called upon to set up a commission. Unfortunately, it delayed again. Women's groups in this country petitioned in all sorts of ways, urging the early appointment of the official commission to determine what the United States would do in observance of International Women's Year. But it wasn't until late April that the commission was appointed. It sounds like there was resistance. Well, a kind of... I suppose it wasn't so much resistance in the strict sense as it was a way of just not moving to do anything about it. The argument that came back was that there were no appropriations that came with the action, that it was hard to determine what steps were to be taken, and the like. So it's that kind of thing that you see when there's reluctance to tackle the issues. But eventually a delegation of women were sent. No, there were two different things. The International Women's Year celebration and observance is a 365-day observance. The International Women's Year Conference held in Mexico City was an official governmental conference in which the governments sent delegations. Now the United States Commission for the Observance of International Women's Year is headed by Jill Ruckelshaus. It is made up of men and women of many different backgrounds. The delegation to the United Nations International Women's Year Conference was headed by Pat Hutar and by Mr. Parker. Oh, that was different. Jill Ruckelshaus was the overall chairman. One is the overall commission, which is still in existence, the Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year. The other wasï»¿192 DH: (cont.) the official delegation of the United States to the United Nations International Women's Year Conference. One is a delegation, and one is a commission. And the delegation was the official representative body. That's just five persons. PC: From the entire United States, there were five official... DH: Right. And then they had with them a lot of consultants and the like. PC: And each country had approximately five people? DH: Something like that. PC: So it was really a small group compared to the other tribune. DH: The tribune was set up to respond to the widespread interest that women showed in the International Women's Year Conference. It was unstructured; it was open to any woman who would come and register and participate, and it had no registration fee or anything of that kind. It was really very open, and it attracted close to 6,000 women from 132 countries. â PC: Men and women, or only women in that one? DH: Predominantly women. There were a few men. Now in the official con- ference, many of the delegations... in fact, most of them included men. As a matter of fact, I think the delegations were predominantly men. Of course, I suppose when you stop to think about it, that's one way of bringing about change, to have those who are in the positions of power in their countries do something about what the conference was about. And at this point in time, those people are predominantly men. Now most of the delegations had women in them, but the heads of many major delegations were men. Well, take the United States. There was considerable protest when Mr. Parker was designated. PC: PC: Yes, that was what was reported. DH: But Mr. Parker was designated because he heads AID* which is involved with implementing the Percy amendment to involve women in the development of their countries. So that, in a sense, you need Mr. Parker to help assure that whatever takes place is put back through the channels of our country. Well, the same thing was true of other countries, as I saw many of the men who were there as delegates. It was because they were, in their own countries, in positions that would have a great deal of influence and, I suppose, the reason you needed International Women's Year is that around the world, the key decision-making posts are in the hands of men. Now, if we had had sort of a rump session, and left all of those people home, the plan of action that was adopted would have been less effective. But weren't many of the women, particularly of the tribune, annoyed that men were representing the women at a women's conference...a so-called International Women's Conference? *Agency for International Developmentï»¿193 Yes. It's like everything else. Many of the women spent a lot of time just protesting the delegations. There was a group from our country who protested, saying that they were the unrepresented, and that our delegation wasn't representative. They appealed to me even on the plane going down to join with them. My position was, and still is, that the delegations to an official international body are designated by the heads of their governments, and once that is done, and you get on territory outside of the United States, there's no need of standing at the door and saying, "We demand another delegation." Those people have been chosen, and they were there. And my position was that we should make them responsive to what we wanted. Before we left home, many of us had asked for changes in the delegation, but there was no need of going at that when you got there. Now from another angleâlook at it politically. What good would it have done to have had all the women of the world meeting together talking to themselves? There were men who were secretaries of state, or heads of major parts of their governments, who were there, who therefore had to hear. You know, they were present. They were the ones who had to take a stand. So that it's like saying International Women's Year is not about women; it's about equality of partnership and opportunity of men and women. So I think that a lot of the women who went on about the fact that there should be no men here and so forth were thinking that this was an international feminist movement. PC: DH: PC: DH: Yes, I suppose so. Which was not what it was at all. It was a movement to say, "The governments of our countries, the private sectors of our countries, business and industry, every element of the country, is to open up opportunities for women." Now if you're going to do that, you have to get some of those who are in positions of power moving in that direction. President Echeverria of Mexico took a very strong stand, and his wife took a very strong stand in this direction. Yet what's very interesting, a Mexican man headed that delegation. Was his wife also a member of the delegation? Or did she just come along? No, she spoke at the opening meeting, and she was very vigorous, very good. I don't know whether she was a delegate or not, but I know that there was a man heading the delegation. I suppose that one of the things that happens to me is, as a victim of both racism and sexism, I learned as a black American that if you only had the blacks talking about the future, you didn't have a change model. You could build up your own cult, you could get yourselves moving. But one of the reasons that people looked at people like Lyndon Johnson was that here was a man who listened. Now he might not have had everything right, but he listened to that, you see. He had to use the office of the president of the United States to take certain positions. And that was the difference between him and Eisenhower. Eisenhower just never moved. He wouldn't even meet a delegation.ï»¿194 PC: No, neither would some of the succeeding men. DH: No. But the point was, the contrast was so great because here you had a person in a position of influence. Now that means that a person in that position knew immediately that what you were asking him was to use the power of that position. And it's not because these were males; it is that those were the people in those key positions in those countries, And so the question was how to make use of that. Mr. Parker did some ceremonial appearing, and then he disappeared and Pat Hutar took over. PC: I thought maybe he disappeared because he had been so hooted, because that was the way it was reported in the United States. DH: Well, a small group, led by some of the young black women from CORE and two or three others, started this idea of getting the mike and hooting him down and the rest. Unfortunately, the press simply responded to them. PC: Well, it's the usual thing, to pick up that irritation any place. Yes, it did not report any of the other steps that were taken, the way people were working. PC: DH: PC: DH: Did you know that when you were there? Oh yes. PC: And there were reporters who were there...was it their way, or was that the interpretation once the story got on the wire? Did you feel sympathy among the reporters, or were they not understanding? The reporters would go wherever there was excitement. And there were two or three from there from papers who would say, "Well, I'm trying to get a real story." But, you see, what I heard had happened there was such a contrast to reality. That had happened, but it wasn't the only thing. PC: They only reported the unrest, not the progress that might have been made. That's right. You could never have told from the paper, what it was. Some of us were so concerned that we organized a full panel in response to some of the Mexican women, who asked us to do so because of the fact that there was this pressure. Since it was agreed to let any Mexican woman come who wanted to, it meant that we got a disproportionate number of women out of Mexico, and that many of them came into the conference sort of fighting their intra-feminist battles. You had some in-group fighting among those groups, so that one group of Mexican women shouted down another group. So some of us set up a whole panel to discuss the importance of women recognizing their common problems and working together in unity, and that unity did not mean uniformity, but there had to be this working together. Some of these same people came to shout down that group. Some of this same disrupting element?ï»¿195 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Right. So that therefore, that's what got the attention. You never would have known that there were so many women working in another direction. How would you evaluate the way in which the conference and the tribune worked and what might come out of it? I think it was very significant that people began to get some sense of their differences. There were women there from Communist countries, as well as from other socialist countries, as well as capitalist countries. There was a really strong anticapitalism, antiimperialism thrust that kept swelling. I think there was a recognition on the part of women from western countries of the real difference in the life experience in third world countries, the less developed countries. I think that this was one of the values of the conference because while, for example, women from the United States were talking about advancing in jobs or advancing in work, the women in less developed countries were talking about how do you create activities that will produce income. They're not even up to thinking about jobs. Or, we were talking about work in one sense and those women were pointing out that they never show up in any labor statistics. But women who have to carry water two miles up and two miles back for whatever they and their children drink, whether they are sick, pregnant, or whatever, are involved in work. And there is just not a feeling of being at ease or willing to just let it be said that we're the working women. See, it's the whole concept of... You mean you're not just a working woman if you work for pay. You're working because there's no other way to exist. That's right. And the World Plan of Action has, oh, close to 200 different items in it. And those were... And that came out of this conference? Out of the international conference. I think that's going to be the important thingâto see how women work now to implement it. Well again, aren't they going to need the men to implement it? I don't mean women work, I mean how countries work. In other words, it is thought that in almost every country there needs to be some agency that's looking at the question of the rights of women, their legal rights, their property rightsâall rights related to women and their opportunities. One of the recommendations was that in the office of the secretariat of the United Nationsâwhich agency seems to be as bad as anything, it is predominantly maleâthat there be an undersecretaryship which would be designated to work on the implementation of the World Plan of Action, as it advances women. So the very same organization that sponsored it is being told to get on the ball. That's right. There was a very strong speaking to that. And Helvi Sipila, who is in the office of the secretary-general of the Unitedï»¿196 dh: pc: dh: pc: dh: pc: dh: pc dh pc dh pc dh (cont.) Nations, was very forthright in acknowledging that the United Nations has a great distance to go. I think they're going to be pressed to really move. She's always been very good, hasn't she? Oh she's good, yes. So if there were a few people like that on the delegations, then there might be motions. But the thing that worries me is that you're not on our delegation. I can't say it's very exciting that Mr. Parker is on our delegation, even though men make things move, because he's not creative. So who do we have who was exposed to this? Well, Jewel Lafontant, who is in the delegation, is a very good person. Pat Hutar is another. Very good? I don't know her. Very good. That's in the core group, but then it was in the overall group of about thirty that those who cla im that the delegation wasn't representative demanded the members speak because they said, "You do not have the diversity." But it was very interesting that as that delegation came forward and told something about themselves, and who they were, even those who had begun to heckle realized that they had made a mistake, because person after person could identify herself as coming up out of a trade union movement, or as being an active person in civil rights, and so on. So that while it wasn't the kind of delegation I would have selected, I think that it was more representative than would meet the eye. That is, representative of economic and social backgrounds. It did not have as much diversity, racial and ethnic diversity, as one would have wished that it had. But it did have it. I think that the pressure that was placed on them by those protest groups has forced some growth. There is probably much more awareness in that group; and it showed itself all the way through. Well, they were just on the hot seat the whole conference through. The delegation called several meetings with women's organizations during the time that we were there and asked to have some opportunity to talk together, and there was real exchange. Who appointed that delegation? The president. And so the president, didn't he understand that he might have a Spanish-speaking representative. He did have. He did? Yes, what I'm saying is that some of the charges that were made were not well founded. The people on there were not that well known, do youï»¿197 DH: (cont.) understand? PC: Sure. Â°H: So that therefore... PC: And was there a black person on that delegation? Â°H: Jewel Lafontant was one of the top three. She is a black woman who was the assistant solicitor to the solicitor general of the United States. She's a lawyer from Chicago, a very able person. I guess some of her relatives were from Haiti, so I guess it was a French [background]... Pc: Well, you're certainly not negative about this experience. It's such a complicated thing to try to get on the record. There are very few people who understood the difference between the United Nations forum and the tribune, and the papers rarely made it clear who was making what noises, and where. DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Well, some of the protest... for example, when the whole thing about Mrs. Rabin and Sadatâthat all took place over at the United Nations Conference. I was over at the tribune with the masses. PC: I know you were with the masses. [laughter] And you'll have to tell me what other kinds of people came to the bigger program, but first of all, what was our [NCNW] special role in it? Our special role was with the tribune, not with the conference. DH: With the tribune. We were funded to bring a group of women from African countries and Latin America and the Caribbean together at the tribune for the opportunity to have them meet together and to look at the concerns that were on the agenda, really from the viewpoint and perspective of black and other third world women. And that proved to be quite a great thing, because it offered an opportunity to get together on a fairly regular basis. We took a large hotel suite, and we were able to come together and talk over what was happening and strategize on different people going to different sessions, and kept up with what was going on. We pretty much followed the agenda. When it was discussing community development, we discussed that, and when it discussed the family, or rural population, and things of that sort... Did any other women from the third world come in to our part of it? Oh yes. Our group, which was only supposed to have been about thirty, was really never fewer, I guess, than fifty or sixty. There were always people being addedâpeople of all backgrounds, who heard about it and wanted to come. We held a pretty steady group together, but we had what we called the American Counterparts, and those were the people who kind of stayed with it. We had a full house at all times. How long would our sessions be? Our sessions would be about two, two and a half hours.ï»¿198 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: Were they useful for getting the complaints, and trying to interpret them into how to ask a question, the way we would do sometimes in the South? Well, yes, in one sense, they were. But in another sense, they were more useful in giving people a chance to talk intimately with each other. See, bear in mind that the tribune sessions, in the general sessions, would have been a group of 1,000 to 1,500 people. So there people could get to ask a question, and though it was interesting to hear the questions for us, there was simultaneous translation of all speeches that were made, so that with the translation in the picture, it meant that the process was somewhat slowed. But our sessions gave them a chance to sit in a small room and talk with each other. Was ours translated also? Because we had women of different languages... We had an interpreter who we employed to stay with us throughout the whole period. Spanish or French? She was Spanish-speaking, because our need was for Spanish. But then later, when we had a French-speaking woman there, she brought her own interpreter, and we also had a French interpreter. So we had interpreters at all our meetings. And they could talk, and in the big session, they had to listen. They couldn't get together. You couldn't call on everybody, so that's really what I meant by frustrations in a wayâthat you couldn't take part, or you wouldn't know how to handle yourself in such a big group. But I thought perhaps you, being a master at this kind of thing, would be able to get them into the bigger session, too. But maybe there's just no chance, they couldn't talk. Well, I think they felt freer having been in our sessions. But a number of women were on the program. They were asked to be speakers or panelists? They would sometimes sort of use our small group as a sounding board for what they were going to do and that sort of thing. Nobody from NCNW was on the official delegation, is that right? No. Did you make any effort to get anybody from NCNW on the official delegation? That comes another way entirely. That's a government, a strictly White House appointment. And truthfully, all the time, our emphasis was on the tribune. So you really wouldn't have had a desire to be in the smaller conference.ï»¿199 DH: We could not have done the thing we were doing had we been in the con- ference. As a matter of fact, I never went over there. PC: Really? You were just too busy in the other part of the city? Our group of womenâwhat did we call them then?âour Seminar on Third World Women. I think I know how it was funded, but perhaps you should tell about it. DH: PC: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Actually it was funded through the women's program of the Agency for International Development, and we, with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, were the two organizations who were funded. The Association for the Advancement of Science was funded to do a precon-ference conference. So they held a meeting for several days before Mexico City, at which they brought together about ninety-nine scientists from all around the world, and they looked at the women's issues. This was all in Mexico City? oh yes. So we were one of the two conferences funded by AID. The AAAS did that preliminarily, and then their arrangement was that after Mexico City, they would have regional meetings in the Caribbean, in Africa and so forth. So as I understand it, they are now finishing up those regional meetings. That's still AID-funded. Did AID put down any requirements of what foreign women NCNW chose? No. We cleared, at some points, to get contact with the missions in the different countries. And there were a number of people who were suggested to us through the organizers of the tribune, because they knew of women in the different crafts that they were expected to use as speakers or the like, and they were glad to cooperate with us. So we worked that way. It was a tough job putting that group together. I would think so. Because the timing was so short. Because here again, we had just about a month after we knew we definitely had the money. To get women from all parts of the world. We started working. But, you see, a thing like thisâappropriations for this had to go to the Congress. Then after it goes to Congress, you have to wait fifteen days, and if there's no objection, you can move. It was kind of a new experience, you know. I know this is not particularly relevant, perhaps, but I wondered if these women understood enough about NCNW to bring the word back to their countries, and to become a part of us in some way or other. Well, I think they became interested in us, because in addition to Mexico City, after the conference, we brought them into the United States, where they visited groups in Mississippi, and they had a chance to see what weï»¿200 (cont.) were doing with feeding programs, and housing, and things of that sort. And then we left there and went to Daytona Beach, Florida, where we were part of the 100th anniversary of Mrs. Bethune. So all of this meant that they had more then just the cursory talking. They had a chance to see people, to visit. And to see what we did in action. I want a little more depth on that, but before that, "the third-world women"âtell me a little bit about them. For example, a woman from Senegal was one of our women, I believe. Is that right? Yes. Yes. She is a vice-president of the Economic and Social Council and, professionally, she is a midwife in her own countryâa very interesting woman. Another woman was the chief of police from Uganda, and wherever we went, people would say to her, "How do you handle arrests?" and so forth. And she would let them know that she was the superintendent, she was the chief executive of the police department. Another woman was a chief from Zambia. What kind of chief? A tribal chief? A tribal chief, and a member of the parliament. Another woman from the Ashanti region of Ghana was the regional YWCA staff person, but a person acting as the developer of arts and crafts. Another one was the president of the Caribbean Women's Association. She came from Trinidad. One from the Bahamas is the president of the senate, the first woman. There was a woman from the ECA* which is a unit under the United Nations dealing with all the economic development of the African countries. With her was another young woman, who was here from Ethiopia, whose husband was working with the United Nations. She herself is a trained agriculturist. One is from Ethiopia? They both were working in Ethiopia, but she is from Nigeria, I believe. But the point was that she was in Ethiopia because her husband is stationed there with the United Nations, and the United Nations will not have more than one member of the family on the job. So she gave up her work to go with her husband. I had a letter from her just a few days ago, saying that since that conference she had the courage to talk with her husband about their both going some place where the two of them could be working, because she's too highly trained to be doing nothing. Another woman was from the Department of Health in Nigeria. They were all women of some competency you know. I would think so. It sounds like it. They weren't just observers; they were a part of their own scene, and knew what their country wanted, needed, and so on. And probably some of them had an understanding of more countries. When someone's from the Bahamas, that represents several islands, doesn't it? Yes, sure it does. And there was another you mentioned, the woman from Senegal, she represents something more than Senegal, she represents something more than * Economic Commission for Africaï»¿201 PC: (cont.) Senegal, wouldn't you say? ^H: She was a vice-chairperson of the Economic and Social Council. PC: oh, I guess it is just her country. But anyway, even if they didn't represent more than one, they learned a lot about each other through this constant contact. DH: oh yes. They appreciated that because it gave them a chance to get to know one another on a more intimate basis. PC: Who was Spanish-speaking in this group? DH: PC: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: A young woman from the Dominican Republic. She operates an arts and crafts center, and they do all these macrame bags and things of that sort. PC: Well, you would not be expected to know each one, but that gives us a good profile, an idea of who they were. There was no one there who wasn't a trained working woman, skilled. Yes, there was no one there who wasn't skilled. The woman from Botswana had developed a high fashion dress business. She had taken a sewing machine, and she had learned how to sew, and she taught others how to sew. She developed this high fashion dress business. High fashion for Africa, or high fashion international? For Botswana. It's all African dress. Well, I guess I haven't even any idea what that would be other than a beautiful robe and a turban. Well, all kinds, using the African prints. She has all kinds of special styles of dresses that African women would wear, but also women of any other part of the world would want to wearâthe caftans, all the wide range. So hers was a business. Many of them were in services of some specialized nature. Right, most of them. One was a young lawyer from Guyana. She was quite a specialist on women's rights. Was there a great difference in age range for those women that were in our group? Because sometimes you can't understand problems if there's a big difference in the age. Well, there was a wide range in age, and a wide range in education, too. There was a young woman from Tanzania, very highly skilled in community development and that sort of thing. She was one of the younger women. They were fairly youngâI guess maybe the world is fairly young. Their part of the worldâat least the people who would come out, who would dare and who would have jobs of that sort. But there wasn't such aï»¿202 PC: (cont.) difference in education as to make communications hard? DH: No. PC: You might have bumped into all of those problems; they might have hit us in the head. But either you chose well, or you were lucky, I don't know which. DH: I think you also have to bear in mind that when you're in a group of 6,000, and you come into a group of forty or fifty, and you have a chance to have close contact with people, to talk about problems that you're interested in, to share experiences and to learn something, that a lot of those differences of age or whatever... PC: They disappear. All right. Now, we started to talk about the Mississippi trip, and I stopped you because I wanted a more elaborate background of who you took to Mississippi. They went to three placesâJackson, Ruleville and Okolona, is that right? DH: Well, we went first to Jackson. And there on the morning of the Fourth, we had Patt Derian and Aaron Shirley and Clarie Harvey to speak. Clarie more or less brought greetings, Patt Derian talked to themâand this was really a briefing sessionâshe talked to the group about some of the perspective of the white woman in the South and of the white South. And she, of course, went back to tell them how much it meant when the National Council [of Negro Women] came with Wednesdays in Mississippi, and she could tell that story from the vantage point of someone who was there. She paid tribute to you, and said what Polly Cowan had meant, coming in and keeping the lines open, and opening up and sitting down and talking with people. And how it was that white women living there in Jackson knew that awful things were going on, but had no feeling of personal identity with itâthat you could be in a community, and know that there was a great pattern of injustice, but you didn't feel responsible because, m a sense, none of the nice people you knew were dealing with that. But she felt that one thing that happened with those teams of Wednesdays m Mississippi was that more people began to ask questions and to be inter ested in what was going on on the other side of town. She felt that, in the way the system had been supported was by keeping white women a sense, LUC way Lilt -------r- r--------- , pedestal, or keeping them at least feeling that they were on a pedes on a VJll CI pCUCOLOX) -----------------~ , , tal. So from this position, a false security and false prideâin a sense, they just lived a kind of artificial life. She said that she thought that one of the hopeful things was what we were doing at that time, and she did a very good job of tracing this history. Pc: She talks very well and sympathetically. I would think they would have really listened to what she had to say. DH: Yes, and she could say it from her own vantage point. She was going off then to something the Democratic Party was doing and she told them the whole political climate and issues. Aaron Shirley, as a black doctor of course, talked only of some of the problems, health and the like. He was able to focus attention upon the fact that the political situation is in such bad shape, and that people, feeling so powerless, were tending not to look at it to see how they could best organize their efforts. Whatï»¿203 (cont.) he felt was that as the lines are drawn now, and people are looking and saying things are better, that they did not want to lose ground. He had heard that the governor's wife had received our delegation at the governor's mansion the day before, as we arrived. He seemed to have been fearful that the visitors would take this to mean that the state of Mississippi was just that great and generous. But he illustrated his point by saying that they have not been able to get the support for a clinic and some things that they had wanted, and that there was a great deal of making gestures, but very little going behind it and doing the things that need to be done. A young black fellow who represented the governor's office was present, and Dr. Shirley sort of put him on the spot, but an interesting thing happened. Someone asked him how old he was when we were there in 1964, and I think he said he was eleven years old; he was one of the children in those Freedom Schools, you see. So that in many respects, the women were just absolutely excited about this conversation. pr â¢ Had they felt that their reception at the governor's house meant that things were particularly good? dh: PC DH dh PC dh PC dh Well, you were always hesitant, lest you seem to be glossing over. But what I had pointed out to the women was that a few years ago, that was an armed camp, and for the governor's wife to come personally and for them to hold the governor's mansion open after hoursâthey have tours like the White House tours and they held everybody on the staff there for usâwas at least a different kind of recognition. Yes, I've never been in the governor's mansion. And that they were proud to have these international visitors. PC: They were? DH= Yes. PC Was it in the Jackson Clarion Ledger as an item? I think so. I don't know; at least it was afterward. I don't know whether they put it in before or not. Who arranged that, Dorothy? There is now a black man on the staff of the governor. This same young one, or still another one? Still another man, and he is the community relations, or whatever they call it, for the governor. All of which, you see, shows that since blacks have the vote...well, before it was as if the blacks weren't there. And sothis man had arranged it. Mrs. Mosley [of NCNW] had talked with him, and she took charge of the whole thing. Later in the afternoon, out at Tougaloo College, they had a community picnic, and all the families cameï»¿204 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: (cont.) and brought their picnic baskets. Some brought their own baskets and others joined in the food with us. And it was really quite an exciting thing. Oh, it was very well done then. Yes, it was really very nice. From Jackson, the next morning we went by bus to Cleveland, Mississippi. Which is in the Delta, isn't it? Which is in the Mississippi Delta, in Bolivar County. And there we went directly to the housing development that we had worked on with Mr. Amzie Moore. This is the one place in the Mississippi Delta where the South Delta Economic Development Corporation had placed in the housing development a bronze plaque naming it The Height Community Center. So they were very much interested. Plus the people told about what the housing meant, and... The people living in the housing? People living in the housing, yes. One of the local women catered a very good luncheon, and told us the story of how she got her business going. She didn't have work, and she had lost her husband and she had two young twin boys, and she had to do something about it. So she told them how she started her business and the success of her business. Did that register with the delegation? Oh yes, they found it very, very interesting. And I think one of the things that kept happening was that things like that would happen which, in a sense, gave these women a deeper appreciation of what it means when women like the National Council of Negro Women do something. Many of these women had been in the United States or had been related to other kinds of international efforts. Usually they saw the upper middle class people. They had no opportunity to talk with people like this, and I think it took away that feeling that they haveâwell, you people have everything, so you have it made. They had a firsthand chance to go in and talk to people. They went into homes and were able to see the families. People would tell them something about what they were doing before, and what they were doing now. So that was a really rural experience. We went into Ruleville, and Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer and some of the women took us to see some of the pigs. This being a kind of a holiday weekend, the Fourth of July, we got into one place, at Drew I think it was, where a family was having a reunion and had roasted one of the pigs. Mrs. Hamer commented that until things began to get better down in Mississippi, no one would have ever thought of bringing all of their relatives from all over the United States. There were, I guess, seventy or eighty relatives. They couldn't have fed them.ï»¿205 DH: And they couldn't have fed them. And she said, to have a pig and that sort of thing... PC: Did they have community gardens there, too? DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: DH: We ran into terrible rains, so we could not go into the gardens, but we did pass some of them. P^: But those were also a NCNW program. That's right, these were all self-help programs. Our whole thing was to show them self-help programs in which we were involved. Then in the evening, we went into Indianola, to that housing development, and again met with the people and talked with them. There is a similar housing project in Indianola? Yes. And there's a pig program and self-help feeding program? Yes. And also we went to Ruleville to the Fannie Lou Hamer Day Care Center. So they really had an experience of seeing what could be done, even though it took a lot of effort. Yes. And so it really was very exciting. They had a chance to ride around and talk about this. When they were in JacksonâI meant to ask you thisâdid they go to Liberty House? I was thinking of this woman who was in design. When we came back, we went to Liberty House. From Ruleville and Cleveland and all, we went down to Okolona. They had a special community program at the church on Sunday afternoon. Then on Monday, we did a full-day workshop at Okolona. At that, everyone had a chance to talk about things that they were concerned about. Here was where they began to lift up some of the particular issues about the legal rights of women, about what is involved in helping women to create income-producing activities. And they began to pick up on some of the things that they were seeing that they thought might be valuable, that they could utilize. I was interested that on the final morning in Daytona Beach, as they were talking about looking toward going home, they began to say, "Well, we may not be able to use pigs, but we can develop rabbits or some other thing. We could develop feeding programs." And, you know, they began to take that on from that angle. Pf â¢ Did any of the other things that we are doing have any relationship? Would they be interested in day care? Very much interested in day care and child care. A problem, of course, is seeing how such things are developed where you do not have necessarily government subsidy, how those programs can be sustained. This is the kindï»¿206 DH: (cont.) of thing you have to deal with. PC: But at least they did see that you needn't be a person with much income to have this. It's a right, not a privilege. Â°H: That's right. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: When you have no money to start with, it's a whole other story. But they sounded like creative people who might, in some of these countries at any rate, be able to figure it out. Well, you went from Okolona to... After the Okolona workshop session, we took a very special scenic routeâ it's a trail that the Indians had through very picturesque countryâand so we took that drive back to Jackson. Were there three or four cars, is that how you did it? We used a bus. And then when we got to Jackson, of course, the women always like to go shopping. So they did shopping and things of that sort. And then in the evening, Mrs. Mosley had a group of women from different fields in the community, education, health and so on, and those women had an evening just of recreation before the next morning when we took off for Daytona Beach. As we came out of Jackson and changed planes in Atlanta for Daytona Beach, a young group in Atlantaâthe new [NCNW] section of Atlantaâhad arranged with Eastern Airlines to have a little reception for us. It was very nice, a nice interlude. Very interesting, a young woman who is the president of the new sectionâshe was about thirtyâ she had women of all age groups come down, and they had refreshments. We had about an hour and a half in the airport, and then we left there and came into Daytona Beach, Florida. We got into Daytona Beach just in time to let people have a day of rest. And then the next day was July 10, the hundredth birthday of Mrs. Bethune, and all that day was spent with Bethune- Cookman College. What do you mean, spent with? In their activities? Well, we started in the morning with breakfast. After the breakfast, they had an opening service, and then a panel discussion, and then a laying of a wreath at the graveside. Then they had a sightseeing tour of the whole college campus. In the evening, there was a public meeting where the governor spoke. Jimmy Carter? Governor Askew. Then the next day, we did our own workshop, a kind of following up on the things that... Women from Africa and the Caribbean spoke about some of their concerns, drawing upon their Mississippi experience and others. But they shared from different countries. They were debriefing themselves in a way, weren't they? Yes. And then we had an opportunity for them to work in small groups to come up with some ideas of what they wanted to do, and the like. Weï»¿207 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) divided then by continentsâso we had all of the North Americans, then the South Americans, and Caribbeans, and the Africansâand each group brought a series of ideas, of recommendations for use when they went back home. Saturday afternoon was a kind of an opportunity for some people to visit Disneyland. NASA invited us to come to see Apollo XV that was about to be launched, and so some of us went there, and it was a kind of afternoon of relaxation. On Sunday morning, we took a couple of hours to pull together the recommendations that had come from the different groups, and to make some projections for the future, and then everybody took off. A number of them came to Washington and since they came up to Washington, Howard University had a farewell luncheon. I guess about twelve came. The others went directly home because it was easier for them to go directly home than to come to Washington. But those who were going out from the Eastern seaboard came. To back up a second, the group suggestions by continent remind me of the workshops in Atlanta,* when you divided people up by states. It was a very important occasion, because it was when the women from the state of Mississippi asked us to come in and do something. So something likeâ I don't expect that particular thingâbut something can come out of that kind of division where the women begin to know what they want and where they need help, where we or somebody else could begin to help them, or they could help themselves. So I think that must have really been special. I'm sure you will have all that in a report. Well, there will be a report, and they're working on it now. Now, there's a story you told me, and I cannot fit it into this sequence, of the woman from Senegal when she was shopping. Yes, while we were in Daytona Beach, Madame Senghor from Senegal, along with a Mrs. Dialloâwho happens to be the secretary for the Organization for African Unity, working here in New York, she is from Sierra Leoneâwith Madame Senghor's interpreter, who is French-speaking, went out shopping. While they were in a department store there called Days, I think it was, a clerk accused her of stealing a $2.59 jar of bath lotion. And, when the interpreter tried to interpret her speaking French, the woman disregarded that and said she couldn't trust what she was saying, and called the police. The police then sent Madame Senghor in their automobile. While Mrs. Diallo and the rest of them tried for three hours to convince them that they had not stolen this. It got to be such a bad thing that this very distinguished woman, who is vice-president of the Economic and Social Council, just wept. They were distraught. Where were you at that moment? We were at the hotel and, unfortunately, we were busy working with plans for the next day's meeting, when they appeared. They came to say that this *This was in Atlanta in March 1963. Women of five organizations and many states came to talk of brutality to women and young people in jail.ï»¿208 dh: PC dh PC dh PC dh: PC: DH: PC: (cont.) terrible thing had happened. While they were there, they didn't call or anything, so we called the store. We did everythingâcalled Washington, called the State Department, and of course, she called the Senegalese embassy. So between it allâthe embassies and all the talking and working on itâwe then appealed to Mr. Hueger, who's a member of the city council and who is on the faculty of Bethune-Cookman College. He traced down and found the manager and the owner of the store. After that, the store said they would take responsibility for it, and that they were sorry that this had happened. But what we insisted was, that they make a public apology, and not just one under cover. So, on the Saturday morning, the men came out, and it was very interesting because the owner spoke firstâbut before making his speech, he offered prayer. He just said, "Let us pray," you know, showing that he was a good Christian. And he prayed this long prayer. Then afterwards, he had the manager to speak and the manager apologized, and said that he didn't know what to say, but he took responsibility for the incident, and what did we intend to do. Madame Senghor was great, because in her response, she pointed out that it was probablyâand she of course spoke in French through an interpreterâ that probably while he said this was his position, he had not made this clear to his employees. And she also said that perhaps the thing to bear in mind is that money knows no color. And she accepted his apology. But you can understand the great complicationâDaytona Beach and Washington, with her government and her embassy, and our government must have been frantic. It was really something. And did she ever really forgive... She accepted his apology. For us, it was a terrible embarrassment...for the National Council. Why, of course. And for the state of Florida, which claims to be a liberal state. Of course, I don't know what kind of a salesperson this was; and you have no way of knowing whether she was a racist person, or what. Well, I think the thing that you have to bear in mind is something that Dorothy Moses of India taught me a long number of years ago when she was here, and she and I got separated from each other, down in Knoxville, Tennessee. She had to call the YWCA because she was arrested. .And she was arrested because she was looking in a store window. What the chief of police finally said, when he apologized, was that when he asked his arresting officer, he said he thought she was a gypsy. I think that's the thing you have to bear in mind about these people. They saw a woman in African dress... I was going to ask you, Madame Senghor Was in African dress? And still it happened? They thought she was a gypsy or something. You were going to say the terrible thing is the embarrassment, and the other women must have identified with her, because all the women were third world women, so all the women were of some color or other.ï»¿209 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: And to think that a young clerk could go this far, and could discredit the French interpreter. Yes, that's another strange thing. She said, "How do I know what she said?" The young woman said, "I am an interpreter." But she was black too, and so I guess she didn't know that there were French-speaking blacks. I don't know. Well, you had to get that out of their minds. What were you able to do since it came so late in the trip? How were you able to overcome that? No. You see, you have to bear in mind the whole thing. The fact is that we stayed on it, that we didn't just let it drop. We kept pursuing, who can we get, and we got Mr. Hueger. The man first called and said, "I want to come and apologize to you." But she said, "I don't want you to just apologize to me. You'll have to apologize to this whole group." So it was a way, I think, that they felt all other women who were there were sympathizing with them, and were suggesting this, and doing the other. I think it was the fact that we acted. Yes, but we, being all black (just about), still doesn't help the feeling that there's racism in an act like this. Oh, there's no way to cover that up. No. It was very clear. So everything that had happened along the way, like the governor of Mississippi giving the reception for you, all these lovely things, and then a little clerk proves what everybody's had to work against___ Yes, well I made a point, too, which she picked up in her comment, which was that while we were busy celebrating Mrs. Bethune's anniversary and enjoying it, that perhaps this was a reminder that there was still work to be done, that all was not well, and that we should not just work on the surface of things. So that kind of got to be the mood that people had. Because on the surface it looks so much better than it used to be. Yes, so that you just couldn't sit back and say, "Now things are so good." No. Did any of them stay on in Washington after you wound up the trip? The woman from the Dominican Republic did. Mrs. Mboya from Nairobi, from Kenya. They stayed for a day or two. Did you ever receive letters from them? Did you get a feeling of what this meant to them, this extra experience? Yes. Those who have responded have said it was very valuable, and they were glad to meet some of the poor Americans and to go to some of the rural areas, you see. And then, places like Hodding Carter's paper down in Greensville, Mississippi, did a full story on it. You have to bear in mind that people in Mississippi were quite excited, because people like this don't come to Mississippi.ï»¿210 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: So there were many people who came who weren't black people, who just were there to see people from other countries, other continents, other places. Yes, as a matter of fact, Hodding Carter's paper assigned a reporter to us the whole time we were in Okolona, who then wrote up a very good story. Because, you see, not long ago, you would have been whisking international visitors out of Mississippi, rather than taking them in. So this was very important, and I think people appreciated it. Well, I have talked to Patt. Patt and Hodding Carter worked very closely on the whole piece along withâI'm not sure Aaron Henry is still as active, because I don't know about his health. Yes, he's still active. Those three and the mayor, Charles Evers, of Fayette. Well, that's four people who tried to move Mississippi, so you have a balance there, tooâtwo whites and two blacks. Mrs. Hamer was interesting also. She came along, and she was very strong in saying to people that we had over 4,000 pigs down there, and that the good thing was that these were things that were needed and were lasting. She did. She doesn't work with us anymore, does she? She doesn't work with us, no. Does she work anywhere, or is she retired? She called the other day and asked if she could have her job back. Did you talk to her? Yes, we talked. We don't have the money. Did Unita Blackwell get along in any of this? Did she come on the trip? She worked with Mrs. Mosley, and of course, she told the story of how the housing got going, and things of that sort. Of course, they were intrigued with all of that. She had worked with the preliminary contacts with the families, so that's how we had the contacts and openings made. That was very important. I wish I could have joined you at one point or another. I did think about it all the time, but I wasn't in any position to leave. I think the part I felt was missing, was that I would wake up and realize suddenly that I literally was the only person on the trip who had been a part of how things got along. See, because even Unita Blackwell was one of the participants in terms of organizational development, and how you involved the women and this sort of thing. It would have been a real asset to have had someone else, your perspective in the picture. It was just one of those things.ï»¿211 PC: DH: PC: DH PC dh DH PC: DH: PC: DH: Yes, well that's the way it goes. How many staff did we have on that trip, on the whole Mexican and United States experience? Ruth Sykes was there. She handled all the funds and that sort of thing. And then we had Ermon Hogan Kamara, she served as the overall director. Then we had several who were consultants and that sort of thing. Anne Turpeau was sort of program assistant with us. Was Maida Kemp, as a board member and vice-president, all the way through a part of the group? She wasn't with us in the Mississippi part. Was there any other board member who was there? Ruth Minor came to Mexico and went on through with us. PC: Went through Mississippi? Yes. Linda Bain came down to Daytona Beach part. And of course, Mabel Jacksonâwe had 114 Council women in all who came to Daytona Beach only. Well, that must have been another interesting experience. So that was interesting because there [NCNW] had the opportunity to meet the women, you see. So we had staff, board and members. I would never have known that if I hadn't by accident asked that. I'm probably going to miss out on some other things, too. But unless you can think of anything that I just haven't asked that should be put into the "pot..." Well, I think that the important thing was something that Mr. Parker of AID said when they were making the announcement of the grant to us to develop an international division. He said that there were many groups who have done other kinds of services, but the uniqueness in what we were doing was that it was community development... it was developmental. It was self-help development, and that that was what they wanted us to utilize with women in less-developed countries. I think that whole concept of self-help, the whole concept of how we involve people, the whole workshop approach that we made, the way in which we were trying to help people identify with what the needs were, and to try to see what they could do about themâall of that is what led to our having this seminar and taking these people to see the work. But it also means that it's sort of a base for anything that we would try to do otherwise overseas. I think that one of the things that I was conscious of is really the need to extract out all those elements of development, because like Julius Nyerereof Tanzania and others have said about the developing countriesâthey don't want just the benefits of development, they want to shape that development. I think the same thing is true of women. Women don't just want to receive the benefits; they want to have a hand in development, and I think, this is what we really have to bear in mind.ï»¿212 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: PC: Have you picked a country in which we will work with the AID grant? There are three countries it looks like we'll be moving toward, but the important thing is to see how we utilize our experience. You see, that's the ingredient that we've got to make sure is there. In some countries, it will be more difficult to work that way. So there's no final selection, is that what you're telling me? I think the people are making selections, but I think that you finally select after you have explored. You don't just say, "This is it." So we end up with taking Botswana and Lesotho and some other country that they're going to explore. That means someone has to go there. Yes. So it's time now to set up a preliminary visit to go there the end of November. The staff visit. Or do you think you'll go? Well, Margaret Hickey, who is the chairperson of the State Department's Committee on Voluntary Aid, says that she would like to go when we make the first visit. We're trying nowâthis is all tentative, but someone from the State Department with her, with the staff, and possibly with me, will go. It could be very interesting, but for you it's going to be a time problem. You can't run into a country for two days and get a major assessment. I don't think that the assessment is the thing; I think that this time we first have to touch base and see that the channels are open. That's really what I meant. I didn't say it right. And find out if there's a women's group or groups, and what political climate is out there. Yes, but there were some meetings with the women from Botswana this week, so there has been a certain preliminary amount of work done. They're English-speaking? I don't even know. Well, there are enough people who speak English. Oh, all of them have their own languages, but I mean there is enough English taught in the schools? [This is February 1, 1976.] We are taping your oral history and, along with your past, we're trying to keep up with your present experiences, so we talked about the International Women's Year in Mexico last summer and about your leadership with the African and third world representatives, when you showed them the National Council of Negro Women's work in the United States. Now, following on that, I'd like you to tell us about your trip to AfricaâI believe that one followed right on the other, not inï»¿213 (cont.) months, but in work, in November, 1975âand about the new international division of the National Council of Negro Women. First, though, could you explain the Agency for International Development and the program grant they've given to us, and how it was conceived and mounted? Well, as you know, when you come to a point such as the hundredth birthday of the person who founded an organization, and the organization is in its fortieth year, the question of what new dimensions could be added to their program becomes one that you just have to face. It seemed to me that our international development was the one that we wanted, and that's why we appealed to the Agency for International Development. You were a part of that meeting, and brought along the tapes from Maida Springer Kemp, the vice-president, who had been to Africa, and some of the other officers and staff. We met with Mr. Daniel Parker, who heads the Agency for International Development. AID, as it is called, is really at present under a mandate of the Percy Amendment to make sure... That's Senator Charles Percy? Senator Charles Percy got through the Senate an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, which states that not only should the United States participate in helping with the development of less-developed countries, but that whatever it did in that development should not only involve women, but involve women in the development of their countries. Now this is quite a forward step, because what it means is, that in order for countries to receive foreign assistance, they are then faced with the necessity to see that women are included, and included at a meaningful level. The National Council of Negro Women asked for the opportunity to develop our capacity for working internationally, so that we would be able to use our experience and share it with women in developing countries. Our local experience? Our own national experience? It was our thought that we had learned something working in the rural South that would have some bearing on what women would be needing to draw upon in some of the developing countries, and so, that's the base of our grant. We received a grant for three years for $825,000 which is to make it possible for the National Council of Negro Women to develop an international division through which it would work. This means that we will be selecting some countries of the world and looking to see what women's groups there are involved in and whether they would like to join hands to work with us. We will be trying to identify needs that they are trying to meet that we could be of some help in as they're working. So that the grant is not one to do program. It is one to help us discover both what our capabilities are and to help us get started. We will also develop a skills bank, so that we will have a good representative roster of individuals who have talent and training and expertise that could be shared. And we'll also have women paraprofessionals, who know something about how to deal with problems, as well as those who are professionally trained. They will be part of our whole skills bank, where we will be able to refer to some international agencies, or to draw upon ourselves in any program that develops out of our first...ï»¿214 â PC: Our development grant. DH: Out of our development grant. PC: The development grant, however, did have built into it a team going into some of the countries to see what might be done, or am I wrong? Some of you did go, in November, to three countries, I believe? In Africa? DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: Yes. November 30 to December 17, Miss Margaret Hickey, who for a number of years has been chairing the policy committee in AID, the committee called the Committee on Voluntary AidâVoluntary Agencies in Foreign Assistance programs... Margaret Hickey, it was felt, along with an escort, Mr. Michael Rolla, a staff member of the State Department, would be a good team from the Agency's viewpoint, one a volunteer and one a staff person, to go with our team, which was Miss Billie Oliver, who is our director for the international division, and myself, to two of those countries. There were four of you? There were four. So that we could make some initial contacts, get acquainted; help people to understand something of what the National Council of Negro Women is about, and what our interests were, who we were, what we thought we had to offer; and that it would be a real opportunity for us to touch bases with key leadership in those countries, both with women, and, of course, their governmental officials. It also meant that we were to make our first contacts with AID missions in the field, because any kind of international work like this really requires both the endorsement and the cooperation of the governments, and also some coordination through our own governmental missions abroad. And so, this was not to be an in-depth visit, but it was aimed to be an occasion when we would set up those initial contacts, so that when the staff people would go in a few weeks later, the groundwork would have been laid, and certain relationships at least opened up. What countries were they? The three countries that we had chosen to work in are all in southern Africa. They are Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland. Did you have a criterion for the establishment of these three countries? Yes, one, they're all landlocked countries, living in the shadow of South Africa with its apartheid policies. That's one of the things that interests me most, our working so closely to South Africa. Yes, yes. They are countries which are landlocked, and therefore, they have not had as much attention paid to them as some others. They're very poor. Right?ï»¿215 They're very rich in raw materials. They're very poor. The people are poor. Each of these is a country in which women carry the major role in leadership, and it's related to the fact that 70 to 80 percent of the able-bodied men are working in South African mines, because of the conditions of their own economies. So that you will find that women are digging the ditches and doing the hard work and rearing the children and building the houses and taking an active hand in everything, so that here was a place where women had a major role. The other thing is that many groups have focused on West Africa and East Africa, and this was a part that did not have much attention. Probably because people were a little desperate about it, didn't know how to work there. That's right. But also, I think it was very significant that our own international agency, AID, has been giving help to them, realizing that they were of growing importance. In the time since we've begun to work in there, when we chose them, the whole problem of Angola and Mozambique has taken a different turn. So that, when we were in Botswana and in Lesotho, at times people would say, "Well, we're getting now very close to the border," and everyone knew they were talking about the Angolan border. Which would have been worse there, the Angolan border or South Africa? Well, those countries are in between both. So either way that you went a little bit off the beam, you would have hit some problem? That's right. But, of course, to get into the countries, you have to go to Johannesburg. There is no such thing as going by air from one of those countries to the other. No, I wanted to ask you your mode of travel. Was it automobile, was it a train? We went by plane and, of course, we had to enter through South Africa, so that we entered by way of Johannesburg. Then we went from Johannesburg to Botswana, then back to Johannesburg, and then to Lesotho, and then back to Johannesburg, and then to Swaziland. I think you can see from that that South Africa has a very good index as to the traffic that is coming and going in those countries. Well, what happened when you went into an airport in South Africa? Does it have separate, but equal, facilities? Or is it all right for us to go through there? Were there any problems? Color problems? No. For one thing, we had to have a visa, and because we were listed as on a special mission...ï»¿216 And you were State Department people? Yes. We got a visa for a year. That's unusual... for blacks to be given that long a term of visa, but that was given to us. And our visa said we were on official business to the B.L.S. countries. That's what they called them, B.L.S. PC: The three together? DH dh PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Yes. They're always grouped together: B.L.S, PC: I never knew that, So that we had to have the visas in order to get in, but in addition, with the world attention on South Africa, every effort is made to be very gracious at the airport. Everything is very nice at the airport. They are, of course, very particular, and everything is checked very carefully. One day we learned from one of our black women in Soweto... In where? Soweto. Soweto. S-O-W-E-T-O, is the black area of Johannesburg. She came in during one of my visits in between to take me out to Soweto, and I invited Margaret Rickey. This woman spoke very quickly, and she said, "I'm very sorry, but you cannot go, because you do not have a permit." That is because a black person could not have taken a white woman, as Miss Hickey was white, into Soweto. PC â¢ Even with a permit? There wouldn't have been a permit? She would have had to have a permit. She explained that had she realized that Miss Hickey was interested in going, she might have tried to get a permit. And she said, "But despite all that you hear about how things have relaxed, it's still very tight." She said that a few weeks before thisâshe and her husband own a restaurant and they own several businesses, and are in better circumstances than many of the black South Africans thereâand despite the fact that they have a good standing in the community... They had visiting them someone who was there attending a church conference, a white woman, a missionary, and the woman was in their house, and the whole while she was visiting, the police simply cruised up and down in front of her house. Familiar story. We've had that too in Mississippi. That's right. It was the same thing that we faced when we were in Mississippi in the height of the civil rights struggle, because you remember how the police cars would spot us and then circle... Circle around and follow us. Follow around to see what you were going to do. This was quite a shock to Miss Hickey, of course, because she said that as a writer for the Ladies' Home Journal, and as one who has been working with the State Departmentï»¿217 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) over twenty years, she had been there several times, and she had lived at several places. A very significant thing that was said was, that there was one hotel, I think it is called the Carleton, and one of the women said to her, "Well, you're now at the Holiday Inn, and it's not on the top list." So that a white woman staying at the Carleton might have been able to do as she did, ride freely around, because the assumption would have been, you know, that she was of a high enough status. In other words, the hotel is a symbol? The hotel is a symbol, and they would think that if she were at the Holiday Inn, you know, she was not as... Miss Hickey being a very sophisticated and well-traveled person, did she try to get around this, or was she just stunned by it and decided not to fight it, or what was her attitude? There was no real point in trying to fight it. We were there for a short time. We had been invited by the American ambassador to come to a dinner that was being held in my honor at the ambassador's residence at Pretor ia. This was a formal dinner and he had issued invitations, and we knew that we had to be ready to go for that. PC: That same day? That same day. So that there was no point in doing that. The question was raised in a little gift shop in the hotel, and one of the white women working there heard it. She immediately spoke up and said, "Well, if you go to the American Express, they can get you the permit, and you won't need to worry." So Miss Hickey then said, "Well, we would not go in for all of that." But I think it was something that you learned a little something from, because it made us realize that though everything moved so smoothly... It's false, really. ...that actually, this was all part of a big... I was thinking that if I had been part of the team, you would have had the same problem, or worse, because I wouldn't be attached to the State Department. I would be attached to the National Council of Negro Women. That's right. So, I would be less able...or any of us people, white people who are attached to the National Council, would be less able to move? Yes. Without a permit. The point is, you can move. Now, when Miss Hickey turned, and she said, "Well, how can Miss Height do this?" And so the young woman said, what later was verified. She said, "They will have her indicated as if she were an honorary white, or honorary European, for the period of her stay." That reminded us that we were told earlier, onï»¿218 (cont.) our arrival, that each of us had been asked to submit four passport pictures, and a very knowledgeable person said, "You will be safe, and you will be able to go anywhere and do anything, because in all probabilities, your picture is in the hands of every police area, because they immediately take those pictures, and pass along the word, treat this person... But wouldn't that be true of Miss Hickey too, or was it just your passport picture? That would be true, but what I mean is that I as a black person was treatedâno matter where we wentâvery graciously. Even when we got downtown to the railroad station and saw a sign that said, "For White Only," and I was determined to walk through it. And so I did and brought Miss Oliver along with me. Nothing happened, and it was explained to us later that nothing would happen, because you have been marked as one who should be treated royally, no matter what. Will that happen to our staff when they're working in there? Oh yes. They'll get the same sort of permits and treatments and... Oh yes. That's right. So we won't have a problem as far as we can anticipate? You cannot promise you won't have a problem... No, you can't. But what you can say is, the kind of visa that they have and the present attitude in South Africa, of trying to make world opinion out a lie, that it is mistreating people, these will add up to the fact that they will get good treatment. They will be served, you know. They may not receive welcoming arms, but they, at least, will be served. I have a question that follows, in a way. Were you treated as a celebrity, which you were? You were given a dinner by our ambassador, and in many other ways you were treated as a celebrity. I also had, in the same question, were you treated as a person wanting to do a job? Did they understand the goals of the National Council of Negro Women and AID on this project? They did, and yet, there are several vestiges of colonialism that are still there. For example, many of the women, when we said to them, "What would you like to do?" spoke first about what they wanted us to give them. That's the missionary thing though, isn't it? What the church would give them. Yes. They wanted to know about a mortuary. They wanted buses. Theyï»¿219 (cont.) wanted us to give them money to build buildings. And so, we had to begin to talk with them, and work with them, and to interpret that we were a voluntary organization, that we could give ourselves and our services, but that we were not the ones to buy the things that they needed and the like. So we had to go through that. But I think that's understandable. PC: Yes, I do too, but you're now talking about the women with whom we'll be doing our most serious work. I just wondered whether the top brass understood that you were not there on an ordinary mission, but you were there because of the National Council, which is there because it wants to help the people of the soil, the rural people? Yes, and I must say that we were especially grateful to the State Department, because, as you know, they had done some work before we got there. We had also been in touch with the ambassadors from these countries, who were in the United States, and especially those in Washington. For instance, with BotswanaâAmbassador Dombi was very helpful in the United States, and came to our national convention, and said in the convention that he had already alerted women in their country. Pc. I remember his saying it, Dorothy, but did it have an effect? DH: DH: PC: DH: PC: ?C: Yes. PC â¢ Sometimes, things can be said by the top, and it doesn't matter. Yes, but I think the thing that I have discovered about the international is that unless the proper buttons are pushed, you don't get anywhere. Not only did he say that, but his wife, who had gone back home, and whose mother died while we were on high seas, or on our way there, had been in touch with the Botswana Council of Women, and when we got into the airport, there they were. And they came with a fully typed-out schedule of our activities. They had made all kinds of plans and arrangements. Now, those women, the Botswana Council of Women, are probablyâI don't even know how to put a class tag on this; but they probably have a little more range of money and activities than the women we are actually going to work with, is that right? That's true, but as in all countries, it is those people who at least can build some bridges between what the government is doing and the needs of the people, who become very crucial. So the job of getting out to rural work still means that you have to have those who build bridgesâbuild those bridges. In each of the three countries, were you treated as a very special person? I mean, one ambassador you mentioned gave you a dinner. I guess that was in Botswana, wasn't it? In every country. Every country.ï»¿220 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: The AID mission representatives or the ambassador entertained us and had people from the communities to meet us. In every country, one of the first jobs that we did was to visit either the head of state, or the representatives, who needed to be briefed. In Gaborone, for instance, in Botswana, one of the most valuable contacts was with the woman who is the mayor of the city. What's the city? Gaborone, spelled with a G. G-A-B-O-R-O-N-E. And the mayor of Gaborone wanted to be sure that we knew what some of the problems were. So when we went to visit her, she had two women who were in the city council there with her, but she already had set it up to have some of her rural development workers there. She arranged to have us go to the edge of the city where several thousand families, squatters, very poor people, had come from rural areas. And it is an eyesore. It is a desperate kind of place for people. Not even in the rural area, but there they were on the edge of the city, and she wanted us to see what they were up against. And she arranged to have people take us out there. XJere you able to communicate with those people? Naturally we don't speak their language. That's why I asked. But that's why she sent some of the staff people. But what they wanted us to see were the conditions under which people were living. Just the worst kind... Are these people who come in from the countryside because of starvation, because of problems... Because of lack of jobs and all, and they come to the city hoping that they will find something, and of course, they just set themselves down and do not intend to return. Well, we have that in many countries. That's right. And she wanted us to see that, see those slums, see the desperate... That's not the same sort of population with which we had originally planned to work, or when we worked the way we do in Mississippi. This is another problem. Yes, but you had asked me, what about these women who are more middle-class... and what I'm saying is, we thought it was very significant that those women probably need help in reaching those rural women, just like many women in the United States, who are urban, have to have help to reach the rural poor. But it was significant that the mayor was so aware of the need for us to see some of the real problems that she brought her staff...in fact, gave us the transportation to go out to this place and to drive through. We never could haveï»¿221 DH: (cont.) gone through It without those people who were indigenous to it. In other words, we would have been intruders, except for the fact that we were in those very familiar, community development Land Rovers. PC: But there is a certain amount of work being done there now by AID, or by.. . Â°H: No. No. This is all their problem. This is their problem. And one of the things they were asking us was, How could we help them with such a thing as this. We went later, another day, out to the rural areas. But I thought it was very significant that a top woman like this would see that it was important for us to realize that it was not only the people in rural areas who were still there, but it was this new urban problem of the rural people, who had brought the rural right into the heart of the city. They're hoping that they will be able to get some kind of bill through the city council that will provide for their doing something about the housing and some of the other conditions there. PC: PC: PC: In any of the other countries, did you see anything similar? ^H: No. But in each country, we went out into the very poorest areas, the rural. PC: And were they places which would be adaptable to our project, or would our projects be adaptable to those places? DH: Well, we're working just a little bit like we did in Mississippi. We are going in and not taking a program, but we're going in... To see what they want. See what it is that they want. We're going in and saying to them, "If you are concerned about food and nutrition, we know a little something of how you can help people provide food for themselves, and the like. We know something about how to get that organized." So that the toughest part of our job is that of listening, and then trying to help people see how we fit in. Everywhere we went, they said, "Help us to build another nursery. Help us to build another school." You see. And those schools were needed. When we sat down and evaluated, we said, "Perhaps what we need to do, to say to them, is that the problem is child development at all stages. It isn't just a question of having nurseries." And the moment we did that, then we could see that there could be a wide range of things done, like helping mothers understand what is happening to children, and trying to find nutritionists and others who could be helpful. So that we have to make a developmental approach to what we're doing, rather than try to apply anything that we have learned. It's really a discipline, in a sense, for us, because it means we really have to try to see what it is they wish to do. One of the key things that I think is emerging is that women have been doing many things, but they need help in seeing how to organize volunteer efforts. You see, the uniqueness of us is that we are volunteers, and how to organize and utilize volunteer help is very crucial. By that you mean, across-the-board women, women of all economic backgrounds? Can the poorest women, who must be absolutely exhausted from the work they do, can they understand a volunteer effort?ï»¿222 DH: Well, they will have to, because they're not going to be able to solve their problem by paying everybody. And I think we're talking about it now, more from an angle of saying, What kinds of help will be needed to sustain what people are doing? Let me give you an example. In Swaziland, we saw a cooperative that has been developed with people who are not literate. In order to help them keep their records and the like, a whole sort of token system has been developed. PC: You mean token instead of money? Yes. Or chips, something like that. They get a chip for each garment that they turn in, and then, after they've given so many, they get their dividend as another color chip. And then, periodically, they cash in these chips. Now that's adapting a whole system of marketing and handling. PC: Quite interesting. It's different than bartering. It's another kind of thing. ^H: Right. So that the people, the central service in that co-op, run by an expatriate, a German expatriate, who has been in the country for a number of years, has centralized services. They cut the garments that the people are to make, or they have a very high grade of mohair, so they take the mohair and measure off what it would take to make a shawl or a scarf or whatever. Then that is taken out to the people... PC: PC: In a cottage industry? Â°H: xn a cottage industry. Those people then do the work. When they do the work, they're not paid immediately, but they're given these chips or tokens, something of that kind. Then they learn how much each thing they do adds up to, and then after they reach a certain number, they get another color chip that represents their dividend. Then, if they meet their deadlines and they get special bonuses, that's in another color. There's a weekly or bi-weekly or some kind of a method by which those are translated into rands, which is their currency. Now, that's what you would call adapting some basic principle to fit a particular situation. That's a fascinating system. Â°H: Yes. You see. And what it amounts to is that those people function now as if they were fully literate. So that they don't have to wait for the next generation to learn to figure. They now know how to deal with this. They also have decentralized it, so that there is, among those people, someone who keeps the books. There is a small committee that operates like the credit committee, so that if somebody feels that they want to venture a little further, and they need either capital or its equivalent in terms of raw materials, then this committee meets, and looks over the record of that person. Then they determine, right there out in their little village, whether or not to recommend this person. Then they do, and then that person has the opportunity to get the new materials. Perhaps they have been crocheting, using the mohair, doing crocheted shawls. They now might decide that they could also do shawls and they could do some other kind of bead work, but they need the beads, and they need the paints, and they need the dyes, and other things they need. Well, then they have the opportunity through that means to get that other material that they need,ï»¿223 DH: PC: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: (cont.) and that's all a part of this business operation that operates on a purely cooperative base. Now, this is for the export market. I mean, it has to be exported, doesn't it, to bring in money? DH: Well, then, that's where the main office comes in. It markets it. And now, they have recently set up in one of the cities some outlets where you can go and buy the things that are made by these people. But, you see, it's lifting cottage industry from people just making something and then peddling it on the street themselves, and sometimes denying themselves and their children their food and all, in order to buy raw materials. But it gives them a way of doing it, and I think that, in a sense, you could say this is adapting the whole concept. The Rochdale cooperative concept has been adapted to meet the needs of these people. Well, I think that's what we have to do. In a sense, that's what we did all through Mississippi in this countryâfind different ways of helping people deal with the problems. There was no need of talking about buying protein. We had to find ways to set up pig banks, or gardens, and to get them to manage them. Is it only in Swaziland that you found this kind of cooperative? When you only had two or three days, and there were so many things that people wanted to show us that we couldn't see, we had to select some things, you know, to get to see. This was one I thought was worthwhile. I would think so; I don't know whether you and the staff plan to build on that or build another way. I'm using that as a for instance, to say that there are things already going on that tell us something about how people in thatched huts, mud huts, in a rural area, not only live, but also how their efforts may be organized. So we have to learn a lot in order to be helpful. It's almost taking a sophisticated concept and making it viable for people who have an unsophisticated way of life, but if they can learn it, or anything else that you and the staff devise as methods, then that will be progress. Yes, and I think also that we have to bear in mind that while we can send a staff, those people will not have a staff, that we're talking about the efforts of volunteers. Well, I really should have said skills bank volunteers people. No, no, no. I mean that what the staff has to do when it goes in, is to realize that we've got to find a way to get those people doing it. That's the only way it will get done. And helpingâyou know, helping them. And that's going to be a great task. With what? Local leadership? It has to be. Because we will not be there doing any specific program.ï»¿224 DH: (cont.) We will be helping those women in the organization, see how they go out there. PC: But we did find local leadership in Mississippi. One thing was, we spoke the language, and here's this first handicap, for either the skilled volunteer or the skilled staff person who has to overcome that particular barrier. But, in many instances, the women with whom we will work will know the language, so that, therefore, our job is to help those women's groups. Not all of them will be able to speak the language but there usually is somebody there that we can communicate with. And if we can work with a nucleusâbecause there are so many languages involved. You know, there are just so many languages, and so many different tribes. pC: Are they all represented in the city councils and the governments... the - different tribal languages, the tribes, in these three countries? Yes, pretty much. Pc: I would think they'd have to be, but how they'd maneuver it, I don't know. They must speak one central language for political use. English is used pretty generally, you see. You have to bear in mind that in these countries, English was taught. PC: The leadership was trained in English schools, or English basic schools. It seemed to sound to me, as you were talking, it referred back in my head to some of the work you did in India, where you found, with all those languages, certain people who were able to carry on the goals as they were outlined when you were there. And most of the time, as we spoke, when we went out into the villages all the time, we had to have an interpreter. That meant that there had to be some person who could speak the language of the people and English. That's the way we spoke, so that all of our major deliberations were conducted in two languages. PC: DH: PC: DH: This must have been an exhausting trip from that point of view, because if you're trying to do this, anything you try to do in a second language and then translate back, and then translate to the other language again, is double the work. Well, it's also very disciplining because it makes you select what it is you want to teach, or what it is you want to say. It's almost like feeling...is what I'm going to say now worth hearing again in another language? [laughs] You see? So it makes you tighten up what you have to say. I think that one of the benefits here is going to be that it makes us have to see what is valuable. A major problem that we will have in all of the African countries is that of transportation. There is no such thing as the kind of transportation that is needed. What will we do? In Swaziland, we did some public buses. So that that's going to be some-ï»¿225 DH: (cont.) thing that we will have to look at: how can we do it? PC: Are there even roads? DH: Oh yes, of course. But the point that I mean is that there is no public transportation. You either have to have a jeep or a Land Rover or something. Even cars, in some of those places, will not do. You see, Lesotho is pretty much a mile high. ^C: What do you mean? M: It's very high. Some of the publicity around called it the Switzerland of Africa. It has snowcaps and it's... PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH; Must be quite beautiful. It's very beautiful, and so you would find that there are so many hills and mountains. That's a crucial problem. Because of the nature of the roads and the height of the mountains, it's not just a simple matter of having a car, because you probably have to have heavier transportation than that in many places. And I think it is hard for us to realize that for some of the meetings and gatherings that people had for us, that people had walked miles. That's how they get around normally? That's how they get around. They walk, and this transportation makes it difficult for them to have the kind of communication that's necessary. They can't communicate between one little village and another? No. Getting from one village to the other, and the like is difficult, so that people sort of function in clusters, you know, around the village that they live in. That's going to be an enormous problem for the National Council, isn't it? Also, it's very interesting to me, for example, that every place we went, people put on gatherings, or they had people from the community to come to meet us. One such place in Botswana was Molepolole... Molepolole? Molepolole was really a very interesting village. When we first got there, we went and saw some womenâoh, older women and very young ones, who were trying to deal with the problem of soil erosion, and they were cutting grass off a hillside and cutting it in squares about eighteen-by ten-inch squares. They were cutting it... Sod. That's right. Squares of grass that was growing, because one of the ways that soil erosion is checked is through transplanting grass, and they were cutting these squares as if they'd had them all ruled out.ï»¿226 PC: You mean, they didn't have stakes. They just knew how to cut it. DH: No, they just had shovels, and they were digging it, and when they saw us, they were bringing it up the hill and putting it on a side of the road, to be picked up by trucks later. When they saw us, they burst into song. And later, we were honored at a sort of a community reception. We went on to it, and a few minutes after we were there, in came all these women. PC: Those same women? DH: Those same women. Still with their same clothes and shovels. But they had come, too, to this program, which means that they had walked there a couple of miles. PC: After knocking themselves out... DH: To come to this, and they sat in the middle of the floor. They had some of the snake dancers and all, and little children danced for us. They sang. But then the officials came, the head of the city council, the regional officer, and an interpreter interpreted what we had to say. There must have been three or four hundred people. PC: Well, now how did they get that news around? How did they alert three or four hundred people to this fact that you were there? Â°H: They passed the word around the village, you see, and people came for everything. PC: Well, of course, it was a show in a way. What else is there? And it's help; somebody cares. DH: They were interested and they wanted to know what was going on. And they were glad to know that we were not there just for a one-shot term, but that we would be returning. PC: were theyâI don't know if it's possible to answer this, but if you had been white, the head of the National Council of Women, instead of the head of the National Council of Negro Women, and you had had a mixed staff, but perhaps more white than black, would there have been the same response as the fact that we were the National Council of Negro Women? Did they understand that? Did they react to that? DH= You have to bear in mind that these are countries that have been under colonial control so that they are more accustomed to seeing whites in our capacity than of seeing blacks. PC: DH: Well, let's reverse the question then. And what they said to me was... Madame Dombi, the wife of the ambassador, told me just the other day, she said, "You know, we were so glad, because you're the first black group that we ever had any contact with." And one of the reasons we began some of our work in Africa is that so many other groups of people have been going in, who don't have some of our ties, that we felt we had a contribution that we needed an opportunity to make. But in addition, your question reminds me that Seretsi Khama, who is theï»¿227 DH: (cont.) head of the state of Botswana, as you know___ PC: No, I don't. Seretsi... DH: Seretsi. Seretsi Khama. K-H-A-M-A. Upset a great many things about twenty or twenty-five years ago, when he was studying in London and he married a British woman. So that he is a black head of state with a white wife, and they have three children. Lady Khama is the president of the Botswana Council of Women. One afternoon, early in our visit, the Botswana Council of Women had in its schedule to meet with the executive committee. They went to their president's house, who was also the president of the country, and Lady Khama was there in her short... ^C: Western dress? DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: Western dress. And these women were there, and she talked and asked many questions. She asked the question first, and then her daughter picked it up in the evening, when we went to the American embassy for a party. She [Lady Khama] asked, "Why do you call yourselves the National Council of Negro Women? Aren't you segregating yourselves?" Well, needless to say, I went on to explain to her that we welcomed all women, but we were concerned primarily about what's happening to black women and their families. But then her question was, "Well, why don't you just call yourselves the National Council of Women?" Then I realized that she didn't understand our country and our people. But then, in the evening, her daughter picked it up and she said, "Well, I just am puzzled at why you would ever put such a name on yourselves. Why wouldn't you just call yourselves the Council of Women of the United States? You're just women." And she said, "If your country is a democracy, why do you have such a thing?" "Well," I said, "it's because it is a democracy, and each group can celebrate its own identity." And that we are pluralistic, we're not a one kind of people, we are many kinds of people making up one nation. Well, she had enough cocktails to keep carrying this on and on. Sounds like resentment was in there somewhere. But both the other representatives and I tried to talk with her.. The one or two other people who mentioned this seemingly understood what we were saying. But I do think that...and I think one of the things that struck me was, both Lesotho and Botswana are on the South African rand.. I found myself saying to the daughter of the head of state, "Well, maybe you are thinking of it in terms of separating oneself off because you live in the shadow of apartheid." And I tried to interpret to her how we looked at it. Then, I also think that it was very significant to me, as we moved about the country, that when we got to the Supreme Court, there the person who headed the Supreme Court, the chief of the court, was a South African. This was in Botswana? In Botswana. In each of those countries we found white expatriates in some important positions.ï»¿228 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC DH PC DH PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: Oh. They weren't sent there by the South African country? No. These are people who have had some relationship over a period of time, and even after they gained their independence, they decided to hold on with them. And there's no resentment of these white people in powerful places? It's not resentment. What I'm saying is, they accept those people, but they were concerned about why we were calling ourselves Negro women. Do you see the inconsistency? And when Miss Oliver and I were talking, I said, "Well, apparently what we have to bear in mind is that even though they have achieved independence, they are more accustomed to seeing a white person in some of these positions." So they would not at all have been shocked to find you white? I don't think so. No. Well, it also reflects the racism of our country, because both here, and I also find in India, when you get outside your country, sometimes people feel that it is the United States that has devalued you, and so they want to make sure that somebody coming to them has enough power to be helpful. Oh, I see. You mean, because a black person doesn't represent the United States as far as they know, it's never been clear to them? No. No. What I mean is that any preference of a white person is based upon their concept of the role and the relationship of the black American inside his own country. And so they feel, you know, that there you are. Like when I was in India, a student said to me one day, "Why did they send an inferior person here to teach us? We're a graduate school." And I said, "I know you're a graduate school." He said, "Well, then don't they want us to know how to function?" Or " to operate," I think he said. And I said, "Well, of course." And he said, "Well, why would they send an inferior person?" And I said, "Well, do you think that I am not teaching you?" And he said, "No, but I'm just amazed. Why would they send you?" And finally I realized what his problem was. He was seeing me... As we would. As he thinks the United States sees me, and it says that blacks are inferior. And that young man later said to me... I said, "Well, I will do the very best job that I can. I think they tried to get someone who had the training and experience to be helpful to you. I will try to be helpful to you." And finally I had to say to him, "What makes you keep thinking of me as inferior?" And he said, "Well, I understand Negroes are inferior." Then I understood, you see. Well, that's also in part the Indian mentality too, the caste system and... It's us...but it's them.ï»¿229 DH: So they would think the white American has higher value because the white American is closer to any base of power, and what they are struggling for is power. And they would say, Well, a white American is more in a power position, and when you send a powerless black out there, it must mean that you want to hold them back. However, I must say that the two or three people who raised this question wereâthough they were kind of rabid in the way they raised itâthey were so few and far between, you see, over against the overwhelming reception that we received, the people who felt proud that we were there. The very first time that I was talking to a large group, about five hundred people, I said, "I bring you greetings from your sisters and brothers in the United States of America." And each time, there was thunderous applause. People knew exactly what I was talking about. And there were other times, when we were made presentations, some of them would say things like, "We give you this because you are our sisters, and though you have been gone from your homeland many years, we are glad that you have been there, able to get some of the benefits and come back to us." So that there was this kind ofâthis was the overwhelming feeling. Whereas the others were questions. I do have to say that it interested me that it was a young woman out of the kind of background that she was, the Seretsi Khama's daughter, and it was a couple of other people in political positions, who raised the question. The other people didn't labor the point. You know, they didn't keep it going, as did Khama's daughter. PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: Well, because they were in a more threatened position, being mixed, racially mixed, so they couldn't look at you as the people who had a background of blackness could look at it, I would think. One wasn't even mixed. Lady Khama was a white woman. Her daughter was mixed. Yes, but she's lived there for twenty-some years. Her daughter is married and had several children, so that...the daughter's also married to a Dutchman. So that that's why it struck me so very funny, that they were pressing the question, not wanting us to say we were the National Council of Negro Women. Well, we'll have to see whether that...I don't suppose that would continue, but I did have it as a question all the way along in my mind, wondering what the reception would be, what the reaction would be, whether they would be happier to see you because you were representing the black women of this country, or the way... Remember when we first started sending black ambassadors, Dorothy, we were afraid to send them to African countries for fear that Africans would think we were not looking up to them enough, so sent them to Luxembourg or Norway, or wherever it was, in the beginning? Right. I think this is the same feeling you're expressing, that we are just getting over too. That's right. Just getting over is not what I mean. We're just finishing up that feeling, I hope. It's ending. I've come to the end of my specific questions except, if you have any notions of what we're going into now...ï»¿230 I think the important thing that was communicated was a sense of our being open to being of help, and that we did not have fixed programs, we didn't go there with one. We have to be sure that we don't impose one. That we are involved in the whole process of development, and I think that the concept of development is vitally important. Julius Nyerere of Tanzania put it very well when he said, "Our people not only want the fruits of development, but they want to have the opportunity of shaping that development." And I think that's what I see, and I think within each one of these countries, the women who have had a little more opportunity, or whose husbands are working in government, who want to work with rural women, have to be helped to find ways of doing it. And, you know, I found myself at points saying, "One need is some kind of plan for dealing with social welfare!' People tended to say,"Well, we need a nursery" so they built a building, which then could handle thirty children, but there were several thousands of children with nothing. We met with people, some women who are engaged in working on initiating some programs in rural development. We went into all kinds of homes, all kinds of situations that people lived in. The need for housing is so crucial that you keep saying, Well, what can be done, you know, how can something be done to help with the housing situation? I see us, really, trying to see how we can help some of the women's groups come together, because we found a tendency to be a little competitive, or even we had to struggle, because sometimes one group wanted to possess us and didn't want us to meet with other groups. In each country, there are several groups? Yes, in each country, there are several groups. So that, one of the thing that we'll have to try to see is how can we help them find ways of coordinating their efforts, building a sense of trust and a sense of cooperative working relationship with each other. And how can we find people who are willing to work there, realizing that we've got to come up with some kind of structure of relationships that keeps things moving. That's between the groups, you mean? That's between the groups and the people that are doing the service. I described the relationship between that cooperative and how it got the materials out and set up the training, and the whole plan. Well, there is a similar thing that is going to have to happen here, because we're going to have to find ways of getting the linkages that keep things moving When you stop to think that 70 to 80 percent of the able-bodied men are working in South African mines, and they're there because they can earn seven or eight hundred rand a year, and as one public official in Swaziland said to us, "How can we say very much when they can go there without training, and earn almost as much as any one of us in the public service, who stays at home?" But that will probably come to an end at some point also? They do not see that as coming to an end, and they do not see it as objectively as we do from here, because they said it has now become a culturalï»¿231 DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: (cont.) pattern, that when a young man is able-bodied, he goes to the mines. And what it amounts to for the women is that often a woman is left there with several children. Her husband signs a contract and goes to the mines for a minimum of six months, but usually, one to two years. During that period, the South African arrangement does not permit her to come to visit him under any conditions, because the men live in South Africa in large residences of ten and fifteen thousand men all together. Then when the husband comes back to visit, she may then become pregnant and have another child while he's gone again. So then she has not only the bearing of the children, and the caring for the children, but also she has the birth and raising of new children, and she has to do everything. Everything. But you said, in the beginning, that these countries are rich in materials? But the materials... For instance, Botswana has a tremendous meat commission, because it develops some of the best beef, some of the best beef I ever had in my whole life. And they have done certain things with it, but they cannot get the markets to ship it. Their greatest market is in South Africa. When Seretsi Khama came in to greet all of us, the day that we were having the meeting with the Botswana Council of Women, he said, right off the reel, "One thing you could do for us is to help us get some markets." So that they have these rich raw materials, but they are not able to develop them to their capacity themselves, and much of it is controlled outside of the country. So that, all these countries have political independence, but they do not have economic independence. And they are too dependent on South Africa. And when we returned home, the ambassadors of Botswana and Lesotho and Swaziland had a joint press conference to welcome us and to make their statement. And I thought their statement had a very significant thing in it, when it said, "We are glad that you have come, and also that the United States Agency for International Development is helping in our country, because whatever you invest in our country helps us to gain our strength in the face of very strong and powerful neighbors." You see. That's diplomatic language, but it certainly indicates that they know what it means. We kept hearing people say in Botswana, "We're going to control our destiny. We're going to have charge." And a man in a meat factory said, "We are now sending all the bone meal, and a lot of the scraps and all back to South Africa, and they' re able to do things with them." And he said, "And we have some trade with some of the Dutch." They had very limited markets. And he said, "But we're going to keep on until we get them." Is this partly because they're landlocked, also, as well as being South Africa's neighbors? Yes. The whole question of shipping, but also, the purchase, those who will purchase their things from them. They need Countries need produce, and they have produce, and it makes it a tragic situation. They can't get it out, or you only get it out through South Africa. DH: Well, they're getting it out, but what I'm saying is that they're gettingï»¿232 DH: (cont.) it out through South Africa. PC: That's terrible. DH: That's what I'm saying. So that when you're there, you say to yourself, "This isn't just what's going on in South Africa. It is that these economies are almost dependent on South Africa." Two of them are on the South African rand. They do not have their own currency, so that it's a long haul. But people have to have some sense of having some capacity to change the situation, in order for them to go on working. And our little bit that we will be doing in helping those people to organize their efforts and see how to mobilize, and what to do, will be very important. And one characteristic, I would have to say, is that they're all up and energetic and workingâthey have a sense of goal and purpose. PC: PC: Even these women who are bearing children and working? UH: Oh yes. They are hardâworking. And the Meharry team met with us and they said, "Have you seen anything quite like it?" You make an appointment at eight o'clock in the morning to go to someone's office, and you get there at a quarter of eight and they wait for you. There's that kind of vigor behind it. And people keep saying, They know what they're up against, but they're really trying to work at it. PC: That's a fascinating observation, because my thought, after I'd read the little material that I read on these three countries, was, these poor women, they must be so drained that they just fall into bed, and that they would die early, because they're so over-burdened. That's true. For instance, some of them told us that they were concerned about teen-age prostitution and other problems, because, you see, in all these countries now, in the Holiday Inns, there have been developed casinos. In Lesotho, with all those beautiful resorts, there are all kinds of attractions. And so many of the South Africans who have money come over there for pleasure, and spend their money. You go all the way through any of those countries in an evening, you know, in any dining room or casino, you'll see a great many of the whites from South Africa. Some of them are more enlightened, and others are just out enjoying themselves. So they have really critical urban problems, as well as the rural problems. But they have a lot of spirit, and they just say, "Well, we're going to make it." What happens with prostitutes? Are they put in jail if they're caught, or are they lenient? I don't know. They were just mentioning it to us as a teen-age problem. This is one of the things we'll find out more about. I think the women were lamenting that with the economic situation such as it is, so many, particularly teen-age girls, are getting themselves involved. And do they worry about pregnancy? Do they worry with us, or you, about pregnancy? The unwed mother, I should say. Not only the prostitute; the unwed mother, as such.ï»¿233 DH: Well, there is a kind of sense of family there; they are concerned about this, but this isn't quite the same problem. I don't know how to describe it. PC: Because there's someone to take care of... DH: They all kind of reinforce each other. They are concerned about what they call...not family planning, but family spacing, and they feel that many of the women need help in how to space their families. They have come to think of family planning as a pejorative, because they see it as meaning... PC: Genocide. DH: PC: PC: DH: DH: Planning to control the number of Africans. So that they are very much caught up in the whole idea of family spacing. And I think one of the nice things that we saw happening was that, even with our visit, some of these women were talking to government officials and pressing them to help the programs and getting a sense that they could influence what happens, and they take a great deal of influence, so that... So they have a sense of themselves, of pride? Yes. I think, really, I hope, at least within the next year or two, we will see some real changes in the capacities women have for determining what they want to do and organizing to do it, drawing upon their government for whatever resources it can do, but then adding the part that no government can do, and that's going to mean a lot. Well, it was a very exciting trip. Very. C: Continuing the interview with Dorothy Height on Memorial Day, Monday, May 31, 1976. We would like to discuss Miss Height's current appointments, former appointments, board memberships and awards. There are so many, we can't get to all of them. I already took the liberty of asking Miss Height earlier about some of them that she considers the most important, useful, and helpful to the work that she's doing. So I would like to ask her first about her current appointment on the Consumer Advisory Committee to the Federal Energy Office. Well, that's a very interesting one because when the problem arose around energy, the federal commission was designated in order to try to deal with some of the problems with the energy shortage, and with the fact that the renewable sources just are not there. And there was a need to make some adjustments. The 'commission was appointed with Lee White,who was a former aide to President Johnson, as the chairperson, and the chief responsible for federal regulations was the executive to whom it related. The commission has many different functions. It has representatives of the oil industry; it has people who are more engaged with such matters as international trade and all of those aspects, and there is one subcommittee which has to do with consumer questions. I was appointed to this one. I suppose I was appointed because there had been so much questioning throughï»¿'234 (cont.) the Office of Consumer Affairs about what was happening, especially to the poor and to the neighborhoods where cutting back on oil, or cutting back on electricity, or on the use of coal, would have been just making life all the more miserable. In the course of things, that advisory group was regrouped, and I think both political and other factors played into it. But the young woman from the National Urban League and the young black man coming out of Alabama are still on it. Each of us was asked at the time whether we wanted to indicate whether we would give this a top priority. I didn't feel that this was where I could be most valuable because so much of it still deals with the cost per barrel and the... Technical aspects. The technical aspects of the federal energy issues. There are those of us who are still related to it, but we don't have to attend meetings, so that I get at least, oh, I would say, at least fifty pages of paper from them practically every week. Now you realize how active the whole thing is. And I've just received the analysis showing what is happening through ...in some of the excavatory financial tribunes. I think the thing that has been the most valuable to me in keeping up with it has been that I have come to understand the nature of the energy crisis. It's not a crisis, it's a permanent problem, and there have to be alternative solutions. It has also helped me to realize that relying upon nuclear sources of energy may be beneficial to the industries who are involved and may speed things along, but that the essential ecology question around which the whole question of energy first arises, about the existence or the lack of existence and the sources of oil and other basic elements for energy, will not be solved by moving towards nuclear energy. So we should be conserving... I think it presents basic problems that are both ethical and... There are both ethical and moral questions, and questions really related to what extent is it better to use quicker more efficient ways of getting energy even at the risk of shortening life for people, and risking all of the things that the reactors and those things that are related will require. To what extent is this so crucial an issue that it should be pursued, no matter what the cost? I think that through the advisory group there was real unrest, because it was hard to get down to those things that are affecting people; it was easier to get at those things in terms of price figures and the like, without seeing that there was an interrelatedness there. With the power, was nuclear energy represented there? You couldn't fight power barons for the people, it sounds like. Yes, plus, we were not really related to the power barons. We were a consumer group, and our recommendations one by one got, you know, either sidetracked or placed in some kind of order where they were not on a priority list, and constant major decisions were being made. So in effect they ignored the other group, the advisory group, the consumerï»¿235 PC: (cont.) advisory group? DH: Well, the consumer advisory group will not be ignored. It has kept its voice going, but it is up against tremendous power in the oil-producing industr ies, and it is really quite a tough one. PC: And it's also international, I suppose? DH: Yes. PC: Well, there is one I know that was planned recently, that I believe you'd enjoy very much, called The National Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, of I think, Biomedical and Behavioral Research, H.E.W. DH: PC DH PC Yes, that's a federal commission which grew out of the protests of people as it was discovered that there had been testing of men at Tuskegee Institute for venereal diseases, and that some of those men had been given treatment, and others, for purposes of experimentation, were denied treatment. There were a few who suffered greatly and actually there were a few deaths. When all of that was exposed, the Senate began to look into the whole issue. Then a bill passed through the Senate and through the House calling f or the establishment of a federal commission on the use of human subjects in biomedical and behavioral research, whose job it would be primarily to advise the secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare on such matters, and to conduct a study of the experimentation on the fetus and to... To do what on the experimentation of the fetus? To conduct a study on the... On what is being done in experimentation? On what is being done, and actually the Senate, when it set up the commission, declared a four-month moratorium, declared a moratorium on experimentation or research related to the fetus. And at the same time it gave the commission a date of April 30, by which it was to have this study done, and the commission just came into being in late October 1975âwith its first meeting at that time. Well, this is a commission of fifteen persons from the medical field, from behavioral sciences, from ethics and the humanities, from law, and I am one of the public members. And it has a very important job because, by December of 1976, it is supposed to come out with its recommendations, which would establish the criteria for establishing a permanent commission to carry forward these functions. It is our understanding that we do not have to be that continuing body, but that our job is to create what that body should be. It's a very important thing because there is so much experimentation going on all the time, so much research... On human beings? Yes. Now some research can be done on animals and the like, but there come points where there is no other animal like the human. So that therefore there are limitations on what can be done with animals. But one of theï»¿236 (cont.) important things that the commission has said is whatever can be done without using human beings, should be the first stages. The report on the fetus was submitted in April, and the work now has proceeded to look at such crucial things as defining the boundaries of research; what the boundary between research and therapy is. And it deals with such things that often are within our grasp and we don't realize it, like when a physician gives one a medication that he has not used before, but he thinks may be helpful, is he doing research or is he doing therapy? Or is he doing experimentation? Well, in this regard* ithe experimentation has to be within a research program, so therefore it's more research. Now he may be in his practice, you know, really giving something a try; that is not research unless he is studying that and analyzing it and the rest, but there is alwaysâas " medical science advancesâthere's always that little bit of trial and error. So that's one reason that the issue of informed consent is so important. Because it is, and this is of course a matter that we are now struggling to try to define: what is informed consent? And trying to look at that within certain populations. For example, the population most subjected to research is the population that in the highest numbers go into hospitals, clinics and the like. So it was found that there was considerable amounts of research â sikHae with the poor, with the racial minorities, with prisoners... So that one of the questions was whether or not it was possible for someone in prison for whom the question "Would you be a part of a piece of research to test a particular drug or to try a particular kind of treatment of some kind..." Often with money entailed. Yes. Very little money, however. But if people are offered that, and they get so very little in the prison, and this is a little more, whether you could say they are exercising their own free will or whether they are being coercedâit raises very fundamental questions. Because you could say, if a person is in the free-living community and is not in a prison, and a person is offered a chance to participate in some kind of research, to be paid for it, that person is free to choose it- So, should prisoners be denied opportunities that they might have if they were in a free-living community? It has to be asked. So it isn't just the question of whether they are of their own free will. And as we have visited prisons, we have discovered many who are in full understanding and very sophisticated about what is happening. Then you have to look at the retarded, the mentally ill, children. Should children be the subjects of human experimentation; how do you get their informed consent? A baby has to have some surrogate. So r. .but how often does someone thinking that something they might be afraid of, may be the thing that will save their child. See, it's not a simple matter.. You can't just have rules of thumb. So that's why the element in the commission's name of protection is a very crucial one, because it isn't just a question of what kind of regulations can we set up, but it is in what ways can people be protected, not only their rights, but how can their bodies be protected. And, of course, the whole issue of behavioral researchâryouï»¿237 DH: (cont.) could say that in every classroom where a teacher says to children, if they do not do certain kinds of things, she will have them do something else, she is trying different things to modify their behavior. So that goes into the whole question of occupation, drugs and techniques, and when do you discover what is risk and what is benefit? How do we differentiate between that which has risk and harm, and that which is truly beneficial? And when you say beneficial, I would say that the commission is moving away from the concept of beneficial to the society. That if you cannot show how it is beneficial to that person who is involved, that person should not be put at risk to benefit society. And that's all very... pC: That's very sophisticated. I'm having a hard time with that. DH: Well, that's...but it's that kind of thing that we're dealing with. PC: Now do you represent a certain group of people? DH: When I started, I represented the public members, and I'm also in the group that has been looking at the ethical factors. We had a minority conference on the whole minority question, and in the course of that, there was such a sense of distrust of the whole medical profession because of the things people know have happened, the sterilizations that have taken place without the people knowing and really having been prepared. Or the sterilizations that have taken place when people have not been given the full facts; that is, they have been led to believe this was a very vital thing, and then they discover later that there was something that could have been avoided. So that looking at such things as time as a factor, the woman who has had her fifth child may consent to sterilization when she is in labor or when she has just immediately had this childâso how much time should she be given so that she's not under duress, she's able to think things out. These are the kinds of things that we're dealing with. I must say that it is one of the most stimulating groups. We have so much to read, and there is so much to do with it, and most of the people in the medical profession you seeâwe've had hearings almost every other month. We have visited homes for the retarded. We have visited mental hospitals. We've had to read just ever so much material that... All that we covered that has ever been written, we have at our service, we must have a network of about twenty-five or thirty specialists from leading institutions across the country. We have let millions of dollars in contracts to people to research out the data on a specific thing. And for example, the whole question of prisonsâwe've had ex-prisoners, we've had specialists who've worked for prison reform, we have visited prisons; we have reviewed the protocols of prison research. It meets two full days every month, except those months when we meet three full days. And it's a very heavy kind of assignment. PC: DH: This must be something special and out of the line of work that a councilor for the YWCA does, or what interests you... Well, when I was appointed, one of the medical men, one of my doctorsï»¿238 DH: (cont.) called me, and he was very upset because they had worked very hard to get one of their members appointed. He said, "I see in the Federal Register that they have appointed you." And he said, "I wish you would just throw out your name and put Dr. [William] Montague Cobb's name on it." Well, I said, "I have the greatest respect for Dr. Cobb." I didn't know what to say. I didn't ask to be appointed. I was surprised that I was appointed, but then the only thing I could say is, if my withdrawal would assure Dr. Cobb, that would be lovely. But that's not the way commissions get appointed. I assured him that I saw my role there as being a public member, and if there should be anything that they wanted to have brought before the commission, I was prepared to bring it, and that is the way that I have worked. I have been in touch with Dr. Cobb, kept in touch with him and with others. I think that the experience that I have had working on other commissions has been very helpful, but in addition, a commission like this which has eleven men and three women has an imbalance to begin with because, particularly in relation to all forums, the fetus, abortion, all those things, women are so deeply involved. But also, I think that the fact thatâwhen the two girls in Alabama were found sterilized without any consent on their part, we of the National Council of Negro Women, waged a real campaign and got a lot of letters written and protests. I imagine that maybe it was because of that that I was appointed. I think that, in addition, those of us who have worked with women and know something about women, and who also are part of the black community, have something to bring to it. What I have discovered is that the medical profession, like every other profession, comes to its own rescue. It begins to say immediately, "Well, that was not discrimination, we would have done that with anybody." And in the minority conference it came up... It interested me that on such a matter as psychosurgery, around which there has been a great deal of protest, that while the press and even some of our members have been interested in psychosurgery, when we got some two hundred people from black, brown, red, yellow communities together, and a great many women as well as men, they were more concerned with the delivery of health services. What they were saying was, it isn't the exceptional things where someone has a brain lobotomy or something that's performed, what concerned them wasâto use some of my experience, for exampleâwas that one could go into a clinic and might be found to have the sickle cell trait, not the disease but the trait. The data that were gathered around that could then be used to say you have to be careful about employing people because they are subject to sickle cell disease- You see? This sickle cell anemia might affect their work patterns. And it might affect this and that and the other. So the way in which data gets collected, by someone going into a hospital clinic with clinic cards and having to be there, and having the information about them analyzed with race and age and sex and all this, that may well contribute more in a detrimental way through the way the services are delivered than might have been if you'd said, "Go to Johns Hopkins Hospital to be a part of an experiment." So it's a tremendously hard piece of work. And I must say, there is not a light moment in a session. Is there any end to that? Do you have any idea when it will end?ï»¿239 Well, it goes up until December. The only nice thing is that we are compensated for our time, we are paid a hundred dollars a day. You talked about working on commissions, and I'm going backward now to the President's Commission on the Status of Women. It was in 19... What? Before I met you, you were working in it, so that's sixties, early sixties, is that right? Yes, I think it was, let's see in '61... President Kennedy was elected in '60, wasn't he? So it was in '61 that he appointed the fifty-member Commission on the Status of Women with Mrs. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, as the chairperson for that. That was a very highly representative group. It included such persons as Esther Peterson, who was then assistant secretary of labor; Margaret Hickey of the Ladies' Home Journal; Henry David, who had done all the manpower studiesâthere was a wide range in that group. This was the first commission, and it laid the groundwork in this country for a lot of other things that followed, and it really took a look at where women were. Why was it appointed by President Kennedy? What was the official reason for the President's Commission on the Status of Women? Well, the United States actually was very slow to move in that regard, and Kennedy was early for the United States, but late in the world. Because as you probably realize, in many other parts of the world, though women had been more oppressed and more out of things, once women began to move, they moved forward and moved quickly. In 1952 when I was in India, there were some seventy members of parliament who were women. Whereas in this country, we've always had just a very scant handful of women. I think in addition, women had begun to pressure for more recognition. Figures were being thrown out that were rather startling. The fact that there were as many women Ph.D.'s in 1961 as there were in 1912. So that, you know, we had this false impression that women were advancing, but they were not. I think it largely came out of women's groups asking to have a look at what was happening. Furthermore, the United Nations already had established a Commission on the Status of Women, and when our women went to represent there, they were there more as individuals, they had no grounding. The Women's Bureau took a major hand in urging the president to appoint such a commission in this country, because it realized that when our United States's representatives appeared in some of these international galleries, they were talking off-the-cuff. They could not come out and say there was an official position that America had taken. John Macy was the United States Civil Service Commissioner, and one of the first charges that the president made was that the Civil Service Commission had to begin to look at how the federal government was dealing with women. And it was very bad. They found out, for example, that women were grouped in all the jobs from range one to five, which were largely clerical, low-paid jobs. Not in decision-making. That's right. And when you got to the policy-making jobs, the top executive positions, those that were graded fifteen and above, you could count all of them on two hands. Now this kind of thing was very startling and, needless to say, Mrs. Roosevelt picked right up on it. The report of theï»¿240 DH: (cont.) commission is called American Women, and the underlying theme of it is that women in the United States need to have opportunities open to them. They need to have options so that a woman could choose to work or not to work or to, well, go to school or not to do so. And the second underlying theme was that this was not a study to advance the status of women over men, but to develop a sense of full partnership of men and women. PC: I think that the book could be issued every year. DH: It will, because we still haven't achieved what the reportâ We haven't, but we've started things, and its documentation is very, very good, because it went down on the line, and even before the first report was issued, the Civil Service Commission had begun to modify its approach. PC: Oh, I think a lot has been done. DH: Yes, but so much hasn't been done or hasn't been recognized, but people are working on it. PC: And that concept of having a commission in our national government, just as there's one in our international government in the United Nations, has now been established. DH: Is there such a commission now in existence? PC: oh yes, it has continued. It's called the Advisory Council on the Status of Women now. DH: I didn't know that. I'm glad to have that done. And that was recommended by the commission, that there should be a group to advance specific functions in the federal government. Now I did know you in the next appointment, when you were appointed one of a twenty-nine-member council to the White House Conference on "To Fulfill These Rights." Your being president of the National Council of Negro Women and having led so many women's fights for progress, that would make a great deal of sense for you to be working with Mrs. Roosevelt and such people; so would the twenty-nine-member council, because you were one of the original leaders when the civil rights movement began to take its full course. I don't know what you want to talk about. It's so logical that you have to think about what...well, I have one sense of your work. I think you met a great many people from around the country that you hadn't known otherwise who were interested in civil rights. Is that true? DH: PC: DH: Yes, it was a commission that brought together people from business and industry across the public and private sector, from civil rights groups and other groups. Our job was to plan a White House Conference on "To Fulfill These Rights." And to take the initiative in seeing who the people were... You were appointed by President Johnson, weren't you? Yes, by President Lyndon Johnson because this was his White House Conferenceï»¿241 (cont.) on "To Fulfill These Rights." And the job of that commission was to do the basic planning and set up the criteria for the selection of participants. And we carried a role in carrying out the conference. It was a very important thing, and the report of that conference, I think, was valuable in laying the groundwork for federal work in behalf of civil rights. Were you able to involve members of the National Council of Negro Women in that? Well, yes, in the conference, there were many people there. But one of the things that I've heard about the commission functioning is that in a group of fifteen to twenty or thirty people, if that group is going to do an effective job, and if one is there as a colored member, you have to be alert to the wide range, and you are there both as an individual and as an organizational person. And keeping that fine line of seeing... For example on this commission, you could say if they're only fifteen people, each one of us is here because we bring a life experience of the leadership that we share in organizations- So this is a product of the job, that I think whoever works in such a thing will always have, and I have found at times rather challenging to figure out how to... Right now I'm trying to see what the commission on human subjects... How do we really utilize some of what we're learning, to alert people? There are many women who go into hospitals every day, who would benefit if they realized there are questions they need to ask, that they don't need to sign something they don't understand, you see? Many will sign these consent slips, thinking, well, this is my salvation, I will sign it. It's an information program you're after... It's the whole thing. I find that you serve as an individual, but you have the opportunity and the obligation to involve all the sectors that you can touch in advancing whatever that thing is about. What the civil rights commission was...we carried a prime responsibility for selecting participants and for seeing to it that they got there. That was as important as planning the meeting itself. And then you, as president of the National Council of Negro Women, I believe, took a lot of that material to the convention. Oh yes, we used it in the convention. As a matter of fact, with the national YWCA, on a tour of the office that I worked in, we related through the Center for Racial Justice, we set up a "stay-at-home conference" using the working papers of the White House Conference on "To Fulfill These Rights," and sent them out to communities all over the country. Almost 300 not only had these, but sent back their final lists and we compiled those findings and presented them to the presidential commission. We got quite involved. Some of those -men, business, industry representatives, became friends of yours. Oh yes, sure. I met [Ben] Heineman in Chicago, and Mr. Sarah who worked with United States Steel___ï»¿242 PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: PC: DH: So that you could feel that if you had a special problem, you could go to representatives of industry about it. Yes. And I think, when you work on something like this where you can exchange ideas or raise questions or agree or disagree with each other, you get a better sense of each other. I came to know some of these people more as persons than thinking of them as heading this company or that company. I understand something of the point of view of these persons from different parts of the community and the United States. Well, that's true. Well, we'll go a little bit into board memberships. You have more than anybody I know. But I have a few down and Miss Height, for the sake of oral history... I've got so many of these things that we've got to choose, so I would like to know just one line, if you want, whatever you want, on, for example, the National Committee on Household Employment. Well, the National Committee on Household Employment is something that I and the National Council of Negro Women have had a hand in shaping, because we were concerned about the problems of household workers. Ethlyn Christensen initiated a small group who came together to look at the status of household employment and what was happening, the lack of protection, the lack of the conditions of work and the like. And we set up the committee, and the Women's Bureau gave a lot of technical help, and then Esther Peterson decided that she would use the honorarium that came her way to initiate our having some kind of staff backup for this work. Because it really got going based upon just plain problems in all of those things. So that we had been part of the National Committee... You've been vice-president or... I served as vice-chairman, not as a chairman... And you feel it's making progress? Yes. Anna Roosevelt Halsted, with my encouragement, took over the chairperson's role in it and did a marvelous job, really, for the period before she had to leave Washington. And during that time the thing got stabilized; we were able to get some foundation help so that the work really has moved ahead. Out of it has come on the part of household workers themselves, the desire to organize something called the Household Technicians. And they have now a National Household Technicians Association, which is a kind of, well, it's not a union as such, but it has the impact of having the workers themselves establish conditions of work and build themselves certain kinds of protection; they've got new kinds of contracts; in some cities they have set up regulations that are really making progress... But it's slow, isn't it? I mean, household technicians... There must be twenty-five to thirty thousand of them organized now, which was not true a few years ago. PC: They're so scattered, it's hard to get together and...ï»¿243 Well, and they are so the victims of the very thing that helps them. That is, they work for a person, and they are not working for a company or an organization, and so how to take some of that and get it under control, help them to understand their own needs for social security, help them to establish certain conditions, all of that is something they have... [November 6, 1976, meeting of National Council of Negro Women] [Opening prayer] And the will that Mrs. Bethune would have us to do here together, we know that without Thee, there can be no power. Without Thee, there can be no strength, and if we are not possessed with Thy will, we feel unable to do Thy will. And now, Dear Lord, give us all an opportunity to say just one word for Thee, and may we repeat the Lord's Prayer or say just one thing in Thy name quietly. [pause] These blessings we ask in Thy name. Amen. Thank you. This is indeed a very special meeting. It is the interim meeting between our conventions, and by the action of our convention, we have as the board of directors those who are the heads of organizations who form the base of the National Council of Negro Women, along with those who are otherwise elected or appointed to carry office. And as we begin then, I want to remind us that this is, as your agenda says, a special meeting of board of directors, executive committee, and members of the commission on the NCNW fifth decade. I think it would be very helpful because we all would like to have a chance to get to know one another, we're going to be working in some small groups which will make that really quite possible. But I'm going to ask our secretary if she would call the roll for us, and as your name or your organization is called, if you would stand. And if there is some, I know there might be some persons who are representing some other...we don't quite have, and if there's anyone missing, just let us know. But I'll ask Mrs. Coleman if she would call us, but let us ask each person to stand, so if we all follow our lists, we'll begin to identify individuals with...names with individuals. Miss Dorothy I..

Here is Mrs. Leola Edwards, who is the coordinator for the Bethune Recognition Program; Mrs. Patricia Gibson, who is the director for the Health Careers Program; Dr. Ruby Puryear, who is the director for the Bethune Collection on the History of Black Women's Organizations; Miss Suzette Garland, who is a field developer under our new international division, and who is now carrying some responsibilities for the coordination of the international program. These are members of the staff who are present; there are others who are around and who will be helping. Mrs. Whaley is going to tell us later how we're going to operate and the rest, and we'll come back to that. But we thought that, as we started today, it would be very good for us to kind of update; you know, on the NBC news they have a way of saying this is the news, and then periodically you get an update on the news. And I think in these past months, with the election in the United States, we have been getting updates, some of them by the hour, some of them, seems to me, went on forever. I think most of us have barely recovered from our experience of Tuesday night with watching to see what was going to happen as our country went through a very important election in its bicentennial year. So there is a way in which this meeting today is of vital importance. Someone said to me, "Well, I thought we might be talking about what we do now, what is our strategy as we face the new administration and as we look ahead to a new Congress." And I said, "Well, that would be a very real objective, a very real purpose, because this organization was organized in 1935 by a woman of vision who recognized from the beginning that there * Betti Whaleyï»¿246 (cont.) was the need to bring together and harness the womanpower that there is among us." And if you look back and see where Mary McLeod Bethune was in 1935, you will realize that she not only had founded Bethune-Cookman College, but she herself was in Washington as a part of President Roosevelt's...what they called the Black Cabinet, working with the National Youth Administration. Mary McLeod Bethune therefore, right from the beginning, had a sense of the importance of women uniting. In that first meeting that was held here in New York in the Harlem branch of the YWCA, she said, that at that moment the Negro woman, the trained and untrained alike, stood outside of America's mainstream of opportunity, influence, and power. And in a sense, when we say "update," we almost have to say how fare black women today. We have changed from calling ourselves "Negro" to "black"; we have seen some new legislation. How deep are the real changes? Are they cosmetic? Are they surface? What is our position now in relation to the society? I think we would have to say that we have advanced in every field in which women have advanced, but the majority of us are still at the very bottom of the economic and social ladder. And perhaps the fact that this meeting is called to look at who we are at home, and what we are engaged in, and how we have stayed in the struggle, what we have learned out of that struggle, that could be useful as we work with women in developing countriesâhelps to keep us aware that we have a contribut ion because we have a struggle. But we will not have much contribution unless we are both in the struggle, and we are noting where we are and keeping abreast so that we are continuously relevant. I think that as we come today, and you will see that a major item in our agenda is that of seeing how do we respond now that we have the opportunity to work with women in developing countries, how do we respond, drawing upon what we have learned? That has within it the assumption that we have to be willing to look at where we are, and we have to be willing to recognize that there are, I think, four kinds of crucial elements that have to be in our consciousness against which we keep examining our position in the society. One of those, of course, is in the political society. But I am not talking of politics in the small sense, but politics in the big sense in terms of the power relations. Because if there's anything that we're hearing coming out of Rhodesia, coming out of southern Africa, coming out of the struggles that people have in other parts of the world to whom we want to respond, it is that they're saying that the change has to be more than on the surface. It has to be a change in the power relations. That you can do an awful lot of changing what you might call simple interpersonal relations, but it's your power position that makes the difference. And in reality as women related to the darker races, and as black women primarily in this country, we have to be ready to recognize that in 1935, we were outside the mainstream. In 1976, we have our foot in the door, but we have a long way to go. We have to measure our progress, not by what has happened to the few, but by what the condition is of the many. And we will somehow put ourselves in a false position if we think only in terms of those who have made the most advances. Because when you really look at it, you can see that, given the Civil Rights Act of 1964, given all of the affirmative action programs that have taken place, given all the steps that have been made, those who have had the most education, the most skill, the most experience, have made the most advance. The gap has widened between those who have advanced and thoseï»¿(cont.) who are at the bottom, and that gap grows wider every day. It is reported even by our own Bureau of Labor Statistics that it is not only that there are jobs that are now obsolete, but there are many people, because they have no real skills that are marketable in a highly technological society, who are virtually obsolete. So that while we are working for full employment, we have to take into account there are millions of people who may never be able again to look forward to having a job unless there are some very drastic special arrangements made for them. The demands of a highly advancing age have not taken into account the need for keeping human beings active. It has taken into account the best way to produce the most and to advance with the least cost. A few years ago I remember reading something that one of the people who had been studying social and political systems, looking at it as a religious scholar, and someone was talking with himâhe wasn't talking in the anti-Communist vein, he was looking at it and he said, "You know, you may talk about it all you wish, but one of those things that people with a religious background of significance have to realize is that often we do not have what some of those in the Communist countries have." He said, "You know, the reason they have a good chance of winning is that they have a philosophy, they have a program and they have a passion." And I would hope that as we come into this meeting, whether we are board or staff, we would free ourselves from just looking at little activitiesâwe do this, we do thatâto examine what is really, what really has to be our philosophy today. Mrs. Bethune expressed it when she said that the time had come to harness the womanpower that there was among us. She called together twenty-eight national women's organizationsâtwenty-eight women representing national women's organizations. They were fewer than we are in this room. In the course of time, since then, we have a breadth of experience and opportunity that many of them might have thought was impossible. When you see the one living person, Mabel Keaton Staupers, who was a part of that group, you realize that they were women of vision, because I think that Mrs. Staupers, even in her eighty-seventh or eighty-eighth year, though she is physically unable to move, still has a great sense of hope for the future. And it was women like that who turned the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses into a core of women who are in the nursing field, not only integrated, if you want to use that word, but making their contributions along...all the way through. Those women at that time sensed that we did not need just to bring together another organization, but we needed, as they said, "an organization of organizations What makes today's meeting doubly important is that our focus today is pure and simple, looking at what it means to be an organization of organizations. It means that what Mrs. Bethune was saying then was best illustrated, you remember how she always did it, with her hands, saying, "If I take a finger and touch you, you won't know that you've been tapped. If I take two, you will at least know that something touched you. But if I bring all those fingers together into a fist, I can give you a terrible blow Now, she was a nonviolent woman [laughter], I don't think she meant to knock you out, but I think what she was really saying was that the kinds of things with which we are confronted cannot be attacked one by one, no matter how great our different groups, but we have to find the ways of working togetherï»¿248 DH: (cont.) So that in a sense you could say now as everybody is moving toward coalition, that Mrs. Bethune wasâas someone said, No one is ever ahead of their time, it may be that the people right around them aren't up to the times. But at the time she said that you need a coalition, and now everybody is talking coalition. And Mrs. Bethune said what we need is a coalition. So the whole philosophical base of the National Council of Negro Women is that we find the ways of working together, not one of those thingsâthat old melting pot that I think we've all learned was almost a dangerous conceptâbut one in which each group is able to celebrate its own identity, but to find something greater than itself as it joins with others. Now that's an idea, that's a philosophy that yet has to be realized. In 1967, and you will find this in your book, I'll just read it to you, and I'd like to ask you to look in there, it's a little book called Two Minutes to Midnight. In 1967 (the bottom of page two), nine years ago, we called together a meeting just like this, and we were the representatives. The difference was that we have since structured this into our whole mechanism in a new way. But what we said then could have been said this morning. Looking at where we are in the American society (at the bottom of page two), this was such a clear ringing message, such a way of demonstrating our basic philosophy that we called the meeting report Two Minutes to Midnight, because everybody who spoke, all through that time, "Well, it's two minutes to midnight." And so we said, "Now at two minutes to midnight, we are taking a backward look at our programs and projects to assess whether they are truly relevant to the needs of the present. Our awareness of the flood of emotions which is shaking the very capstones of society has also deepened our sense of social responsibility and as Negroes, as women, as human beings, out of our closeness to the problems of the Negro family where real change and real service must occur, we sense a need." I think these words here, "for a new unity of Negro women to respond to the new challenges, to serve more effectively before time runs out. How can we connect the talents and skills of almost four million women to serve as catalysts and agents for change in thousands of communities? How can we maximize our potential to meet the tremendous challenge of this age of change and turmoil?" And if you will turn to the next page, the group ended with saying, and this was the result of three days of work, "We must somehow make our objectives to implement affiliate national program goals through collaborative efforts." And I wish we could underscore that word "collaborative," because I think that sometimes our concept of cooperation is, you know, I do the co-ing and you do the operating. Well, really what we're talking about is not cooperation, we're talking about collaboration, recognizing that we are all part of one, that it is sometimes, we talked about itâwe and they or you and meâwhen it's us. And in the society in which we live, unless we think about us with the sense of wholeness, then we are fragmented with all of our skills; with the wealth of knowledge that there is among us, we are incapacitated at a time when we need our maximum service. And then they said, "Let us establish a national communication network for exchange of information and improved cooperation, develop proposals responsive to acute needs of people in communities, increase sensitivity to people's needs, assess strength and potential of groups, explore majorï»¿249 DH: (cont.) national issues in their relevance to national program goals of affiliates, to build constructive potential for high level relationships for more effective collaboration and support." This meeting was a kind of milestone in the history of the National Council of Negro Women, because it grew out of the first piece of work, that the National Council of Negro Women was ever able to secure outside funding to develop. It was a project called "Project Womanpower." There, with the help of the Ford Foundation, we were able to bring together women who had been working in many different communities and then the national heads to sit down together. In a sense as we talk about updating, let's keep this before us, and realize that we're not starting from scratch. The challenge before us is to say, "What are the next steps in that collaboration? What new patterns are there?" The underlying philosophy is one in which we are seeking to make this togetherness more effective. The second thing that seemed to me that we might look at in terms of program is that an organization can have goals, but it always has to say how you translate those goals into action. What are we doing? In a sense the program is what we do to accomplish those goals. There are in the present scene, several things, and you will notice in this report which I found very interestingâand I hope that each of us will read this all the way throughâthere are some tremendous papers that were presented, or tremendous remarks, we recorded that meeting, as we're doing this one, so that we may have it for us. Well, one of the things that was said by one of the people at that time was that what we needed was to realize that there were three groups of people who were bringing about change in our society. At that moment, you will bear in mind, they were looking at what was happening to the civil rights movement. So it was those who were black or brown, the people of color, who were in a sense rebelling against conditions that had oppressed us. The second group, they said, was the young, all of the young. In the group of those who were rebelling, the black and the poor, the young were the second group, and the third group, women. And it's very significant that the National Council of Negro Women really is deeply involved and embraces all of these. As you look at 1976, you would say that those same elements, those same components are there. And whatever we do in terms of program has to be seen as relevant to making a difference in the lives of the families, the individuals, the communities, to which we are related. And so I found myself jotting down that we have to be conscious of the political climate today, political in the sense of power and power in the sense of decisionmaking, being related to the structures, the institutions helping to bring about change. We are meeting at a time when women around the world are on the move. We have a button before us representing the United Nations Decade for Women. We are ourselves a part of the International Women's Year Program. And a principal piece of our work while we are here will be dealing with how we see ourselves working internationally. We have through our Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, the opportunity to work with women in developing countries. But what we have to offer comes because we have been working in the underdeveloped areas of the United States. I think that as we lookï»¿250 (cont.) back, we can see that there are many aspects to that, and that in this period .just immediately ahead, when there will be meetings, and one here in this country, of women looking at how American women participate. One of Bella Abzug's last contributions was to get the funding for a conference of women in the United States, part of the International Women's Year. That's been set for next November in Houston, Texas. We don't want to just go to a conference, we have to be a part of that, making certain that the plight and the progress of black women and their families become a part of the thinking and the work, the goals, achievements that come out of that. You will see in our program that we have been focusing around certain problems related to youth. And this afternoon, we'll have a chance to hear something of the kinds of things that we are doing. But even as we do that, we have to see that our question is not activity, it is that we have been addressing ourselves to the fact that minority youth in this country are the most out-of-school and out-of-work group in the society. In some communities, as high as 50 percent, 50 to 60 percent of black youth are out of school and out of work. It is very telling for us that even within that, the highest group is the teen-age and what the census describes as the nonwhite girl, so that there is a way in which we have to look at program in terms of how relevant is it to the needs. Aud The other aspect that I feel that you will note as we look at program is, we have been working not only to help women advance their careers, but we have taken a major role in representing the interests and concerns of women. Some of that got started during the height of the civil rights movement. You remember that in 1964, in the height of the civil rights movement, we went into rural Mississippi and we worked there with women. We went into Mississippi, and I felt this the other night when Mississippi was the last state to put Mr., uh...Mr., uh, what do you call it... ience: [general laughter] Carter!!! DH: Audience. DH: CarterâI was trying to see if you realized it. [more laughter] I stopped and thought, Do you remember when Mississippi was the last of everything? Right! Do you remember when Unita Blackwell Wright used to say to us, "I come from the ruralest of the rural." And I didn't know that there was such a thing as the "ruralest," but she did. But you'll be interested to know, that of that ruralest of the rural neighborhood where she is, she has just been telling us their city was incorporated and Unita Blackwell Wright is the new mayor. [laughter] Aud So when you talk about updating, you know, you have to look at the swing between what was going on and what has happened. In the whole range of things, to realize now, that in the days when we went into MississippiâPolly Cowan set up that Wednesdays in Mississippiâwe could get off the...what do you get off? ience: Plane.ï»¿251 ...plane in the Jackson airport, but we had to act like we didn't know each other. The only possibility for us to move together would have been for me to pretend I was her maid or something. No, we could not have moved. We took teams of women down, and I think maybe she ought to tell us, she was telling me this morning about a little update in relations to women in another part of the world. Well, I think an awful lot of you know this, but we will go into it a little again. The replication is fun to know about, and I'll leave that for the last. We did go into the South in 1964 and 1965 in teams. Many of you, or your organizations and agencies, were a part of those teams. We tried our best to get all of the affiliates, and then we worked with other groups such as the League of Women Voters, and the church groups of both white and black and leaders in professions, professional women, and women who just had a way with them. We brought in a lot of educators too. Now, the white women in those days worked with white women, and the black women worked with black women, because there was very little meeting ground. Once in a while we were able to have meals together in a sort of off-the-record, hidden way, and exchanged, we always exchanged information, but it had to be done off-the-record, really. But as the program got moving, and the civil rights bill was passed, we made the effort finally to eat in the newly integrated restaurants, and to move into the newly integrated hotels, with a great deal of hostility directed at us, but we did it. Finally, the white women were housed in white women's homes. Black women had always been received with pleasure in black women's homes; they often did an educational job because the black women didn't really have courage and didn't really understand that things were on the move. Well, when white women moved into white women's homes, that was a big step because those white women were terrified. But, it began to happen and then, to cut that part of it short, programs began to evolve in the next few years, because as Miss Height and other people, and once in a while I went along, went down there, they got the ruralest of the rural and the poorest of the poor to say what they needed. That's how the hunger program evolved, and housing programs, and help for teen-agers, and perhaps even some beginnings of the health program and the career programs. Now, much is going on that will be reported around the room, I am sure, but it began from the little seed of our just trying to help women and teen-agers who had been jailed and really persecuted down there. We were doing our best to make their lives a little easier. Incidentally, at one of those visits, Miss Height was served a warrantâ she could have been incarcerated in Selma, Alabama, but she got out. Now, what's happening today, and I just found out recently, you all know the terrible problems in Ireland and of the women who have been on the peace march there. Apparently, on December 4, there is going to be another peace march and it will be, as much as possible, an international peace march. I found out that this was started by Jack Conway's wife, whose name I cannot remember, and Marsha Nielson, who is a friend of mine who followed all of our adventures in Wednesdays in Mississippi. They are getting together an international group, as best they can with no money, to join the women of Ireland in the peace march. When Mrs. Nielson told me, she said, "We really followed the plan of Wednesdays in Mississippi." I think * Polly Cowanï»¿252 PC: (cont.) that's something that we should be proud of. [laughter] DH: It really requires more than lip service. It requires a kind of trying to get with it, so that you can both appreciate your heritage and your past, and you can help shape the future. That's why today's meeting is so important. You will notice that in the objectives we have said that this is about the future of the National Council of Negro Women. And then, we are aiming to further strengthen the coalition of black women working within NCNW. This is on your agendaâyou have the agenda. Get your copies in case someone doesn't have them. Before the news gets out in the press, they are calling to ask what kinds of women who are there, that we would suggest might help as a new administration speaker. Or, who do we have to suggest, where are we? In other words, what jointness has in it something that has meaning for the individual group as well as for the total. And then the otherâto present a united front on urgent issues. We've isolated a few urgent issues. You will see us looking... One which has to do with the part of the world with which we are now working, that is, southern Africa. We have urgent issues around the whole question of employment, around youth, and we'll be talking to those. I think that if we can keep these objectives in mind, but keep a sense of perspective on itâif this moment is the first time we've ever thought about the National Council of Negro Women seriouslyâwe have something to bring to it. We don't have to say, "I don't know the history." But we do have to have the knowledge that we have roots, that we have a beginning, that we have a base, that what we are struggling with now, has to be seen within that whole context. I just wanted, therefore, as we move, to refresh our minds about how we are structured to be what we are. We are an organization of organizations. The National Council of Negro Women was several years old before it organized local sections. This meeting is not about local sections, this is about the basic organization. The local sections were organized as a way of relating in local communitiesâthose who could form the base in a communityâfrom those organizations who were the basic structure of the National Council of Negro Women. I think every once in a while we stray from that, and we have to be very careful, lest we say, "Where are the rest of you?" We get that "we" and "they," when it is "us" that we are really struggling to do. This is a complex kind of structure because it means that every national organization has its local units. But the uniqueness in the National Council of Negro Women is that it aims not only to relate us together nationally, but also to provide the mechanism through which local units may have more of a sense of a clearinghouse of collaborative efforts, of mutual support. That part is hard to achieve, but it is the most important part. When we say that we today have an outreach to four million women, that outreach is real. What is really necessary is for us to find the ways of actualizing that relationship in local communities as well as at the national level. I quoted Mrs. Bethune's 850,000 a few minutes ago, and then that number went up; then, I remember talking to Dr. Ross, when we were taking a tally andï»¿253 (cont.) she told us about the three million Baptist women. We said, "Oh my goodness, we have so many." So if we really added it all up that way, it would be even more, but we realize that there are Baptist women who also belong to some other groups that we have. This is not a public relations figure, that's all I want you to know; it is a fact. And to me, it is a challenge that we cannot shy away from. One of the unique things that happened in 1969 was that at a meeting in Nassau, the heads of affiliates recognized that the need was here for us to provide an opportunity for women who were in the organization to give direct support to the National Council of Negro Women through their membership. We'll be talking about this later, that whole concept of direct membership, and what it means and why we came to it. One of the things that has been happening to the National Council itself is that we're having the opportunity to look to see how we might be more effective by working within the states, rather than by simply having, what we used to have, a kind of regional operation. So we will be discussing, later today, the whole idea of localizing women at the state level. That's becoming increasingly important. International Women's Year conference people called us the other day and said, "Give us the names of women in every state who could work with the development of those conferences." Mrs. Hampton is here from Minnesota, but I remember one time a very glaring experience when the president of the National Council of Jewish Women called me and said, "Out here in Minnesota, when we want the Catholic women, we know who to call upon; when we want the Jewish women, we know who to call upon," but then she went on, "When we want black women, we have to call all these groups." So, when we get together, no one is able to say, "Well, I represent..." There's no coming together. She said, "What can be done?" So she took a hand in helping to organize the National Council of Negro Women. I'd been there a few years before, and Mrs. Hampton is here, and it is very clear that they are enlightened now. But I'd been there a few years before for the YWCA; I met with a group of women and they took me to an elegant place at the top of something, one of those high restaurants that go round in a circle and all that. After I gave my best speech about the National Council of Negro Women, one of the best dressed, smartest women I'd seen said, "Well, Miss Height, that's very good for the places that need it, but we're integrated out here." [laughter] And I remember Alice Sente, who had been my hostess, was so embarrassed that she started and she said, "Yes, but...yes, but..." What they didn't know, I had just left the YWCA and had found out how integrated they were, how unintegrated they were. Anyhow, when it was all over, I said, "Well, it has been nice meeting you and so on." But thank goodness, the light dawned. You see, this is what we are really trying to say, we have to find out where we are and who we are. And now, those women have moved forward, so that one of the things we sensed was that as federal revenue sharing, as the new federal income moves, as things turn to the states and localities, we have to be organized in those localities to make the difference. We already have made some progress on that. You have the report on that. We'll be talking about it later, but I cite that as a part of our new effort to modify ourselves. In addition, in the last convention, we adopted a plan, which you also haveï»¿254 (cont.) and which we'll be working with later for looking at the future of the National Council of Negro Women. Here we are, forty-one years old. How will we be in the next decade? Where do we want to go? What do we want to see happen that hasn't happened? How do we want to shape ourselves? What do we think that we must achieve? We will be looking at that, and as we do it, one of the things that we can say is that we, ourselves, have been part of some new coalitions that are giving us a sense of what's happening. One of these, of course you know, is we've been a part of WICS for the past ten years, but in the past few months, we've become a part of a new one called the Alliance for Volunteerism. You will note from your papers and everything else, the National Congress on Volunteerism, that there has been a tremendous new push toward the whole question of volunteerism. The National Council of Negro Women, as a part of that coalition, is learning what it means to be a part of a coalition. We are affiliates in the Alliance for Volunteerism, and there are new patterns emerging there that we think __ have a lot to say for how, in our own National Council, we may work together. Each of us, as affiliate groups in the Alliance for Volunteerism, is carrying a particular task force, a particular piece of work. We, with the National Black United Fund, have joined our forces because we found that if the pie, as it were, was cut in twelve pieces, if we took our two pieces and put them togetherâsince we are concerned about our kinds of communitiesâ that we could maximize our results. Are there things that we could think about, about new ways of working as organizations working together, new ways of making a contribution, new ways of servicing? Those new ways then, would be reflected more at the community level, because, as we begin to work things out, we see that it's at the community level that we have to work out plans that are carried forward. So, therefore, as we come into this meeting, I hope that we will see we have a responsibility to help shape the philosophy, the principles, the concepts through which we wish to work, to get some way of assessing, not only for our program and structure, to find us now, but to develop a new sense of passion for the things that we know have to be done. And they're not going to be done unless we put ourselves to them. You will see, running through everything we do, today and tomorrow, that the call to identify the resources that are among us, the people, the ideas, the ways of work that would be useful, internationally, will be a primary focus of our work. But, we first have to find out more about ourselves and what we are doing. A few weels ago a group of people from the black community and our organizations were called to meet with Secretary Kissinger, who was sharing something of the thinking in the new strategy that had been proposed in relation to southern Africa. In that meeting, there was the kind of thing that arose, that sort of gave everybody a kind of sense that each of us has to be careful, lest our ownâyou know, we all have our egos and our interests and so forthâbut we have to be very careful that they don't take hold of us and run away so we forget who we are and what it is we are trying to achieve. While the secretary was describing what he's doing in southern Africa and the like, the question arose about visas to go to South Africa. He is a diplomat and so he said, "Well, you're a representative group. If some of you realize that the South African people can't take hundreds of blacks if they want to go, and if you would meet with me and help me to select thoseï»¿j255 DH: (cont.) who would be the ones to go, then we could see to it that the South African government gives them visas." Nobody had a chance to rehearse, no one had practiced this, but all of us as one voice, the message came back to him. Percy Sutton said it the best when he said, "Mr. Secretary, we cannot settle for that. The United States government accepts people who come from the Union of South Africa. When it starts limiting the number of South Africans it will accept in the United States, then we will accept limiting the number of Americans who are given visas to South Africa. And, if any one of us were to tell you which ones, then we would be denying for ourselves what is our right. If Americans are going to South Africa, black Americans must have that same right." Now, I say this, because I think that to me this was an indication of what it takes for us to move ahead. No one of us can afford to sell the other out. We all have to be willing and ready to think what we are trying to do. It's that sense when we talk about unity. Mrs. Bethune said, "We need a unity of purpose and a unity of action." That's what she was talking about. It is not a sense that if one can make it, and that one makes it and says, Well, I am the first and I am the only...you know, that thing. It seems to me now that as we are working here today, we will be not only talking about what our programs are and what we are doing, but we hope that we will share deeply some of the things that each of us, in our groups, is working on, struggling with, where our program thrusts are, what it is that we are concerned about. We hope that we will not be so modest that we don't... You know sometimes we don't know this. We don't. We need to know more, and that's why you will see that we have put considerable time within our schedule for us to have the opportunities for some in-depth sharing, so that we might know more of each other. Then from that, hopefully tomorrow, as we are looking at how we are going to strategize and what is going to be our way of work for relating to women in developing countries, that we will have laid a better base for moving together ahead. And now, I am going to ask Mrs. Whaley if she will tell us how we are going to work and in what groups. I hope this will mean that we will be sort of helping each other all along as we go. BW: We did get a sense of each other, and we did note the program emphasizes all of the important organizations. Ideally, the best way to have done this was for us to meet in open session and for everyone to report out. But we also felt that we would not get the kind of in-depth sharing when we hear from twenty-seven groups. So, therefore, what we have developed are round tables, where we will be interviewing the affiliate organizations particularly. In those round tables will be your representatives from the executive committee and from the staff, so that we can all get a sense of the program emphases. We will hope to synthesize that information from the round table interviews and give you a feedback during lunch. We are particularly looking for commonalities and linkages, because we do know that a number of the affiliate organizations are working on programs of common purpose, so that we can get that sharing and see how we can maximize our resources. I think that's all we want to say right now about the round tables. As you go into your groupings, the person who is scheduled to be the interviewer will help you identify exactly what our goals and objectives are. There is a great deal of information that we want to gather, butï»¿256 BW: (cont.) primarily for the purpose of this exchange we want to focus in on the programs and organizational goals. Just in terms of mechanics, two of the groups will be meeting in this room, this is the Boston Room. That's round table four and three; three will meet over here, and four will meet over here. The interviewer for round table number three is Anna Kanig. Anna, will you stand again so that people will know where you are, and so we will ask you to gather at that table, round table three. Round table four, Miss Higgens, will you be over here. Round table two is in the Roman Room, which is right there. Grumman Room, I'm sorry. Right there in the cornerâand the interviewer for that is Miss Ruth A. Sykes. Miss Sykesâyou stand, and she'll be over there. And round table one will meet in the Peace Room, which is on the eleventh floor, and Miss Thelma Ferguson, who's there, Miss Ferguson is out of the room, and Miss Sykes was introduced in back. She has just joined NCNW as a consultant or public information specialist with a Ford contract, and we must acknowledge Ms. Kathy Mitchell who is here in two roles, Tau Gamma Delta, and also as one of the key persons at Ford who makes the grant possible to have some of the staff here today. Now, do all of you have the listing of the round tables in terms of which round tables you're in? DH: Before we move too, I'd like to say that a few minutes ago, Ms. Mitchell, whom you've just introduced from the Ford Foundation and Tau Gamma Delta, just came in. Mrs. Thelma Dailey of the Trade Union Women of African Heritage, were you here then? Oh, I'm sorry. Mrs. Odessa Skeene, who is one of our committee people working with white membershipâwas there someone elseâMrs. Elsie Bookhart, one of our vice-presidents and, no, we got you, and... BW: One other piece of update that Miss Height didn't mention is that she talked about the Alliance of Volunteerism, and I don't think it is out of school to mention that she is likely to be nominated for the president of the Alliance, which gives us another foot inside the door. The round table is scheduledâwe are just ten minutes offâfrom 10:45 to 12:30.ï»¿..
