 Joey Fink: This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. It&#8217;s May 17, 2011. I&#8217;m in-. Ann Mostoller: Eighteenth. JF: Excuse me. Thank you. It&#8217;s May 18, 2011. I&#8217;m in Oak Ridge, Tennessee with Ann Mostoller. Ms. Mostoller, can you start by telling me when and where you were born? AM: I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, March 15, 1941. JF: I grew up outside of Pittsburgh. AM: Oh, whereabouts? JF: In Imperial, out by the airport. AM: Imperial? JF: Yeah. It was pretty rural when I was growing up but now it&#8217;s gotten much more developed. AM: Is it part of Moon Township? JF: Next to Moon Township. AM: Next to Moon Township, okay. JF: Where did you grow up in Pittsburgh? AM: Ben Avon. JF: Ben Avon? Okay, down on the Ohio? AM: Mm hmm. JF: And was that sort of a mixture of working class, middle class? AM: Mm mm. I was in Ben Avon Heights. It was a very small, very-. It was a middle/upper income community, not Sewickley but-. JF: The Heights are always a little-. [Laughs] AM: And even Ben Avon was not very working class, I wouldn&#8217;t say. JF: And your folks are from there, your family&#8217;s from there? AM: No, they&#8217;re originally from New Jersey. JF: Okay. So you went to high school-? AM: I went to high school there, right, Avonworth High School. JF: And was there an expectation when you were growing up that you would go on to college? AM: Yes, I think so. I think almost everybody who lived in Ben Avon and Ben Avon Heights would have been expected to go to college. JF: Okay. And what did you want to do when you went to college? AM: I had no idea. JF: [Laughs] Where did you go to college? AM: Brown [University]. JF: Brown? AM: Mm hmm. JF: What did you study? AM: I majored in international relations. JF: Okay. And then you graduated in [19]63? AM: [19]63. JF: And what were you planning to do after graduation? AM: Well I got married. I don&#8217;t know that I had any real plans at that point. JF: Did you meet your husband in college? AM: He&#8217;s also from Pittsburgh. JF: Okay. And then I noticed on your law firm website that you have two children? AM: I do. JF: And so did you have your children right after college? AM: No, no, didn&#8217;t have the children for about five years, I guess, four years. JF: And then between Brown and when you went to law school- AM: I worked. JF: -in the early [19]70s-. AM: I worked until a little after I had the children and then I went to law school about eight years after I graduated. I think that&#8217;s about right. JF: How did you make the decision to go to law school? AM: Well, it was probably stupid but we lived in Florida at that point, in Boca Raton, where there was a legal services office that handled migrant-. For some reason in Boca Raton, which is a very wealthy community, they had a migrant community and so they had a branch of legal services there and I thought that sounded fascinating and that you could probably do that work part-time so I decided that would be a good career that I could do part-time. JF: And how did you end up in Knoxville? AM: In Oak Ridge? JF: Mm hmm, or in Oak Ridge. AM: My husband worked at the lab. JF: Okay. So you moved to Oak Ridge and then applied to law school? AM: And then went to law school, mm hmm. JF: What was the application process like for law school? AM: It was really easy. This was in 1971 or [19]72, I think. I mean it was really easy to get into law school at that time. JF: And were there many women in law school with you? AM: We were on a quarter system, there were four women, but what I can&#8217;t remember is how big the class was. I think there were about seven hundred students so you&#8217;d think two or three hundred, probably, a year. We had four, and out of the whole seven hundred there were twenty-one women in the law school at that time. I think we were all the only woman in our class almost all the time. Then the year we left, which was [19]74, that incoming class was one third women. JF: Wow. Was that because of Title IX, do you think, that change? AM: I don&#8217;t think it was. I think it was just a gradual change in what women were wanting to do. Title IX would have been more the sports stuff. I mean that&#8217;s important but I don&#8217;t think that was the major catalyst. JF: So can you characterize the climate for women when you entered law school? AM: Well, I think it was a struggle. There were a couple of women in our class who truly were young women right out of school, and I think they had a real different experience than Dorothy and I because we had families, we traveled every day, we couldn&#8217;t really participate that much in the law school activities, and so that probably made us be a little bit different. But the other women there were-. We were a real odd lot. There was another woman-two other women-Dorothy&#8217;s age, and she was forty-five. One had been I think a state legislator and one had just gotten out of the Navy, retired from the Navy, so it was a weird mix of people who were in school. It was very different. People didn&#8217;t know quite what to do with us, but, I don&#8217;t know. So while I was there we formed a women&#8217;s law group, we had women come and speak to us and we put on something that I can hardly remember over at that student center, some big deal, so we were real aware that we were different. JF: Did you run into any conflict with professors or fellow students? AM: I don&#8217;t think so. For one thing the professors were kind of young. That was the hardest thing was that the professors were probably younger than Dorothy and almost younger than myself, but there were a lot of men who had come out of the service so there were a lot of men who were a little bit older too because the Vietnam War was just winding down and they were out. We weren&#8217;t the oldest-well we were, but not that much older than everybody else. But I don&#8217;t recall there being a lot of trouble with the professors, even the older ones. I think probably we noticed more awkward treatment of us when we got out and started to practice. People didn&#8217;t quite know how to handle us, what to call us. That part was pretty awkward. JF: So you were a mother while you were in law school. AM: Dorothy and I both were. Her children were a little bit older but mine were pretty young. JF: How were you able to balance all that? AM: That was hard. That was the hardest thing I ever did. I never was so tired in my life. JF: Did you have to negotiate for family responsibilities in the household, housework, taking care of the kids? AM: Some. I mean they went to daycare. My husband participated. I had a husband, fortunately. I don&#8217;t know how you do that by yourself. It was very inexpensive, that&#8217;s one thing. Now you think about student loans and all, I mean we hardly even noticed the cost of going to school. The books probably cost more than the tuition. JF: Wow! AM: So that made it a lot easier. JF: Did you have to do any internships? I noticed talking to some women who were pushing into the professions in the [19]60s and early [19]70s that they had trouble fulfilling some requirements to get an internship. Nobody would hire a female intern or - AM: I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t remember there being internship possibilities. The closest that we came was that the year we graduated, while we were taking the bar and waiting for the results, we were employed by the legal clinic, and that was a big help, but that legal clinic isn&#8217;t the same now. At that time it was very active and the students could go to court and do a lot of stuff. So that did help us a little bit to prepare us to start practicing but I don&#8217;t recall there being formal internships. People did go to work, because you were allowed to work then, and I don&#8217;t remember if the women had trouble getting those jobs because most of the people were working for their relatives and all that sort of thing so it probably depended more on whether you had family around than anything else. JF: And so then you graduated, and what did you expect? What kind of work did you hope to get? AM: I really don&#8217;t know. We probably both had some idea of doing legal services kind of work. I don&#8217;t know how well formulated we were in our thinking about what we would do and what type of law we would do. I don&#8217;t even know that we made a very great effort to find work. Certainly there weren&#8217;t people lined up to hire us and I did send some letters. I don&#8217;t know if Dorothy did or not. I remember talking to one gentleman who said, &#8220;What would you do in my office?&#8221; [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know what he meant by that. Maybe he didn&#8217;t have enough work or maybe he didn&#8217;t know what a woman would do in his office. I really don&#8217;t know what that was all about. Anyway, nobody offered to hire us so we made the probably foolish decision to just open up a law office. JF: [Laughs] Did you have any trouble getting loans or getting started? AM: You know we&#8217;re not a good sample because we had husbands who worked and could support us. We didn&#8217;t really have to make a lot of money. So we borrowed money and we got a loan with no trouble at all for two thousand dollars from a local bank, very nice guy, no collateral, no cosigners, nothing like that, and we did not have a problem doing that, but somebody coming out of law school with a family who had to support the family, that&#8217;s not a good comparison. I&#8217;m sure we would have had trouble if we&#8217;d tried to borrow twenty thousand dollars back at that time and didn&#8217;t have any collateral to put up for it or a cosigner. So we started out on a real shoestring and stayed that way for a long time. I think it was probably five years before we really paid ourselves a salary. JF: Wow. AM: And, you know, other people can&#8217;t do that. JF: What kind of clients and cases did you take on in the early years? AM: Well we started out with appointed criminal work, which is very common, and we were the public defender for a year. There was a public defender program that was just a kind of a little pilot program and we did that for one year, got some good experience that way. There were a couple of men in the bar who were really very helpful. One had been the public defender before us and he was just very willing to help us figure out how to try cases and so on, and we really appreciated that. He was one of the younger members of the bar and then another young man, who was kind of a personal friend as well, was very helpful. They both treated us just like we were regular people. They didn&#8217;t have any problem with the fact that we were women and they were very good to help us. Then we did a lot of domestic relations work through a program that our local bar association had at that time where you took cases on a sliding fee scale, and we did do that. Then we kind of branched out into other things. JF: I know in the mid [19]70s there were some efforts by some women activists to help women learn their legal rights, I think when it came to credit or divorce, and that this for a lot of women was really important for helping women gain more independence. AM: I don&#8217;t know. If we participated in some programs like that I&#8217;ve forgotten about it. Sorry. JF: No, that&#8217;s okay. [Laughs] AM: Now Dorothy was real active in some things dealing with sports, not in so much a legal area but more administratively, pushing things through the government with some other folks, and of course we did that basketball case. That was my case. JF: Was that when you-? AM: And she went on and did some employment discrimination cases. Those were really hard cases. I did one, I think, and lost that one and she did a couple and they kind of came out half and half, but as far as doing non-law educational stuff I don&#8217;t recall that we did a whole lot of that, just other than our work and however we would have dealt with the clients. JF: And the basketball half-court case, [Laughs] I have kind of a sketchy idea of it in my head. AM: Well I doubt they were still playing that way when you were young so you&#8217;d have no reason to remember these- JF: [Laughs] No. AM: -foolish things that we did. JF: Speaking with Dorothy a little bit, and then I also spoke with Nan Shugart, is this the right characterization of it, that there was an attempt to, through the Tennessee courts, end half-court basketball for high school girls and that didn&#8217;t work? AM: It did and then it didn&#8217;t, and then the next year they changed the rules. We had a client, a friend of mine, whose daughter was on the high school team, and he was really irritated that she was having to play this half-court basketball. JF: And this was here in Oak Ridge? AM: Yes, in Oak Ridge, and so he asked us to bring a suit and we did. It makes good reading. Pat Head testified, and the position we took is that the women were being financially harmed because they would not get scholarships as easily coming from a split-court basketball program and going into the university system where it wasn&#8217;t split-court. It was kind of a difficult argument because in Iowa they had a wonderful girls&#8217; basketball program and the girls went to all the best teams and they played split-court. They were just really good. But we had a judge who was very sympathetic, and we knew that. He had previously required that a team in Morgan County, I think, which is a really rural little county way up kind of north of us, allow a girl to play baseball on the high school baseball team. He had played baseball in the Appalachian League, or something like that, and so he was really tuned into the sports, and you know there was no good justification for that split-court basketball, so he ruled in our favor. He ruled that they had to change, but the Tennessee organization that runs the sports appealed that to the Sixth Circuit and they overturned it and then we were on our way to appeal to the Supreme Court and the young woman quit the basketball team, and her dad said, well, that&#8217;s that. So we didn&#8217;t take it any further, and it would have been moot anyway because they changed the rules and she, I think, was out of school. I don&#8217;t know that they would have heard the case. So that&#8217;s what we did. That was a long time ago. We&#8217;d only been practicing about a year when we took that case, because you do things like that when you&#8217;re young and you don&#8217;t know any better. JF: [Laughs] Let&#8217;s see. [Pause] Well let me ask, some of the organizations that I saw listed on the law firm website that you&#8217;ve been involved in-the YWCA, Planned Parenthood, the Rotary Club-can you tell me a little bit about your interest there and the work you&#8217;ve done? AM: Well, I&#8217;m not very active with the Rotary. It&#8217;s more just a membership kind of thing. I&#8217;ve been active over many, many years in Girls Club and all that sort of thing but that goes back a long time. JF: What were your expectations as [far as] being a parent for your daughter? Did you want her to go on to college, have a career? AM: Well, I expected that she would go on to college. I didn&#8217;t know what she would choose to do as far as a career. I will say that my children thought that all lawyers were women when they were little. They thought that was a female profession, but they figured it out. JF: [Laughs] That&#8217;s interesting. Did you feel that you were part of the women&#8217;s movement in the [19]70s? AM: Oh, yeah, mm hmm, yes, through law school and founding the Girls Club and being on the NOW board and all that. Yes. I at least was pretty active. I don&#8217;t know that Dorothy was so active. JF: And would you have called yourself a feminist in the &#8217;70s? AM: Oh yeah. JF: What did feminism mean to you? AM: What did it mean? JF: Mm hmm. And then I&#8217;m going to ask you if that idea&#8217;s changed. AM: Probably just to have an equality and a professional respect for women, yeah. JF: And have your ideas on feminism or equal rights changed over time? AM: No, mm mm. It certainly-the whole situation is a lot easier, and I do practice in an area of law where women practice a lot. I do mostly bankruptcy work. There are a lot of women in that field so I think we just don&#8217;t really think about gender anymore in that small area where I am. Now I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s true across the board. I hope it is but I don&#8217;t really know. JF: That&#8217;s interesting. Why do you think that bankruptcy draws a lot of women to that area? AM: I don&#8217;t know. I don't know if they think it&#8217;s less confrontational than some of the other areas of law. I really don&#8217;t know. But we do see-. JF: What do you like about it? AM: I don&#8217;t know. I mean every area of law has interest and to an outsider and to me just starting out I would have thought bankruptcy was the last thing in the world I wanted to do, it would be boring, you know. But I ended up in it and it&#8217;s very interesting, it&#8217;s intellectually challenging, so it&#8217;s perfectly okay, and you do end up feeling like you help people a lot, so it&#8217;s all right. But, you know, when you first start out you think, gosh, I could never do landlord/tenant law, I could never do trademark litigation, but probably you could. You would probably get into that and think, oh, gee, this has some real interesting aspects to it, and it would be fine, so. JF: So you have a little bit of experience coming from the North, growing up in Pittsburgh and going to your undergrad there. I wonder if you could tell me how you think of the local women&#8217;s movement in the [19]70s in eastern Tennessee fitting in with the broader women&#8217;s movement? AM: You know I&#8217;m not a good person to ask about that because Oak Ridge is a little-and particularly then-was just a little bit of the North plunked right down. We moved from Boston to Boca Raton, that was a real culture shock for us, but when we moved to Oak Ridge it was like we had kind of moved back. I think it&#8217;s not quite the same now but the people who lived here came from everywhere, foreign countries, the North, everywhere, and so I don&#8217;t think our experience would have been a whole lot different than it would have been had I been in Pittsburgh. Now as far as the university and the enrollment changing, gender based enrollment changing, I think that happened a little slower here than it did in the North, but I think it was just part of the gradual movement so that maybe in 1970 some of the law schools in New York and up north had a third of their applicants women; by 1974 we did. So I think it took a little longer to get the South moving but I don&#8217;t think Oak Ridge would fit into the pattern. JF: That&#8217;s a valuable perspective to know for future researchers if somebody&#8217;s looking to do work on Oak Ridge. AM: It&#8217;s very different. Yeah, Oak Ridge was very different than the South. JF: What do you think have been some of the most important changes in women&#8217;s lives over the past forty years? AM: Well, I think the movement in the [19]60s really was what was important and now I see a little bit of kind of backing away from that movement. Certainly the women today are not strident like they were back then, and I guess that&#8217;s okay. It worries you a little bit, that maybe some of the younger women are going to backpedal and give up what we thought we were working so hard for, but they should have choices and women aren&#8217;t going to always be the same as men so I try to have a balanced perspective as to where things are headed. I would certainly like to see a lot more women in our representative, you know, in the government. I think that&#8217;s probably the area that we have the most trouble with now, and maybe at the top of some companies, boards of banks and things. I look at all those and I see well there&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s wife down at the bottom of the list but there really isn&#8217;t a very good representation of women in some of those higher areas, so we have some place yet to achieve, but it&#8217;s a lot different. JF: And working with bankruptcy cases have you noticed any trends or patterns in terms of how economic changes, like the current recession, do they affect women more than men, differently than men? Have you noticed anything like that? AM: I think the financial situation always affects the women more, and the women probably at the lower levels. Now when you get into your business bankruptcies and so on you might have a little more male participation and dominance but in your general consumer practice, yeah, it&#8217;s more often the women. I mean there are a lot of men in bankruptcy too but, yeah, it hits women really hard. JF: And do you feel that you&#8217;ve been able to sort of do some social change work through your legal work? AM: I don&#8217;t know. We try. You know we try to provide information that we think will be helpful but we really-. We do what we do, and that&#8217;s fine and it provides relief and gives people an opportunity. What they do with it after that we don&#8217;t-. I&#8217;m not going to say that I pretend to follow up and do social work in that area, no. I&#8217;m not trained to do it; I&#8217;m not interested in doing that. JF: Do you see a relationship between your political views and your career choices? AM: Probably. I think probably most feminist liberal women would be in the Democratic party, mm hmm. JF: Are you active with the Democratic party? AM: Mm hmm. JF: What have you done, what kind of activities? AM: Well I serve on the local Democratic executive committee and I am on-. They have something called the Democratic Women&#8217;s Club. I think they&#8217;re all over the state but we have one here in Anderson County and I'm on the board of that too. JF: Okay. Are you happy with the Democratic party right now? [Laughs] AM: Yeah, I am, I am. It&#8217;s got a hard way to go right now but I think the party itself is okay, yes. I&#8217;m not terribly critical of Obama. No; I think they&#8217;re fine, need to be given time to get things done. We have a lot of work to do locally. We do not vote Democrat in Anderson County right now. JF: Do you think there&#8217;s any lessons from the [19]60s and [19]70s from the social movements, from the liberal legislation that was passed under Johnson, do you think there&#8217;s any lessons from that that could be helpful for liberals and Democrats? AM: I think there are. I think we ignore most of them and kind of forget about all those programs. A lot of what was done became kind of accepted as the norm. We&#8217;re kind of backpedaling very terribly now, even from what Republicans would have done, even what Nixon would have done, today. We&#8217;re really sliding far to the right, I think, and away from guaranteeing people even a minimum opportunity. JF: Is there anything that you can point to that helps us understand how that happened or explains that shift to the right? AM: I wish I could, because I can&#8217;t figure out why folks vote so against their own interest, but they do, and I think it&#8217;s partly a religious thing that I can&#8217;t understand so I can&#8217;t explain it. This abortion thing just gets people all bent out of shape and viewing politics in a way that isn&#8217;t very helpful to us or to them, so I don&#8217;t know what else it can be. JF: Is there a difference in the way abortion is talked about as a political issue between let&#8217;s say the early to mid [19]70s and now? AM: You mean since it&#8217;s, quote, legal? JF: Mm hmm. AM: I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know how to answer that. There are just a group of folks who are going to make that their life&#8217;s work, to restore the illegality in regard to abortion, and I don&#8217;t know even what their motivation is, I don&#8217;t know where they come from. A lot of them are men. I just don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know why that happens. So, no, I don&#8217;t have any explanations. JF: Well I guess we should probably wrap up. I don&#8217;t want to- you said about a half an hour. AM: Okay, I think so. JF: And I think we&#8217;re at a half hour now. AM: All right. JF: So I&#8217;d just like to close with just a couple of questions that I always ask. One is: Is there anything that you thought I&#8217;d ask that I didn&#8217;t ask? AM: No. JF: Okay. Is there anything you&#8217;d like to add that we didn&#8217;t talk about? AM: I don&#8217;t think so. JF: And then sort of a personal reflection question: How do you think being a feminist has affected your personal life, your relationships, your family? AM: I don&#8217;t think it hurt them any. I think it strengthened the people around me. That&#8217;s what I think, mm hmm, made them better people. [Laughs] JF: Excellent. [Laughs] And then any sort of ideas about the future, like where you see a renewed women&#8217;s movement or women&#8217;s politics? AM: I don&#8217;t see a renewed women&#8217;s movement, I sort of wish I did, but I&#8217;m not sure that I think it should be the same sort of thing. It should be like in the League of Women Voters locally, and I think everywhere, men are participating, and the goals should be shared. Men should realize that it&#8217;s good to have women in places of responsibility and it shouldn&#8217;t just be the women doing that the way it was a long time ago. JF: So more of just a liberalization and progressiveness across the board. AM: That&#8217;s what I would like to see, yeah. JF: Excellent. I agree. [Laughs] AM: Yeah. It&#8217;s not hard. JF: Well thank you very much for your time. AM: Well you&#8217;re very welcome. JF: I appreciate you talking to me...
