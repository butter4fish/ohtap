 LIZ LUNDEEN: This is Liz Lundeen. I&#8217;m here with Paula Wolf doing an interview for the Southern Oral History Program. Today&#8217;s date is August 2 [2012] and we&#8217;re here in Paula Wolf&#8217;s home in Raleigh. So I&#8217;m just going to get started by asking about your early life, your childhood, where you grew up. If you want to say anything about parents or siblings or early on that would be great. PAULA WOLF: I was born and raised in Chicago, and when I was a very little girl, my father was a cab driver. Then he became a political hack for Mayor Daley&#8212;the real one, Richard J. And I watched him lose jobs over and over again, when the right person didn&#8217;t get elected and I truly hated politics. Then I went to college, and I&#8217;m the first person in my family to graduate from college, and everything opened up to me. It was in 1971, and I was right there for the second wave of the women&#8217;s movement, just right there. LL: Wow. PW: I realized as many of us did at that point that everything is political, that the personal is political, and unfortunately my dad died before I became a lobbyist here in North Carolina. He would&#8217;ve gotten a pretty good smile out of that one. LL: Yeah. Can I ask&#8212; You grew up in Chicago. What part of the city are you [from]? PW: We were on the north side of the city. We had to live in the city. There was a city ordinance&#8212;it might still be there&#8212;that if you worked in the city, you had to live there. And the north side was where all the Jews were, and so that&#8217;s where we were. LL: Can I ask you about your mom in terms of when you were growing up. Your dad was involved in politics. What did your mom do? PW: My mom was legally blind when she had me. And she did not work outside the home, but she was the busiest person I've ever seen. She helped found the Jewish home for the Blind in Chicago. On Saturdays she would go, and she would say she was going to help the blind people. And also we never had a lot of money, but she was always concerned with the poor people. And so I watched her live out sort of Talmudic requirements of tzedakah and serving other people. And I guess I got that [from] her. She was amazing. If you were a fly on the wall in the kitchen, you would never know she was blind. She cooked; she made all the holiday meals. All the family came to our house. And she was always raising money for some cause&#8212;Hebrew Immigration and Aid Society, the Sisterhood, the B&#8217;nai Brith, you name it. And the blind home. LL: So did religion, did Judaism play a pretty big role in your life growing up? PW: Well, interestingly enough, no, not the religious part. My parents were first generation Americans. So when their parents died out, so went the orthodoxy, the kosher, the temple memberships and all that stuff. They gave me a choice because I was a girl. If I were a boy, I wouldn&#8217;t have had a choice to go to Hebrew school or not, and I said no. So it wasn&#8217;t a religious thing, but it was a definitely a cultural thing and a gastronomical thing. LL: Right. So were you an only child then? PW: I have a brother, a half-brother who&#8217;s twenty years older than I am. He was married and out of the house before I was born, and his children, his son, my nephew was five months younger than I was, and my niece is two years younger. And then I have a sister who is thirteen and a half years older. She and I both came from the same mom and dad. She left when I was nine to get married. So in a sense I was an only child. LL: So what would you say, you mentioned briefly the choice to go to Hebrew school was yours. But what other expectations do you think your parents have for you as a female child? PW: My father said, &#8220;You should marry a lawyer.&#8221; I will never forget that. If he had said, &#8220;Be a lawyer,&#8221; I might just have been. But he said marry a lawyer, and they had no expectations for me beyond high school. I had to beg to go to college. And they didn&#8217;t understand why I wanted to go. My father was still connected at that time, so he got me a legislative scholarship, which is still the subject of much scandal in Illinois. But at the time you just got it, and I went to a state university in town, lived at home, for ten dollars a trimester. LL: Oh my goodness. PW: Yeah, it was amazing. And then I worked at the university, and the dean of arts and sciences at the time after I graduated, he asked me to come back, and we developed a business and management major. He had a man who was a very successful businessperson but really didn&#8217;t know the university community very well. I knew the inside and out of that, of Northeastern Illinois University. So together we built this business and management program, and while I was there, I got a master&#8217;s degree for free because I was an employee. And then I was recruited to a PhD program at the University of Chicago for the sociology of higher education, and I thought I was going to be a dean or vice president. I had a baby instead and I&#8217;m ABD [All But Dissertation]. I have passed everything just did not write a dissertation and really thought that that was going to be an albatross over my head for the rest of my life and on my tombstone and everything. But as you probably well know, unless you are working in the university, you don&#8217;t need [the PhD] necessarily. One day when one of my bosses here at the State Employee&#8217;s Association called me into his office and basically told me to dumb down, I never discussed my educational attainment again. LL: Wow. I want to definitely come back to some of that, but for a moment if we can flash back to when you went to high school. This was the [19]60s, right? It was the [time] of tumultuous social and political changes. PW: Right. I remember a day that we all walked out of our high school, through the windows, through the doors. It was a big, it wasn&#8217;t a boycott. I can&#8217;t remember what they called it, but we all left. And at that time I was not political. I hated high school. I was not intellectually born until I got to college. And so I didn&#8217;t know what we were doing, but we had gotten out of school so that was very good for me. My class was the first class&#8212; We were able to wear pants to school. When I think back on that, and in the winter in Chicago to have to wear a skirt, I was freezing. I hated the weather there. LL: Do you remember feeling any sense of injustice about all that or is it something that you only looked at or saw when you looked back upon it? PW: I just thought that&#8217;s the way it was. But once I got to college then I saw the sexism and discrimination everywhere. When my father died, well, before my father died, I told my mom, &#8220;You need to get a credit card, one of these credit cards in your name.&#8221; They all said Julius Wolf, my father&#8217;s name. And she said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly I've been shopping at Marshall Fields for forty years. It&#8217;s no big deal.&#8221; And of course she was stunned when he did die and she could not get credit in her own name. LL: Wow and that would&#8217;ve been what year? PW: 1983. LL: Wow. PW: It seems like it wasn&#8217;t that long ago, but it was. And I&#8217;ll tell you a good story. I have a stepdaughter and she never lived with us, but we would get her on vacations and stuff to come. I wanted to set up&#8212; We wanted to set up something where we would give her a savings bond every month towards college. I remember walking into the bank and filling out the form and the form said, for the person who is going to get the bond, Mister, Mrs. or Miss. I looked at the teller and I said, &#8220;Where is the box for Ms?&#8221; He laughed and said, &#8220;There is none.&#8221; I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re just talking about a nine-year-old girl here.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a Miss.&#8221; So I was livid, and I filled out the form, and then I wrote to the U.S. Treasury Department and they fixed it. That was in the Chicago Tribune. LL: And that was the [19]80s or late&#8212; PW: That was early, late [19]70s. LL: Late [19]70s, okay. Wow, that&#8217;s fascinating. Well, maybe I&#8217;ll have to look that article up. So just real quick, you went to college in 1971? PW: Mm-hmm. LL: So do you have recollections of the [19]68 [Democratic National] Convention at all in Chicago? PW: I remember that, I was on the last part of the baby boomers so I was at this in between age. I think I was fifteen, and there was no way my parents, my father was going to let me out of the house. I watched this and I really, I didn&#8217;t really understand the depth of what was going on, and yet, it was happening a half an hour from my house. It was a little freaky. I remember going to that same place, Grant Park, for a concert. Sly and the Family Stone were supposed to come for a free concert, and I went with my boyfriend. They didn&#8217;t show up, and a lot of people were a little angry about that. The next thing I knew I&#8217;m covering my face from teargas because that was just the way it was. We ran away and I never told my father. He would&#8217;ve&#8212; LL: Was it just because&#8212; the police [were there] because there was a huge crowd of people? Wow. PW: Mm-hmm. Looking back on it, it was really a war. It was about young versus old; it was about rich versus poor, a lot of things that of course are still happening now. It was about kids and the war. It was a fascinating time. LL: Yeah. So let&#8217;s talk about when you went to Northeastern Illinois and you said you had your political awakening there. Was it with a particular cause? Was it with feminism or was it with the anti-war movement or&#8212; PW: It was with feminism. It definitely was with feminism. I&#8217;m a sociology, interdisciplinary social scientist, women&#8217;s studies [major]. So my first course, I went to see the professor ahead of time. It was Introduction to Psychology, and I get to his office and he&#8217;s wearing a&#8212;he has long hair. He&#8217;s wearing jeans and a t-shirt and sandals. This man is still a friend of mine. He was the best man at our wedding. But I freaked out. Who is, where am I? Because I was a pretty sheltered little girl. And then my Introduction to Sociology [course]; it said the professor was Mary Ann Schwartz. I thought, Mary Ann and Schwartz. It didn&#8217;t match. When she walked in the room, she was from Wisconsin and she was clearly not a Schwartz. And after class I said, &#8220;Okay, how did you get the name Schwartz?&#8221; It was an Ellis Island thing. Her folks were from Czechoslovakia, and they couldn&#8217;t spell it or say it. So we also are lifelong friends; we published an article together, and she just made an incredible impact on me. Mary Ann was one of the movers and shakers in the faculty union. So I watched her negotiate, and I watched her be so articulate, and I had someone to look up to. I mean, my parents were not formally educated. No one in my family was. My friends who I grew up with, their dads were doctors and lawyers and business owners, and it wasn&#8217;t a matter of if they went to college. It was a matter of where they were going because they had a trust fund. I had none of that. We were staunch working class people. So here was this woman who was so brilliant and so articulate, and I just looked up to her tremendously. LL: So she was, was she one of the founders of women&#8217;s studies or&#8212; PW: Yes, she was, they mostly came out of the sociology department. There were a lot of women there, and then we fought for a women&#8217;s studies department, and there was also a women&#8217;s services. And this was the great struggle between academic feminists versus women who really did the work out in the community and on the ground. They often could not talk to each other. It was rough. I, at one point at Northeastern, was the chair of both of those boards. And I was fit and determined to get everybody to work together. LL: Can you say a little bit more about the divide? The other department was called women&#8217;s services? PW: Mm-hmm. LL: So which faction did that represent? PW: That was the rape crisis center counseling and the returning women and things that were really service providers, and they of course thought the academics had their head in the ivory tower, which they did a lot. As an academic, a lapsed academic, I can criticize, and I've seen that over the years in my political work here, these academics who teach public policy and sociology and politics, they have no idea what really goes on, and they don&#8217;t talk to the people who are actually working. LL: So was this department&#8212;the women&#8217;s services department&#8212;I mean was that, could you get a degree in that? PW: No, no, no. LL: Or it was just like a center? PW: That was on the student services side. LL: Right. Okay. I see. So they were working the rape crisis center. They were sort of doing the direct services, so to speak. PW: So there was this struggle between academic feminists and service providers. There was also a huge struggle between lesbian women and straight women. I identified myself for years as a political lesbian. For years I didn&#8217;t wear my wedding band because it gave me heterosexual privilege. And I&#8217;ll never forget this women philosophy professor. She was very radical, and she once said to me, &#8220;I can&#8217;t trust you&#8221;&#8212;this was in a big group of women, straight and gay&#8212;&#8220;I can&#8217;t trust you because ultimately you will protect a man when it comes down to it.&#8221; And there is nothing to say to that. There is a lot of mistrust. As you may know, the whole rape crisis movement was started by lesbian women, so too the domestic violence prevention. So they always thought they were the real feminists, and it was an interesting struggle to be right in the middle of. I'd like to think that I bridged some of that. LL: Yeah, I was going to say&#8212;how did you, you said you were on the board for each so how did you reconcile that? You had this mentor who was very much on the academic side, I&#8217;m guessing, yet you were talking to people and working with people who were very much in the direct action. PW: But so was she. LL: Okay. So it was a false divide for many. PW: It was. That&#8217;s a perfect way to put it. These professors were activists. They were blazing the trail, making the ground move. They had no idea that they weren&#8217;t real feminists. This frustrated me. A couple of things that distinguished me in the academics is that I don&#8217;t, I never bought the silos. Everything is related to each other, and I've seen that. That&#8217;s the way I learned, and that&#8217;s the way I taught. And I also couldn&#8217;t abide this fight. So I had both boards meeting together. LL: Wow. This was when you were still a student? PW: Yeah. LL: So did that, was there any sort of&#8212; PW: I was a student, and then I was an administrator there. But it was still hard. When you go to school at the place that then you become a professional, some people never do let you grow up. LL: Mm-hmm. So I had another question about&#8212;the women&#8217;s studies program I gather was just taking off when you got there, right? I was part of a women&#8217;s studies department in the early 2000s. So what we were studying was probably what you were actually experiencing in addition to studying. So I&#8217;m just curious as to what the curriculum was like. What did you read? What did you study? PW: Well, I have many of the books on my shelf. Sisterhood is Powerful; there was a groundbreaking book about domestic violence. A lot of it was literature&#8212;essays and not necessarily research yet. But we were trying desperately to be focused on real research. Many of my colleagues wrote books, many of my professors, and I have them on my shelf as well. I have a feminist section. They&#8217;re classics now, but these were the books. They were in paperback. We were reading what was just written. And I also had the amazing opportunity to be one of the founding mothers of the National Women&#8217;s Studies Association, and I still have my pin and my t-shirt and a program, I believe. But we went to Storrs, Connecticut, the University of Connecticut, and there I watched women who knew what Robert&#8217;s Rules [of Order] were all about and utilized them and I just, I was overwhelmed. From then on I used to sleep with Robert&#8217;s Rules so I would learn them. I was so amazed and impressed, and they started this organization from nothing. And now it&#8217;s quite well regarded. LL: Absolutely. PW: There was something called the Feminist Press and I&#8217;m losing the name of the&#8212;Howe, H-O-W-E, I can&#8217;t think of her first name. Florence Howe, she was the first founder and she had jet-black hair but with a white streak here, so you could see her from miles and miles away. We all thought she did that on purpose. They were the real stars of the movement. Then there were the kids, and we were just soaking it up. LL: Right. Wow. PW: Then there was another thread, and that was black nationalists. LL: I was going to ask about. PW: At one time there was a woman who chaired the sociology department, and she had no use for white people. None. And so you understand. I understand that women had to get their space, and it appeared to so many people that we were man haters and that black people did the same thing. We had to all go through those stages and learn from them and then figure out that we&#8217;re going to have to work together or else the planet&#8217;s going to just disappear. LL: Yeah. Can you say a little bit more about&#8212; In terms of the women&#8217;s movement that you were a part of in college, did you feel as though it was racially, ethnically diverse? Did you feel as though it was inclusive on the basis of class, sexuality? You alluded to some of the tensions with lesbians and then just now to black nationalists. I&#8217;m curious, would you put a sort of positive spin on it, that you were able to build coalitions? Or did you think that there were some rifts that you thought couldn&#8217;t be reconciled? PW: There were rifts that couldn&#8217;t be reconciled. National Organization for Women of course, one of my lobbying clients, we distinguished ourselves by taking a stand that we were going to have the backs of lesbian women. That made a lot of women very nervous; [they] didn&#8217;t join. Feminist became a bad word. Phyllis Schlafly, of course, was from Illinois and all that. There weren&#8217;t very many black women because black women were and still are caught up in this dual struggle, and nobody needs to know that they&#8217;re a feminist, but everybody knows they&#8217;re black right away. And so it&#8217;s hard. There&#8217;s a woman here who I admire very much. She&#8217;s African American; she&#8217;s a feminist; and she&#8217;s gay. That&#8217;s something to have to deal with, I think. Her loyalties are pulled in so many different directions every single day. So I think we did the sexual preference thing pretty well. We did not do race very well, and we did not do class very well. But none of us do class very well even now. Because the poor people and the working people who we need to be represented don&#8217;t represent themselves because they&#8217;re busy working, and that&#8217;s the way it was then. Interestingly enough if you look at the founding mothers of the women&#8217;s movement, Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, there&#8217;s more. They&#8217;re all Jewish, and yet the anti-Semitism in the women&#8217;s movement was rife. It was fascinating to me. LL: Is there a particular moment that you care to talk about in terms of the anti-Semitism? PW: Just in terms of the schedule and having things on Jewish holidays and things like that. And then, that&#8217;s who started the movement, that&#8217;s it. LL: The irony. Yeah. PW: And yet there seemed to be more tolerance for other differences. LL: I imagine there are many, many goals of the movement when you got into it. But was there a particular cause that you identified with? I&#8217;m thinking rape crisis center, for instance, domestic violence, reproductive choice? Was there something that really resonated with you in particular? PW: Reproductive choice was my real issue. I said then and I say now that unless and until women can control whether or if they become pregnant, we don&#8217;t have to talk about equal pay for equal work. They&#8217;re never going to get into the workforce. We don&#8217;t have to talk about anything else. That to me is the whole basis for our freedom and equality. We have the babies. That&#8217;s the way it is. Unless that&#8217;s really looked at and dealt with, we&#8217;re never going to be equal. At that time there were different kinds of feminists. Someone who believed that reproductive rights was at the bottom of everything like I did, we were radical feminists. Then there were the lesbian feminists. And then there were the academic feminists. So it was&#8212; LL: Socialist feminism in Chicago, too, was pretty strong. PW: So it was interesting. I mean, we always had our ways to differentiate each other. That was it for me. That was it for me. I didn&#8217;t really know about any of the other things. Again I was very, I'd say, cloistered. I was pretty overprotected. When I went to the University of Chicago the first time, I thought my father was going to hire a bodyguard for me because that was the Southside of Chicago. It was a world away from anything he knew. And of course the campus is surrounded by what they used to call the DMZ [demilitarized zone]. It&#8217;s not a great neighborhood. Obviously it&#8217;s a world-class school and I was excited. But it was a real sociology lesson because during the day I worked at Northeastern Illinois University, which had mostly minorities and first generation college students, working class. Then I'd go to the University of Chicago in Hyde Park, and one of my economics professors said to me one time&#8212;well, it&#8217;s on a paper and I still have this paper&#8212;it says, &#8220;You are so bright. It&#8217;s really too bad you have such narrow interests.&#8221; Those interests of course were women. That was a paper I wrote, and I wrote it about the women&#8217;s studies program, which was evolving as we spoke, and I thought it was pretty interesting. LL: Wow. PW: But I was too narrow. LL: So there was a big difference between Northeastern and University of Chicago then. PW: Very big, not only the faculty but the students. It was a huge class difference. Most of the kids I went to school with like me were working their way through college, even then. Everybody at [University of] Chicago of course was residential. It was a different world. LL: Well, I want to ask just one more question on your undergrad days because I think some of these early publications that you co-wrote with the professors or the mentors of yours, that was when you were still an undergraduate. So can you talk about that? The titles were just fascinating to me. For the tape I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Academic Feminists versus Feminist Academics: toward a redefinition of feminist education.&#8221; Singlehood and the American Experience: the historical and sociological perspectives of the never married.&#8221; Do you care to say something about&#8212; PW: Mary Ann was sort of a marriage and family sociologist. That was her big focus. I don&#8217;t know how it came up, but I got interested in it too and so my master&#8217;s thesis was about singlehood in the United States from colonial times to, I think I went to the [19]50s maybe. And all of that, &#8220;You&#8217;re not really a grownup until you&#8217;re married, and then you&#8217;re not really a grownup until you have a child.&#8221; But single people and never married people in colonial times were thought of as witches, and something was wrong with them. A woman couldn&#8217;t live by herself, but even a man was suspect. And then I looked at non-traditional resources. I spent a lot of time in the Newberry Library if you know that. It&#8217;s a&#8212; LL: Yeah, beautiful. PW: It&#8217;s a marvelous place. And I looked at magazines of the time and Harper&#8217;s Bazaar and things like that, and from the [19]teens and [19]20s and 30s. You just look at the advertising, you learned almost everything you need to know about a society. And it was really a burden to be single. So when I was going to get married&#8212; LL: I was just going to ask how this affected your own personal views. PW: Well, my husband and I lived together for three and a half years before we got married. And I was convinced that we didn&#8217;t really need to be married. We had a commitment to each other, and that piece of paper was absolutely unnecessary. But I did have a mom and dad who wanted us to get married. So when we got married, I took Mary Ann out for coffee or something and I said, &#8220;I have to tell you something.&#8221; And so we laughed about that. Now she at that point was like a forty-year old person who had never been married. She had a honey in another department in the university. They were always together, but they lived separately, and so while we were laughing about that she said, &#8220;Dick and I are going to get married.&#8221; LL: I was going to ask if they were marriage protestors or they just&#8212;? PW: It was just about making a statement that we didn&#8217;t have to do that. And of course I didn&#8217;t change my name in 1977. My mother couldn&#8217;t understand that. My mother-in-law who just died last year to this day would address envelopes to Mr. and Mrs. Lary L. Dial. LL: Wow. PW: And I've never had her name. So I mean they just couldn&#8217;t understand. And I still get, that was the other thing too, I would get the bank statement from our checking account, and only Lary&#8217;s name was on the checking account. I said, &#8220;Why is that? It&#8217;s a dual account, a joint account.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Well, if your name is first then your name will be on all of the records.&#8221; And not only on your statement, but if somebody&#8217;s calling up for a credit report, I didn&#8217;t exist. So of course I got pretty mad at that, too. And at that point we switched it. LL: So you were first. PW: I was the first name. Of course since then we abandoned joint checking accounts. That did not work for us. Just didn&#8217;t work for us. But all these things that I think young women take for granted, even the ability to have an abortion and get birth control. And yesterday in Congress they were debating a bill that would get rid of it all. You only could have an abortion on the most extreme circumstances, and these are, I just watch all these white old men who are deciding what&#8217;s what. I think they&#8217;re frightened because already they&#8217;re not the majority, and more and more they&#8217;re going to lose their power, and so that&#8217;s where the&#8212;. I think bigotry comes from fear. One of my clients for years was El Pueblo, and the anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions around here are frightening. LL: Can I ask what your husband thought of your feminist politics when you met and you were living together? PW: Well, he was an academic as well. He was professor of Asian History, Asian studies, but he&#8217;s ten years older than I was. He wasn&#8217;t hostile certainly. I couldn&#8217;t have been with someone who was. He had a lot to learn and he did. I would say that he was one of the feminist-thinking men around. And he&#8217;ll tell you that today that I helped him see all that. It&#8217;s a struggle; it&#8217;s a process. But I had my name, and that didn&#8217;t bother him ever. You hear about that a lot. Sometimes the man will come after ten years of marriage or something and say, &#8220;Take my name.&#8221; He&#8217;s never done that. In fact when we were thinking about having a child, he said out of the blue, &#8220;You know if we have a boy, we would give him the Dial last name. If we have a girl, her last name should be Wolf.&#8221; And we had a girl and her last name was Wolf. LL: Wow. PW: That was cutting edge, I thought. I thought we were going to hyphenate or something. LL: So what about having a child in terms of your politics of reproductive choice and everything. Was motherhood, was that an easy transition? PW: Well, I always knew I wanted one child to have the experience. I thought that I would go into the rice paddies, squat, have my baby and go back to work the next day. And she was about three minutes in my arms and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going back to work.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t wanna. I just didn&#8217;t want to leave her, and I knew I was only going to have one. I thought, &#8220;Why would I want someone else to raise her? I want to be there for all of this learning and discovery.&#8221; And so we were absolutely so poor. We were so poor, but I stayed home until she was about two and a half and could go to preschool. I needed to, then I got a part-time job, which was the perfect balance for me. You just can&#8217;t be with a two-year-old twenty-four/seven. You have to have adult conversation. Now my daughter is struggling with the same thing. Whenever you&#8217;re at work, you wish you were at home and vice versa. There&#8217;s something you think you&#8217;re not getting done when you&#8217;re home. I think that that struggle is good for children to see, especially girl children. So that&#8217;s what we did. And how my daughter rebelled against me the most. She used to tell me she was a Republican. She&#8217;s not. But then she used to tell me she wasn&#8217;t a feminist. And now she has this little girl who is fifteen months old, and I&#8217;m just watching it and she is such a feminist. LL: So was it something she would do to kind of rankle you? PW: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But you know when you&#8217;re in your twenties, you know everything. LL: Oh yeah. Absolutely. PW: Thankfully she&#8217;s in her thirties now. I did, I knew everything in my twenties. I&#8217;m amazed when I look back at how much I did not know. But it&#8217;s all coming around. She&#8217;s not a partisan and she teaches politics. But she cares about people, and she cares about humanity, and she wants fairness for her daughter and everybody else&#8217;s. So she&#8217;s a feminist. LL: So you went to California in the early [19]80s? Is that right? PW: Mm-hmm. She was born in 1981 in August, and by November we decided that we had, we had no family there. So we picked up and moved to Southern California, which is where my husband&#8217;s parents were, his two brothers, all the family. So we went there. We had lived in Madison, Wisconsin. We were only there for a year, but when we moved from Chicago to Madison, that was the first time I ever lived anywhere but Chicago. That move, having to learn a new culture, where the grocery store was, get a new driver license, that was very difficult for me. But then I had the skills, and I just generalized them to California. So the first thing I did was find my communities. We joined a temple, and I joined the rape crisis service because I had done that in Madison. In Madison you could take shifts, and they would, you could be home, and they would forward the calls to your home. I would take it when Rebecka was napping. I went to Southern California and I was already seasoned. I got together with the most amazing women, and I&#8217;m still friends with a lot of them. The San Fernando Valley Rape Crisis Center was so pure that we wouldn&#8217;t take money from any local municipal government, nothing. It was great because we could decide what we wanted to do. If a man called in those days, we had the name of a psychologist, a man, who dealt with either men who were rape victims or men who were trying to deal with their significant other having been raped. But we wouldn&#8217;t touch them. I was not talking to a man because a lot of times they were just crank calls. On the other hand for a woman we believed everything she said. Whatever she said we were going to believe her. We were going to start from that point and we were going to validate her feelings because whatever you feel is normal after something like that. And so I did that for many years. LL: Was it hotline and did you have a center as well where people would come? PW: No, there&#8217;s never a physical space. It was hotline, and you could accompany a woman to court and the hospital. It was a great experience. LL: What was your sense of the difference between Madison and San Fernando Valley; would you say the organizations were very similar? PW: Yeah, they were. We were pretty radical in Madison. And so when I found San Fernando Valley, those were my women. LL: Yeah, yeah. PW: I was very comfortable there. Of course I remember doing my training with Becka nursing, and one of the women who was my trainer sang at my daughter&#8217;s Bat Mitzvah. I mean we&#8217;re still good friends. It&#8217;s something; it's really something. You forge a bond. But that&#8217;s sort of who I am. Once you&#8217;re mine, I hang onto you unless you do something to me that will make me not trust you. So I have friends who are thirty, forty years. LL: Wow. You mentioned the moving was a big ordeal from Chicago but then [it was] a little bit easier to go to California. How did you go about finding the women&#8217;s organizations and finding the communities? I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s being studied right now and through oral history. How do you find the women&#8217;s movement in those days? PW: In those days the best sociological mirror to any community was the yellow pages. So every time I would go to a hotel, Mary Ann taught me, I would look in the yellow pages and see if there was&#8212;under women&#8212;women&#8217;s center. To see if there were Jews there, you&#8217;d look under synagogues. So it was much easier. Now you can go on the internet, but I went to the yellow pages and that&#8217;s where I found&#8212; LL: And in terms of the women&#8217;s organizations, were you a member of NOW, Planned Parenthood those kind of places? PW: NOW. I didn&#8217;t really get involved with Planned Parenthood until I started lobbying for them here. But what a marvelous organization. LL: What would you say was the organizational outlet for your reproductive choice advocacy? Was that on campus, primarily? PW: It was NOW. It was NOW. And campus but, yeah. I think it was NOW. LL: So let&#8217;s see. I have some other questions about California, I think. This would&#8217;ve been the early [19]80s when you were in California. What were your perceptions of the rise of the New Right, of Phyllis Schlafly, of the Eagle Forum&#8212;the opposition, the anti-choice folks? PW: Well, remember that she is from Illinois, downstate Illinois, a small town. So I was aware of her and fighting her long before&#8212; LL: Long before. PW: And the biggest irony, of course&#8212;she wanted women in the home with their children. She had four kids and was always on the road. She was never home. Nobody said boo about that. But I don&#8217;t know why she had so much power and influence; she was like the NRA now. When I got here, I met the feminists here who worked on the ERA, and I remember, then there&#8217;s a book about that whole experience. In that book there was something about a legislator who was the final [vote], he was the reason ERA failed here. And he was from Granville County. He told them that he was a yes. But then when he got on the floor, he voted no. So he was just bad news. He left the General Assembly for a long time but then he came back in [19]93 when I started lobbying. So he was there. Once I got to be good friends with him I said to him one day, &#8220;I have a thirty year bone to pick with you.&#8221; And I told him and he said, well, first of all he denied that he ever said that he would vote for it. But what he said fascinated me. He looked at me and said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want my daughters going into the military.&#8221; This is the Joseph Goebbels school of marketing. If you say a lie enough, people believe it. LL: People start to believe it. PW: That was her. Unisex bathrooms, and women are going to go into the military. Well hello. They are in the military. And they&#8217;re in combat and what do they get for it? All the sexual assaults and they&#8217;re not taken seriously. LL: Wow. What an experience. Were there changes that you saw between the [19]70s and the [19]80s in terms of how the feminist movement, how activism took place, keeping in mind the rise of the opposition? PW: Yes. And in some ways we didn&#8217;t know it was happening. The right very tactically and very systematically had their plan. They had their thirty-year plan. Okay, you&#8217;re going to get Roe v Wade. We&#8217;re going to disembowel it, little by little, at the state level. And we&#8217;re going to make sure that our people get on the school boards because we want to put Jesus back in the classroom, and prayer. And we don&#8217;t want to teach evolution, any of that kind of stuff. Then we will put them on county commissions and state legislatures and the judiciary, and they&#8217;ve done that. They&#8217;ve done a great job at that. And I think we were all asleep at the wheel. LL: Yeah, if only we could&#8217;ve seen that coming. PW: Yeah, not only would we have done a better job of protecting our gains, but we would&#8217;ve seen them for what they are and what they&#8217;re doing. LL: Yeah. Well, so when you arrived&#8212; Tell me about the move from California to North Carolina. PW: Well, the one thing I did like about Southern California was the weather. In December I was wearing cut offs and a t-shirt and looking at the weather forecast in Chicago below zero. But that only lasted a couple of years. I didn&#8217;t care for LA [Los Angeles] at all. This is a generalization, but the people there, well, they don&#8217;t share my values, most of the people. They work in the show business, and they tell you how much money they make. I never knew how much money my father made. I still don&#8217;t. That Midwestern sensibility. But the reason they tell you is they&#8217;re on union scale and people understand that. Well, I don&#8217;t understand that. I was offended by that. And then big actors when they&#8217;re not working go on unemployment. LL: Yeah, wow. PW: And the newspaper was just filled with how to get skinny, how to get beautiful every single day because people made their living on their looks. I just thought that was too superficial for me. I want to be healthy, but I just couldn&#8217;t stand it there. And it was so crowded, and it was so filthy. LL: And this was when you were raising your daughter as well. PW: Yeah. LL: She&#8217;s young. PW: So we came here when she was seven. The way we got here was pretty interesting. My husband at that time was a working chef. He had had restaurants in Chicago and Madison and&#8212;. In Beverly Hills however, the owners of these restaurants would snort his salary as opposed to giving it to him. So we had a tough time there. Or else they would&#8212; Everybody wants to own a restaurant. They think it&#8217;s very romantic. It&#8217;s a very tough business. But he would help them design the kitchen and start the menu, and then they&#8217;d fire him and get someone in who was cheaper. So the Golden Corral Corporation here contacted him&#8212;I didn&#8217;t know anything about this. They wanted him to be their corporate food and beverage director. So it was going to be a big, corporate job. We thought the checks wouldn&#8217;t bounce and all that. But North Carolina, the only connection I had was that I watched the Andy Griffith growing up. The South for me was not a good place. So I looked it up in the encyclopedia. It said, now granted it was an old edition, it said that there were 4,000 Jews in the whole state. At the time we were living right off Ventura Boulevard in the Valley. And I said, &#8220;Lary, there are 4,000 Jews in ten miles each way.&#8221; I was scared to death. Plus, I&#8217;m used to a city and not rural at all. This is suburban, but we didn&#8217;t even live in the suburbs. The first night here sleeping, I couldn&#8217;t sleep. It was so quiet, and my bedroom, my childhood bedroom was a busy street that had a bus, and the ambulances were going back and forth. It was just such a different experience for me here. It&#8217;s taken a long time, and I&#8217;m really glad Rebecca grew up here, and I&#8217;m glad that we were here, that we&#8217;re here. LL: So you moved to Raleigh first. Right, you moved here. PW: Yeah. We moved here when she was seven, and we moved into this house and we&#8217;ve never left. But a lot of the cultural shock for me&#8212; If I went to the grocery store one more time and someone would ask her, &#8220;What&#8217;s Santa bringing you for Christmas,&#8221; because religion was so public. People pray here before a meeting. I&#8217;m just here for a meeting. LL: Or at the restaurant. PW: Yeah. And so that was hard for me. But now I know the culture a lot, lot better. I've run statewide campaigns and I know all the regional sociological differences. And so I understand it a little more. LL: I know you were working part-time when your daughter was young and then before leaving California and coming here. What was your career path? PW: Well, the part-time job I took, I told my boss that I only&#8212;he said you&#8217;re so overqualified blah, blah. I said, &#8220;No you don&#8217;t understand, my daughter is the first priority. So I want to come here, leave at three and not think about you.&#8221; By the time we were moving I was the associate executive director or something like that. I was the number two person running the whole company. It was called the College Success Seminar. It wasn&#8217;t an SAT prep course; it was a course that would get you successful in the freshman year because so many kids flunk out. Because they&#8217;re suddenly on their own and they don&#8217;t know how to manage their time or anything. So this was very unique and interesting, and universities around the country would sponsor it. So we were at UC Berkeley, and we were at the University of Illinois and we were University of Maryland, I think. Anyway I was running it from California, and almost none of our classes were in California. So my boss said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just take it with you?&#8221; Now at that point fax machines were a great new invention. And we did it. When we first moved here I remember that David and I were on the phone, and he was going to send me a document on a computer. I felt like Alexander Graham Bell. I mean you had to get the phone and some thing and it worked. It was Apple. All the computers were only Apple then. I thought I was amazing, just amazing. So that worked for a while. The business went under because nobody knew that they needed this course. And if you have some money to spend, you&#8217;re going to spend it on getting a better score on your SAT. So I didn&#8217;t work for a while and then I saw this ad in the [Raleigh] News and Observer when they were still putting job ads in the News and Observer and it said personnel assistant/legislative assistant, or legislative coordinator, something like that. It was for the State Employees Association of North Carolina, and it sounded really interesting. So I went there, and I said, &#8220;I've never stepped foot in the legislature. I don&#8217;t know anything about it. But I have these political chops and I&#8217;m smart and I will learn.&#8221; And the executive director at the time, he liked me, and I had just the most amazing opportunity. He was the lead lobbyist, and then there was a woman who was director of government relations. I was under her. So I literally walked around with them, met everyone, learned the ropes and I wasn&#8217;t in charge. It was perfect. LL: Wow. You mentioned the changes, the day-to-day changes moving to the South and your anxiety about moving to the South. What did that mean in terms of women&#8217;s activism? Did you find women&#8217;s organizations when you came here? PW: Not immediately. LL: Not immediately. PW: When we first moved here, I didn&#8217;t know anything about the magnet schools, and so we enrolled Rebecca in Ravenscroft, which is just down the street. When we went to look at Ravenscroft, she was going to be in the second grade, and then we went across the street to the public school and looked at that. Well, there was just no [comparison], and being at Ravenscroft&#8212;it was new, it was bright, it was loving, small classes. We were fortunate that we could afford it . She went there for three years. She had some really good experiences, but mostly at that time, they thought&#8212;she&#8217;s extremely bright&#8212;and what they thought was enrichment was more homework, which made her feel like she was being punished for being smart. Or there were two boys and Rebecca who they would take out of class and put in the center and let them read because they didn&#8217;t know what to do with them. So luckily I found out about the magnets, and we transferred her and she went to Hunter, Ligon and Enloe, which are the cream of the crop public schools here. But that was tough and Ravenscroft, they&#8217;re not a religious school, but they&#8217;re based in religion and the math homework [at] Christmas was little Santa Clauses. Little things would just be so offensive because the assumption is that everyone is Christian. That&#8217;s changed a lot here. And I remember complaining about things, and well [they said], &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come in and bring something about Hanukkah?&#8221; LL: Right. PW: I said, &#8220;No, see that&#8217;s the point.&#8221; LL: That&#8217;s not the point. PW: I don&#8217;t want religion in the school. Anyway. It was a struggle a lot of times. They had chapel there and they said, &#8220;Well Rebecca doesn&#8217;t have to go to chapel.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay. Why don&#8217;t we just sew a yellow Jewish star on her and she can be that much more separate from the group?&#8221; I mean they just didn&#8217;t know what to do. They just didn&#8217;t. Now they have a lot of Jewish students too over there. And I think it&#8217;s a lovely place, but it wasn&#8217;t right for us. So she had a wonderful public school education here, and now she&#8217;s a teacher. LL: So I know that you got involved with Lillian&#8217;s List after you&#8217;d been here a while. So how did you eventually find women&#8217;s organizations, or which one did you get involved in? When did that start for you in Raleigh? PW: Well, I&#8217;m thinking about all the things I've said, and it sounds like I&#8217;m such a super-Jew and I&#8217;m not. LL: No, no, no. PW: But this one is another story. Since I had done rape crisis for so long in two different states, I looked up Interact; I mean I found out it was called Interact, and I went there. This is many years ago. I don&#8217;t even remember her name, the woman who was executive director. I told her, &#8220;You know what. I&#8217;m ready to be on the board. I don&#8217;t want to do the&#8212;&#8221; LL: You&#8217;ve done the hotline; you&#8217;ve&#8212; PW: Yeah. So we&#8217;re talking just like this, she&#8217;s behind her desk. She said, &#8220;Well, you should look at the members of our board and see who the Jews are and you&#8212; LL: Wow. PW: As soon as she said that I grabbed my purse and I said, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; So from there I went to Planned Parenthood. Pam Kohl was then the executive director, and I was on her board, and I learned a lot. In fact that was one of the things I got involved in right away as a board member, something called the Lifesavers Coalition. And it was a group of women who were lobbying to make mammograms and pap smears freely available. It took years. Blue Cross just fought tooth and nail against that. Fifty-dollar mammogram versus fifty thousand dollars for breast cancer and the patient dies. LL: Yeah, no brainer. PW: But that wasn&#8217;t the point. The point was the word &#8220;mandate.&#8221; Well, we finally won, but during that time I got to go to the General Assembly and look around, and I met feminist women. There was at that time a group called NC Equity, which was a statewide policy nonprofit that focused on women. When that went away, we have a big void in this state. LL: And how did it collapse? PW: Someone took over as executive director, and I don&#8217;t think she was up for the challenge, and so the grant money shriveled up. Yeah. So I met all these women, and then turns out that the really politically active women also worked for Jim Hunt at some point in his first or second term. And so then I got to know people. And it is pretty remarkable that this little Jewish girl from Chicago goes to the General Assembly, and I&#8217;m very respectful. If you would&#8217;ve told me that I would let some old man call me hon or put his arm around me twenty years ago, I would&#8217;ve said you&#8217;re nuts. But again it&#8217;s learning the sociology. And when they call you, &#8220;Oh you&#8217;re a good girl.&#8221; That&#8217;s a compliment and I know it. But I have a button that says &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me girl&#8221; from the [19]70s. It&#8217;s how I got to know people and I started before listservs were invented. I started this thing called the&#8212; I was working with what was then the NC Child Advocacy Institute, and it&#8217;s called Action for Children now. And I started the NCCAI InfoNet. So in the old days I would be the person who would see an article in a magazine or the paper you needed to read, so I would cut it out and put it in an envelope and say, &#8220;FYI, thought you&#8217;d be interested.&#8221; Well, now I can do that on the computer. I copied and pasted, and I had listservs on, let&#8217;s see African American, Latino, Education, Political Junkies. I had like eight or nine of them and people would get on them, and I would send articles or interesting things, and now of course everybody does that. So I know so many people. People will call me day and night, &#8220;What&#8217;s so and so&#8217;s email address, and of course I know it, or cell phone number?&#8221; I have the most amazing contact list. When people want to get the word out about something, they say, &#8220;Will you send this out over your network?&#8221; They&#8217;ve dubbed me, &#8220;the empress of email.&#8221; Now some of it&#8217;s gone way over my head now. I have a couple hundred people who follow me on Twitter&#8212; LL: On your Twitter account. PW: And I&#8217;m on Facebook a lot. But I don&#8217;t know how to do some of the things that are really good to do. Although I recognized it as a really good political tool and when I managed to campaign for a statewide judge, nobody was doing this. I made her a Facebook page, and I got a thousand friends and I figured each one was a vote. LL: Absolutely. Yeah, you just post an update and get people to go to the polls these days. PW: Now it&#8217;s utilized really wonderfully. Of course Barack Obama&#8212; LL: With the text messages too. So I&#8217;m wondering, so in talking to people so far there are a lot of organizations, women&#8217;s organizations in North Carolina getting started in the [19]90s I would say that focus on putting women in office or getting women in public service. So Lillian&#8217;s List, the Forum, or rather the Peace College, I think right, sponsored the&#8212; PW: Well, it&#8217;s called the North Carolina Center for Women in Public Service, and it was birthed out of the Women&#8217;s Forum. LL: Out of the Forum. PW: So I was on the board of the Women&#8217;s Forum at the time, and I got involved in helping to write a little bit of the curriculum and doing a little teaching. Now ironically I&#8217;m going to be teaching at Peace&#8212; LL: I saw that as an adjunct, yeah, great. PW: University. So I&#8217;m really very excited about that. LL: So I guess my question was brought that about do you think? I mean, women in public service seems like a logical goal to me, but that seems to have been a large focus of the women&#8217;s movement. I&#8217;m wondering if the people who were dedicated to those causes were also sort of dedicated to reproductive choice or domestic violence. Or was that the main goal of women involved in these organizations? PW: Well, I think that the founding of these organizations like Emily&#8217;s List is the&#8212; LL: National, yeah. PW: We all go by that. Emily is not a person. It stands for Early Money is Like Yeast. But Lillian&#8217;s List here, Lillian was a person. You know Lillian Exum Clement, she was the first woman to be in the legislature. She drove her horse and buggy down the mountain, and she was an attorney, and some seventy pieces of legislation that she introduced are still on the books. It&#8217;s a wonderful story, but all the research shows that women make a difference to the discourse when they&#8217;re around the table. And that&#8217;s what we all decided, that we needed to get more women elected. And of course then you struggle with, &#8220;Oh well, you&#8217;re only going to care about women&#8217;s issues (whatever those are) and children.&#8221; Well, forget it, children. But it does make a difference to the discourse. Lillian&#8217;s List is, we elect pro-choice Democrats, pro-choice Democratic women to the legislature. And it was just the legislature, just recently they expanded to include Council of State. A lot of that was because Bev Perdue was running for governor, and that was history. So it&#8217;s a wonderful model. It&#8217;s based on Emily&#8217;s List. Women and men join, and then they interview candidates and give them a questionnaire but for sure a face-to-face. LL: Face-to-face. PW: And they&#8217;re asked certain questions, and if they are endorsed, then that goes out to all the members. Here&#8217;s their picture and a little bio, and members are encouraged to write fifty-dollar checks to as many as you can. LL: As they can. PW: And Lillian&#8217;s List bundles them. So if you&#8217;re running for office, you get this envelope a few times during a session, a campaign, and there&#8217;s like fifty checks in there, and it&#8217;s like such an ego boost. LL: What year was it founded? PW: I believe [19]99. LL: [19]99. That sounds about right. I was thinking the late [19]90s. I mean at that point in time being an organization that said, &#8220;We will only endorse pro-choice candidates.&#8221; What was the reaction? It&#8217;s one thing to say we stand for women being elected to public service. It&#8217;s another to say and we are going to focus on those who are pro-choice. PW: Well, 1999 was after the 1994 revolution, the Gingrich Revolution. And then in North Carolina the Republican Party took over the House for the first time ever. So it was amazingly destructive. Of course it&#8217;s worse now because they run both chambers. They&#8217;ve taken us backwards on so many important issues, women&#8217;s rights, education, the environment. LL: You name it. PW: But in those days it was just the House. So we depended on the Senate to not take up all the idiotic bills that were passed. There were some real zealots. This was before the Tea Party, but there were some zealots there. Anti-tax people, people who didn&#8217;t want to accept federal money for anything. Federal money was tainted. You don&#8217;t realize how much, most people don&#8217;t realize how much federal money is part of each state&#8217;s working budget. And we need it. There were two old guys who were crazy together. And they would go to Smart Start sites with a video camera and put microphone in the director&#8217;s face and say, &#8220;How much money do you spend on this? And what&#8217;s your budget and what are you doing?&#8221; It was so intimidating and bullying, and the only reason they hated Smart Start was because it was a Jim Hunt program. And then they hated More at Four because it was a Mike Easley program. But we&#8217;re talking about preschool education. LL: Four and five year olds, yeah. PW: And how important that is&#8212;Jim Hunt would say, &#8220;It&#8217;s the itty-bitty brains.&#8221; And of course we know that, but these are folks who say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have preschool at all and look at me.&#8221; LL: You don&#8217;t need it, yeah. PW: Right. Or when we were talking about corporal punishment in the schools. &#8220;Well, I was whupped and look at me.&#8221; Well, yes, you&#8217;re a little crazy. LL: Right, right. Maybe that&#8217;s why. PW: But it was really a bad time. But thank God for the Senate. Now there&#8217;s no hope. So we knew that women had to be there. LL: And for the pro-choice stance did you face a lot of flak? Was that rubbing salt in the wound for people who would&#8217;ve opposed Lillian&#8217;s List anyway to say&#8212;? PW: I don&#8217;t think so. LL: No? PW: I don&#8217;t think so. LL: I was talking to somebody the other day about starting a women&#8217;s center, and she was saying that she took a lot of flak because in order to get money they couldn&#8217;t take a stance on abortion. And this was in the [19]90s and so&#8212; PW: In order to get money from who? The feds? LL: No, no, no, from donors. Right in the local area so I was just sort of curious about the climate surrounding even the [19]90s surrounding the issue of choice politically. PW: Well, these were women that we knew. LL: So already, among supporters certainly it was&#8212; PW: And the candidates who wanted to be, you got the max in the primary, you got the max in the General, and then you got all these little bitty checks and it was good. It was good. But some women in some counties didn&#8217;t want our endorsement, and to this day they still don&#8217;t, some of them. They&#8217;ll do what they want, but they have to play to their county. So we respect that, too. For so many years actually until two years ago, these women had never been tested. What I mean by that is, all of the Republicans would always introduce two dozen horrible bills, and our Democratic leadership would pocket them, and they would never come up on the calendar. They would never be discussed. In some ways when I look back on that, that was too bad because, and this is one of my frustrations. When the Democrats are in power, they are afraid to be Democrats. When the Republicans are in power, they have no problem being as extreme and awful as they want. I remember arguing with some legislator saying, &#8220;Oh I can&#8217;t do that. But what if you had the Republicans in power?&#8221; I said, &#8220;What difference would it make?&#8221; And to a lot of that it didn&#8217;t. So when they got control, now their bills moved. And they were pretty horrendous. But in those days we had all these women, and they never had to vote on anything. They told us they were pro-choice. LL: But they never had to say yes or no. PW: And I was frankly a little bit nervous as to what would happen when they actually were tested. But they all came through with flying colors. They all made me cry when they spoke on the floor of the House and Senate. LL: So with this depressing political climate in place, what is the answer? What&#8217;s the silver bullet? How do we advance, fight against what does seem to be truly a war on women? PW: Well, there&#8217;s a lot of legal action. You know they tried to keep Planned Parenthood from even applying for any state or federal money, clearly unconstitutional. And a judge put the kibosh on that. That was last year, 2011. So this year they didn&#8217;t mention Planned Parenthood by name. What they did was say that all the money for family planning and cancer screenings were going to go to the local health departments. Now first of all by the time you can get an appointment at the local health department, you&#8217;re probably going to pass twenty weeks and not be able to [have an abortion] or have cancer that isn&#8217;t detected. They have six, eight week waiting periods for appointments. LL: Waiting periods. PW: They&#8217;re terribly underfunded and understaffed. So the Obama administration did a great thing last week and gave Planned Parenthoods all over the country, because they&#8217;re all under attack, Title X money and in North Carolina it was four times as much money as&#8212; LL: As they had gotten. PW: As they would have gotten from the state. So that&#8217;s great. But all the money and the time and sweat that you have to spend litigating when it&#8217;s totally unnecessary. LL: So what about younger&#8212;you&#8217;re going to be teaching at Peace&#8212;a younger generation of women and their views on feminism? I&#8217;m always shocked to hear just how bad a word it is among college circles. From your experience in the women&#8217;s movement, do you see any sort of solutions there, or things that we can do? PW: Unfortunately it&#8217;s like the Affordable Care Act. Half of Americans who are completely uninformed say that they hate it, that don&#8217;t like it, that they want it repealed. But then when you ask them&#8212; LL: Point by point. PW: Point by point, do you like no pre-existing conditions, keeping your kids on until twenty-six, all those things, they love those. And even the Republicans figured out that they would have to keep those things in their bravado about repealing it. And I think feminism is the same way. LL: Are you a feminist? No. Do you like&#8212; PW: No, but I want to decide when I get pregnant, and I want birth control, and I of course I want equal pay for equal work. So you know if they don&#8217;t want to call themselves that that&#8217;s fine, but they&#8217;re fooling themselves. My goal, I&#8217;m teaching a course on public policy, and my goal is to get young people engaged in the process. So many people say, &#8220;Ew, I&#8217;m not political.&#8221; LL: Politics, yeah. PW: Yeah, it&#8217;s dirty business. Well, yeah it is. But democracy only works when everybody plays. LL: Participates. PW: And people just don&#8217;t understand that. It&#8217;s frustrating to me how years ago, or if it&#8217;s still happening, people in countries around the world walk for days and cry when it&#8217;s the first time they&#8217;ve ever voted in a free election. Americans take it for granted and don&#8217;t vote. We have the worst turnout figures. It makes me so angry. Especially, I&#8217;ll tell you. I was in line at the post office one day. Two people were talking. One was an African American young man, said, &#8220;Yeah I&#8217;m not going to vote.&#8221; I wanted to turn around and say, &#8220;Do you realize that people actually died so that you could have, were murdered, so that you could have the right to vote? How dare you take that for granted?&#8221; So that&#8217;s my, and it&#8217;s funny. Everybody that I've asked for advice, from my mentors to the woman who authored one of the textbooks I adopted, they all said, &#8220;Keep them engaged.&#8221; LL: It&#8217;s true. I think that&#8217;s a huge part of it. So I have a couple of reflective questions to close the interview up. Looking back, how would you think of yourself in terms of the women&#8217;s movement in the U.S., you having been a student of women&#8217;s studies? You know the first wave, the second wave, et cetera. Where would you place yourself in terms of&#8212; [phone ringing] PW: I would say that I was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time. [phone ringing] I had my&#8212; LL: That&#8217;s fine. PW: I had my academic awakening, and I had my political awakening, and they were one in the same. I just learned so much and I was part of it. I was part of it. When you asked about the [19]68 convention in Chicago, I wouldn&#8217;t have gone near that. I was not a brave person. I still don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a brave person. But someone said, &#8220;Look at all the risks that you&#8217;ve taken over your life.&#8221; But not to my personal safety. I wouldn&#8217;t have gone down to Grant Park for anything. But I have since been part of demonstrations and rallies and things like that. It was just a wonderful time for me. LL: Like the light bulb just kind of&#8212;and so I guess this may be a tough question. What do you think is at the core of what motivated you to get involved in the women&#8217;s movement when you did? Was there one thing in particular or was it kind of all these things converging? PW: Fairness. It was just fairness. When you study history and you read about how they couldn&#8217;t own land, they couldn&#8217;t vote. As heinous as slavery was in this country, black men were given an amendment to the constitution to vote years before women were. It&#8217;s just ridiculous and of course American women have it great compared to other countries where just horrific things happen to women, and they&#8217;re treated so badly. That shouldn&#8217;t happen. It shouldn&#8217;t happen. We&#8217;re human beings, and we contribute just as much if not more. I have a button that says something like, &#8220;Wages for Housework.&#8221; There was an economic study, and it showed if you had to replace yourself in the home to be the cook, the chauffeur, the cleaner, the this, the that, that would bring in a big salary. And of course that&#8217;s free. That&#8217;s free labor that women provide. LL: People don&#8217;t have to pay for it. PW: That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m very against volunteerism to a certain extent because that&#8217;s free labor. If you give your labor away you&#8217;re not going to ask for a living wage when you get a &#8220;real&#8221; job. LL: Is there anything that I haven&#8217;t asked or that you wish I would&#8217;ve asked or anything that you want to say on tape? PW: No, I don&#8217;t think so. I want to show you some stuff though. LL: Yeah, that would be fantastic. Okay, then I&#8217;m going to call an end to the tape...
