 KWON: So Iâm going to record a quick intro. IKEMOTO: Okay. Thereâs a good chance I wonât remember much. (Both laugh) KWON: Thatâs okay. So this is Juhee Kwon. Today is July 8, 2013, and Iâm interviewing Professor Lisa Ikemoto at her office at the University of California Davis School of Law. This interviewâs a part of the Asian American Reproductive Justice Oral History, and I just wanted to get started possibly with a quick intro and then also a brief introduction of the current work you do. IKEMOTO: Okay. Sounds good. . . So what are we starting with? (laughs) KWON: Your intro, and then the current work youâre doing here at the School of Law. IKEMOTO: Iâm on the faculty at UC [University of California] Davis School of Law, and my work focuses on biotechnology uses, mostly reproductive and genetic technology uses, primarily through a critical race, feminist lens and also using cultural studies. So I probably fit in the categoriesâthe academic disciplinesâof bioethics and science and technology studies. KWON: Do you teach classes related to those, too? IKEMOTO: Yeah. I teach the bioethics and health law curriculum here at the law school, so I teach bioethics, public health law, healthcare law, reproductive rights law and policy. And then I also teach a bar course on marital property, which is not related to anything else (laughs). KWON: So how did you get involved in Asian American reproductive justice then? IKEMOTO: Um, how did I do that? . . . I started my academic career right out of law school withâimmediately because I was interested in reproductive technology use and reproductive justice issues. So I guess because Iâve always used a racial lens and used critical race theoryâand I came at a time when critical race theory was emerging as kind of a challenge to the traditional doctrinal approach in legal scholarship and practice. And because I came at a time when the primary paradigm for race was black and white, it was a good time and an important time for thinkingâbreaking open that black white paradigm. Because Iâm Asian American, because Iâm from California, and Iâve lived primarily with Asian and Latino and White communities, I guess it seemed natural to bring in those perspectives or to try to. KWON: Did you get personally involved with the organizations like APIRH [Asian Pacific Islanders for Reproductive Health]? How did you get involved with those organizations? IKEMOTO: Yeah. So my career started in the East Coast and Midwest, and then I was working primarily in a Black White social context, although with as many asâto the extent that I could have contact with Asian American communities. But when I moved back to LAâso that was in ninetyâI moved to San Francisco in â92 and LA in â93 or â94. And I was just so happy to be back in a multiracial, multicultural context (laughs). KWON: Me, too. IKEMOTO: I just jumped into it. Yeah, you know the feeling, right? So I became involved in Asian American bar activities and other community activities. So Iâm trying to remember. I met Yin [Ling Leung]. Yin approached me and introduced herself to me when I was in the Bay Area. She was ED [Executive Director] of APIRH at that time and thenâI think she just came up and introduced herself and was very open and inviting. And then maybe when I moved back to LA, I was approached to join the board of APIRH. . . Maybe it wasnât right away. Maybe it was after that. I just canât remember. It must have been after that. KWON: Yeah. Okay. IKEMOTO: Yeah, but I met Yin pretty early on. Then shortly after I moved to LAâso that was in â93. I took a faculty position in Los Angeles. The women started getting together, initiatedâat least from my perspectiveâby Peggy Saika in the Bay Area and Cyndi Choi, who was then in LA, to have a gathering of progressive Asian American women in the U.S. KWON: In the entireâ IKEMOTO: So that was the basisâthat was beginning of the formation of NAPAWF [National Asian Pacific American Womenâs Forum]. KWON: Oh, right. So did you attend the first NAPAWF conference? IKEMOTO: Yeah, and we chose LA for the first gathering, so I was on the organizing committee. There was a big network of people working on it. It was great because as soon as I moved to LA, I got to start meeting people and connecting with people, largely based in California, because we were doing logistics, but also all over the U.S. And they had been inspired because Peggy and others who went to Beijing [for the 1995 UN Womenâs Conference] said, How come we have to go to China to meet the progressive women in LAâto meet the progressive women in the U.S.? Why donât we do this in the U.S.? So they really started it, and I was happy to be in the right place at the right time. KWON: Oh, thatâs really interesting. IKEMOTO: Yeah, and I think I joined the board of APIRH a little bit later. So I think that was in â97. KWON: Mhmm. So since thenâ IKEMOTO: But I had met some of the key peopleâ KWON: Right, right. Like Peggy Saika and Yin. IKEMOTO: Yeah, and Yin and Sora Park and some others. KWON: Okay. Have you been able to integrate that into your academic work here as well? Because I know youâit says you work National Law Students for Reproductive Justice [LSRJ]. Thereâs a group here at Davis? IKEMOTO: Yeah, so Iâve always, throughout my career, tried to connect my academic work with community work. Iâve done it largely by being a board member or advisor, and I try to work both with a local organization and with a national organization, and those have shifted over the years, just sort of depending on where the opportunities were and where I was. So when I was in Indiana, I was on the board of Legal Services of Indiana and working with the critical race theory people nationally and with some other academic organizations. When I moved to Los Angeles, the opportunities changed, just because the social political context is very different in California than it is in Indiana. So I was on the board of California Womenâs Law Center. A little bit later, I joined the board of APIRH. Currently, Iâm not on a community organization board becauseâwell, Iâm on the advisory committee for the national LSRJ. I just cycled off of Reproductive Health Technologies Project board as of the end of 2012. But because Iâm going on sabbatical, Iâm saying no to everything right now. I spent my last sabbatical with APIRH, which is great butâ (Phone rings) Hello? Speaking. END OF FILE 1 FILE 2 IKEMOTO: Did that answer your question? Iâve lost track of what the question was. KWON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. How you work with different community organizations. IKEMOTO: Yeah. So in part, itâs hopefully my effort to contribute some time and energy to on-the-ground work, but it also keeps my own work grounded. I pick up issues [and] try to bring in the types of resources and skills that they donât have the time to do themselves. Thatâs sort of how I see it. KWON: When I talk to a lot of different community organizers, they were saying, âOh, we need more academics in the field because all of us are on the ground, and thereâs no actual academic material being produced.â Because when I looked for literature and things like that, thereâs a lot on Black women, Latina women, but thereâs nothing on Asian American women. IKEMOTO: Hardly any on Asian American women. I know. At one point, Yin and I had this dream that we were going to create a historyâlike an RJ [reproductive justice] history of Asian American women. But thereâs no documentation. KWON: Exactly. IKEMOTO: There is for African American women, because thereâve long been historians whoâve been working in that field, and we thoughtâwe looked for data on abortions and all kinds of issues, and we canât find anything. So weâd have to go out and find the people, interview the peopleâ KWON: Which is what Iâm doing. IKEMOTO: Yeah, exactly. We need people like you. KWON: Yeah. I looked for it too, because I wanted toâ IKEMOTO: Did you find anything? KWON: No. I found Lora Jo Fooâs book [Asian American Women], and then I found Undivided Rights, and that was it. And then I found you, and there were a couple articles and then that was it. IKEMOTO: Yeah. Thereâs hardly anything out there and I thought, God, I would love to be able to go out and interview people, but I donât haveâfrom a lawâif youâre not an anthropologist or a sociologist, itâs really hard to do that. So I could start now, but I wouldnât be able to get around to collecting enough material until I retire. (laughs) Then it can be my retirement project. I mean you need somebody whoâs been trained to do it. KWON: Yeah, but itâs good. I think itâs good that Iâm interviewing people who are actually doing the work right now because itâs more live and itâs more fresh, and so their memories are a little better. IKEMOTO: For a while I had a fantasy of tracking down the doctors who were providing servicesâbecause there was a doctor in LA, whoâthere was a woman doctor who practiced in LA She delivered my aunt, she delivered one of my students, but she was working primarily in South Central. So she must have delivering babies and performing abortions for primarily women of color for decades. For decades. Because she startedâshe was one of the first women, Asian women doctors. Her life must have been fascinating, and she must have known what was going on. But by the time I figured out who she was, she was like in her nineties, and I was no longer in LA. KWON: Yeah, and the history just kind of disappears. IKEMOTO: Yeah. Maybe somebody got it, I donât know. KWON: Hopefully with this project, weâll hopefullyâbecause itâs in the archives someone will look for it. IKEMOTO: Yeah, itâs great that youâre doing this. KWON: I also wanted to move onto your experience with the RJ for All Conference in Smith College. If you could tell me what the conference was about, what it was like, and who was there. I know it was a while ago. IKEMOTO: It seemed like everybody was there or nearly everybody was there. So in that sense, it was this wonderful gathering. Because it was peopleâit was activists, and it was scholars. So there were a lot of synergies there, a lot of excitement. It was one of the first, I think, conferences using the reproductive justice framework; it wasnât the only one. And I think it was really telling that the RJ framework came from the movement and not academia, and it gave academics a chance to appreciate that, so I think that was really good. But it was a really good mix of people. Not absolutely everybody could make it, but it was a real mix of issues. It wasnât just abortion. It was also disability rightsâa little bit, probably not enoughâand the queer activists were there, so sexual orientation, sexual identity, those issues were on the table. And it was one of the few times where Iâve been to a reproductive rights, reproductive health type of setting where those things came together. It wasnât more narrowly focused, and the goal was to open up those spaces rather than say, âThis is what we can do in two days.â KWON: So what was the final product of the conference? IKEMOTO: I know they tried to document it as much as possible. My guess is that there wasnât a final product, but it didâone example was that one of the panels I was on, we decided to use that as a starting point, and so we produced a set of articles that was published in Signs, and so it allowed us to continueâthere were coupleâthere was at least one meeting following that, which I wasnât able to attend in person. But it sort ofâso it was a basis of a new set of relationships at least, and I think thatâs been true for other people as well. Yeah. KWON: Who were the other Asian American women that were there? IKEMOTO: Yin was there. So thatâs an example. Sheâs someone whoâs long been doing work on the ground, and she was there and that was really important. Iâm trying toâwho else was there . . . for Asian American women? (pause) Well, Wendy Mink was one of the organizers. KWON: Oh, whoâs that? IKEMOTO: Sheâs at Smith [College]. She was one of the core faculty members who put it together. Gwendolyn Mink. KWON: Okay. I donât know her. IKEMOTO: She does really great work. Her primarily workâs in welfare, but she does great race gender analysis of welfare. She was, in a sense, one of the hosts who helped pull it together. She was key in that process, and sheâs alsoâshe was selfless in the way she did it. She didnât put herself front and center, and so maybe thatâs why you donât know her name (laughs), but she was key to that coming together at that conference. So sheâs Asian American. Iâm trying to think. Itâs so funny, because it was probably much less about raceâI mean, itâbecause there was a racial analysis there, but because it was so openâ(pauses) I know Dorothy Roberts was there. Sheâs not Asian American, Iâm just trying to remember all the faces I saw. I canât remember. KWON: It was just a lot of people? IKEMOTO: Yeah. Was it Marlene [Gerber Fried]? Marlene was there. (pauses) I donât remember. I just remember lots of people were there. Eveline [Shen] wasnât there. I remember I called her from there. Planned Parenthood was there. That was amazing, because to have one of the major national womenâs organizations that had been, for so long, white and law-focused. Theyâre embracing theâor at least, saying they were embracing the reproductive justice framework was really important. But the Asian American women, I canât identify specifically. Yeah. Itâs all pretty fuzzy. KWON: I can just dig through the archives when Iâm at Smith. IKEMOTO: Yeah. Yeah. I guess you can remind me who was there. Yeah, I donât remember a lot of specifics about it. KWON: Were there any other seminal gatherings or any key events that you remember? You said there were some other reproductive justice conferences? IKEMOTO: In terms of academic conferences? KWON: Yeah, sure. IKEMOTO: Letâs see. You know, the Color of Justice Conference. That was at Santa Cruz. KWON: Okay. Do you remember when that was? IKEMOTO: Let me look it up. I think they have an archive, too. If not, I might have materials from that. (Types on computer) KWON: Was that a law conference? IKEMOTO: No. Let me seeâ(Typing on computer. Searches âColor of Justice Conferenceâ) This was so long ago. KWON: Was it the nineties? IKEMOTO: Oh, it was Color of Violenceâis it Color of Justice or Color of Violence? Maybe it was this one. (Clicks on link to INCITE website) KWON: Oh, the INCITE Conference? IKEMOTO: (Looking at INCITE Conference website) Okay. Maybe this was it. That looks familiar. KWON: Yeah, that was a pretty big conference. IKEMOTO: What was the date? I think this was it. (Pauses while reading website) I think this is the one Iâm thinking of. That one wasâso it wasnât solely focused on reproductive justice, but there was definitely a reproductive justice thread there. I just canât remember when it was. But that was another one. What else? A lot of the stuff thatâwell, LSRJ, when they switched from Law Students for Reproductive Choice to Law Students for Reproductive Justice, I think that was an important shift, and theyâve hosted some, I think, important events. One at Berkeley Law. And their trainings are good. Other big events. I think itâs just so interesting now because reproductive justice has become so frequently used now that itâs lost some of its political meaning. KWON: Yeah. Thatâs what happens when it gets into the system. IKEMOTO: Yeah. I mean evenâthere was a really interestingâthey got an NSF [National Science Foundation] funded workshop, and it was hosted by Jennifer Fishman, Laura Mamo, and . . . Iâm losing the third person. Oh! I canât think . . . Janet Shim. Do you know them? KWON: . . . No. IKEMOTO: So theyâre in Sociology, but they hosted this in San Francisco. It was like a workshop, and that was focused on reproductive justice. It was much more limited. We could all meet in one room. But we met for two days with pretty intense discussions. KWON: Was it scholars? IKEMOTO: That was . . . was it all scholars? Iâm trying to think of who was there. All the people I can think of were primarily scholars. Some people doing a mix of both. (pauses) I think it was primarily scholars. But that was a reallyâoh, what they did was they mergeâthey had RJ and EJ [environmental justice]. KWON: Mhmm. Oh, thatâs always good. IKEMOTO: Yeah, and it was really interesting to see the different uses of the word âjusticeâ in different understandings, and the different evolutions and paths that those two framings have followed. So I think that was a useful discussion, at least within the academic world. They had a lot of the key people there. KWON: Yeah. This is just a personal question that I was interested in, but why do you think itâs so important to have a law studentsâor why do you think so many law students are interested in reproductive justice, [so much] that thereâs a national organization around it? IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah. I think a lot ofâwell, thatâs a good question. Letâs see. Maybe it shows the ways in which critical theory and feminist critical theory have influenced both undergraduate education and legal education, but probably also the way that community work is done. Students come in with an awareness and are at least open to learning that you can only do so much with law. And so they want a way of thinking about issues that gets them beyond the limitations of legalistic approaches, and RJ can do that. KWON: Is the organization mostly made up of women, or are there a lot of male allies? IKEMOTO: LSRJ? KWON: Yeah. IKEMOTO: Yeah, I think itâsâwell, the staffing is primarily women. I think the most of the members in the different law schools are women. Itâs not limited to women, but their primary goal has been to get courses in the law schoolâs curriculum and to provide sites within the law school for students and faculty to work on the issues, to be trained to address the issues, and then participate in the broader movement in various ways. KWON: Yeah. Do they go outâafter they graduate law school and when they practice law, is RJ something they [continue engaging in]â IKEMOTO: Yeah, some of them do. Probably becauseâso some of them are getting fellowships. (Points to a picture above her desk) Christine right here is one of my former students, and she was head of LSRJ when she was here. She got an LSRJ fellowship. I think she did one of their summer training programs and then got an LSRJ fellowship that placed her at NAPAWF in D.C. So thatâs what she was doing now. So sheâs doing RJ stuff, post graduation, and I think she wants to continue doing that. There arenât tons of jobsâ KWON: Itâs a really narrow field. IKEMOTO: âin reproductive justice, but I think [students are] much better equipped and much more likely to find those jobs, if theyâre getting the courses and finding the support system while theyâre in law school. KWON: Thatâs really cool. Yeah, Iâm trying to figure out what I want to do after college. Yeah, that might be something I would be interested in. IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah. Itâs a great group of people. KWON: Well, also since youâre so familiar with lawâI havenât been able to ask as many people, but do you know of any key legislation or policies that I should probably include in the timeline? IKEMOTO: Well, thereâs this whole ramping up in abortion regulation right now. I get an email about that every single day. KWON: (laughs) I know. I have no idea whatâs going on in this country! Weâre always on the defensive, right? I donât know whatâs going on. IKEMOTO: Oh my gosh. Itâs crazy. Itâs crazy. Yeah, so the just the ramping up in abortion regulation, and it isâ KWON: Why do you think thatâs happened? IKEMOTO: I guessâI donât know (laughs). Everybodyâs talking about the polarization, not just between the official political parties but the cultural political polarization. Itâs interesting because I think the agendaâs not just about fetal politics anymore; itâs really about the status of women. Itâs much more directly aimed at womenâs decision-making powers. Itâs trying to narrow down the scope of womenâs decision-making powers, but itâs also very closely linked to a broader agenda. So the sameâthe attacks on womenâs rights and womenâs status is linked to the attacks on same sex marriageâso I donât think thatâs a coincidence that those two fights are taking place simultaneously. But I donât have you know the perfect answer to whatâs going on. And the interesting thing is that at the same time that thereâs all this effort to contract choice with respect to abortion, assisted reproductive technology [ART] use is almost wholly unregulated. So this notion that free choice is perfectly appropriate in that sphere. So weâre using a free-market approach to those kinds of technologies. KWON: Well, thereâs definitely a class difference between the two, right? IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah. KWON: So the users of technologies, theyâre not [so-called] âbad mothers who need abortionâ or who are making theââthe unfitâ to make those choices. IKEMOTO: Yeah, itâs primarilyânot exclusivelyâitâs primarily white. Itâs primarily privileged, you have to haveâ KWON: A lot of money. IKEMOTO: Credit and cash to use those technologies. There are powerful industries behind them because itâs a multibillion-dollar in the U.S., and now itâs global, soâyeah, and itâs pro-natalist. One of the things now is toâin California, thereâs a billâI think itâs close to enactmentâto authorize payment for eggs for research purposes. We already have an unregulated market for paying women to provide eggs for fertility purposes, but thereâs been regulation of payment to provide eggs for research purposes. But now theyâre trying to authorize payment for eggs for research purposes, so itâll expand the market there. The expansion of a market approach on the one handâ KWON: Itâs only going to get bigger then. IKEMOTO: Maybe. Maybe not. But thereâs no immediate brakes on it. So . . . KWON: Wow. Yeah, Iâm not very familiar with the legislation or the policies on reproductive technologies. IKEMOTO: Well, the other thing thatâs going on is that thereâs stillâI mean, there was just a story in the paper yesterday about the forced sterilizations taking place inâor theâ KWON: The prisons. I clipped it. IKEMOTO: The involuntary sterilizations taking place inâ KWON: Yeah, I clipped the entire thing. I was like, âThis looks like an article that I was reading from the eighties or the seventies.â Yeah. IKEMOTO: Exactly. Exactly. Because thereâs a group of people working to try to get redress for those who were subject to the forced sterilizations in California as part of eugenic sterilization, but now thereâs this whole ânother group of people. KWON: Oh my gosh. IKEMOTO: It hasnât stopped. KWON: Yeah. I think itâs interesting becauseâI donât know if this is true, but a lot of the discussion is shifting from race to crime or immigration status, and itâs hiding the race factor because race is some taboo thing weâre not allowed to directly discriminate people on, but itâs okay to discriminate people on immigration status or criminal history. People kind of erase the fact that itâs connected directly to race. IKEMOTO: Well, immigration restrictions have long been understood as a way of population controlâby race. Thatâs been true since the early 20th century, and thatâs part of what the debate is about now with respect to immigration reform. So itâs not just specifically about, technology uses, but also things like marriage and immigration are related as well, yeah. KWON: Because itâs all about the nuclear family, like the technology and the immigration and birth control and abortion. Itâs all aboutâthatâs really interesting. IKEMOTO: And I think itâs important to remember itâs also about gender roles. The fightâs still on about gender roles. I know it seems like it shouldnât be but it still is. KWON: Oh my gosh. IKEMOTO: Yeah. KWON: Okay, so those are the policies that are [being enacted] right now, but what about some key policies or legislations in the past, in the eighties and nineties? Are you familiar with any [legislations from then] or [have] things that stick out? IKEMOTO: Oh, from the eighties and nineties? KWON: Mhmm IKEMOTO: Well, eighties and nineties the things that surfaced were prosecution of pregnant women for drug use and still, the way pregnant women are treated, especially criminalization, is stillâthat trend has continued. Now itâs criminalization of women for anything causes fetal injury or death. So itâs expanded in some senses. Letâs see. That was a lot of it. The reproductive technology uses were really booming then. KWON: When was, when was the Hyde Law? The amendment? IKEMOTO: That started inâHyde Amendment was a reaction to Roe vs. Wade so that came up in the late 1970s. KWON: 1970s. IKEMOTO: Yeah, and itâs changed over time. Whatâs changed is its list of exceptions, and then itâs also multiplied so there are different Hyde laws. So it applies to members of the military. It applies to other sources of federal funding as well, because the Hyde Amendment itself only applies to Medicaid funding. But now there are sort of Hyde-like laws that apply to other federal funded forms of healthcare. KWON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you also familiar with PRENDA [Prenatal Discrimination Act]? IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah. KWON: Could you talk a little bit about that and sex selection and Asian American women? IKEMOTO: Yeah. That stuffâs getting really nutty. Yeah, so itâs all in the name ofâI mean, they say itâs about protecting women and protecting women of color, specifically. KWON: Isnât that an interesting rhetoric? IKEMOTO: Yeah (sighs). Yeah, itâs just crazy. So itâs all in the name of protecting women, but itâs regulation of women in another form, really. They couched it in the form of racial anti-discrimination, which is clever. Yeah, so between that and the [anti-abortion] billboards. You get all these differentâthereâs this women protectionist movement, so we need to restrict abortion in order to protect women against themselves. Reva Siegelâs done some of the best work on that, and then yeah, now theyâre using the anti-race discrimination framework, so itâsâI think the focus on the fetus has shifted to these other rationales or narratives about what the regulationâs for. KWON: Has the PRENDA law passed in some states? IKEMOTO: The last timeâthe last one I heard about was in Arizona, and I think it was defeated. Oh! Another person you should talk to: Sujatha [Jesudason]. KWON: Oh, yes. IKEMOTO: Did you talk to her? KWON: No, I have her scheduled in two weeks. IKEMOTO: So she has a reallyâsheâs really knowledgeable on this issue. KWON: Yeah. She used to work with Generations Ahead. IKEMOTO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And sheâs still doing great work. KWON: Yeah. I think sheâs at UCSF [University California, San Francisco] for CoreAlign. IKEMOTO: Yeah, but Generations Ahead put together a really good analysis of sex selection, antiâthe supposed race selection laws. Yeah, sheâs the person to talk to about that. KWON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, your commentaryâs helpful, too. IKEMOTO: Yeah, so I think the other important front isâwell, Sujatha is also going be good on thisâthereâs only emerging now an ability to talk between the disability rights and reproductive rights people, because theyâre going to be in conflict on some issues. From a disability rights perspective, thereâs a lot of concern about choosing abortion because of Down Syndrome or any other disability. So itâs really important to acknowledge those conflicts and try to work together to the extent possible. Thatâs onlyâthatâs very recent, and itâs just starting to happen and may not have gotten very far. KWON: Oh, wow. What do you see as the possible compromises that they could come up with? IKEMOTO: I probably havenât thought enough about this one (pauses). I think at least the conversation can start about acknowledging that there are different understandings of choice on the table. So my concern about pro-choice at any cost is that itâs morphed into a free market choice, that itâs no longer a sort of a thoughtful, autonomy-based choice anymore, and I think that puts communities like persons with disabilities at greater risk. So I think we have to start by acknowledging that. But I donât know, yeah. I donât know. KWON: So itâs like a potential future conflictâ IKEMOTO: Yeah, I think itâs whereâhow do we start the conversation is hard enough. KWON: Do you know if there were any convenings of RJ and disability rights activists? IKEMOTO: Yeah, well, Sujathaâs done some of that work. So Generations Ahead did some of that work, and then Center for Genetics and Society held a series of three meetings. I missed it this year because this is the first year without it. The Tarrytown Meetings, and theyâreâthe last two meetings, there were conversations about [RJ and disability rights] that I think were very good and searchingâand honest. Difficult, but open and willing in spirit. KWON: So thatâs one potential future conflict that you foresee for RJ? IKEMOTO: Yeah, and maybe I donât even want to frame it as a conflict, but I think itâs an important area of work that RJ needs to taken on. KWON: What else do you think thatâwhat other issues do you think will come up for the RJ movement? IKEMOTO: Umm. The next few years . . . Well, the technology issues are moving really fast. KWON: Whatâs the current status of ART? IKEMOTO: Letâs see. So a lotâsome of itâs taking place in genetic testing, because itâs moving to really early stages of the pregnancy, and so. KWON: Like how early? IKEMOTO: First trimester. Early in the first trimester. Yeah, you can now do genetic testing. And presumably youâll get more and more information. KWON: How exactly does that work? IKEMOTO: Well, because now they can do rather an amniocentesis, which you usually do at eighteen to twenty weeks, so during the second trimester. Thereâs nothing wrong with doing it earlier, but youâre getting more information, and thereâs no thoughtful analysis as far as I know about how to use that information and the amount of information youâll be able to get will increase over time. So people are facing choices that they donâtâthey may not be prepared for and donât know how to think about; I donât think I would. Theyâre just presented as choices for people to have. So thatâs an issue. KWON: So when you say genetic testing, it means like, âYour son or daughter is a carrier of X, Y, Z disease, and they have a percentage of developing kidney failure.â IKEMOTO: Developing breast cancer when theyâre fifty orâand so itâs the kinds ofâtheyâre risks as opposed to conditions that the child will be born with. So weâre expanding the ways of tailoring people. KWON: So when they offer genetic testing, they say, Okay, hereâs the risk for your child. Then what are the options? Do you want to abort your child? Is that the option theyâre providing? IKEMOTO: Yeah. Yeah, if itâs prenatal. We also you know you can screen gametes to some extent. You can screen embryos, in vitro embryos, but most of the testing takes place during pregnancy. On the one hand, youâre providing more and more opportunities to get information about the genetic content of an embryo or a fetus, and on the other hand, we have this massive attempt to regulate pregnancy, so you canât do anything with the information. Part of itâs whatâs going on in genetics. Part of itâs whatâs going on in the ART market. I donâtâthereâs probably not enough attention being paid to contraceptives. Thereâs a lot of research being done in contraceptives in the world of contraceptives, so new forms of contraception will come onto the market. KWON: Can you give us a sneak-peek of whatâs coming? IKEMOTO: (laughs) No, Iâm not a science person in that sense, but itâs only come on the table because of the fight about the Affordable Care Act and whether or not that should be an essential health benefit, part of the health package that employers regularly cover. But it looks like now thatâs going to be a fight. It has been a fight for the past couple of years. Contraceptives seems like old hat, but itâs coming back. So thatâs back on the table. KWON: And before you were talking a little bit about globalization of the market for reproductive technologies. IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because the reproductive technologies and the geneticâI assume the genetic testing stuff is, well, to some extent it isâyou can go to different jurisdiction to obtain access to any of these technology uses. The U.S., and California in particular, is both a major destination spotâso a lot of people come here to use these technologies, in large part because theyâre freelyâtheyâre as available as the market makes them here. We have few regulations that restrict access to them. And then a lot of people from the U.S., because those technologies are expensive here, they go to other countries, and so people are traveling from and to countries all over the world. KWON: What are some of those destinations for U.S. people, who are seeking out cheaper alternatives? IKEMOTO: It shifts. It depends onâbecause the marketâs shifting. So Mexicoâs a destination. I think Argentinaâs positioning itself to become one, because I think they just passed a surrogacy law. South Americaâs opening up. Latin Americaâs opening up. In Europe, Spain and Eastern Europe are really big. Thereâs a lot in Asia. Japanâs very restrictive, so people from Japan going out. Part of it depends on who restricts it, where the technology is feasible, what the cost factors are. KWON: Because it seems like it needs to balance, because you need a certain level of development that you have the technology to do itâ IKEMOTO: Yeah, and you have to have the experts. KWON: But you canât be so developed that itâs expensive. IKEMOTO: Yeah. Exactly. So itâs justâpeople are moving all over the place. South Africaâs a destination. And people go to different countries for specific things. Indiaâs received a lot of attention for its surrogacy market. KWON: Right. Iâve seen those pictures of Indian women just sitting in a row. Itâs very weird and Brave New World. IKEMOTO: Yeah, exactly. But a lot of people in theâcome to the U.S. for surrogacy as well. KWON: Oh, okay. IKEMOTO: Yeah. I think people go toâif youâre White, you go to Eastern Europe, Spain. People from all over come to the U.S., because we have diversity here. So if youâre looking for a âparticular colorâ baby, then you shop on that basis. But you can take your embryos with you and undergo in vitro fertilization or surrogacy somewhere else. Yeah. KWON: So instead of traditional [surrogacy], itâd be gestational surrogacy. IKEMOTO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So itâs really crazy. KWON: Yeah. Are there any racial orâI mean, Iâm sure thereâs class conflictsâ but isnât it weird to have a white couple come in to an Indian woman and have her have a white child? Isnât that kind ofâ IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But itâs also the privilege of the people from England, say, going to India, where the amount that the woman can make being surrogate is greater than the amount of money she can make doing anything else, if she lacks a lot of formal education and if she wants to support her kids and her family, then thatâs the best economic opportunity. So theyâre in a sense taking advantage of the limited opportunities for women in that country to get cheaper surrogacy. KWON: Yeah, butâbecause Iâve heard the opposite argument that people justify their actions saying, âOh, itâs her choice to do it, and sheâs earning money.â IKEMOTO: âIâm helping them outâ KWON: Exactly. Itâs an independent woman making her own money, and she can put it in her own bank accountâ IKEMOTO: Yeah, and I think, I think thatâs true as a matter of fact. KWON: It is. IKEMOTO: Yeah. And thereâs some Iâve heardâsome people sayâwell, they come to the U.S., because weâre better at the technology, but the price tag attached to it signifies that itâs also better in quality. So some people are actually willing to pay more, because they think it connotes a better outcome or something. KWON: How many of the people in our world are using these technologies? IKEMOTO: I donât know. I donât know. I know the U.S. measures for the industry, which look at the revenues generated. Itâs a multi-billion dollar [industry] within the U.S., but the numbers, I donât know. The numbers globally, I donât know. Thereâs a European organization, which tracks some technology use. Thereâs some studies in Canada, which have tracked it, and there isâyou can get some data in the U.S. through the CDC, Centers for Disease Control. But then you still have to make some inferences and jumps about it. But itâs still increasing. KWON: Oh, wow. Because I havenât met a test tube baby friend yet [in] my generation. IKEMOTO: Oh, really? KWON: Yeah. At least I havenât, or theyâve never disclosed it to me. IKEMOTO: Maybe thatâs the difference. KWON: But I know weâre talking about it all the time. These issues come up, and âOh, this neighbor had a child via in vitro fertilization,â and they would talk about it, but I just havenât met a kid my age yet whoâs done that. So maybe itâs a little youngerâmaybe itâs a different generation. IKEMOTO: Maybe. It also might beâitâs a lot of people now donât tell their kids. So it might be that theâand my guess is that it was more true 20 years ago than it is now. So it might be that you are sitting next to a test tube baby, but you donât know. But the use of itâs increased over the years, so itâs much more likely now thatâof the kids being born now, that some form of technology was used than it was 20 years ago. But 20 years ago, that was late nineties, so . . . right? Early to mid-nineties. KWON: Yeah, because I was born in â91 soâ IKEMOTO: Oh my god. KWON: Early nineties. IKEMOTO: At least you were born in the 20th century. So it was definitely being used then. Surrogacy, the servicingâgestational surrogacy, there was a clear market for that. In vitro fertilization, definitely. There was an egg market then, although itâs much much bigger now. There was definitely a sperm market. Yeah. KWON: I want to talk a bit about the egg and sperm market, too. Because even in the Brown Daily Herald, which is our newspaper, thereâs articles that says âSAT 2100ââ IKEMOTO: How much are they offering? KWON: They were offering eight thousand to ten thousand [dollars] for Ivy League students, fit, Asian, woman. And I was looking at it, and Iâm like, âI could make ten thousand dollars.â IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thereâs a premium on Asian eggs, because thereâs relatively few donors and people are coming from overseas. KWON: Oh. So itâs Asian couples looking for Asian eggs. IKEMOTO: Yeah, primarily. As far as I know, as far as I know. Thatâs it, and people from other countries as well as in the U.S. So thereâs high demand, and the prices go up with demand for eggs. KWON: And thatâs a little weird. IKEMOTO: It is weird. It is weird because itâs trait pricing. The industry rhetoric is that no, weâre paying for time and energy contributed to this, but the pricing is based on traits of the donors. KWON: Because they give like a list of requirements. Theyâre like clean medical history and this and that. Itâs just a little weird, because theyâre looking for Asian womenâAsian eggs. IKEMOTO: Yeah, and thereâs separate eggs for like Jewish eggs, everything you could think of as well. If you wanted to do something fun on the way back on the train, get onâor google California Cryobank, because thatâs one of the biggest sperm banks in the world. KWON: Crail bank? IKEMOTO: Cryobank. California Cryobank. KWON: How do you spell the second word? IKEMOTO: C-R-Y-O-B-A-N-K. KWON: Okay. IKEMOTO: So itâs a sperm bank. Their marketing will astonish you. KWON: Is it profiles of people with pictures? IKEMOTO: Yeah, yeah. You can also do celebrity look-alike donors. KWON: Why is that necessary?! IKEMOTO: (laughs) I . . . I donât know. KWON: Itâs so weird. IKEMOTO: It is. Thatâs how crazy it is. KWON: Is there a gender difference between sperm donors and egg donors? IKEMOTO: Yeah, so Rene Almeling has done a great work on this. Sheâs a sociologist at Yale. Sheâs interviewed both the banks and also people whoâve done itâand thereâs alsoâthereâs Jennifer Haylett is a grad student here [in the Department of Sociology at UC Davis], and sheâs done really interesting work. Jenniferâs done work showing that as you go thereâs an elaborate screening process for most sperm and egg banks, and the screening process serves to get them information to decide whoâs going to be appropriate, but it also is a socialization process for those who are providing them. So in a sense theyâre helping you figure out how to think about what youâre doing if youâre becoming an egg donor or a sperm donor. So sperm donorsâthis is Rene Almelingâs workâcharacterize their work asâor characterize sperm donation as âwork,â as like a job. Thatâs what guys do, they go to work (laughs). But egg donors are much more likely to frame it in altruistic terms. Theyâre helping somebody. Itâs a âgift.â Itâs a gift of life or a gift of family. Even though theyâre receiving a lot more money than sperm donors and theoretically, theyâre going through a lot more risk and time and work than [men] are. But itâs gendered. KWON: Wow. IKEMOTO: Yeah, the way itâs presented to the public and the way itâs presented to those who are participating in it is very gendered. KWON: I actually didâmy paper was on that. It was about framing surrogacy as a choice, so not egg donation, surrogacy for traditional surrogates and then gestational surrogate. And how it used to be that privileged white women would do it for their sisters or their neighbors, and they would do it for free but then receive monetary compensation after the fact, as a thank you. And then now itâs still framed as a choice, these women still do it as a choice, and then ignoring the class and the racial impacts that the gestational surrogates go through. Yeah, so itâs interesting and freaky. IKEMOTO: And I heard theâthereâs been a lot of news coverage about the surrogacy agencies are targeting military wives. KWON: Oh, Iâve heard that too. IKEMOTO: Yeah. And I havenât seen anything about the numbers, but it makes sense because if youâre going be in a place for a year, what kind of career could you build? You could register for school, but then youâre going to have to transfer soâand if youâve got kids, then you can stay at home. KWON: Right, and then just the money itself. IKEMOTO: Yeah, and youâre contributing to the familyâs income, so theyâre healthâthey tend to be healthy, young. KWON: Do you think that marketâs going to only further expand? IKEMOTO: As far as I know, there doesnât seem to be any great push to stop surrogacy. And I think itâs beingâso many celebrities are so open about it, in a sense, theyâve helped make it acceptable. KWON: Oh. You mean that theyâre using surrogates? IKEMOTO: Yeah. Yeah. KWON: Do you think it will ever get to the point where the fear that a lot of people have is that you know rich people will use other women to just have babies so that it doesnât affect their figure or they donât have to go through the painâ IKEMOTO: I donât know. I know people were talking about that in the 1980s, you know, what this was going to do wasâyou couldâitâs a subcontracting model, right? KWON: Yeah. IKEMOTO: You could contract that out. I donât know. Because thereâs also a glamorization of pregnancy, too. Kind of a valorization of women whoâve gone through birth, and then you know in the celebrity world, not only gone through birth but gotten their figures back too. KWON: (laughs) BeyoncÃ©. IKEMOTO: Yeah, exactly. So I donât know. I think together what they form is this idea that this push for women as mothers, and maybe thereâs different kinds of mothers now, but thatâs still being held up as the most important role [for women to fulfill]. KWON: And then jumping back to the Asian American women, whatâs the utilization of ART for the Asian American community? IKEMOTO: Oh. Well, as egg donors, and I assume for sperm donors too, although I havenât checked that. You can checkâwhen you go through the sperm banks, you can narrow down your search by race and ethnicity. Asianâs definitely on there. So I assume theyâre recruiting for Asian sperm donors, but egg donors even more so, because you see those targeted ads, and thenâyeah Iâm notâI assume that, and Iâm assuming this, I havenât seen any data, because you canât really get the data, that if you think about who can afford this, then at least a certain segment of the Asian American population has enough wealth to use these technologies and fit the profile of those who might want to. And I certainly know on an anecdotal basis people who have, but I donât know of anyâ KWON: numbers? IKEMOTO: Yeah, I donât have numbers or trends. KWON: Thatâs interesting. Why do they not collect any data on it? Is it just a privacy issue or the companies keep their data? IKEMOTO: Yeah. The CDC requires that fertility clinics report what they call success rates, and by that they mean, lives births. So they have to report the number of IVF cycles, whether or not surrogacy was used, source of the eggs. But they donât have to report any demographic information. Yeah. KWON: Oh, okay. So race and everythingâs left out. IKEMOTO: Right, right. KWON: Because that would be an interestingâ IKEMOTO: Yeah, sure would. KWON: thing to look at. IKEMOTO: The only other way to go about it would be to look to see who the agencies are marketing to. And they have becomeâthey started to become more multiracial, and there are niches. Yeah, there are niches. KWON: Because I know in Dorothy Robertâs book [Killing the Black Body], she goes through the fertility clinicsâand she wrote it in â99 so it was awhile agoâbut she says that all the fertility clinicsâ images and front pages of their homepages are white babies with blue eyes. IKEMOTO: Yeah, yeah, and I think to a large extent thatâs still true, but Iâmy guessâwell, the ones Iâve seen there are some, and I think theyâre sort of niche clinics. So there are some that are aiming at the so-called âGaybies,â so theyâre set up for gay and lesbian couples, and some are set up for multiracial families or more diverse communities than that. But the mainstream is stillâitâs white babies on the front web page. KWON: Yeah, it was a little creepy. I was looking through different websites, and Iâm from the Midwest, so I was looking through local Minnesota fertility clinics. IKEMOTO: Oh, yeah. KWON: (simultaneously) All whiteâ IKEMOTO: (simultaneously) All white. KWON: families with all white babies. Yeah. IKEMOTO: Yeah, so I think if you go to LA, New Yorkâ KWON: Bigger cities. IKEMOTO: Yeah. San Francisco, then youâre going to find those niche markets. And globally, youâll find them as well. KWON: What aboutâwhat did you call them? Gayâ IKEMOTO: Gaybies. That was what term that was being used for a while for clinics that were going for that market. KWON: Yeah. They mix those namesââgayâ with like everything: Gaysian, Gaybies. But with the recently supreme court ruling, do you think that marketâs also going expand for gay and lesbian couples? IKEMOTO: Yeah, I mean gay and lesbian couples have been having couples without marriage, but I think the marriage will help validate that use, and it might makeâit might help pry open the doors of some of the clinics. Because some clinics have been saying, No. KWON: Donât some countries also have restrictions? IKEMOTO: Yeah, yeah, and that might change. So in a sense, it might validate gay family formation. So maybe itâll expand it, but I think itâll also, like I said, hopefully help reduce some of the exclusion from some of the clinics. Weâll see. KWON: I mean, personally from within my family, my family would not be okay with me being a surrogate mother or donating eggs. Is there an Asian cultural thing, too? I know Iâve seen some articles on stuff like that, but I donât know. IKEMOTO: Yeah. I donât know. For one thing, it depends onâit probably depends on which Asian culture youâre talking about. So itâs really hard, because weâre soâ KWON: diverse. IKEMOTO: Yeah, diverse just within the category of Asian. I think itâs really hard to say. I think probably to the extent that now such a huge percentage of Asian Americans are first or second generation, and just in that sense, may be less willing to accept the idea of being a surrogate being an egg donor, that might be true. Otherwise, I donât know, because even the religious diversity within the communities isâ KWON: Itâs pretty one end to the other. IKEMOTO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Itâs all over the place. So I donât know. A reporter asked me thatâwas it last year or the year before, because LA Times did a storyâooh, itâs 4:07PMâon the Asian egg market. KWON: Maybe Iâll look that article up. IKEMOTO: Yeah, they just did this human-interest piece, because they had noticed the ads or something like that, too. KWON: Yeah, theyâre a little creepy. IKEMOTO: I bet. We want your eggs. So what feels creepy about it? KWON: I guess the fact that itâs an Asian woman. IKEMOTO: That itâs so specific? KWON: Yeah, that itâs in a school newspaper was a little weird too. So itâs next to student articles and local pizza places, and then it says, âSeeking Asian Female Eggs.â And Iâm like, âWhat is this?! This is so disturbing.â Yeah, the fact that it was targeted towards Asian women becauseâ IKEMOTO: And thatâs noticeable. KWON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And on top ofâand then Iâm super race hypersensitive, and so Iâm like, âIs this analogous to classified ads looking for Asian women as you know submissive partners? What is this for? I donât understand.â IKEMOTO: Because what they want is your race, right? They want a racial identity. KWON: Itâs always at the top. Itâs Asian Female, and then they list the SAT scores they want and all the other things like that. Itâs like, Oh wow. I could do this but seems just a little weird. Yeah. Just a little weird. IKEMOTO: Yeah. I bet. I bet. Yeah, I ask my students. I go, âWhere do you see the most ads?â and they say Craigslist. So I guess theyâre all over Craigslist. KWON: For eggs? IKEMOTO: Yeah. Yeah. KWON: Thatâs interesting. My friends always show me the article, and theyâre like, âHey Juhee, make ten thousand dollars,â and they joke about it. IKEMOTO: Still creepy? KWON: Yeah, itâs still a little creepy. Do you think thatâs like the future? Where do you think everythingâs headed? IKEMOTO: I donâtâoh, thatâs a good question. Where I think everything is headed. Well, I donât even want toâso to me it would be pessimistic to think that weâre going in that direction, where everything is totally free market, anything goes. Because my version of the market is that all these social categories will govern the market. That itâsâmarketâs not a neutral place, and in a sense it will exacerbate all the racial and gender selections that we already have. So I donât want to be that pessimistic and think that thatâs where itâs going. (pauses) I donât know. I guess the most promising parts of it to me have been in family formation by gay and lesbian couples. The use of ARTs there, because in that sense, the use of ARTs has had a liberatory effect. I think itâs important to think about how do you use these technologies in a way that enhances relationships and communities at the same time? I guess thatâs sort of the counter to the market for me. KWON: The bright side. IKEMOTO: But I donât know which oneâs going win. Itâll probably just evolve into something completely different. Some new technology will come up. KWON: Yeah. You can check back like ten years from now. IKEMOTO: Yeah. Itâll turn out like completely wrong. KWON: Yeah, well, thatâs all the questions I have, soâ IKEMOTO: Okay. Good. KWON: Yeah, if we could justâI actually brought a camera, so if we could take a photo and thenâ IKEMOTO: Oh, god. I shouldâve worn something else. KWON: Oh, itâs okay. Let me justâ..
