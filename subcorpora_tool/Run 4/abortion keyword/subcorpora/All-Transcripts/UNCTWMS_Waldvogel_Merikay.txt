 Jennifer Donnally: Good morning. This is Jennifer Donnally, and today is Thursday, May 27th, and I am in downtown Knoxville in the St. Oliver Hotel interviewing, could you introduce yourself? Merikay Waldvogel: Merikay Waldvogel. M-E-R-I-K-A-Y. I always have to spell it; it&#8217;s one word. Waldvogel, W-A-L-D-V-O-G-E-L. JD: Sounds wonderful. So my first question for you is going way back. It&#8217;s where did you grow up and what was your childhood like? MW: I grew up in St. Louis. I was born in 1947. It was a suburban Midwest childhood. Went to a fabulous high school built right after World War II. I had very good education: math, science. Although, when I chose college [I studied liberal arts]. I was [the oldest] of four children. My mother was from Minnesota. My father was right there from St. Louis and he had built his own house. It was an acre around it and woods. Civil rights, how that affected me right then, I graduated from high school in [19]65. Kennedy was assassinated in [19]62. That really had a big impact on me. Sargent Shriver had announced the Peace Corps, and I wanted to join the Peace Corps and serve the country. I had a very strong background with Girl Scouts, resourcefulness; I had leadership training; I had excelled in things like I got onto the Honor society my junior year in high school; I was elected [secretary] of the student council. Our high school was huge; there were twelve hundred people in my class. There were things a little like sororities, or you could call them Y groups, but I didn&#8217;t want to be a part of that. [I was] raised in a Presbyterian church. I always was chosen to be the leader. I went through [camp counselor-in-training] through the Girl Scouts, and I was chosen to go to Roundup. It was a big, huge event out in Idaho. It was my senior year of high school. People had looked up to me for leadership, and in a way, I didn&#8217;t understand why they were doing that. But, that was the beginning. I was the oldest. So anyway, I went against what my parents wanted me to do. My father wanted me to go to Washington U[niversity] and be an engineer, Washington U in St. Louis. I wanted to go away, and I chose, on my own, a small, Midwestern [Presbyterian] liberal arts school in western Illinois, Monmouth College. There, I realized right way that I had probably made a mistake [be]cause I didn&#8217;t have a really big world view. At the time, this was Vietnam and a lot of people from the East Coast were coming to Midwestern liberal arts schools because, the men especially, if you weren&#8217;t in school, you went to Vietnam. Then, when they got there, if you didn&#8217;t excel and you failed classes--. I mean, there&#8217;s always that hanging over your head, the boys, they would go to Vietnam. One of my boyfriends did flunk out, we called it then, and he went into the military, but he served in Germany. Anyway, I decided this was probably too small [a] school for me. There were sororities there. I did join a sorority [laughter], one of the worst [decisions I made]. Anyway, I joined a sorority. But then I went, and [learned] we didn&#8217;t have blacks in our sorority, [and] we had one Jewish woman in our sorority. I went, my junior year, to France. While I was gone, there was a big uprising about the sorority system. I wasn&#8217;t around for that. When I came back, a lot of my friends deactivated and left. When I came back, my senior year, I went to student teach in Chicago. I was in an urban studies program. The idea was to work eight weeks in student teaching in a middle-class, upper-[class] high-achieving school system, school district, a high school, then contrast it with an inner-city high school. So I taught French at Bowen High School and then I taught French also at Wendell Phillips High School. At Wendell Phillips High School, that&#8217;s where Nat King Cole went, and the very first day I was there, I was on a bus with students going to a football game on the north side of Chicago and a gun was pulled on the school bus, and I was in charge. Also, I was living in Hyde Park [on the South Side]. The idea was to give us an urban experience. I was living in the Hyde Park Hotel. Julian Bond had just moved out. The Democratic Convention had just ended when we moved in, in late August. Julian Bond and his whole group had moved out of our hotel, so there was a lot of electric excitement about civil rights, the Vietnam War, justice, all that was in the background. In my junior year in France [in 1968], France closed down. I was there, and there was this big&#8230; JD: &#8230;Student uprising&#8230; MW: &#8230;student uprising and I was right in the middle of it. I had to escape, get out. The letters I have from that time are amazing, my first-hand written letters back to my parents. Anyway, I ended up coming back to Monmouth, senior year, and decided, &#8220;What am I going to do now [when I graduate]?&#8221; I really had no--as a woman at that time--employment. This is when the women&#8217;s movement begins to hit me. I could be a secretary, a teacher, a social worker, maybe, or I could go to the Peace Corps. Well, I decided to go on to graduate school, and I went to [the] University of Michigan. I eventually entered a program in English, in linguistics. Again, at the time, Michigan was the place for linguistics. Well, George Lakoff, Robin Lakoff [were my professors]. Studying linguistics was edgy. At the same time, Kent State happened while I was there, [pause] SDS had been founded there [University of Michigan]. I think that&#8217;s correct. The ROTC building was burned while I was there. I was [working] right next door to it. All this was going on. Okay, so I ended up getting a degree in English as a second language. I knew that I needed to have something tangible that I could go off and work with, get a job with, and I was also thinking about the Peace Corps. But I had also realized that, working back at Wendell Phillips [High School], there were a lot of things in Chicago I could work on and have an impact. So, I ended up going to Chicago and I taught in the public schools, English as a second language. In the beginning, it was [at an] elementary school on the north side, right near Wrigley Field. My roommates were all involved with the School of the Art Institute, just a wild, wonderful time. I ended up teaching at a high school a little farther north called Senn High School. There were at that time, five bilingual programs. This is from [19]71 to about [19]76. Anyway, my point was I was having a great time, very involved. I felt like, at least my life, the way I was living was [pause] authentic or something. I met this man, Jerry Ledbetter, and he was from St. Louis, and he knew my best friend, Marcia Hall. She was my best friend from growing up. Eventually, Marcia got married; I was the maid of honor in their wedding. My husband was the best man, so that&#8217;s how we met. He had gone to school at the University of Missouri. He was an engineer. He had not gone to Vietnam, and he was on his career path. He had been to Virginia, State of Virginia, working as an engineer in water [and] wastewater. So, he got a job in Knoxville and he said, &#8220;Come with me. Leave Chicago,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No way am I going to the South." In my mind, the South was red clay and dirt, hot, and I did have this nasty feeling about it being the place where a lot of civil rights things, or protests, had gone on. He said, &#8220;Oh, come on. Just come one time,&#8221; so I flew down. It was in October -- the leaves were still on; it was still green. He met me at the airport and we drove directly to the mountains. We were going to camp. I remember walking off the plane; I remember walking down the steps and this humidity and the greenness enveloped me. I loved it from the minute I set foot here. I could not believe how different it was. Where I thought it was going to be red clay, it was green. So we went off to the mountains that weekend and I really liked it. That summer after school ended, I came and spent the summer with him. I went to Arrowmont, The School of Arts and Crafts over in Gatlinburg. Ooh, boy, that&#8217;s the beginning of some of my women&#8217;s history interest. I had learned how to weave in Chicago, so when I came here, I realized, &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; There were all these women&#8217;s co-ops in the mountains. Then I could go to school at Arrowmont. Turns out, the two [weaving] teachers I had [at Arrowmont] for two weeks were from Chicago. The major grand-dame of weaving, Elsa Regensteiner, was teaching. Elsa Regensteiner was teaching that summer and I got into the class, and I spent two weeks weaving with fifty women and fifty looms. It was like going to camp, but it was adult camp in the mountains and everything. I did go back to Chicago in the fall. I started teaching, six weeks I was there, still at Senn High School and then I decided &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Knoxville,&#8221; so I moved to Knoxville. What am I going to do now? I went to the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center; they had a program called the Job Club. I read about it in the paper and the idea sounded like what I needed: change careers--how a person can change a career looking at the skills that they have that may or may not be connected to their degree. See, my degree was a B.A. in French from Monmouth and I had a teaching certificate that went along with that. Then, at Michigan, it was an M.A. in linguistics, with the E.S.L., English as a second language component. So, I came to Knoxville and at the time, I wanted to do something different. My husband had a job, an engineering job. JD: Were you guys married at this point? MW: We weren&#8217;t; we got married the next summer, [19]78. He was working in an air pollution [pause]--Carborundum was the name of the company, and he had a decent job, decent income. I felt like I could be a little bit more flexible; I could take a little bit of time to think about what I really wanted to do with the rest of my life. So I took this class, this Job Club, and the book was What Color Is Your Parachute? It&#8217;s still around. I was fascinated by it. I met people in that group that I still know today. That was in 1976 -- no, it was [19]77; it was fall of [19]77 when I moved here and I took that class. Well, Shukran Kamal was the executive director at that point. I was so impressed with [Shukran Kamal]. And see, she was [pause], she had learned English. I was impressed with her English; she was a translator, she was Arabic; she was--I thought she was breaking the mold for being an Arab woman, but I&#8217;m not sure now, now that I know a lot more about Arab women. She had come here with her husband, and here she was at the Women&#8217;s Center as the director. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s because we clicked right away or that leadership thing clicked in, but they were looking for a program director, associate director, and so I applied. A couple other people in that class applied and they gave me the job. I thought, &#8220;Wow!&#8221; Here I am; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d been [in Knoxville] more than four weeks and I had this new job and it was pretty open-ended. At this point, the Women&#8217;s Center did have the work program which was government funded and it was always part of the umbrella of the Women&#8217;s Center, but it was on its own and there was a director of that. The government money, the CETA money that was funding that was overseen by Shukran. Shukran Kamal had to sign off on all the contracts and oversee it and write the project, but we didn&#8217;t--I&#8217;m not sure we got much overhead from it. So, my job was filling a vacuum. It was to offer programs to the community at large about women, promoting women, women&#8217;s job issues and things like that. That work program, Women&#8217;s Opportunity and Referral of Knoxville is what it was called, the original name. That was for low-income women. You had to have a [pause] pretty low income to be accepted into it. The Job Club was supposed to be a similar program for women who&#8230; JD: &#8230;Had college degrees? MW: Yeah, so I oversaw the Job Club, which happened two or three times a year, but there was plenty of time in between for me to fill in. So, I did the newsletter, which was called EVERYWOMAN. I [was] the editor and I over[saw it]. That came out every month and we always had articles on women&#8217;s health, women&#8217;s employment, [and] the arts. The covers of EVERYWOMAN are really interesting because we always tried to get an artist to do them early on. That newsletter was put together by Jane LaDain. I don&#8217;t think she was ever paid, but she was the person who had my job right before I did. Boy, I wish you could talk to her. She had a passion for this, for women&#8217;s rights, just women. She was from Wisconsin. She&#8217;s still alive, but when she left here, Alzheimer&#8217;s was coming on, and that was about ten years ago. Oh, and she adored me and she wanted me to succeed. I remember when I got married the next summer, she decided--my mother had died in 1973, and it was hard; it was hard for me to get married in a place I didn&#8217;t know and away from my mother. She knew; she knew what the problem was and she said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to go buy fabric for your dress,&#8221; and that&#8217;s what--my mother would have done that too. We weren&#8217;t going to buy a dress. She said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go do it.&#8221; Together, she helped me put together this wedding and people from the Women&#8217;s Center came. All my new friends came to that wedding. It was in the back yard of the house that Jerry and I had been living in. People today remember going to that wedding and they didn&#8217;t really, they hadn&#8217;t known me for a long time. I felt really at home here right away. It offered me an opportunity to do things that I had seen going on in Chicago [pause]. Well, Women&#8217;s Kaleidoscope was a TV program that we did [in] Knoxville at the St. John&#8217;s Episcopal Church. [They] had a community TV program called Channel 20 Community TV. It&#8217;s still going on. It&#8217;s now located in the Andrew Johnson Hotel. Reading back through some of the information, like in Jane Weeks&#8217; document she wrote, she said that Marge Gregg actually videotaped or filmed one of the earliest meetings. It&#8217;s supposedly archived at Channel 20. We&#8217;re talking [19]74, 1974-75. So anyway, they were looking for programs, so I was the [laughter]--. It was like a little Oprah program. I could invite who I wanted to sit at the sofa. I interviewed Wilma Rudolph, the Olympic runner. I interviewed Pat Summitt, Pat Head back them, the women&#8217;s basketball coach, along with some of the Lady Vols players. The [Lady Vols were new]. It [was] the second or third year that they&#8217;d even been in existence. I&#8217;d love to see those [tapes]. They say that they&#8217;re archived somewhere. So I sat there and asked questions, bantered back and forth. Maybe Phil Donohue&#8217;s show was going on then in Chicago. I thought, &#8220;Oh, I could do this like Phil Donahue.&#8221; Then, there was [pause] a conference. We decided we&#8217;d have an annual conference and we called it Wider Opportunities for Women. The first one was held at the Methodist church on Henley. We invited people from the community to have little workshop sessions. It was modeled on something that was going on at TVA with their Federally Employed Women project. [We] ended up doing it almost every year, and sometimes there was a theme to it, like women in business; sometimes it was women and health. Right before I left in [19]82, we did a women&#8217;s race, a road race. I had started running. I&#8217;m about thirty-two years old at this point, and I decided I would start running. And I got interested in doing 10K races, so I thought, &#8220;Well, why doesn&#8217;t the Women&#8217;s Center have one?&#8221; All these men were racing. Sometimes it&#8217;s men and women, but, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we have a women-only race?&#8221; So we organized it and I realized it was pretty hard to do. I always had to do these things and then I&#8217;d learn the details. A lot of these things were not so good because the Knoxville Track Club handled all the races and we were doing our own. It was like they sat back to watch us not succeed very well. Not fail, but we were having fun. Anyway, I&#8217;m not sure they ever did the women&#8217;s race again. Well, one thing my husband wanted me to be sure to mention was this mural on the side of the building. I don&#8217;t know if anybody has mentioned that. [Laughter] JD: They have. MW: I looked for pictures of it. It was Jane LeDain&#8217;s idea. We moved into the Ely Building, and it&#8217;s still there; it&#8217;s at 406 Church Street. It was a two-story building and the basement was called The Letter Shop. Everybody downtown would go there and get their printing done, their envelopes and their printing. Then, on the first floor was a lawyer&#8217;s office, Myron Ely. On the top floor--I&#8217;m not sure what was up there, but the building was eventually was-- Mr. Ely died. No, when I was in there he was still alive. But anyway, the church, St. John&#8217;s Episcopal Church owned the building eventually, so we were paying rent to St. John&#8217;s Episcopal Church and they let Mr. Ely stay in his office. He had a big roll-top desk and there were all kinds of cool things in the basement. Well, Shukran Kamal left about 1980 to go to the D.C. area to set up a translating service. Then I became the executive director, so my office was right next to Mr. Ely&#8217;s. It gave me a taste of Knoxville, downtown old-time Knoxville. Anyway, on the side of the building was a parking lot and then there was the big Mann&#8217;s Funeral Home right next to it, and it also was owned by the church, St. John&#8217;s Episcopal. But, it was no longer a funeral home; it was VOA, Volunteers of America, so it was a place for homeless families. They primarily wanted families to stay there. So, here we were, the Women&#8217;s Center, right next to this--you&#8217;d call it a homeless shelter today, but it was lavish inside this old funeral home. So we often worked with them. We worked closely with Volunteers of America, but we wanted to beautify our building. So, it was Jane LeDain&#8217;s idea. She gets a grant application from the Tennessee Arts Commission and we get the grant to have a contest for this mural. See, I loved it because back in Chicago when I was there, the Spanish community was putting up murals all over the south side, on the sides of their buildings, in Hyde Park and around southwest Chicago. I was fascinated with them, all the symbolism. I never did actually paint on them, but here was a women&#8217;s mural that we could do the same thing with. So they had the contest and a young man won. He was a student at UT. I should know a little bit more about that, but basically, it was four faces. Think of, like Mt. Rushmore [laughter], and there were four faces, and it was Wilma Rudolph, Eleanor Roosevelt--. Oh boy, Susan B. Anthony--I can&#8217;t remember them; I need to get a picture of it. So we accepted it and then we had to decide how we were going to paint it. We paid the student the money, but he wasn&#8217;t going to paint it. So Jane LeDain&#8217;s husband, Jane LeDain, my husband and me, we were the people who spent the most time. We put up this scaffolding. First, we painted it all a beige color and the colors were two, three shades of brown: a medium brown, a dark brown, and the beige background. Basically, all you had to do was draw a grid on it in pencil or whatever, and then sketch in and use--we had a big piece, big drawing of it with the same grid lines on it, and sketch in the outline and then you paint it in. It&#8217;s like silhouettes, and boy, it came out looking fabulous; we really loved it. It&#8217;s a huge space. I mean, it&#8217;s probably fifty feet or more than that. It was a really long space, but we got it done and it put the building on the map. When I left, it was still on there but at some point, the Women&#8217;s Center moved out of that building and went up to the Moses Center. The church tore down Mann&#8217;s Funeral Home and painted over our mural and made the parking lot nice. They charge now. It&#8217;s interesting that today, people don&#8217;t remember that at all. They don&#8217;t remember that the Women&#8217;s Center was in that building. Downtown has been revived and revitalized. There&#8217;s a man named Jack Neely who is the city historian; he knows everything. But when he writes about 406 Church Street, the Ely Building, he does not mention that the Women&#8217;s Center was there in the seventies. He might have been a high schooler at that point, and it didn&#8217;t connect with him at all, so I&#8217;ve always thought that that little bit of history downtown has been overlooked in that building, about what went on in that building. It was pretty exciting. Women came in there on the first floor; they would look for jobs on our job board; they might go upstairs to the work program and take classes up there. Eventually, the work program became the STIP program: Skills Training Improvement Program. We taught women electronics; those were a little higher level jobs than the work program jobs. They were always looking for jobs that were non-traditional and all that was going on, on the second floor. The first floor was a gallery space. Mr. Ely did move out, and I ended up decorating the downstairs with my quilts that I&#8217;ve been collecting, these antique quilts. In the beginning, it was a really nice-- it made it very homey; people felt at home coming in there. They always would ask--they had a story to tell about a quilt in their life. The very back room was the law library, so it had bookcases floor to ceiling and we had a women&#8217;s library in there. That&#8217;s where the board met. Lots of groups meet there; there were classes given there, everything from bartending to reflexology to massage to--. Of course, the Job Club met there. JD: Could I stop you for a second? I want to go back and ask a few questions. MW: Okay. JD: So were you involved in any women&#8217;s movement activities in Chicago? [sound break] You mention that you watched the path of it. I don&#8217;t know if you actually participated in any of the consciousness-raising groups when you were teaching? MW: No, it had just started. I took a class, or maybe I heard about a class called Assertiveness Training. JD: Okay, was that here? MW: No, in Chicago. JD: Okay. MW: I can&#8217;t visualize sitting in a group; it would be a consciousness-raising group. I can&#8217;t remember that. There&#8217;s my memory going [laughter]. No, but I was taking these weaving classes, so no, they weren&#8217;t consciousness-raising. So when I came here and when somebody came to the Women&#8217;s Center and wanted to give a class in assertiveness training, I said, &#8220;Right on. Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221; I wanted to experience it personally and I thought it would be fun. It would be a good thing for Knoxville or for the women in Knoxville. So no, I was not involved in women&#8217;s movement things, per se, at all. Chicago was pretty much still black-white issues and Vietnam by the time I left. Bilingualism was [a] really [big issue], but women&#8217;s issues, no. JD: Did you face any discrimination as a teacher? MW: Oh yes. Well, now wait, discrimination, sexual harassment, things like that? Or discrimination? JD: Discrimination in Chicago. MW: In Chicago, I was a member of the union, so I always felt like that was a good thing. Here were all these women teachers who were being supported by the union, and we went on strike a couple of times for higher wages. I probably made more money there than I&#8217;ve ever made in my life. I should go back and look at my social security thing, but I made very good money. I don&#8217;t know, fifteen thousand was my starting salary, and they had things like 401-Ks; they weren&#8217;t called that then, but I put lots of money in. I was making plenty of money to save. Discrimination, well, I thought it was odd that men were the principals. I thought that was odd. JD: Did men get paid more? MW: I don&#8217;t think so. I didn&#8217;t know that. I don&#8217;t think so, because there was a very strict pay scale. [The union] handed it out. You [had a pay schedule]; you knew if you entered here as a B.A. you were in Step 1 and you moved up. I had started out with a master&#8217;s. I was like, maybe two or three steps above other people and then I started going on. No, the pay was [equal]. But when I got here, I remember talking to Wanda; she was Wanda Glenn then, and she was real excited about this Women&#8217;s Center. She had young children and she couldn&#8217;t get a decent job. Well, she was raising her kids then, but then--and then she was really active in the ERA Amendment work. We realized that in a law school--well, she ended up going back to law school and getting--. We wanted to keep a list of women we could refer to, like a woman attorney, a woman gynecologist. There was, like, one each. It was amazing. Here [for the most part] the principals seemed to be they didn&#8217;t have the education degrees behind them. They were often coaches that were becoming assistant principals and then you get into that routine; you end up being principals. So, I was on the outside looking in. Here I was being employed by a women&#8217;s center, but what I was getting was reports from people about how the--and trying to get women jobs. It was hard. JD: I want you to comment a little bit about the apoliticism of the Women&#8217;s Center, and their decision not to take a stand on the ERA, to take any stand on any central women&#8217;s political issues such as abortion, the ERA. MW: I&#8217;m not sure when it hit me that that was what was going on. Whatever it is, thirty years hindsight, I might see it as the way people survive, the way people thrive or endure in an area where they are a minority in their political beliefs. You go ahead and you be nice, you connect with people, with people of opposing political views. There&#8217;s a lot of toleration. That&#8217;s what I realized in the South. Okay, let&#8217;s step back. In Knoxville, there were at least two abortion clinics at that point. You didn&#8217;t have to go back in the backwoods, and in Chicago, I could not have told you where the abortion clinic was, or an abortion clinic. But in Knoxville, there was the Center for Reproductive Health and then there Volunteer Clinic, and then there was another. There was a third one, but ten years earlier, it was not that way in Knoxville. I arrived when things had just switched, so there was an abortion clinic; there was an active chapter of National Organization of Women; there was a commission on the status of women for the state; there was Federally Employed Women; the Affirmative Action programs were in place. The federal laws were in place so that if you set up something in this community, even though the majority of the people didn&#8217;t think it was right, it was the law, so you just did it. Luckily, there were people with a lot of vision and good backing. [The McNabbs&#8217;] Center for Reproductive Health was a really, really fine clinic. Then [the] National Organization of Women was strong. The Women&#8217;s Center, or the board of the Women&#8217;s Center felt like all these things were in place. Let them handle the political issues. We&#8217;re going to provide programs that address the issues and try not to step on any people&#8217;s toes, but to move forward. We also wanted to be sure that the people coming in who we felt like needed the most help, who might also be either afraid of coming because they thought it was an abortion clinic or they thought it was one thing or another. We wanted them to come in. I think that is probably the reason we tried to steer a very straight, a just path. The government programs wouldn&#8217;t allow us, either, to be political. So I told you although the Women&#8217;s Center was an umbrella organization, the bulk of the funding at the point I was there was coming from the government and you couldn&#8217;t take stands on a political candidate. We decided we weren&#8217;t going to be a religious organization, so that was it. Now, the times when [pause], the time when I may have stepped over the line--. I stepped over the line and they said, &#8220;You&#8217;re on your own.&#8221; They were supportive, but, &#8220;You stepped over the line, Merikay.&#8221; But I felt like it was okay. It had to do with the Knoxville World&#8217;s Fair, the 1982 World&#8217;s Fair. It was an employment issue. Here was a very large construction project going to happen right within blocks of where we existed. We were on Church Street. They were talking about hiring thousands of construction workers, and here we had these women who&#8217;d been trained in all kinds of carpentry work and even electronics work. So, it looked like it was going to be a good place to get women jobs, so we met ahead of time with the people running the World&#8217;s Fair to be sure that they knew we were there and that we could--. They were looking for places that would provide employees. Most of the people who worked at the fair got their jobs through the Employment Security, which is the state employment office. Our CETA program, some of that funding came through that. It made sense that our people should be getting those jobs. So anyway, it looked like it wasn&#8217;t happening; the good jobs, the higher pay[ing] jobs weren&#8217;t going to the women, so we took a stand. I can&#8217;t remember all the details now, but I do remember Cheryl Humble was our attorney and she was on the board. She agreed to go with me and we were going to sit down at a table and clear the air and make sure that the officers at the World&#8217;s Fair knew. So we went over. I remember getting up in the morning; the newspapers had gotten word of it. I remember being in the shower and the phones started ringing. I didn&#8217;t want to make it confrontational. I was going in there to lay it on the table and say, &#8220;We can offer this; here we are.&#8221; Anyway, they started calling, and my husband would say, &#8220;She&#8217;s in the shower,&#8221; and hang up. It was very dramatic. Somebody from the News-Sentinel called; they wanted the inside story. I said, &#8220;Look, where are you going to be?&#8221; So, then the word got out where the meeting was going to be. So we went, and there were all these cameras, people wanting interviews; oh, it was bizarre. So Cheryl and I went inside. They closed the door and we went inside and sat at this table, and she pretty much led the discussion. We said, &#8220;You are required by law to hire women who have the skills; our women have the skills and we can do it.&#8221; Well, I don&#8217;t think it ever happened. Maybe a couple of women got jobs, but the whole World&#8217;s Fair thing was a little blown out of proportion anyway. The construction companies came with their own workers, so as far as new jobs were concerned in the construction phase, there weren&#8217;t that many, but it really gave the Women&#8217;s Center a name. Most people associated me with that one meeting. So, it was okay and I held my own; it was fine. I felt like I could--I was glad Cheryl was with me; she was on the board. People would come up and slap me on the back, &#8220;Right on!&#8221; you know, &#8220;Women&#8217;s rights,&#8221; and I was proud of it. But, the World&#8217;s Fair came and went. I left right before the World&#8217;s Fair started. The World&#8217;s Fair opened in May, and I left the Women&#8217;s Center in probably January of [19]82. I took a job with the Arts Council and it was helping artists, regional artists get their work in a sales situation close to the World&#8217;s Fair. I&#8217;ve always done that; I&#8217;ve always tried to do what&#8217;s right. That if something&#8217;s not right, I know that&#8217;s what&#8217;s always driven me. If it&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m not going to be afraid of what comes my way. So that might be the same reason. I can&#8217;t speak for the other people, but in this town there were other organizations that handled the prickly issues, and [they] did a much better job than the Women&#8217;s Center could do. We were really into helping people find jobs and being a referral service, a network point. Now, the interesting thing is, long after I left, when all these organizations--NOW is practically nonexistent, as far as I know right now. Everything is--I mean, the women&#8217;s movement, what, thirty years on, is much reduced in this town, and the Women&#8217;s Center never really took on those issues when the other programs faded away. Save the Night, with that Women Against Violence Against Women, we had one of those. Wanda was part of that too. The women college students got real involved in that. They&#8217;d go out and protest at night with candles. She had a program; we call it a PowerPoint today, but it was a slide show. Wanda had collected all these images in advertising, in publications and movies, of violent images of women selling products or whatever. One time she asked me to go. She spoke all over the Southeast, and she&#8217;d go to campuses. Once, I went to Florida State [University], in place of Wanda. She was probably in law school by that time. Well, I&#8217;m not sure, but anyway, she asked me to go. That was interesting because, boy, people really got--they wanted me to be angrier. They really wanted me to be angry. The student body was--I showed these pictures and I was reading from her script, but the passion, my passion; I was angry but I didn&#8217;t want to deal with it in front of this. My appearance had caused some uproar. It was odd; it was like the issue was being presented. I was the messenger and they wanted me to be saying something. I didn&#8217;t know exactly what to say, but I was with them; I didn&#8217;t know what to tell them to do. JD: What was the Center&#8217;s relationship to black women and the black community? MW: Ah, that&#8217;s a good question. Well, it was pretty strong. Lee Woody was an African-American woman who worked at TVA. She was president of our board at one point. When I went to work there, I was in a minority really. There were two women who were--well, the receptionist, Gail Robinson, was black, and then there was a woman named Vivian Robinson; she was the legal aid person [and] Joyce Johnson--. A lot of these women were single. They were all--oh, and then Thelma Strickland, oh my gosh, she has died. So, they were always employed and most of the women who were coming to the work program were black. A lot of them were black. Yeah, I liked that. I mean, I thought, &#8220;Wow!&#8221; [Recording fades as interviewee moves away, looking for a publication] I recorded the--hopefully, oh well, I don&#8217;t know where it is. We did one whole issue on black women, and then we did another one on single women. Here, [the] black women [EVERYWOMAN newsletter]. That&#8217;s Gail; that&#8217;s Thelma; she was in charge of the Private Industry Council, and Joyce Johnson, she was middle--what was her name? She didn&#8217;t stay that long. The image of black women [looking at publication], yeah. Anyway [pause], CETA [pause]. We had a lot of blacks. Knoxville has this other lower-class [of] white[s] from the mountains too. We&#8217;ve got that historically too. [The] percentage [of African Americans] is pretty low; it&#8217;s always been right around thirteen or fourteen percent of the population. But it was funny because they all seemed to know each other. It was so cool. Thelma was a great ambassador; she&#8217;d tell [people] if we got some new money or some new program was going to start, like the work program. She&#8217;d tell people, &#8220;Hey, you come on down to the Women&#8217;s Center. This is a great program.&#8221; For her to be our ambassador and she was just great. And Joyce Johnson, too, she was raising a single son. And Gail Robinson--these were all people who Jane Weeks and Emily [Passino] had met. I&#8217;m not sure how. Those are early on. I don&#8217;t know what happened. What I&#8217;m really speaking about is from [19]77, late [19]77 to early [19]82, so it&#8217;s about four-and-a-half years out of the, what, twenty-five, thirty year history? JD: Did the center ever do anything to outreach to lesbian women, or what were some of those issues? MW: We did not ever, I don&#8217;t think. Now that I think back on it, there probably were some gay women I knew, but nobody ever talked about it. On the board, nobody ever talked about it. I was looking through these [points to EVERYWOMAN Newsletters] last night and thinking, &#8220;Now the issue is gay rights and gay marriage.&#8221; Knoxville wasn&#8217;t into that then at all. I don&#8217;t know if there had been a federal law in place at that point. I don&#8217;t think there was, but there were plenty, it turns out there&#8217;s a sizeable gay community in this town. Again, it&#8217;s tolerance. If you get along well; if you do something that really adds to the community, the quality of life or whatever, what you do in your private life is your own business. I was really struck with that, the tolerance. I kept calling it tolerance, and somebody later--. When I first moved here, I thought, &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; Here I thought the Southeast was going to be intolerant; I thought it was going to be backwoods, and here I find [pause] better access to women&#8217;s services than I had in Chicago. I was always very fascinated with it. The Highlander Center is here. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard about the Highlander Center [and another program of] the women coal miners trying to get equity and get hired by the coal mines, Marie Cirillo, up in--. And then the [pause]--I was fascinated by it. Then, when I did get into quilts and really [had] to learn the history of the region in relation to quilts and women&#8217;s lives, I thought the region was so complex. You can&#8217;t simply answer questions, I guess, is what it is. It&#8217;s so complex because I&#8217;ve often thought that somebody like Al Gore losing in this state. A man who has deep, deep roots in Tennessee, or recently, even giving him an honorary degree at the University of Tennessee, and [his reception] was lukewarm. Here&#8217;s a [pause], it&#8217;s complex. There&#8217;s a bit of a mentality where people are afraid to demand their rights. I guess, getting back to [Al Gore], they voted against candidates who, in fact, champion their needs. They voted against candidates who would have [pause] supported what they needed. Right now, it seems so complicated on the national scene; the economy, health care, small grassroots organizations. I&#8217;m not sure the Women&#8217;s Center would ever exist today because we say maybe there&#8217;s not a need for it, but there is still need for it, women finding jobs. But, other agencies have stepped up and there&#8217;s more tradition now of seeing women in all kinds of positions. JD: I want to ask more questions, which is how did you get into quilts? MW: Well, in Chicago I started collecting them. There were no quilts in my family growing up, which people are always amazed at, so I didn&#8217;t have that. But when I went to Chicago I started collecting them, and the very first one I wanted to hang on the wall. I bought it because it was different. It had a little mystery to it; it wasn&#8217;t [pause] sugar-sweet, traditional patchwork. It had a broken edge on it and it looked like somebody had started it and somebody [else] finished it later, and the colors were brown and green on a white background. It was a typical little North Carolina lily pattern. But anyway, I right away started collecting other quilts for the fabrics. I was interested in weaving, so then, when I moved here I thought I had come to quilt heaven. But people were keeping their quilts in their families, and I started interviewing women about their quilts, quilts and their lives. I began writing right away. Some of the early articles, my very first quilt articles are written in EVERYWOMAN. I decorated that building with quilts. We had a seminar where we asked people to come and show their quilts. I brought a woman from Chattanooga, Betts Ramsey, to come up and be a speaker, and one thing led to another, and she and I ended up doing a survey of Tennessee quilts in the eighties. We wrote a book together called Quilts Of Tennessee and then it started getting some national attention. We documented; we saw fourteen hundred and twenty-five quilts on that survey of Tennessee, so it got me out into all these little communities and learning more about the history of Tennessee and women, in particular. Then I wrote a book on my own in 1990 called Soft Covers For Hard Times and it was to be one of the first exhibits at the Knoxville Museum of Art. They built the museum and they wanted a quilt exhibit, and they wanted it to travel around the country. It was on depression-era quilts, so I put in information about Arrowmont, the weaving schools, but it all had to have a quilt connection. It was an opportunity for me to bring out a grassroots side of quilts. I wanted it not to be sugar coated. I wanted to dig deeper into quilt history. Then I wrote a book about Chicago, the Chicago World&#8217;s Fair quilt contest. It was in connection with the 1933 Chicago World&#8217;s Fair. Barbara Brackman, from Lawrence, Kansas; she had been in Chicago teaching right before I left. So if the two of us had met. [Later we wrote a book, Patchwork Souvenirs of the 1933 World&#8217;s Fair]. [break in recording, with resumption of recording during discussion of new subject] The arc of that is that the Women&#8217;s Center here allowed me to do something; it broke my career path, which was at that time, teaching. It allowed me to realize I could do something on my own. I was always wanting to start a business of my own, but the risk of that always put me off. But, going off on my own, on writing and doing workshops, [pause] a lot of it came from the Women&#8217;s Center experience. And Knoxville has benefited a lot from that. They know me as &#8220;the quilt lady.&#8221; Some people do know me for the Women&#8217;s Center, but a lot of people look to Knoxville [because] we have wonderful quilt makers here too. American Quilters Society out of Paducah, Kentucky chose Knoxville for a convention and it&#8217;s held at the convention center. It was held last July, in 2009, and it will be held again this summer for two more summers. It brings in millions of dollars. I&#8217;m still looking for a museum somewhere. It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;ve thought of the Ely Building. I often think of the Ely Building and think--right now, it&#8217;s for sale for a million dollars. I thought, &#8220;If we could open a quilt museum&#8221; and it would be right there. We could set up archival files and boxes in the back room and have a little bit of gallery in the front. It would be a research center; people would come in and access information through computers. But that&#8217;s me speaking. I&#8217;ve mentioned Girl Scouts. I often ask women of my age, &#8220;Were you a Girl Scout?&#8221; and a lot of them were. Girl Scouts enabled us, made us realize that we could do things on our own. We could be resourceful and be successful at it, and they showed us how to do it. You divide up the tasks, distribute them, leadership qualities that are important, and that&#8217;s what was going on with the Women&#8217;s Center too. I mean, how could this organization come up with an idea from two women, Emily and Jane, and they did it. They put it together within two or three years and sent it on its way. Now, it changed over the years, but that&#8217;s the way it goes when you send off a non-profit organization run by women. The Women&#8217;s Center allowed women to even think that way. We weren&#8217;t entitled to really high-paying jobs at that point, but it allowed us to go ahead and do it. Even this idea of me thinking, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll set up a Quilt Center.&#8221; [Laughter] I&#8217;m not sure; I&#8217;m probably too old at, what, sixty-two now, that I wouldn&#8217;t--or is it sixty three? I guess it&#8217;s sixty-three. I feel like I don&#8217;t have the energy to do it, the passion. I probably still have the passion. And, backing up, one more thing I did [similar to] the World&#8217;s Fair protest. In about 1993, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. started licensing the quilts in their collection. They chose five quilts and they sold the license rights to a company in China, so they had women in China getting paid next to nothing, producing American quilts owned by the American people, and then, by the thousands. They sent the quilts back and they were sold in department stores around the country. The model for that caught on and importers were selling Amish quilts made in China, grandmother&#8217;s flower quilts made in China. Suddenly, it looked like American quilters were going to lose their jobs because these quilts were being sold for a hundred dollars. So anyway, a group here in Knoxville, we formed a group called The American Quilt Defense Fund. There were four of us, and one of the husbands had actually worked at the TVA and worked at the World&#8217;s Fair, and he said, &#8220;Merikay, remember back when you went to the World&#8217;s Fair? I said, &#8220;Hmm, yes,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to do that again, but I&#8217;m going with you.&#8221; So, he and I, Pete Claussen and I went to--he was going to sit there; I was going to be the Cheryl Humble this time. I was going to do the talking and he was going to sit there because he had opened the door. We hired a lobbyist and we got access to the undersecretary of the Smithsonian. The two of us went in there, sat at her desk, and there had been all these protests. Women quiltmakers had gone to the Congress; they had petitions; they were out on the Mall; they were angry that this was going on. They had gotten the people of the Smithsonian so angry they didn&#8217;t want to talk about it any more, so I said, &#8220;Quietly, I&#8217;m going to explain to you why these people are upset, and I&#8217;m upset, very upset.&#8221; So, we convinced them that they should stop the contract. They said, &#8220;Where are we going to get the quilts made in this country?&#8221; Well, that is the issue because people wanted cheap quilts, and to get them made here, it&#8217;s almost impossible to get them made at that price. So, we directed them towards a co-op in West Virginia, so they did give that co-op some business for a while, but it pretty much died out. They never did have any more Smithsonian quilts duplicated, but it still goes on, with quilts being made in China and sold cheaply in the United States. There was one particular quilt; it was called the Harriet Powers quilt. She was an African-American woman, freed slave, 1883; she made a Bible quilt and then she made a second Bible quilt. One Bible quilt is owned by the Boston Museum of Art and the second one was owned by&#8230; JD: &#8230;The Smithsonian? MW: The Smithsonian, and they duplicated that. I mean, it&#8217;s an iconic quilt. It looks like African figures, an African appliqu&#233;, and she had cut these figures out. There were people and snakes and flowers and things, and it was almost like a painting, and they sent it to China and they duplicated it exactly and sold five hundred copies. Now, ironically, today, if you own one of those five hundred, it&#8217;s worth several thousand dollars because it created such a stir and there were so few made. That, too, I learned from the World&#8217;s Fair experience. I also learned that it didn&#8217;t have much of an impact, but it&#8217;s important to say these things. It really is important because down the road, people remember it and they&#8217;ll think twice about overlooking women or American quilt makers or whatever. JD: Well, is there anything you&#8217;d like to add? MW: I&#8217;m looking at this. I don&#8217;t see anything [pause] else on there. I think that&#8217;s it. JD: Well, thank you so much for a fantastic interview. MW: Okay. Well, thank you...
