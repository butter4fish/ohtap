 Joey Fink: It&#8217;s May 13, 2011. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee. This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program and today I&#8217;m speaking with Wanda Sobieski in her office in downtown Knoxville. So, Ms. Sobieski, we did an interview with you before and we lost a little part of the end because the flash card ran out of room, but you had told us about growing up in Kansas and moving to Knoxville with your husband in 1971. Wanda Sobieski: Right. JF: So maybe we could start around there and you could tell me a little bit more about how you learned about the women&#8217;s movement in Knoxville and how you started getting involved with what was going on and what drew you in. WS: Well just before I came to Knoxville I lived in Vermont and I had sort of followed from afar the formation of Ms. Magazine, the formation of NOW, and found all of that interesting. So when I got here I checked around and I suspect the first group I actually contacted or made contact with was La Leche League because&#8212;. JF: Can you tell me what that is? WS: It&#8217;s a breastfeeding organization, support group for women, and I had a one-month-old son. Believe it or not it was pretty controversial to breastfeed back then. [Laughs] It was considered sort of strange and really discouraged. So I hooked up with that group and it turned out that through that group I found out that a NOW chapter had formed here in Knoxville and a lot of the people were crossovers. They were in La Leche, they were in the NOW chapter, many of them became part of the Women&#8217;s Center as it developed. I was connected to the university because I was studying for a master&#8217;s degree and so the university people tended also to be in those groups, so there was just a lot of crossover. I guess we&#8217;d call it networking now but there was a lot of crossover back then. So that&#8217;s how I first got connected to the people who were thinking about the issues, and some of them doing things. JF: Were the women generally your age, married, single, mothers? WS: There were a lot of young women and there were several older women. There seemed to be an age gap. People were in their twenties or thirties or they were in their fifties or sixties, and I&#8217;m not exactly sure why that was the case, but I remember really enjoying the older women in the group particularly and one of them I became very fond of. [She] had an interest in history and she and I got to know each other in the work through NOW and some of these groups for several years before I went to law school and then I found out when I got to the law school that I would be taking classes from her husband. [Laughs] And I&#8217;d never heard of him, really, [Laughs] so it was sort of a surprise to me that it was someone I knew, sort of. JF: That&#8217;s interesting. I talked to Dorothy Stulberg yesterday and I was a little surprised in her interview because she told me the women&#8217;s movement was her life and she was just a lifelong crusader for equal rights and justice but when I asked her if she called herself a feminist in the &#8217;70s she said no, absolutely not. WS: [Laughs] JF: I was a little surprised but it seemed she kind of just thought of a feminist as like, as she put it, a bra-burner. WS: Yes. JF: And it was too narrow for her. She was more about human rights, equal rights for everybody. WS: Right. JF: Do you think this sort of fits with a generational difference? WS: Well I think it&#8217;s part generational difference and it&#8217;s probably part geography. I think women in the South were apologetic about trying to do things for themselves that benefited themselves. I mean they&#8217;d been taught not to be selfish. They&#8217;re supposed to be nurturing, they&#8217;re supposed to be helping other people, and to say I&#8217;m working for women&#8217;s rights that will benefit me, as well as other women but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily focus on everybody&#8217;s rights, was an uncomfortable thing, and I think they did feel like it made them look selfish. I really think that that mindset was a problem for the suffragists as well, just the notion that women were going to go out and do something that was not for someone else but for themselves was kind of rough and coarse and strange, so it doesn&#8217;t surprise me that Dorothy said that. JF: That helps me put it in perspective, yeah. WS: I think it&#8217;s part Southern culture and part the time. JF: That sort of relates to another question I was going to ask. A lot of times when people talk about the &#8217;70s and the women&#8217;s movement they&#8217;ll sort of conflate sexual liberation and women&#8217;s liberation and feminism, you know, it&#8217;s all the same thing. WS: Right. JF: I was wondering if you can recall, in the &#8217;70s how did you think of those terms and use them? WS: Well it was a little awkward for me because I came from a very conservative background [Laughs] so when the &#8217;70s came along I was living in communities where a lot of the activities of the &#8217;70s were kind of scary and weird and strange. Being very liberal sexually was not something that I was comfortable with at all, though I didn&#8217;t really condemn other people for it, but it was a little awkward. You didn&#8217;t really want to be associated with that necessarily. I should tell you this story. It will embarrass myself, maybe I should say we shouldn&#8217;t publish this until I die, but when I went to my first national NOW convention the time extension was up for consideration on the Equal Rights Amendment and the convention was going to be held in Detroit and I decided I just had to go, and take my baby with me but I was going to go. So I drove up there and shared a room, we all crowded in, [Laughs] a whole bunch of people wall to wall in a room. I took the child, my little girl, and one night they had a social event and I decided to go to it and one of the great things about NOW conventions is they always had childcare so mothers were never left out. You could always go to the meetings and go to the events and they have really good childcare. So I left Elaine in the childcare and I went to&#8212;. There was a band playing, the Deadly Nightshades was their name, and they were really good. They were from Pittsburgh and they sang some really funny stuff that they wrote. But as I walked in the door they were singing, &#8220;No rest for the wicked &#8217;cause they&#8217;re too busy having fun,&#8221; and women were dancing together and I had never seen anything like that. So I was a little uncomfortable and not quite sure what to do and the whole time I sat there my Baptist background was saying, get out of here; lightning&#8217;s going to strike you. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: But nothing happened, you know, it was fine, but it was a culture shock to me. It was just something I had never even seen. It was something that was certainly not talked about, at least in the narrow community that I grew up in. JF: That&#8217;s not embarrassing. WS: [Laughs] JF: Everybody has that moment of: I&#8217;m out of my comfort zone. [Laughs] WS: Well, you know, but I stayed and it was okay. I remember my mother getting very upset, because she associated the Equal Rights Amendment and feminists with sexual freedom and gays and lesbians and so forth, and so she thought it was a bad thing for me to be involved in because I had children and it&#8217;s just a bad idea. She went with me one time when I was debating a member of the Eagle Forum on equal rights here in town at a joint NOW meeting and some other group, I can&#8217;t remember what it was. We finished the debate and then we had cookies and punch afterwards and Mom got to meet a few of the people and she got a little more comfortable. Then on the way home she told me she really thought it was a problem and I needed to be careful about associating with people like those lesbians there, and I asked her why, and she said it&#8217;s just bad and it&#8217;s bad for your kids and you don&#8217;t need to do it, but there&#8217;s this really nice&#8212;. &#8220;Like that Susan. Now she wasn&#8217;t like some of those others. Susan seemed like a really nice person, but she&#8217;s not like those lesbians.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, actually she is, Mom.&#8221; [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: You spent most of your social time there talking with a lesbian. [Laughs] She got really sort of angry with me and then I did what I probably shouldn&#8217;t do, which is point out that a lifelong friend of hers that she met for lunch once a month for years and years was also a lesbian. JF: And she didn&#8217;t know that? WS: No. She really got very angry with me and she called me back two or three weeks later and said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t even been able to see her since you told me that.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, Mom, it&#8217;s not a big deal. I mean it&#8217;s just another person. She&#8217;s not going to make sexual advances to you. If she hasn&#8217;t done it in fifty years why would you think she would now?&#8221; So she resumed her lunches with her friend until her friend died. JF: That&#8217;s interesting. It kind of reminds me, I didn&#8217;t really talk to Gloria Ray too much about this but I had heard from my colleague, who grew up here, that people love the Lady Vols. WS: Oh yes. [Laughs] JF: But there&#8217;s still kind of this like, oh, lesbians go to the games, and be careful because they&#8217;ll try to hit on you or you&#8217;ll become a lesbian if you get too close to that. WS: Yeah. I mean there is that concern. A woman athlete, I think, has that kind of issue still. Women gym teachers have that kind of issue still. I remember when the Lady Vols were searching for a name that they were going to call themselves and the NOW chapter was very much opposed to &#8220;Lady Vols&#8221; because we thought they were trying to be too apologetic about being athletes, and of course &#8220;lady&#8221; at the time&#8212;. [Mobile phone rings; break in recording] So anyway, we didn&#8217;t think that &#8220;Lady Vols&#8221; was a great name. We would have liked them to have chosen a stronger word and not something that conjured up tea parties and white gloves. But they, I think, liked the contrast, and maybe needed it because of the attitude toward women athletes. JF: Ms. Ray told me that she felt that Lady Vols was really the best name. She said if they hadn&#8217;t named themselves the names that they would have gotten called would have been worse. She said one of the possible choices was the &#8220;Vols Dolls&#8221;&#8212; WS: Oh gosh. [Laughs] JF: &#8212;and another one was the &#8220;Orange Maids.&#8221; [Laughs] WS: [Laughs] Yes. There were some really bad ones, but they really have distinguished themselves, so I don&#8217;t think they get too much grief anymore. JF: Can you go back a little bit to&#8212;? You said you debated a woman with the Eagle Forum? WS: Yes. [Laughs] JF: Do you remember some of the things that were said? WS: Oh, yes. I mean it was&#8212;. The Eagle Forum was sort of the Phyllis Schlafly group, and there was a group called The Happiness of Womanhood that was related to it. It was a group out of Texas and I suspect there was a lot of crossover on the boards and so forth and their attitudes. They always made a big issue of if the Equal Rights Amendment is passed then women can be drafted and women shouldn&#8217;t be serving in the military, whether they&#8217;re drafted or volunteer. They would be inadequate as soldiers and they shouldn&#8217;t cause them to be put in that kind of danger. So the whole military thing was a big issue and of course we had Vietnam and the draft going on. There was concern that women would abandon the home, they wouldn&#8217;t have children, the future-of-the-race kind of arguments were pretty frequent. The children would grow up to be juvenile delinquents because you wouldn&#8217;t be there and you wouldn&#8217;t be caring for them; the whole notion that women needed to be at home, raising children, and somehow they were threatened by that. I always found it pretty ironic though that Phyllis Schlafly, while she had six or seven kids&#8212;I think she had seven children&#8212;was a lawyer and worked outside the home. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: But she was the head of the keep-the-women-at-home group, and Ellie Smeal was a housewife. I mean she didn&#8217;t work outside of the home, she had her children, and she was leading NOW. Up until she became president of NOW and NOW got enough money to pay her some salary for that she was a volunteer. [Laughs] The irony was just amazing. But anyway, they were very concerned about unisex toilets. If we got the Equal Rights Amendment there wouldn&#8217;t be a women&#8217;s room and a men&#8217;s room in public places; they would all be unisex and you&#8217;d be using the bathroom with guys, and that was a really big issue. I think that may be one that the Eagle Forum made more of than anything else. Of course most homes in America have unisex toilets. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: Most airplanes do. I mean we&#8217;ve all been exposed to it, but it sounded like something more scary than it really was. But unisex toilets, that was a big deal. [Laughs] JF: What is it about claims for gender equality that terrifies people? It seems like&#8212;. You know the civil rights movement had its violent, nasty moments and battles but it&#8217;s almost like when you look at the long history of women claiming rights it always goes back to this thing about the family and the children and it just terrifies people. WS: Well I think it&#8217;s because&#8212;. It&#8217;s hard to draw good analogies between the civil rights movement for black Americans and the women&#8217;s movement, even though there are some similarities. We sleep with the enemy, is what a lot of women would say. Our most intimate relationships, for heterosexual women, are with the very people who by custom or genetics or whatever it is have limited our place in the world, so it&#8217;s a very complex relationship. I think the men felt very threatened in their very intimate relationships and in their&#8212;. It hits you really, really close to home. It&#8217;s not what happens in the marketplace; they have to see it as maybe their whole world gets turned upside down, and I think there was just a lot of genuine fear. I used to feel, in the &#8217;70s, pretty sorry for men actually, because so many of them in the cultural role were put in a position where they were expected to make their wives happy, and so many women grew up expecting their husbands to have the responsibility for making them happy. I think that would be misery. How do you make somebody else happy? They have to have something in themselves, some interest of their own to occupy and to make them happy. So I saw the women&#8217;s movement not just freeing women but freeing men from unreasonable expectations as well, for whatever that&#8217;s worth. JF: Sara Evans, of course, is famous for kind of coining the term &#8220;the personal is political,&#8221; and so often you hear women come to have their moment of the light bulb over the head about gender in a very personal intimate situation or when it hits them close to home. Did you have a similar experience with that? WS: A little bit. I was married before so this is not my current husband, but in the &#8217;70s my husband then was very threatened by me going to&#8212;we&#8217;d call them rap groups, where we&#8217;d just sit around and talk. I think it was a sort of grassroots way of getting people to think outside the box, we&#8217;d say now, I guess. He seemed very threatened by that and we had a lot of conversations, and I know one of the things, and I may have said this earlier in the interview, I don&#8217;t recall, but one of the things that became an issue just for me, trying to figure out what the roles were going to be in this time of transition, was I thought he ought to pick up his own dirty clothes. I really didn&#8217;t think [Laughs] that should be my place, that we should be like two grownups and he should pick up his own dirty clothes and glasses that he left wherever. His response to that to me, which kind of stymied me for a little while, was you have a different standard for how clean you want the house to be; why should I have to live by your standard? You live by yours and I live by mine. Just leave them in the floor, I guess, was the implication, which I couldn&#8217;t do because I didn&#8217;t want to live in a house with clothes on the floor. So I felt pretty trapped and I thought maybe he had a point. So when I went to one of my early meetings with NOW, or one of the rap sessions, they were talking about things that were way beyond my thinking at that time. I had a lot of catching up to do. I remember after the meeting taking aside this one woman who was obviously a leader and obviously really smart and had thought her way through things and I said, this shared housekeeping thing, it doesn&#8217;t seem fair if I make him live up to my standard. I explained to her what he had said and she looked at me and just dismissed me with, &#8220;That is the oldest copout in the book,&#8221; and walked away. I thought, well that&#8217;s not very helpful to me, and then I thought, wow, it is. [Laughs] How can I be so tied up in this thing? Of course that&#8217;s a copout. That was sort of an adjustment for me on the whole thing and I thought, okay. All right, I&#8217;m not going to beat up myself quite as much anymore. I&#8217;m going to start thinking that maybe what I think has something of value to it. But I&#8217;ll never forget the way she looked at me and what she said, and to her&#8212;now we&#8217;re great friends, we&#8217;ve known each other now for many, many years and she doesn&#8217;t remember it at all&#8212;it was nothing, [Laughs] and that&#8217;s exactly the attitude that she purveyed that night, and to me it was an &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moment. It was like, oh boy, are you way, way, way down in elementary school on this. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] I&#8217;m going to jump a little bit, because this makes me think of a question I wanted to ask about being a professional woman or a graduate student or a law student. Did you have sort of similar moments of that when it came to gender discrimination or harassment by professors or colleagues? A random example, but: &#8220;Can you get me a cup of coffee?&#8221; and you start to get up and you think, wait a second. I shouldn&#8217;t have to get you a cup of coffee. WS: I was probably ahead of the professors on some of that by the time I got into graduate school. Now as an undergraduate I did have a professor who sexually harassed all the women, wouldn&#8217;t keep his hands off of us, how you responded clearly affected your grade. It was really a bad situation but there was no Title VII, there was no Title IX, there was no sexual harassment law, there was nothing. There was literally nothing that could be done so I decided that maybe just embarrassing him or getting somebody superior to him to talk to him, maybe that would take care of it. So I went to see the department head who sent me on to see a dean and their response to me was, well that&#8217;s what you get if you&#8217;re going to be out in the world. So in certain ways I had fairly advanced ideas and understandings but when it came to that intimate home setting it was much more complex to try to figure out how to make that all work. When I was getting my thesis approved for my master&#8217;s degree, during the process of trying to select the thesis and working with my advisor, who was a male professor, he had graded one of my papers in the class and he wrote a note at the top: &#8220;This is the best paper I&#8217;ve ever received from a female graduate student,&#8221; and it made me mad. It just really made me angry. So I went in to see him and he said, &#8220;Well, how did you like that comment? You must feel good about that.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, are you crazy? [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: I said, &#8220;What, pretty good for a woman? Is that what you&#8217;re saying here? I mean that&#8217;s really insulting, why would you do that?&#8221; He insisted that wasn&#8217;t really what he meant but it&#8217;s what it said. So we started arguing about the way I took it. I took it wrong, I needed to quit being so sensitive, and I was telling him that he was being insensitive putting it that way; why did it matter whether I was female or male? It&#8217;s a paper, grade it. So a number of our arguments from that finally led to him approving my master&#8217;s thesis topic which turned out to be some sociolinguistic issues on how women&#8217;s credibility is perceived depending on what feminine associated label you put on them, professional women in particular. So that was one of those moments, but I think it may be more &#8220;ah ha&#8221; for him. [Laughs] JF: Yeah, sounds like it. [Laughs] WS: Maybe. JF: Most people seem to think, and you may or may not agree, that things have gotten better for women in their relationships with men, that compared to thirty, forty years ago there&#8217;s different expectations for relationships between men and women and male professors want to see their female students succeed as much as their male students. If you agree with that, what would you credit to that change? WS: Well I think there&#8217;s a change. I don&#8217;t think any change is like a straight line moving forward. We still have people out there who have just learned how to disguise their motives better. They understand what&#8217;s politically correct or what&#8217;s at least likely to submit them to some kind of legal liability and so they do a pretty good job of covering it. To watch the change in the attitude and the relationships between men and women, it&#8217;s kind of interesting. I think what I&#8217;ve noticed, and this is anecdotal and maybe some social scientist would have a better clue as to whether it&#8217;s true, but I noticed that when I began practicing law the people who were most willing to accept a woman, particularly a woman that wanted to do courtroom litigation work&#8212;I mean at the point I was practicing they would consider an office lawyer woman but they weren&#8217;t too keen on having women in the courtroom. JF: And this would have been in the early &#8217;80s? WS: Yes. The older men, really like retirement age, sixty-, seventy-year-old men in the firms, were much more willing to accept a woman and assume that we could do things, and I think it might be because they had daughters who were competing in the world. The younger men in their thirties and forties who if they had daughters [they] weren&#8217;t far enough along to be out in the world maybe, tended to be more difficult to deal with. So I don&#8217;t know whether aging with daughters helps liberalize men or not but I think it might. I certainly know that some of them saw the issues and had their &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moments when it happened to their daughter. Then it was something very, very different. JF: I guess I&#8217;ll jump back then to the &#8217;70s and the women&#8217;s movement in Knoxville. How did you see the local movement fitting in with the national movement? Were there parallels, and then how was it unique or different because it was Knoxville or the South? WS: I think it was different in the South. Bra burning and some of the really more radical stuff nobody felt comfortable with, even in the NOW chapters, or if anyone did they didn&#8217;t say it. We, I guess, in our chapter maybe were a little more&#8212;. We believed that if we did things right people would see the logic of it and turn around. I think looking back that was pretty na&#239;ve, that logic is not what the problem was. People could see the logic but you had to get to their hearts and souls, and I think that&#8217;s why sometimes music can get to people in ways that words never do. If I had it to do over again I would have spent some time getting some musicians to do a really good women&#8217;s anthem that would be a women&#8217;s song that masses could sing that&#8217;s not new words to an old tune. But anyway, I&#8217;m kind of digressing. In the South we&#8217;re in a small community and we have to kind of live together, and you know that you&#8217;re going to be living together and working with these people so it&#8217;s not like in some big cities where you can go offend someone and never see them again. [Laughs] So it&#8217;s a little bit of a different approach. There&#8217;s one demonstration we did. There was a point in time&#8212;maybe I told you about this? Did I tell you about the demonstration at Congressman Duncan&#8217;s house? JF: That is exactly where it cut off, so I am so glad you brought it up. [Laughs] WS: Okay. Well we had what we called an action chair in the NOW chapter and that person was to plan some kind of media event or action every month, so a lot of the things I told you about, posting the grievances on the church doors and so forth, those came from that. Well the Hyde Amendment was up in Congress for a vote, coming up for a vote, and of course it was an attempt to limit access to abortion rights, so we needed to do some kind of demonstration to draw attention to that. However it got decided it got decided, not particularly by me but I was certainly in the room, that we would go and stage a demonstration at Congressman Duncan&#8217;s home. He would be back from Congress and he was pretty conservative and we would try to talk to him about the Hyde Amendment and how it affects welfare and so forth, because I think at the time, if I remember correctly, he was voting to limit welfare rights and payments and at the same time deny abortions and so you&#8217;re going to have more children and less opportunity to feed them and so forth, so we were going to make that kind of argument. We had notified the media and we were going to gather with our signs on his front lawn and then ask him to come out and talk to us. Well it seemed a little confrontational to me. [Laughs] I mean it just seemed a little scary and I didn&#8217;t want him to be scared because he was really a nice man. He was very well liked because he really took his job seriously as a Congressman to take care of people here. If anybody had a problem with social security or the Veteran&#8217;s Administration or whatever it was you didn&#8217;t have to deal with the bureaucracy; you&#8217;d go to him and he&#8217;d take care of it, and he didn&#8217;t care which party you were in. JF: So like a real service ethic. WS: Yeah. He was a very service oriented person, and he was a neighbor, so I decided, okay, we&#8217;ll do it but I&#8217;m going to call him ahead and let him know that we&#8217;re coming so he doesn&#8217;t get scared. I don&#8217;t want to scare him. JF: Did you tell the other women that you were going to do that? WS: I don&#8217;t think I did. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: I didn&#8217;t want him scared, because you wake up and see a bunch of strangers on your front lawn it could be a little frightening. JF: Sure. WS: So anyway I called a few days ahead and said we&#8217;re going to come Sunday morning, don&#8217;t be afraid, we&#8217;re going to have signs and stuff and we&#8217;re going to talk about the Hyde Amendment and have the media there but it&#8217;s just to make this point. No one&#8217;s going to hurt you and no one&#8217;s going to damage your property, [Laughs] so don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s going to be okay. Well years later I was at a luncheon with his son, who is now the Congressman, and he told the other side of that story. He was there about the time his father got that call and his father was saying we&#8217;ve never had a demonstration at our house; what are we going to do? I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m supposed to do. So he turned to the now Congressman Duncan and said, &#8220;Go rent one of those big party pots for coffee and we&#8217;ll get Krispy Kreme doughnuts and when the media leaves we&#8217;ll invite them in for coffee and doughnuts.&#8221; [Laughs] JF: That&#8217;s so amazing. WS: So we had the demonstration on the front yard, you know, and we had the signs and we talked to the media and then afterwards we went around back and went in the back door and had coffee and doughnuts with him and talked about the Hyde Amendment. JF: Oh my God, I love that story. WS: So it was a demonstration Southern style, I guess. [Laughs] Both of us really holding to our own positions and understanding that there was no need to be uncivil about the whole thing. So anyway, yes, I think it&#8217;s a little different in the South. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] That&#8217;s a lot like&#8212;to return again to something Gloria Ray mentioned about&#8212;. She referred to Title IX as like an ace in the back pocket; that you worked with who you knew you could work with and you found allies and you didn&#8217;t shove it in their face but you had it as a tool or a weapon if you needed it. WS: Right. JF: Does that sort of ring true to you in your experiences? WS: Well I think so too. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s geographical or whether it&#8217;s a time difference but you try to work with people and not threaten them, because if you have to get to the point that you&#8217;re threatening them you&#8217;re really at the end of your options. And that has a tendency to make them bow up and go the other direction anyway, so you try to work it through with people if you can, but sometimes you need to have the club. [Laughs] You can&#8217;t always get by without it. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] I really liked your comment about music. It reminded me of I heard that there was something in Knoxville that some people called the &#8220;women&#8217;s choir.&#8221; Joan Boyd Short, who was an activist and a singer/songwriter&#8212;she only lived in Knoxville for a little while and then she moved up to Big Stone Gap where she was a public high school teacher for years&#8212;but she said women got together every once in awhile, it was like a potluck dinner, and they sat around, they talked, they sang songs, they griped to each other. Did you ever hear of that? WS: No, I didn&#8217;t. It would be an interesting place to be but no, I didn&#8217;t really hear about that. JF: It might have been earlier. It might have been maybe &#8217;68, &#8217;69, &#8217;70. WS: It might have been before I came. JF: Did you go to the&#8212;? I heard there was a Monday night book club that some of the women from the Women&#8217;s Center had? WS: There were many of them, as it turned out, in different neighborhoods, which is an interesting parallel to the suffrage things because you know a lot of the suffrage groups formed from literary societies and out of literary societies or they called themselves literary societies so people wouldn&#8217;t get all upset about them getting together. We have a great example of that here. It&#8217;s the Ossoli [Club]. JF: How do you spell that? WS: O-s-s-o-l-i. They were formed by Lizzie Crozier French, who is the leader on our statue, as a literary society to get women to start thinking about talking about ideas and reportedly at some point during the process&#8212;. She got very frustrated because they were not as community minded and as progressive as she thought that they ought to be and they were coming along but at some point she is reported to have stood up and slammed a book down on the table and said, &#8220;Ladies, I have news for you. Dante is dead. We need to work on things that affect us now.&#8221; [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: And she moved forward and she was a suffrage leader, she worked on environmental issues and the smoke ordinance here, she worked on getting ratings on movies so that children wouldn&#8217;t be exposed to thing inadvertently that they shouldn&#8217;t see, free lunches in the schools because the kids can&#8217;t learn if they&#8217;re hungry; she was very, very involved in the community for all of her life. But she said they called it Ossili Circle, &#8220;Ossili&#8221; after one of the authors but &#8220;Circle&#8221; because women could belong to sewing circles and it didn&#8217;t threaten people, or they could belong to literary circles and it didn&#8217;t threaten people, but if they belonged to something that was called a &#8220;club,&#8221; they were organizing and that threatened people, so they just called it a circle so they could not be hassled quite as much by people, I guess. JF: That makes a lot of sense. We&#8217;re sitting in this conference room and I see framed cartoons or newspaper clippings&#8212;&#8220;As I see the future of women&#8221; by William Howard Taft, is to my right here&#8212;so obviously it&#8217;s very important for you to know the history and make the history of the long women&#8217;s movement visible, and I&#8217;m wondering what you see as parallels or connections between older generations of women activists and younger? For instance, the League of Women Voters, which has been around forever, and Dorothy Stulberg mentioned it&#8217;s very active in this area. WS: It is. Well I got interested really in looking at the history because of course they didn&#8217;t teach it when I was in school and the history books we had left women out. I mean the whole sum and substance of women&#8217;s suffrage was: In 1920 Congress gave women the right to vote, like they just decided to be nice one day and did it, without seventy-two years of struggle, as it turned out, that was the real story. JF: And hunger strikes and imprisonment. [Laughs] WS: Right, [Laughs] all of the other crazy things that went on. So I started I guess when I confronted the arguments of people like the Eagle Forum that made no sense to me. Why would giving me equal opportunity mean that it would destroy my home? Why would it do that? That doesn&#8217;t make sense to me. How can it be controversial in a country that has founded itself on freedom and equality to give equality? How can that even be controversial, let alone the kind of firestorm we got when we tried to pass the Equal Rights Amendment? I couldn&#8217;t understand it. Then somebody told me it had been the same with suffrage and I couldn&#8217;t believe it. How could voting be that controversial? So I started researching it for two reasons. One is first I didn&#8217;t believe it so I had to go check myself, but second, if that was true then surely we could learn something from what happened in those movements so that we don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel every time. We&#8217;re sitting out here working on the Equal Rights Amendment, facing the same kinds of arguments, and we don&#8217;t know what they did, and some of the things they did were very successful. So that&#8217;s really how I got interested in looking at the suffrage movement, and it&#8217;s a history we don&#8217;t know much about but it&#8217;s a history of great courage, particularly in the South. I&#8217;m sure it was difficult to be a suffragist in any part of the country but in the South it was, I think, harder, and so I have a little extra respect for the women in the South that led the suffrage movement and that contributed to it. So anyway, I&#8217;ve done a lot of work to try to locate and preserve the history of the suffrage movement, particularly here in Tennessee and in the South, in hopes that it will help us learn where to start again. If the Equal Rights Amendment really gets going again we ought to learn from our foremothers about how to deal with some of the issues, and from our last attempt at the Equal Rights Amendment, quite frankly, as well, and we weren&#8217;t really good about keeping&#8212;. We&#8217;re better about keeping that history than the suffragists were about keeping their history but most of it&#8217;s still in boxes. It&#8217;s not really been assimilated into the kind of map for the future I&#8217;d like to see it assimilated into. JF: That&#8217;s a great way to put it, and part of this project I kind of see as a way to directly ask the people who lived it: What happened with the ERA? So do you want to talk about that for a little bit and tell me&#8212;? WS: Oh, it was a heartbreak. JF: Tell me everything. [Laughs] WS: I don&#8217;t know that I ever felt as strongly about anything as I did that it needed to pass. I had a little girl, born in 1974, and it was just very important to me that she have equal rights when she turned eighteen, and I believed it would happen, maybe because I was na&#239;ve and didn&#8217;t realize how much subtle power behind the scenes can be exercised against you. You&#8217;re not always dealing with what&#8217;s right on the surface, there are people behind pulling strings, and I was too simplistic to fully appreciate that. And because it just was so right and so logical how could it not happen? And now I&#8217;m worried about my granddaughters reaching eighteen and still not having full equality under the Constitution. It&#8217;s crazy. So I really was heart and soul into it, and a lot of people were, and many people much longer than I was; I was sort of a latecomer to the group. But when it failed, and it became pretty obvious that it was likely to, that was about the time I went to law school. It just knocked the wind out of all of us. Some of the people that I worked with every day just disappeared. They wouldn&#8217;t return phone calls; it was hard to get to see them; they were depressed. A lot of the women sort of privatized, went back to their own little world that they could control, which is a way of coping with that kind of loss. Some of them have never recovered. I think it really took an emotional toll on them, and I can think of one woman right now, that I won&#8217;t name, but she worked so hard and she&#8217;s never gotten back to full function after that. So it was a real hard blow. Then there were people like Ellie Smeal who led that. I mean she had to feel it more so than any of us, I would think, and she continued battling every day, sending out her letters about this is coming up in Congress or that&#8217;s coming up and you need to do this and you need to do that, and I&#8217;m just like, how can you do it? I want to get away from this for awhile myself. But she never quit and never will, and I suppose those are the people with the spirit of Alice Paul and Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton and that&#8217;s why things continue, but somehow she&#8217;s never given it up. She just continues to fight the battle day by day. But it was devastating. Then you would look at people&#8212;. It was hard to look at people quite the same after that too. JF: How so? WS: Well, you know, why&#8212;? You look at voters and you want to say, why is it that you don&#8217;t think that fifty-one or fifty-three percent or whatever of the people in this country ought to have equal opportunity? What&#8217;s so bad about us? Why did it take us so long to get suffrage and then everything stopped? We still don&#8217;t have constitutional equality. Then a few years later I&#8217;d get calls occasionally from high school history teachers that would want me to come in and talk about the women&#8217;s movement or the Equal Rights Amendment and I was happy to do that, but I&#8217;m looking out at all these high school girls who thought it passed, who thought they had equal rights, who had no real concept of where they were or what might be coming, and that was difficult and that was kind of annoying. So when I started doing the work to raise the money for the statue, it&#8217;s a suffrage memorial, I did that in part because I thought we need to make a public presence of that story so that it&#8217;s never completely forgotten and if we make it a public presence then other people, years from now, may walk by and read it and decide to read a little more and find out more and the story may continue, so that was really the plan, to create a public presence for the suffrage story in Tennessee. The way we raised money for that was we started out going to civic clubs that are always looking for programs with a slideshow about suffrage, and it is kind of interesting. I mean we have all the images of the literature that was anti-suffrage, and they&#8217;re pretty funny, and some of the pro-suffrage and how people framed the arguments and so forth. Then I started tagging on the end of it: So we owe a lot to these women that went before us and we grew up and just registered to vote and that&#8217;s all it took. We didn&#8217;t have to do anything but register and go vote. What are we doing to advance the rights of women in our day, what are we doing for our daughters and our granddaughters, and of course my hope was we&#8217;d do the ERA and that didn&#8217;t happen, so I usually come back to the ERA there and CEDAW and all of the other things where the rights of women tend to get pushed in the corner and to the bottom of the agenda. We have a liberal President now&#8212;I hate to call him liberal publically because that seems to be a bad word&#8212;but we have a progressive President, but CEDAW still hasn&#8217;t come to the floor of the Senate. He could do that. He could get it passed. I&#8217;ve not heard him say a word about the Equal Rights Amendment. I&#8217;ve heard some general statements but I&#8217;ve seen no movement to actually do anything. When Wilson was President and the suffragists were trying to get the 19th Amendment passed he gave them lip service, said he supported it, but he never used his political clout and he never made it high on the agenda until the National Women&#8217;s Party pushed him in a corner and he had to. So I guess right now I feel like women&#8217;s issues are by and large ignored. There&#8217;s always something more important and we&#8217;re always told to wait. When I lobbied Congress for the Equal Rights Amendment, which I did a few times&#8212;. JF: Did you go to DC? WS: Uh huh, sure did. You know how we did it&#8212;I probably told you about that, in the Women&#8217;s Center? JF: Collecting quarters instead of postage stamps? WS: Right. [Laughs] JF: That&#8217;s amazing that you were able to get a plane ticket like that. WS: Oh yes, we did. That&#8217;s the only way I got there and I did it a few times. The Congressmen&#8212;and they were men&#8212;would constantly tell me it&#8217;s just not the right time. You need to wait your turn. There are other things first. I found that very frustrating because I was young and impatient, but that&#8217;s what happened when black men got the right to vote and women wanted them to make it universal suffrage and they decided they had a better chance of passing it without us and we were cut out. That&#8217;s what happens, constantly. Even the people who say they support us in government, we&#8217;re just not a priority, and part of that&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t force them in a corner. The squeaky wheel and all that; I suppose that&#8217;s what we need to do again, and that&#8217;s a lot of work. But that&#8217;s what they say, and one time I asked Howard Baker about it when I was working at his law firm. I was annoyed with him because he voted against the time extension, the second time extension, so we were at a cocktail party for the firm and I said, &#8220;I just have to ask you why you did that,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Well did I?&#8221; JF: Oh, my gosh. That&#8217;s almost worse. WS: I know. And I said, &#8220;Yes you did, and I think I know why.&#8221; So anyway we had a discussion about it and, you know&#8212;. JF: What did you think was&#8212;? WS: Well I think he&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know if this was true. My personal belief was that he was thinking about running for President at that point and he had gotten a lot of grief from the conservatives over his vote on the Panama Canal, quote &#8220;giving it away,&#8221; and so he needed to prove that he was conservative and we were a part of that proof. That was my read on it, and I don&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s fair to him or not but that&#8217;s how I read it at the time. So I asked him, &#8220;What&#8217;s it going to take to get the Equal Rights Amendment passed?&#8221; because he did vote for it in Congress. He wasn&#8217;t an enemy of the Equal Rights Amendment; he just wasn&#8217;t as strong a friend as I wanted him to be. He looked at me and he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to take another generation of lawmakers dying off,&#8221; and I thought that means I&#8217;m going to die off. [Laughs] I can&#8217;t wait that long. But he may be right. It&#8217;s a change of time, a change of perspective with time maybe. I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;m disappointed right now. I really thought that maybe with President Obama at least some of these issues would get to hearing. We should have hearings on CEDAW and we should have hearings on the Equal Rights Amendment, and I don&#8217;t see any real movement. I hear promises but I haven&#8217;t seen anything happening yet, and I know there&#8217;s other big things going on in the world but at some point half of the people in your country having equal rights ought to be important. JF: And so many of the other things that they talk about are things that, of course they affect women and often they affect women the most, [like] poverty. WS: Exactly, and those are perennial problems. Those are going to go on to some extent forever and we&#8217;re going to have to address them. I would think we could address them better in an atmosphere of equal opportunity where the brightest and best minds and talents weren&#8217;t held back. Let the cream rise. Give everybody a chance and then we know when we&#8217;re pulling on our pooled best talents that we have our best chance at solving some of the other problems. But some guys might lose their jobs I guess, [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know what the real concern is but that&#8217;s certainly one of the concerns. JF: I think one of my professors put it once that it requires a plague of locusts for real change to happen. WS: Well, and it happens when you least expect it, too. If you look back over history, that&#8217;s what happens. It&#8217;s the perfect storm and something happens and it&#8217;s hard to even see it coming. It&#8217;s hard to know when the opportunity&#8217;s going to be there. But I don&#8217;t think women have been particularly good at watching for their opportunities. JF: And that goes back to what you said earlier about fearing that they&#8217;re going to appear selfish or self interested. WS: Right. I think that&#8217;s a part of it, I do. We&#8217;re trained not to be that way, there&#8217;s a little more emphasis on it for women I think than there is for men growing up, so I don&#8217;t know. I hope the ERA passes sometime in my lifetime but I&#8217;m not counting on it. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] Let me pause and skip to the next track so we don&#8217;t lose anything. [Break in recording] You used the phrase &#8220;the squeaky wheel&#8221; in sort of saying that women need to be the squeaky wheel and push these issues, and it made me think of one of the ways I feel that there was a big change in the &#8217;70s because of the women&#8217;s movement was the visibility of making criminal and public things like rape and sexual harassment that had previously been considered personal or private matters. WS: Domestic violence was still then a very private matter, sure, yeah. I think that really helped put us in the public arena to get people thinking and talking, and people who might not actually want to be seen with us identifying with us privately and quietly, and that can reflect itself in the ballot box or sometimes in a checkbook. I think those issues did help, people could identify with those. We&#8217;ve made a lot of progress in terms of raising public awareness on those issues and made some law changes but the underlying problem still exists and I see it all the time in my practice. I practice a lot of domestic law and violence and people quietly hiding their secret of violence in their home goes on every day still. It&#8217;s very difficult to root that out, and that may be fundamentally a disrespect issue and you disrespect the people who aren&#8217;t equal. If they&#8217;re not as good as you and they&#8217;re not entitled to the same opportunity then they&#8217;re somehow a subspecies. And then of course there are women that oppose the Equal Rights Amendment too, and for whatever their nervous concerns might have been they jeopardize themselves in the process and I see that all the time too, so there&#8217;s nothing really new about that, women and men that take positions that only hurt themselves. JF: What about birth control and reproductive rights and reproductive health in the &#8217;70s? What was going on in Knoxville around that? WS: Well it was pretty controversial. Abortion rights, of course, is pretty controversial still. Contraception was an issue that almost seemed to divide on church lines, religious lines. The Catholic Church of course was not in favor of any form of contraception as we think of it and the issue was always tied up with women being promiscuous. It was like if you have birth control then that means that you&#8217;re getting it so you can be promiscuous, and that was sort of the argument against it. It never made a lot of sense to me because obviously one of the biggest commitments you can ever make in your life is to have a child and I would think that you would want people to be able to enter upon that decision willingly and ready as opposed to in an immature way. But birth control, it was still hard to even talk about it frankly, publicly. There was some embarrassment about the whole issue of birth control. Abortion rights were a very emotional discussion. I don&#8217;t know that that&#8217;s really changed all that much. I do know I used to do a program for churches on the biblical support for abortion rights that got lots of interest and lots of&#8212;. [Laughs] JF: You mentioned that in the first interview. You said your background, you felt, helped you. WS: Oh yes. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: That helped me a lot. That was kind of fun. What I found interesting was there are so many women in the South who feel pressured to appear at the anti-choice events or at times they were picketing the clinics who privately and personally supported abortion rights and many of them had abortions, and it was the sort of thing that I never felt that it was appropriate to out them on it because it is a personal issue and should be a personal choice, so I kind of felt like they took advantage of us on both sides. JF: &#8220;They&#8221; being the anti-abortionists? WS: The crossovers, the people who would appear publicly with their church friends opposing abortion and then would have an abortion themselves or would take their daughter for an abortion, and they had to have some comfort level to believe that we weren&#8217;t going to personally out them because we thought it was a personal choice, so it is a small community. See that&#8217;s a function of a small community too, probably, that you know some of those things. JF: That makes it so much harder for women too. I think that&#8217;s a great point about feeling pressured. WS: Yeah. I mean it was like a secret sisterhood almost. You knew what they were doing and you knew why they felt like they had to do this in public and why they really felt some other way and who are we to judge them and say that&#8217;s horrible. I don&#8217;t think you can judge them. You can&#8217;t live in their shoes. I just think it&#8217;s a lot more complex maybe in a small community where you know too much. [Laughs] JF: You mentioned in your first interview that you had served as a clinic escort. WS: I have, yes. JF: Was that in the &#8217;70s or have you done it sort of continuously? WS: No, I haven&#8217;t done it in a long, long time, so it would be probably mostly in the &#8217;70s. JF: What was that like? WS: It really wasn&#8217;t bad. I guess that&#8217;s the flipside of the South. The activists are not in your face so much here and the antis aren&#8217;t either. It&#8217;s more civil. When we&#8217;ve had real trouble has been literally when they bus people in from other states or other areas to be a part of some demonstration. JF: Oh, like what&#8217;s that&#8212;? WS: The outside agitator, as they used to call them in the Civil War, I guess, or after the Civil War. JF: Operation Rescue or something? WS: Yes. Those are more troublesome and that&#8217;s when we do escorts but frankly aside from that, I mean I remember when Gloria Steinem was here for a program in &#8217;91 we had a dinner at Club LeConte, which is a sort of top of the glass tower restaurant here, and a lot of people were there and we were going to go from there to the Tennessee Theatre, which is about a three-block walk down the main street of Knoxville, called Gay Street. I had arranged for a police escort to come and pick her up at the back of the building and take her into the back of the theater because I didn&#8217;t want Knoxville to be for the women&#8217;s movement what Memphis is to the civil rights movement. The last thing on earth I wanted was for someone like that to be killed here or hurt here, and I could see from Club LeConte that there were anti-choice demonstrators gathering at the front of the door of the Tennessee Theatre and that we were going to be picketed there. So I tried to get her to go out with me, to go with the police, and she refused to do it. She said she&#8217;s going to walk down the main street just like she should. So I picked out a couple of really big guys to walk in front of her so they could take the bullet it if happened. [Laughs] And they volunteered. They knew what the mission was and they volunteered. We walked down the street&#8212;. Well the anti-choice demonstrators I guess had been told the wrong time to be there and they sort of lost interest and by the time we got down there, there were only two or three left with their little signs, and Gloria stopped and talked with them very nice and very civilly and we proceeded through the midst of it and nobody got hurt and nobody even spoke really an unkind word. [Laughs] And there are a few other events we&#8217;ve done to raise money for a Susan B. Anthony scholarship at the law school. We did some public events at some of the theaters and we draw pickets every once in awhile, but nothing very frightening really happened. I was more concerned about Gloria then I was anybody because of her name. JF: Yeah, if there was somebody crazy in that crowd they were going to target her. WS: Yes, but when the crowd pretty much gave up before she got there I guess they had other things to do. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: I thought, well that&#8217;s okay. [Laughs] JF: This is kind of a mundane question but I always like asking this: What did you think of television shows and movies in the &#8217;70s and the &#8217;80s, in general and then the ones that purported to be about the women&#8217;s movement or to have strong feminine characters like Norma Rae or Silkwood? WS: There was a lot of writing and talking about how women were disadvantaged by the use of language and by images in the media, and images in the media were a problem. The frightening trend to me in the &#8217;70s was the commercial use of images of violence against women to sell products, and it got awful. The record companies probably led the charge with horrible billboards of women beaten black and blue with&#8212; JF: What were they&#8212;? WS: &#8212;chains and women bloody and in trashcans and just horrible, horrible images, and their executives would say, well, that gets people&#8217;s attention, that&#8217;s why we do it, and we would say, you&#8217;re desensitizing people to violence against women. You&#8217;re suggesting it&#8217;s a good thing. You&#8217;re drawing people in to buy into this product and to be thinking it&#8217;s okay to treat women like that, and there were a number of studies that suggested that that kind of desensitization does increase violence. They weren&#8217;t too impressed. So there was this group that formed out in California, in Orange County where the first black and blue billboard went up, called Women Against Violence Against Women, WAVAW, and they did slideshows to educate people on this trend in advertising and to get people to sign resolutions that were sent to the boards of these corporations that had these kind of advertising policies. I thought it was brilliant, the woman, I can&#8217;t remember her name right now, that first started that group, but I had met her early on and formed a chapter here. We bought stock in the record companies and at that time minority shareholders could appear at the annual meetings and had a certain amount of time that you were allowed to address a minority viewpoint. So we were always minority shareholders, we didn&#8217;t have enough money to be anything else, but just one or two of us with a share or two of stock could go to the annual meeting and there&#8217;s the whole board and we would show them the slides and the studies. It was pretty upsetting to some of the board members who didn&#8217;t really realize&#8212;. I guess they&#8217;re looking at the profit and loss; they&#8217;re not looking at the details of some of the advertising and what was going on. Then we would introduce minority shareholder resolutions against using images of violence to sell products. It was an extremely effective technique until they found ways to limit access for minority shareholders to have the stage. [Laughs] But we showed these things around a lot, and JC Penny&#8217;s used to have a store down on Gay Street and I thought that this was really all coming out of California and New York, because you would see the images there, and I saw some in Boston and some other places I had been, like store windows with female mannequins upside down in trashcans or in chains, just gross stuff. I was walking down Gay Street, passing JC Penny&#8217;s window, and there they were, female mannequins in mink or fur coats and chains, chained up, and I was astounded, so I went in to see the manager. I said, &#8220;How can you do that? Why do you do that?&#8221; and he explained to me that that got people&#8217;s attention and they keep stats on what people are looking at, and so forth. So I said, &#8220;I was hoping I could talk you into taking them down.&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;Well we paid some New York designer thousands of dollars to get this window done,&#8221; blah, blah. So I said, &#8220;Well, okay, then I&#8217;ll just have to bring my group back to picket you.&#8221; [Laughs] They reconsidered and the next day they removed those mannequins from the windows. [Laughs] I&#8217;m not sure whether I could have gotten a group up or not in a day but I probably could have. It didn&#8217;t take too much. JF: He didn&#8217;t call your bluff. [Laughs] WS: But I was shocked to see that here, and they got a lot of complaints. I mean I got on the phone and people started calling in complaints, so we didn&#8217;t have it to the extent that a lot of other cities did. I mean there you are, we&#8217;re just exposing domestic violence as that sort of dirty little secret, the silent scream kind of thing, and at the same time we&#8217;re dealing with people who are glorifying violence to sell products, and the trend then was to do that more and more, and when it trickled down to places like JC Penny&#8217;s I thought we were sinking. I haven&#8217;t seen so much of that. Every once in awhile you&#8217;ll see something but that seems to have been a fad that died, I hope, and I hope it stays dead. JF: Wow. That kind of astounds me. I guess I&#8217;d never heard of that. WS: I still have the slideshow. I could show you hundreds of record albums with these images from that time. JF: Oh my gosh. WS: I would literally go with a camera to the record stores and just go through the bins and take pictures of them to use them as illustrations in slideshows of what was&#8212;. JF: Yeah. I feel like now the concern more is about the sexual objectification of women in music and in cinema or the effect of these sort of unattainable body figures on young women. WS: Right, the Barbie look, yeah, and those are legitimate concerns, but boy, that violence stuff was very scary, very scary, and it may have been in part in reaction to the women&#8217;s movement. People start to feel threatened, maybe people would like to see those people that are threatening them chained up, or whatever, so you&#8217;re always going to have that sort of push. When you push one direction you&#8217;re going to get a reaction in the other, and that may have been part of the backlash. I&#8217;m not quite sure. The people we talked to were the corporation types who just thought it was a good money maker. JF: Well that reminds me of what you said earlier, that I just really liked your point that perhaps women in the &#8217;70s sort of underestimate the problem of the subtle power behind things and the way that the opposition learned to mask their opposition and their antifeminism and their anti-woman statements and activities and attitudes. WS: I don&#8217;t think we realized how much insurance companies had to do with defeating the Equal Rights Amendment then. JF: Can you tell me about that? WS: Lots of money from the insurance companies, lots of money. They were afraid&#8212;. JF: What&#8217;s their stake? WS: Well because they had differential rates for men and women and I suppose they were afraid that they would have to have the same rate for men and women. They make more money on women; women live longer, did then, still do. I mean there was a lot of fear in the insurance industry and a lot of money that went into state campaigns to elect legislators who would vote against the Equal Rights Amendment. JF: Wow. WS: So I was not sophisticated enough then to think they would care that much and get involved in it. With the work I&#8217;d done on the suffrage movement the funding opposition&#8212;you know, follow the money trail?&#8212;the funding opposition to suffrage came largely from the liquor industry and the manufacturers and the railroads; liquor because suffragists were often also temperance workers; manufacturing because they were pretty sure that if women got the right to vote that they would pass child labor laws, which I&#8217;m glad to say we did, [Laughs] so they were right about that; and the railroad because there was so much corruption and good old boy cronyism going on, to introduce a whole new flock of personalities, I guess, was pretty threatening to the way business was done at the time. So they just poured money into the opposition and got some poor schmuck of a woman to go out front and be their front person to say she opposed her own rights. It&#8217;s very sad. JF: This would be a good segue into, I was going to ask you about your experiences at UT because academia, talk about an old boys&#8217; network. [Laughs] WS: [Laughs] JF: I&#8217;ve done some interviews with women faculty members at UNC who have said&#8212;well this is sort of a tangent&#8212;they said that some of the processes in academia, like getting tenure or getting hired, were so loose and flexible that it can work to your advantage or it can work against you because if you weren&#8217;t in that network&#8212;and it&#8217;s still like that to some extent. WS: Yeah, if you want to make sure that only your friends get tenure then you make a process that&#8217;s subjective or that has no real objective standards, and that I&#8217;m sure. I mean you can just look at statistics for universities everywhere, whether the issues is admission of women or the issue is tenure for women who are in the faculty, or the hiring of women. My experience at UT primarily was with the law school and I must say the law school was the most egalitarian place I&#8217;ve ever been. JF: And you started there in &#8217;79? WS: In &#8217;79 and very much to my surprise people were really conscious of trying to be fair and reasonable. They just seemed light years above any of the other departments that I&#8217;d been associated with at the university. So my law school experience from the standpoint of did I feel like I had equal opportunity and did I feel like I was treated fairly was very good. Of course one of the things that law school does that so far as I know no place else in the university did at the time is all anonymous grading, so most of the grades came from a single test at the end of the course and you were assigned a number and the teacher wouldn&#8217;t know who it was and grades were posted by number, so it made it hard, I think, to put gender bias into that kind of a mix. So I was very pleased with that and I thought, well, maybe it&#8217;s just lawyers, so when I get out into the law world it&#8217;s going to be a place that&#8217;s more like equality, and that wasn&#8217;t true. [Laughs] It was just law school. [Laughs] Always hopeful, you know, always hopeful. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] So what was it like when you would have finished law school in &#8217;81, &#8217;82? WS: I finished in &#8217;82, I was single and I had two kids and I had a mortgage and I couldn&#8217;t afford to go anywhere else. I had maxed up loans and there weren&#8217;t that many loans available then and so I felt really pretty much stuck in Knoxville. There were not many women who did litigation work in Knoxville and the only thing I wanted to do was litigation work. I love the courtroom, I love appellate work, I did not want to be an office lawyer, I did not want to right contracts, they bore me; I just didn&#8217;t want to do that. So I realized early on that a lot of people wouldn&#8217;t even interview women for litigation at all so I thought I&#8217;ve got to do something to stand out. And I do understand. I will say, from my limited experience in various kinds of businesses, if there&#8217;s anything that overcomes sexism it&#8217;s greed and so if you make enough money for them they pretty soon don&#8217;t care whether you&#8217;re a woman or not. [Laughs] So I thought if I can do something to really distinguish myself so that they think that having this label or whatever it is that I have makes them better or makes them money then maybe I&#8217;ve got a chance of getting a job in Knoxville. So I decided to do the national moot court competition, which at the time was the most prestigious of the moot court competitions, and the second year, my last year, we won the national competition, which UT still hasn&#8217;t won again since, so that&#8217;s thirty years ago now. That was a big deal and it was in the paper everywhere so then I started getting interviews because I think they thought that might attract business. A lot of these firms were dealing with national companies, they did products litigation for Ford and Nissan and so forth, so that opened some doors for me that I think might never have been opened at all before. But there were still a lot of people who said they would not hire women in litigation and I interviewed with some firms that were sort of schizophrenic about that. There were some people in the firm who thought it would be fine; there were others who wanted to figure out how it could be done. It seemed in principle like a good idea but they were very nervous about it. [Laughs] And some of those interviews were hilarious and I won&#8217;t name the people because they&#8217;re decent people but they were caught obviously in a time of change and they wanted to change but their culture and their background and their brain was still a decade or two behind them. In one of the interviews I had like, I don&#8217;t know, a half a dozen men&#8212;they were all men&#8212;in the room asking me questions and what they couldn&#8217;t get their head around was how could they have a woman in litigation, because they might&#8212;. You know, they travel and do trials, so what&#8217;s your wife going to think? And I&#8217;m like I&#8217;m not going to stay in your room. [Laughs] I want a room of my own. [Laughs] The other thing that came up in more than one firm was we don&#8217;t know whether a woman lawyer, how could she get along with the secretaries? Women don&#8217;t get along that well, you know. I guess that was sort of the queen bee stereotype thing that they had, which I found very strange because I&#8217;ve got a lot of women friends. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t get this. JF: [Laughs] WS: So those were probably the most common themes: Our wives will think we&#8217;re doing something wrong. If we have to work late&#8212;oh my. After I was working at Baker, Worthington, which was Howard Baker&#8217;s firm here when I started work, I had worked for three or four years with a man that was sort of difficult to get along with, I guess is the way to put it; did a lot of cussing and screaming and yelling. It didn&#8217;t bother me because I had brothers. It&#8217;s not a big deal. We were traveling, coming back from some deposition someplace, and I remember at one point he made some comment to me about how glad he was that I didn&#8217;t try to use my sex to my advantage in the firm. I remember looking at him and thinking, I don&#8217;t think sex is an advantage for a woman working in litigation. [Laughs] Or are you saying that you&#8217;re glad I haven&#8217;t hit on you, because I&#8217;m not interested in you. [Laughs] I mean tell your wife not to worry; I&#8217;m not interested. [Laughs] I mean that&#8217;s really how I responded. I couldn&#8217;t figure out what he was trying to say, and what he was trying to say was the latter. He was surprised that we could work together as attorneys and not have a situation that made his wife uncomfortable, and I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed that. He hid that well. I had no idea that that was whirling around someplace in the back of his head, until he said it. JF: That&#8212;. WS: [Laughs] JF: It&#8217;s wonderful you mention that&#8212;I mean, it&#8217;s awful&#8212;but it&#8217;s wonderful you mention it because I&#8217;ve heard a lot of women talk about things that relate to being very conscious of their bodies and their appearances&#8212; WS: Oh yes. JF: &#8212;in ways that men never talk about having those thoughts or fears. Can you tell me some of your feelings and perspectives and memories about that? WS: Well I grew up very conservative so I always have dressed conservatively and frankly that&#8217;s not a tradition carried on by many of my younger female lawyers. [Laughs] So I guess I didn&#8217;t really concentrate a whole lot on that. It wasn&#8217;t like I had to change the way I dressed to be appropriate for a professional setting except maybe not wear my jeans, which were my favorite clothes. But there are a lot of women who I don&#8217;t&#8212;. There&#8217;s this trap for really attractive women. I am not a beautiful woman, okay. I mean I&#8217;m not the kind of person who would ever be Miss Tennessee or Miss Knoxville or would even want to be but there are some women who are inherently just beautiful and those women, if they&#8217;re also smart, can go to law school and get out in the community but guys can&#8217;t&#8212;sometimes, back then, and I&#8217;m thinking of a particular situation&#8212;can&#8217;t look past beautiful. So it was like she&#8217;s beautiful or she&#8217;s smart but you can&#8217;t be both, so some of the women were really disadvantaged by being good looking and they had to dress down and makeup down to get people to focus on the work that they did. I have a very good friend, who was told in a moot court argument at the law school that she looked like she ought to be a cocktail waitress, and she put her hair up in a bun and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s ever come down in public since, beautiful blonde hair. But she had to get them to look past her physical self because she&#8217;s a brilliant woman and a very good lawyer, but she became a very conservative dresser because guys often couldn&#8217;t deal with her as a professional if she was good looking. That is a phenomenon that I guess I wouldn&#8217;t have anticipated. I had to see it to understand how that came about. But that was never particularly a problem for me [Laughs] because I&#8217;m more plain looking so that was never a big issue. JF: So you would have been single when you were entering the job market, a single mom. WS: Yes. JF: How did that affect your experiences? WS: [Laughs] Well it affected the interviews a lot. I mean it was one thing to have a woman lawyer but to have a woman lawyer that was a single mom with two kids? I remember one of the attorneys in one of the interviews saying, &#8220;Just how on God&#8217;s green earth do you think you&#8217;re going to be able to work twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and raise two kids?&#8221; I just said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t plan to work like that. I have two kids. I&#8217;m going to work hard and give it my best and then I&#8217;m going home to take care of them at the end of the day,&#8221; and I got up to leave because I figured that job was gone, and he was so surprised that I was assertive enough, I guess, to get up and leave that all of a sudden he was like, &#8220;Oh, no, no. I meant like an average of forty hours a week.&#8221; [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: So I sat back down and we continued the interview. [Laughs] I said, well I can do forty hours a week. JF: Wow. WS: And some people&#8212;. I was divorced and I felt like that was an impediment, that the bar is kind of conservative and some of them thought that being divorced indicated instability or being divorced meant I was out on the look for somebody&#8217;s husband, I don&#8217;t know. [Laughs] But all those kinds of things were swirling around, and I do remember being in one interview and the guy said something about me being divorced and I said, &#8220;Is that a disadvantage here?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know how else to do it, just ask them straight out. He looked at me and kind of laughed and he said, &#8220;You know, I don&#8217;t trust anyone that hasn&#8217;t been divorced. You&#8217;ve got to be able to admit a mistake.&#8221; [Laughs] So I said, okay. [Laughs] So, I don&#8217;t know. I mean you never know what&#8217;s going on in people&#8217;s heads, just what they tell you, but obviously that was a concern for some people, I think, but it didn&#8217;t keep me from getting offers ultimately, fortunately. So that was just another one of those things you walk through. JF: And how did being part of the women&#8217;s movement&#8212;? Well let me ask, do you consider yourself a feminist? WS: Oh yes. JF: Would you call yourself a feminist in the &#8217;70s? WS: Oh yes, I did, no question. JF: And has that term changed meaning or definition for you over the years? WS: No, not at all. JF: How would you define feminism or what does that mean to you? WS: I think a feminist is somebody who thinks that women are equal. I mean I think that&#8217;s the fundamental thing. How did that affect the job market? That&#8217;s an interesting question. I think that the men who were interviewing me didn&#8217;t pay enough attention to the women&#8217;s movement to know that I had been particularly active in it, so that was probably an advantage, I suppose, in a way. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: I do know that I interviewed with one firm where you had to interview with each and every partner, and there were a lot of them, and it was sort of a blackball system. Whoever first didn&#8217;t like you then the interviews were over, you were done, and I expected to get blackballed really early [Laughs] because I had&#8212;. JF: That&#8217;s brutal. [Laughs] WS: I had decided that I&#8217;m just going to be honest with them and straightforward with them because I don&#8217;t want to wind up with a job where I have to try to be someone other than I am and I&#8217;d rather wind up someplace that I can stay and be comfortable. So I was just very honest with people as they asked, and nobody really asked me much about that until close to the very end of the interviews, and I&#8217;d already passed through the two people who had blackballed all the women before and I&#8217;d gotten by them somehow. One because he didn&#8217;t like women because they were too docile, and he&#8217;s the one I almost walked out of the interview on, so he liked me because I tried to walk out of the interview on him. [Laughs] And another who just liked to talk about himself all the time and I understood that from some intelligence I received ahead of the interview so I just went in there and asked him questions about himself so he passed me on. [Laughs] So that worked. So I was really up to the very end before someone asked me about politics and they asked me if I was involved in politics and I said, &#8220;If you mean party politics, no. I&#8217;ve never been active in party politics.&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;Well what do you mean? Then what do you do?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, more issue politics.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Like what kind of issues?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Oh well, you know, the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights.&#8221; [Laughs] You know, I just listed them all, and he got this stunned look on his face because it was sort of a Republican firm and he said, &#8220;Well, when you start practicing law do you intend to still be involved in those sorts of things?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, as much time as I have, and I don&#8217;t expect I&#8217;ll have as much time as I&#8217;ve had in the past, but yeah.&#8221; So that made that partner very nervous but I guess he decided not to blackball me because I was one step from being hired, and after all I was a national moot court champion and they did want to put that in their resume. [Laughs] So that&#8217;s the only time it came up directly, that I can recall, in interviews and I figured that it was over when I had to answer that question. [Laughs] JF: Did you get offered a job by them? WS: I did, so. [Laughs] People are not really like flat characters; they&#8217;re very complex, all of them, and maybe that's what we don&#8217;t understand enough of and that&#8217;s why we didn&#8217;t get as far as we should have with the Equal Rights Amendment. Maybe if we&#8217;d understood a little more how complex people can be. But anyway, so then when I started practicing I immediately went to a&#8212;well not immediately but within a few months&#8212;to a meeting of a bunch of women who were talking about forming a women&#8217;s bar organization in Knoxville. There were minority bars and there was the defense bar and the plaintiff&#8217;s bar and all these other little sort of subgroups of the bar but we were starting to have a fair number of women and we thought that meeting for lunch and sharing experiences and whatever, networking, might be a good idea. So I went to an organizational meeting for that and that really scared the people I worked for. I don&#8217;t know; I mean they acted like it was almost a betrayal. It was a weird kind of response, and as other women eventually were in the firm if two of us went to lunch together they started getting nervous like we were plotting against them. [Laughs] If we got in a room and shut the door to talk about something they would get nervous and be knocking on the door, trying to find out what&#8217;s going on. I mean it was kind of funny, actually. I sort of enjoyed it. [Laughs] And there were some people who felt that it was inappropriate to have a separate women&#8217;s bar, that it was somehow threatening that the women didn&#8217;t want to be a part of the big bar or they didn&#8217;t&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know what they expected us to do, but anyway, that organization has survived now thirty years so I guess people have become a little more comfortable with it. Of course three of our five justices on the Tennessee Supreme Court are women now and one of them is a former president of that East Tennessee Lawyers&#8217; Association for Women that we formed. JF: That&#8217;s pretty remarkable. WS: So it&#8217;s a little more accepted now than it was. But it was funny to watch them. I mean it was like they thought we were union organizers or something all the time. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] Well we&#8217;re getting close to noon, so I just had maybe one other question and then I always close by asking my interviewee if there&#8217;s anything that I didn&#8217;t ask that you thought I would ask or that you&#8217;d like to add, but I guess my last question would be how being a part of the women&#8217;s movement has influenced you as a parent? WS: Well as a parent it definitely made me think about gender roles and gender expectations. I made sure that my son had dump trucks and dolls; I made sure my daughter had exposure to sports as well as to tea parties. It would be interesting to ask them how that really affected them [Laughs] in the long run. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d like the answer all the way around. But I was conscious of it, although I must say with my son, he was my first child, I was very, very careful to if I read him a child&#8217;s book and it was sexist I corrected the language as I read it to him. We only had a black and white TV and it broke so we didn&#8217;t have all the TV and those kinds of influences to worry about. I took him with me to NOW meetings, I took him with me to feminist meetings, so I knew pretty much everything he&#8217;d been exposed to when he was two, two and a half years old. One day we pulled into a fast food place and just pulled into a parking spot and while I was getting ready to get out a woman in a pickup truck pulled in next to us and my son started just laughing hysterically. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Darren, what is the matter? What are you laughing at?&#8221; He looked at me and he said, &#8220;Womans don&#8217;t drive trucks.&#8221; [Laughs] And I thought oh my lord; it must be in the genes. [Laughs] Where does he get this notion? I know everything he&#8217;s been exposed to, I&#8217;ve been so careful to not raise him in a sexist way, and he thinks it&#8217;s hilarious that a woman&#8217;s driving a truck. So, I don&#8217;t know where it came from but obviously&#8212;. [Laughs] Obviously there was something in his brain that told him it was wrong, and maybe it&#8217;s just that he hadn&#8217;t seen women driving trucks, that there just weren&#8217;t that many women that he had seen, but I thought that was funny. No, I was going to raise the perfect child from a gender standpoint and, you know, then you get outnumbered by teachers and friends and other things so your influence is not nearly as much as you think it&#8217;s going to be when they&#8217;re two. [Laughs] But he&#8217;s grown up to be a very nice kid and I think he&#8217;s very sensitive to issues of equal opportunity, so that&#8217;s good, as are all my kids. So, yes, I tried hard to be a mother who raised them in egalitarian ways and then I just quickly learned how little power I actually had. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] I&#8217;m sure it had an influence. WS: Well I have a picture of my older two in their white outfits going to the march on Washington, the Equal Rights Amendment July 9 big march on Washington. I think it was the first time we had over a million people, or whatever it was, show up, a hundred thousand or whatever the number was, and I was a marshal in that parade and took the kids. The newspaper came and took pictures of them because they were wearing certain outfits and so that&#8217;s like in the baby book for each of them, which was cause of some embarrassment to them for awhile and now they think it&#8217;s kind of cool. My daughter, Elena, her middle name&#8212;. I was working on my master&#8217;s thesis and I came across an article about Lilith, Adam&#8217;s first wife before Eve. I&#8217;d never heard of that, so I lost three or four days reading about Lilith instead of working on my master&#8217;s thesis. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] WS: I was pregnant and I was trying to get everything finished before she was born, but I got distracted and I read all about Lilith and I was fascinated by it all. So I gave her Lilith as a middle name and I was so proud of that. I thought it was so forward looking of me. I kept the research, I put it in her baby book so she would know why that name, and I don&#8217;t know, she was eight or ten and I explained to her what it was all about and she was not impressed at all [Laughs] and by the time she was in high school she found it very embarrassing. [Laughs] You know, I thought, okay, all my efforts to raise them with the right attitude; they are their own people, and that&#8217;s good. I raised them to be independent. But then she went to college and took a religious studies course and had to write a paper and she had gotten angry because she&#8217;d run into sexist professors so she was starting really to kind of decide maybe I wasn&#8217;t a fanatic and maybe there was something to these concerns I had. So she wanted to write her paper on Lilith and asked me to send her that research so she could use that to start, so I said, okay, I&#8217;ll do that, if you send me your paper. So I sent her the research and she did some more research and she wrote a nice paper and she sent me a copy of it and it was a very nice explanation of the Lilith legend and all the things that went with it, and at the very end she said, &#8220;The thing I like best about the Lilith legend is my mother loved me enough to name me Lilith.&#8221; So I thought, well, maybe we do have a little more power than we think at times when we&#8217;re raising kids. [Laughs] You just never know. Then my youngest child, she grew up when I was doing a lot of events to raise money for the Susan B. Anthony Scholarship and all that was going on, and so I took her with me to all of it and I had friends who were musicians who were writing songs that we were using in various events and they would come to the house and sing while she was pretty impressionable, five, six, seven, eight years old, and she&#8217;d be up on the stage, so she&#8217;s been very much a part of all of it. A couple years ago, maybe three or four years ago, we went to Nashville because the national NOW had their national convention in Nashville, and it was handy, so we went together to the convention. We were seated in a room with Ellie Smeal and several of the people who are well known in NOW, and she had taken a women&#8217;s studies minor in college so she knew some&#8212;. I think she just did it because she figured she already knew it and it would be an easy A, but she took it and she knew some of the names and so forth. Anyway, they had called me and asked me to come join them because they were having some discussion about what was going to go on at the convention and she was sitting in the back acting bored. I guess she was maybe in college by then but I can&#8217;t remember exactly the timing. All of a sudden she realized who these people were, the names. Somebody spoke the first and last name of someone and then she started to put together that it was Kim McMillan and Ellie Smeal and she just about came out of her skin. [Laughs] So she took one of the big round NOW signs that you see all the time, because we were doing a demonstration down there at one point, and she took it around and got everybody to sign it, all of these people that she had read about and that she thought were so wonderful, so now she has that sign framed and in her office. JF: [Laughs] WS: Very proud of having met all those people and having been to the convention and been part of it. So, yes, it affected my parenting, and I hope not badly. [Laughs] JF: It doesn&#8217;t sound like it was at all [bad.] WS: Well I&#8217;m sure there were some bad parts to it but I don&#8217;t know them. They&#8217;re not going to tell me yet. [Laughs] JF: [Laughs] Well my mom always said she had to be a bad mom sometimes. [Laughs] WS: Well the problem is you&#8217;re human, you know? You&#8217;re never going to be really good at anything all the time, so you&#8217;ve got to give yourself a little space to make mistakes. [Laughs] JF: Excellent advice. WS: So, anyway, my kids I think would say it probably affected the way they were brought up. JF: Well, is there anything you thought I would ask that I didn&#8217;t or something you&#8217;d like to add that didn&#8217;t come up? WS: Oh, I can&#8217;t think of a thing. You&#8217;ve been very thorough. [Laughs] I just hope that the young women of today will organize again because you&#8217;ve got a much better world to try to make change in. When we were doing what we did for the Equal Rights Amendment it was so hard to get the word out and everything had to be mailed and everything had to be typed by hand and run off of mimeo machines and we didn&#8217;t have offices and copy machines and faxes and computers and email and all those things. It&#8217;s so much easier to get the word out now. You won&#8217;t face the same kind of economic barriers that we did. You won&#8217;t have to have bake sales for the ERA like we did. [Laughs] So I hope, I really do hope, that the young women of today will organize again with new energy and make something happen before my granddaughter turns eighteen, and she&#8217;ll be three in July so that&#8217;s fifteen years. You need to get with it. [Laughs] JF: We&#8217;ve got a timeline. WS: Okay, that&#8217;s good. [Laughs] JF: Well I think that this interview is going to be a really valuable addition and I&#8217;m so glad we had a chance to do another interview with you. WS: Well it&#8217;s great to talk to you. It&#8217;s important stuff. JF: Absolutely. WS: It&#8217;s very important and there&#8217;s still a lot to be done. JF: Well thank you for everything you&#8217;ve done. WS: I haven&#8217;t accomplished a thing. [Laughs] JF: I don&#8217;t know about that. WS: We have a statue. We did get the statue finished. JF: You have a statue. WS: That&#8217;s about it. JF: I wish it was a little closer. I&#8217;d ask if I could get a picture of you in front of it. WS: It&#8217;s only a block or two away. Do you want to go see it? JF: If you wanted to do that. WS: I&#8217;ll take you to see it. JF: Excellent. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do next. WS: All right. JF: Thank you...
