 Stephanie Rytilahti: All right. Today is Monday January 31st. My name is Stephanie Rytilahti and I am meeting with Melody Ivins in her home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. So I&#8217;m building on the interview that we did last time in Jacquelyn Hall&#8217;s class and I wanted to start at a place where we left off. And I remember Jacquelyn had asked you, she had posed in the historiography that a lot of people see activism as coming out of the left and people finding their movements of activism through the civil rights movement. And she had asked you if you had come through this movement through feminism and you had said that yeah that you thought that was pretty accurate to your experience. Melody Ivins: Yeah. Feminism was my primary interest, like what I took most personally. But I was also outraged by the racial relations in Smithfield. The Vietnam War was going on and, you know, everyone under thirty seemed to oppose the Vietnam War. So the organizations and interests overlapped in every conceivable way. And I sort of prematurely told you about the feminist about ten years older than me that I met in the early days who were my role models and mentors. We met at a women&#8217;s fusion encampment at Savannah River, Georgia. And they were Mab Segrest, lesbian feminist author who worked with North Carolinians Against Racist and Religious Violence; she&#8217;s the founder of that and with the magazine Feminary. Mandy Carter who you&#8217;ll get to talk to more and Mandy--this was War Resistor&#8217;s League back then--and she has worked for every organization. She worked against the Jesse Helms campaign. She&#8217;s been doing for the last decade, she&#8217;s been doing a lot on people of color, gay, lesbian, queer, bi rights and she&#8217;s nationally renowned now and we are so lucky to have her here in Durham. And the third was Candy Hamilton who I was closest to of the three. Candy was from Atlanta where she worked on the Big Speckled Bird, Great Speckled Bird, sorry. And she--. SR: What was the--? MI: An underground newspaper. SR: Ok. MI: And she had friends that were at the occupation of Wounded Knee who called her and said, &#8220;Please come up here. We need you. We need more journalists.&#8221; And she wound up staying, she was there through the occupation and she worked on Pine Ridge Reservation for fifteen years. She came back here and organized for the Leonard Peltier Support Committee, which was the entr&#233;e for a lot of us into aboriginal rights and, you know, overlapped nicely with civil rights. And there were women in my circle who were working on the situation in Nicaragua, Latin America in general. You name it. We belonged to three, four, five groups each and we were all working for all kinds of peace and justice organizations. Peace was the one that we all had in common with probably women&#8217;s rights with gay/lesbian would probably be the other one that we all had in common. SR: So then would you say then the realm of activism and interest then was it more focused on the world outside of Chapel Hill and the Triangle? Or was it a mix of kind of local concerns and kind of this larger spectrum you&#8217;re referring to? MI: Yes it was a mixture. I mean we would--there were lots of protests in front of the Chapel Hill Post Office protesting foreign wars, but also protesting domestic policy or very domestic issues what was going on right here in town. My friend George who was part of the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange men&#8217;s group got very involved. He left for a while. He was back for grad school in Chapel Hill and he was very involved in the health keeper&#8217;s struggle for better wages and better working conditions. So at the time I had been in Durham about ten years. And if you don&#8217;t drive, Durham is a long way from Chapel Hill. SR: Yeah. MI: George picked me up and brought me over here for a Martin Luther King celebration, and I was looking forward to Old Home Week when I would see all my old buddies. Well the way that everyone moves around here, there weren&#8217;t as many people [5:00], not as many of my old friends, but all of these middle-aged and older African-American women came up and hugged George because they knew him through the housekeeper&#8217;s work. That was fun. SR: So what was the overlap then with the black freedom struggle? You mentioned the Martin Luther King Day. MI: Um [pause], there was a lot more involvement in the circles that I moved in once I got to Durham which has a much more African-American community. We used to joke in Chapel Hill that everybody that lived in Chapel Hill for a while grew up and moved to Durham. You know, housing&#8217;s less expensive, there are some amenities. I found my lesbian friends to always be the smartest about finding the best housing for the least price. So if you were moving into a neighborhood with several lesbian couples you done good [both laugh]. But, you know, on reflection the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange was whiter than we wanted it to be when we were doing that activism. We certainly collected books about every ethnicity and women with disabilities and, you know, we were very concerned about all of that. We had a handful of African-American members. But, you know, the majority were hunkies like me. And Durham was a different story. Durham was very mixed in every conceivable way and we had a really wonderfully diverse community supporting Southern Sisters , making use of its resources and volunteering there. But I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve lost track of your original question. SR: No that was perfect. I was just kind of really looking more at the overlap and the entanglements of the different movements for justice. And I guess I was wondering did the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange predate Southern Sisters? MI: That was the library that opened in &#8217;83 and ran for ten years, moved several times. It is now at the Duke University Women&#8217;s Center because UNC had no women&#8217;s center then. And the Orange County Women&#8217;s Center kicked us out for having lesbian material always on the shelf. They were old, rich white women and they were easily freaked out [laughs]. SR: So what was their initial attraction to your group? MI: They wanted a library. They had a fabulous big house on North Street very near town. SR: In Chapel Hill? MI: In Chapel Hill. We had 5,000 volumes. We were the local experts. SR: Wait, you had 5,000? MI: We had 5,000 volumes [SR gasps]. We had a lot of women donating books. Mostly Spring and I--. My dearest friend in the world now is Spring Brooks and she was the volunteer at the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange that wouldn&#8217;t go away. And would always come back and do whatever needed doing. So we spent a lot of our spare time trading in books that had been donated that we didn&#8217;t need. We had our route amongst the used bookstores just swapping for the books we did need, bring them back, catalog them, get them on the shelves. SR: So if I was a patron, how did that work if I wanted a book on whatever topic? MI: Well we&#8217;d ask you to sign up--we were a membership library. But dues were low as five dollars a year. Course this was twenty years ago and we were incredibly poor. To us five dollars was a lot of money. We also asked for people that could afford to pay ten or twenty and you would come into our first home was the size of this modest living room. And we probably only had 2,000 volumes when we were in the front office at the business where I worked. But you would come in and we&#8217;d ask you to fill out an index card, pay your dues. We&#8217;d ask you if you needed help or if you wanted to browse, because even in that it was a very cozy and safe space. But even then, women might be shy initially to ask where are the books on, you know, questioning your sexual orientation or, &#8220;Where are your books on Goddess religion?&#8221; So people would browse. We&#8217;d be doing our little clerical work and chatting and they might join in the conversation. And you could borrow as many books as you wanted to. We had the old fashioned checkout system, the card in the back that you&#8217;d sign. Books were due I think a month later. We had a long long list of perpetual overdues [10:00]. I would threaten to go to people&#8217;s houses and reclaim the books [laughs]. People came in and just browsed. We had magazines; we had hugely back issues of some things that we couldn&#8217;t afford subscriptions. People would come in and ask questions. We had an embryonic, you know, what would grow into the magnificent bulletin board and (indecipherable) at Southern Sisters. Someone said, &#8220;Here is my situation,&#8221; &#8220;Here is what I want to know more about,&#8221; &#8220;This is the kind of therapist I&#8217;m looking for,&#8221; we would get cracking on getting referrals. And we sold buttons and bumper stickers to help make a little bit of money that we needed for office supplies. The buttons got us in trouble a few times; they were kind of rowdy. SR: What were the buttons? MI: Dip me in honey and throw me to the lesbians [both laugh]. I think there were some that were sort of insulting toward mainstream religion. Yeah, the whole thing. SR: So this sounds like a collapse. You know when we talked about Southern Sisters, you had mentioned that there was kind of a chasm between the lesbian community and the owners of that place just the type of merchandise available. Now was this more of a collective effort where you had straight women and lesbian women working together? MI: Yeah. The Women&#8217;s Book Exchange, we were all young. We were fairly rowdy. We were fascinated by anything then. So I think I had the first pass made at me that I recognized as a pass at the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange. And this was one of the women that was visiting that told me there are such thing as lesbian presses and people will expect to see their books here. She was also a sign language interpreter and I&#8217;m fascinated by sign language. So she&#8217;s showing me a few signs and she showed me the ones for you and me and it was something like this for play [laughs]. And I went, &#8220;Oh, you and me play? Ooh, show me more!&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Oh. And here&#8217;s, &#8216;moving right along.&#8217;&#8221; [Both laugh] It was a few days before I realized, &#8220;[gasps] She thought I was cute!&#8221; You know [laughs]. So it&#8217;s all part of my education. Yeah we were, lesbian feminism was what the young folks were into and the straight young women were into. And a lot of people were questioning their identity. A lot of people were, you know, experimenting with being bi or whatever. Separatism was still a big I&#8217;d say a big strain. That&#8217;s as good a term as any, but an important concept. And you know we knew separatists and eventually moved the Book Ex into a separatist face because that&#8217;s all that was available. Although we were gay and straight and we had our men&#8217;s group who were gay and straight. So yeah it was a real adjustment to move from that to pretty much simultaneously move the women&#8217;s book exchange into the Orange County Women&#8217;s Center, which had a mostly older constituency who really threw their weight around. Now the director was our age and we loved her and trusted her. SR: What was her name? MI: Frances Henderson. SR: Ok. MI: And you are welcome to talk to her. She now runs the Dispute Settlement Center and she&#8217;s magnificent. But even Frances and the other board members and the other staff, I think they learned some hard lessons in who was really running the Women&#8217;s Center no matter what the bylaws said in this battle, because the wealthy older women wouldn&#8217;t play by their own rules. They were just so determined to get rid--either censor us or get rid of us. SR: And it was because of specifically of the lesbian content or was the feminist content--? MI: Specifically. SR: Was fine. MI: As far as I understood it. I know one of the women, when Spring called, someone who is now an elected official and I will not name her, although Spring says she won&#8217;t forgive this group unless this woman kisses Spring&#8217;s ass&#8230; in Main Street at noon on a Saturday for a crap [both laugh]. When Spring confirmed conferred with her she said, &#8220;You know the only materials that everyone is complaining about are lesbian materials.&#8221; Now what is it, are you homophobic or what? And this older more politically adept woman immediately went and filled out complaints about a poem about rape by Marge Piercy. And, I don&#8217;t know she did or she got someone else to fill out a complaint about a flier for a Halloween service at the Eno River Unitarian [15:00] Universalist Church featuring Goddess religion, about which they knew nothing. They saw the name Hecate and reached out. But I think they were really looking for other things to complain about. It was the lesbian material, explicitly sexual lesbian material. We had a handful of sex manuals, you know, for everybody. And when we found, the incident that set things off, somebody had taken one of the lavishly illustrated ones and put it on display in the middle of the library. None of our volunteers would have done anything like that. Somebody thought this was funny or somebody wanted to shock the rich old ladies. But they got a complain about that and we said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to upset anybody who is unprepared for sexually explicit imagery. We will pull these books out of--.&#8221; We had a section named &#8220;Bodies.&#8221; It was all kind of health, sports. &#8220;We&#8217;ll pull these out and put them on a high shelf. We&#8217;ll label them &#8216;sexuality,&#8217; so anyone, you&#8217;ll know what you&#8217;re going to find if you reach up there. Little kids can&#8217;t reach it.&#8221; We were willing to go that far and they were still, they said, &#8220;No. We have to keep them under lock and key and available on request only.&#8221; We said, &#8220;No one will request them.&#8221; SR: Yeah because that doesn&#8217;t facilitate--. MI: They had been some of our most popular books to people who were simply curious, you know? They just wanted to know what all the fuss was about. But yeah nobody&#8217;s going to file a request a week in advance with the librarian so they could borrow it. SR: Right. MI: Or that they could take a peek. And they were completely unwilling to compromise, and it turned out they didn&#8217;t have to because they could withhold their funds. They could refuse to support the women&#8217;s center. And Frances and the existing board when we moved in stood up, I mean risked the funding, risked these women&#8217;s displeasure. The older women they should that she was one of their own. Frances Weaver, a retired UNC librarian, who was, you know, about their age group. But these women were so ignorant about what a library does. They thought that they could assign Frances to our committee that was considering the problem and how to solve it and that she would, you know, ride hard on us. She stood up for us! She said, &#8220;They&#8217;re doing the exact right thing. They&#8217;re being good librarians. This is appropriate. They&#8217;re right. If you lock the books up, they won&#8217;t be used and that would be a shame.&#8221; So they ignored her and they waited until--again all this behind the scene scheming we finally found out about later--they waited until a new president of their board was elected. And they had her, who was willing to do anything they said to get funding, so they could redecorate again; that kind of crap. As soon as she took office, she took Spring out to lunch and said, &#8220;You can either accept our removing the materials that we find offensive and leave the library here, or you can remove the whole library.&#8221; She being generous in giving us a choice to remove our books rather than be sanctioned. So we moved the library. It was in storage for a while. And this is when it hit the press. Women were outraged. It was such a black eye for the Orange County Women&#8217;s Center. Frances resigned, Frances Henderson. Half of their board resigned in protest. SR: Wow. MI: But the money and the connections were on the other side, and they begged us to not go public with this story. But we were pretty nice. We didn&#8217;t say much. But all the documents, all the complaints, all of that is now at Perkins. SR: Oh that&#8217;s interesting. MI: Yeah Jenny Daly asked for our papers. Spring and I eventually donated the library to the Duke Women&#8217;s Center. SR: So there wasn&#8217;t a campus Women&#8217;s Center at UNC. MI: At that time there was not, mm-mm [no]. SR: Were most of, were there any types of things similar to a women&#8217;s center at UNC or was most of the kind of spaces that women would go to outside of the university structure? MI: Outside the university structure. Women&#8217;s Book Exchange had been one of them. Internationalist Books was another. For socializing, [20:00] for political events, a lot of Chapel Hill women went to Durham because that&#8217;s where the community was really thriving. And that&#8217;s one reason we located Southern Sisters in Durham, and only then found out that a lot of Chapel Hillians will not go to Durham for anything [laughs]. SR: Because? MI: Well because Durham--I&#8217;m speaking with ridiculous prejudice--because Durham was big and dirty and poor and there were a lot of black people as you know. A lot of Duke students never left campus because if they set foot outside the vault, there would be poor black people. [imitating them] &#8220;Oh my God!&#8221; And I was amazed by my little culture shock moving from Chapel Hill to Durham. Chapel Hill anywhere you go for food, if you want your sandwich on whole wheat bread they&#8217;ll do it and they&#8217;ve heard of vegetarians before. Durham it&#8217;s like, &#8220;You want what kind of bread?&#8221; [Both laugh] Now Ninth Street near campus and we&#8217;re talking twenty years ago. You know, Ninth Street near campus was much more like the community I was used to. But a lot of Durham was not at all amenable to the bohemian vegetarian new-age ridiculous people with funny hair [laughs]. SR: But they still had sort of a movement there though at the same time. MI: Yeah yeah. The movement was there. The movement operated in, you know, there was Ninth street. There was the Durham YWCA was a tremendous institution there for decades. And this is where everybody had their offices, you know, rape crisis and battered women. And then there was a smaller building downtown where Mandy and Candy had their offices, where the rent was really cheap and it was a little dangerous. But everybody who worked at the Y, you had dances as fundraisers, the offices were there, you could get all your networking done, you know. And then they had a big blow up. This would be right before, right before Southern Sisters opened, a couple years before so maybe &#8217;86. And it was a wonderfully integrated YWCA. But these tensions came up between these organizations and the fault line was the black women accusing the white women of being racist and the white women accusing the black women of being homophobic because a lot of the white volunteers were gay or at least very supportive. And you know I&#8217;m sure there were other issues, but this is where the line was drawn. And sadly the Y kind of imploded. It ceased to be the great community center and office housing that it had been. SR: What kind of a role do you think those types of spaces played in these different movements? So having caf&#233;s, bookstores, bars, YWCAs, what type of--? MI: Oh they&#8217;re absolutely essential! That&#8217;s where women meet each other. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re trying to, well we didn&#8217;t even know we were looking for but we know it when we see it. That&#8217;s where we make connections. Connections is what it&#8217;s all about. Talking is what it&#8217;s all about. Um [pause] yeah something--. Women&#8217;s Book Exchange was in many ways, you know, a smaller younger poorer beginning for Southern Sisters. Southern Sisters had many more resources. There were more people that were aware of the need for the books. We had contacts with professional communities working on women&#8217;s issues, the activists working on women&#8217;s issues. SR: Did you have a relationship with the university in terms of selling books? MI: Women&#8217;s Book Exchange didn&#8217;t sell books. Southern Sisters we tried. Most Duke students wouldn&#8217;t leave campus and drive into dirty dangerous frightening downtown Durham to get their textbooks. And I found out that one grad student in women&#8217;s studies, thinking that she was doing the right thing, when she asked us to tie up like ten percent of our inventory for a whole semester, or that&#8217;s how I took it. We had to have the books the entire semester if anybody needed them. She also ordered all the same books in The Regulator to give the students a choice, which meant that we were completely screwed and I explained to her and she was aghast at what she had done. You know if we were a bigger store it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered, but we appeared luxurious. The store was huge and gorgeous and we had some money behind it. [25:00] But not enough to sit on twenty--. SR: No. MI: Yeah. Yeah. SR: Yeah just in a lot of the other research that I did a lot of the feminist bookstores were able to be successful because they were able to have a strong partnership with women&#8217;s studies departments. And that ended up being a huge revenue base and kind of forging that connection between academia and kind of a more wide activist circle. But it sounds like that wasn&#8217;t--. MI: [Door slams] Guys. Be nice to your mother. Testosterone, I tell ya [SR laughs]. Pardon me one moment. Would you like something to snack on, would you like more tea? SR: No I&#8217;m fine. MI: Ok. I think I&#8217;m going to take a smoke break if you want to--. SR: Yeah absolutely. MI: Thanks. [Recorder turned off then on, 25:50] SR: So I guess what I wanted to ask because I was kind of asking about the relationship between the bookstore and Duke University and then you were of course a student at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. So what do you think was the relationship locally between these other movements and what was going on inside of the university? MI: That&#8217;s a very good question. SR: Kind of what the push and pull was between the two. MI: Yeah. I will say that while selling books for women&#8217;s studies classes was not as successful, we had tremendous support from the women&#8217;s studies programs starting with Jean O&#8217;Barr and various professors. SR: At Duke? MI: At Duke. And also faculty at Central were very supportive and marvelous advisors. It just didn&#8217;t translate into sales from our premises. The other, I talked a little bit when I was in class the other night about this chasm between women&#8217;s studies at that point. This was late 80s into the early 90s and the activist feminist community. The activist feminists were working on nitty gritties like battered women&#8217;s shelters and rape crises and the needs of incest survivors and survivors of child sexual abuse were just being known. The Courage to Heal had just come out. This was huge. The recovery movement was just getting going and was huge. And the university was off doing very very intellectual very very removed deconstruction, post-feminist theory. SR: Right. MI: Several of my friends said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be a post-feminist in a post-patriarchy.&#8221; There were people with a foot in both worlds. I remember in particular a brilliant grad student who was doing American women&#8217;s history who had come into feminism by volunteering at a battered women&#8217;s shelter. She said, &#8220;I, you know, I&#8217;m starting to think my head will explode. I just, even discussing history, discussing the history of sexual violence, the rest of my community has no connection with what&#8217;s actually going on in the community.&#8221; SR: Do you remember her name? MI: I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t. SR: And when you say that you&#8217;re referring specifically to Chapel Hill. MI: Nope. We did meet at Duke. SR: Duke. Was there a difference with the state universities? With Central, Chapel Hill? MI: That&#8217;s a good question. At the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange, we had a handful of professors and more than a handful of grad students were very very interested and very supportive. And Jacquelyn was one of those people and I will love her until the day that I die for that alone. There&#8217;s Beth, to a lesser extent, Bethany Atkins who is one of our great women writers. Some sent money and never set foot in the place. But it was small. There was a decent support. Of course UNC was struggling to even develop a women&#8217;s studies program at the time and they did not, there wasn&#8217;t a meeting place for them on campus. There was no place for women in different disciplines to get to know each other. I really really like the changes I see all these years later. And Women&#8217;s Book Exchange was right across, we were on Franklin and Henderson, so we were right across the street from campus and it was easy for campus folks that wanted to [30:00] to come find us there. Southern Sisters was [darkly in a sarcastic manner] dangerous downtown [both laugh]. It was dangerous. We got broken into repeatedly. We got tires slashed. Some scary things happened. But so far as really, gosh I feel like I&#8217;m losing my thread. Institutional support, there wasn&#8217;t institutional support. There was individual support from both universities. SR: And then the other movements you were involved in, so if you were talking about the peace movement or the Triangle Area Feminists, were there people in there either graduate students, undergrads, or professors who had some institutional backing, you know, who were attending the university or was there really an ongoing chasm? MI: The folks that I know, and I didn&#8217;t know everybody that were (31:00), but seminary did some great scholarly publishing with an activist focus. Mab Segrest, Catherine Nicholson a magnificent playwright and director were highly educated folk from other universities that might have an affiliation with Duke. I think Catherine was retired by the time that she moved here. So we had these great scholars, but their activism in the feminist movement was separate from that. SR: But the question I would have then, you talked about things that I would recognize as feminist practices happening when you talked about Jacquelyn Hall&#8217;s class, like you talked about consciousness raising groups. MI: Yes. SR: These feminist ideals were spilling over into the classroom. MI: Yes. SR: Was that pushing people to try and change the curriculum and the practice of a more traditional setting? MI: Oh yes. SR: So how did that play out? MI: It took a long time. It took a long time. There was a lot of resistance here in part because UNC is a state-supported school and Jesse Helms was still calling the shots for the state budget to a great extent. There was only so much we could do without running into opposition not only from conservative male professors, threatened male professors, the hierarchies on campus but also on the state level. So I think Duke may well have been able to move more quickly in establishing because they didn&#8217;t have accountability at that level. They had to make things right with their big donors who were probably not radical feminists [both laugh]. SR: Yeah, still might not be. MI: But yeah I think the note I sent Jackie that I think she shared with you reflecting after talking with your class, I wan an aspiring poet. I took the, what is it, six semester, five semester honors program in poetry writing taught by a man who I&#8217;m sure thought he was progressive but had an enormous ego and told us what we could and could not write about. And politics were strictly, oh political poetry--we kind of had to write like him. He didn&#8217;t tell me but he told another woman student in my class in a private conversation that there had not been a great woman poet [pause], which means this asshole had not read Sappho or Audrey Rich just for starters and Gwendolyn Brooks. I did a whole paper on sexism and the Norton Anthology of Poetry, the big blue anthology we used in every single class. Just looking at the headnotes, how the different artists were introduced and the number of egregious errors and facts describing the work in the lives of the few women that were represented, were jaw dropping. And these were the attitudes of the known professors in the English department. I took, gosh when I was in undergrad there were maybe ten classes in all the disciplines that were cross-listed with women&#8217;s studies because there was not yet a women&#8217;s studies program. SR: Wait there wasn&#8217;t a program yet? MI: It was early on. There were a few courses. SR: Ok. MI: There wasn&#8217;t a program there. You couldn&#8217;t major in women&#8217;s studies when I was in undergrad much less get a master&#8217;s. And I know the scholars who were teaching the classes and the grad students were pushing. My friends in the English department were pushing. But it was, you know, incremental until I had [35:00] this fabulous, it was the year that the Klan and the Nazis shot the Communists in Greensboro. I think that&#8217;s &#8217;78, &#8217;77. Had a wonderful wonderful young visiting professor from Canada teaching the first course cross-listed between philosophy and women&#8217;s studies. And boy she was such a culture shock bless her heart. And I was one of the people that was trying to help her understand what she was overhearing on campus, the redneck boys, &#8220;Oh I should have shot some more of &#8216;em.&#8221; But it was a serious question. One of the questions that we decided to discuss over the course of the semester was why have there been no great women artists? And actually my Norton Anthology paper was for her because I was starting to catch onto what was going on in the English department. And I don&#8217;t know if, Germaine Greer&#8217;s book, The Obstacle Race, where Germaine went to Europe and found the great unrecognized women artists and documented them and changed the world. I don&#8217;t know if that book didn&#8217;t come out until a couple years later or if I didn&#8217;t find it until a couple years later. But it was in the late 70s; this was a real question. Were we not creative enough? Were we just not determined enough? Why should you bother trying to be an artist or a poet when you were a married woman? Perhaps your period interfered with you, you know, executing your work perfectly? Course perhaps being denied an education and the opportunity could have interfered, but [laughs]. SR: So how do we get back to all these counter-ideas though? Was this in women&#8217;s studies classes or was this in one of your own outside circles? Like how did you know about Adrian Rich? How did you get these counter-examples? Because I think a lot of times we accept those ideas because we haven&#8217;t been taught how to criticize and challenge but it sounds like you were coming to an awareness of how to critically do that. MI: Slowly a piece at a time. I had really smart friends who read widely. I read everything I could get my hands on. I remember working on the paper on the Norton Anthology. I found the little corner in the undergraduate library devoted to anthologies by women because you know I think they left some women out of this big blue book. And here was a shelf maybe this big, but it traced really good really important women&#8217;s writing, you know, from Sappho to the present. My hair stood on end. I, you know, electricity running up and down my spine. I said, &#8220;I have ancestors! I have ancestors.&#8221; So if some wise librarians had gathered those books, whether they were being circulating or consulting a lot, and had put them together for someone who wanted more to find. And there were professors like Jacquelyn and I wish I could remember the name of the wonderful young woman from Canada, that if you went to their office and said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this I need to know more about it.&#8221; And there were librarians. I love librarians. There were people that would help you. They were people that would help you. And there were publications that, especially once I started running the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange and collecting them: Miss magazine, Off Our Backs--Off Our Backs was crucial. Eventually there was the Women&#8217;s Review of Books and it might be after four years that an important book of feminist scholarship arrived or biography. But eventually they would print a very intelligent very useful review that you wouldn&#8217;t have seen anywhere else. But I did have the experience at Southern Sisters, again when we were trying to get the new books in, reading Women&#8217;s Review of Books and went, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to have this book!&#8221; And it was out of print by the time it had been reviewed. SR: Oh [sadly]. So what happened when you wrote the paper on the Norton Anthology? How did your professor respond? MI: She loved it. She loved it. SR: Oh. I thought this was for the male professor. This was for the female professor? MI: Oh no, this was for the Canadian professor. SR: And she loved it. MI: She loved it and she said, because I was talking to her when I was working on it. She said, &#8220;Can you do the book? It&#8217;s 4,000 pages. Can you do sexism all the way in it?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No no no, I count pages, I&#8217;m going to look at the headnotes and I&#8217;m going to look for who was left out.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Ok that&#8217;s doable.&#8221; [40:00] She was really really impressed with the results and she said, &#8220;I think you&#8217;ve answered our question, resolved why there have been no great women,&#8221; fill in the blank. There have, they just haven&#8217;t been recognized, which in the arts it&#8217;s so tricky because one way we establish who is a great artist it&#8217;s when they have intellect and when they have followers. Well if nobody knows who you are, how do you have influence and followers? SR: Right. MI: Or even if people know who you are, but you get forgotten very quickly because they get forgotten about really quickly because there&#8217;s something odd about a woman being a really great artist, which I can think of as odd and I think other books nicer than that. But one of the great male poets, it was a male theologian, said that hearing a woman speak well in public was (indecipherable): it could happen but it&#8217;s sometimes like watching a dog dance on their back legs. This is how our great scholars read it for generations: as novelties; as quickly forgotten novelties. I&#8217;m still angry about that. SR: Well yeah it still happens. I&#8217;m wondering did you raise these points in classes where there were professors that didn&#8217;t have such an extensive viewpoint and how did that, and how did the other students respond? MI: You know I don&#8217;t know if the other students got to see my paper. I had given copies of it to everyone that wanted one. I discussed it with a lot of people. No, this is not a class where we shared papers, so that didn&#8217;t happen. And I didn&#8217;t, gosh you know I wish I had, copied the paper and given it to my professor of creative writing. There&#8217;s still time I think. He&#8217;s still [both laugh hard] on campus, that son of a bitch. But I certainly I was offering it with a lot of concrete information any time it came up. Like a few years out of my lengthy undergraduate careers I was working with one of my English professors who I thought was a really good guy. He was pretty nice as long as he took his meds. But the Norton people had asked him and another English professor here to assemble a Norton Anthology of modern drama. And I hear him on the phone to his crony saying, &#8220;Well if we have to include some women, I mean maybe Lily Hellman even though she&#8217;s not that good.&#8221; I was sitting in the office. So when he got off the phone I was able to come in and say, &#8220;How about,&#8221; and name four women playwrights he had never heard of, because by then we had the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange and I was finding these books and putting them in a good place. SR: What a resource. MI: What an education for me. SR: Were other students challenging sexist viewpoints in the classroom when you were a student? MI: Not many, not many, not often. I mean yeah it happened. But it was still, I mean, the culture of respect for the professors, the professors that would not have taken did not take being challenged well. The paucity of women teaching. SR: Did you think that students were hungry for feminism or they were involved in feminism? I&#8217;m just wondering how it percolated down. MI: Yeah, yeah. I have to try to make a distinction here between my friends and the people I hung out with and the other students in the class. The people I hung out with including the guys wanted to know more; they wanted to know more, and you know we traded ideas and we traded books. In fact it may have been my friend Jason Battle who handed me my first Adrienne Rich anthology. I really don&#8217;t, except in women&#8217;s studies classes, I don&#8217;t really remember this interest coming up. Although my fellow aspiring poet in the creative writing program, you know, it got back to me really quickly what my professor had said to her. Some of my undergraduate career, at least, I think I was still guilty of the phenomenon of thinking other women were kind of silly and interested in silly things. A lot of my close friends were guys fortunately [45:00]. At least I had the taste by then to choose guys who loved their mothers, treated their girlfriends well, you know, treated me with respect and affection. But I do remember--this for me was part of getting to the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange. It was recognizing myself, you know like counting up best friends, absolute closest friends, were two women. And you know the next eight people I really relied on were all guys and going, &#8220;You know why is that? What is going on with that?&#8221; And I started making an effort to pay more attention to the other women in my classes the other women that I met. And look at me now [both laugh]. SR: So I think another student in class asked you what the racial makeup was in the classroom and you said it had been mostly white women. MI: Yeah I&#8217;m starting to think that I don&#8217;t remember very clearly. But Jacquelyn offered that there weren&#8217;t that many African-Americans here--. SR: On campus. MI: That you could see at that time, which I&#8217;ve thought about that since. Given that so many of the high schools, given that so many of the people from UNC particularly then had been were from North Carolina and given how recently the high schools had integrated and how uphill it was for African-American students, I guess we shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised at that. SR: So was it different for the community groups that you were a part in? In activist circles, or these different, like you mentioned that the Y was very integrated and then you spoke to some of the politics. Was there more racial integration? MI: I would say in Chapel Hill at that time there was less integration. In Durham there was more. In Durham there has always been a more bigger and more activist community and folks, my hat is off to all the activists in Durham who figured out more quickly than some of the folks have of how to build bridges more quickly than some other folks have, how to build bridges. How to work with folks not exactly like yourself. SR: Right. And then what was your relationship then with the Triangle Area Feminists because I know you mentioned that in a couple of the emails that we exchanged and that might have been in the bio too that you gave to the class? MI: Their name is actually the Triangle Area Lesbian Feminists [TALF]. SR: Ok. MI: And they put out the newsletter that was absolutely essential reading if you wanted to know what was going on. And I wish I&#8217;m sure the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange&#8217;s copies of it are over at Perkins now. I would love to have a couple of those in hand to see the listings because it would include women&#8217;s, you know, War Resistor&#8217;s League and Women&#8217;s Strike for Peace and Women with Nicaragua Action and nanananananana [so on and so forth]; so the whole spectrum. Thoughtful articles, news on local women and local happenings; just a fabulous resource, a fabulous resource. Lucy, yeah, Lucy Harris was a part of that. Later on my friend Patience Vanderbush that I can put you in touch with who is a Women&#8217;s Book Exchange volunteer and then worked for the Chapel Hill Newsletter. It was, you know, we didn&#8217;t have formal brokered relationships; we had friendships. So I admired TALF enormously for the work they did, the information they provided. I, you know, pitched in every chance I could. When Bob Sheldon was murdered--Bob Sheldon was the founder of Internationalist--I was so heartbroken. Bob was a friend and a neighbor and a colleague and the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange had been housed at Internationalist for five years. I had to write something for Bob to be in tribute just for my own piece of mind and I sent it to the TALF newsletter. And they sent it on for Feminist Bookstore News. Carol Seejay saw it in the TALF newsletter and reprinted it there. SR: Oh wow! MI: I mean the network was so good that--. SR: That&#8217;s a really good networking example. MI: That&#8217;s a--oh it was such a great network. And you know Carol who was keeping up with what&#8217;s going on in feminists bookstores and publishing all over the country knew who Bob Sheldon was, knew what a big deal it was that he had been murdered. And she wrote me back and said, &#8220;I&#8217;d been looking for the right tribute for Bob, and when this showed up I knew I had it.&#8221; So [pause, 50:00] yeah I would say we had a great informal relationship with Triangle Area Lesbian Feminists. And did you ask about somebody else? SR: No I don&#8217;t think so. MI: Yeah they were an ad hoc ever-shifting group of women that got the news out. Oh at Southern Sisters when I was there, and it was my friend Patience who had been a Women&#8217;s Book Exchange volunteer and a basketball coach for girls. This was back--title nine was so new. There were not any girl athletes. So we were thrilled that Patience was working on that. But she got asked, TALF asked her to ask Southern Sisters about their anti-pornography policy. Here I am between my communities. I&#8217;m dealing with--and I have real affection and respect for the owners of Southern Sisters until they started acting like complete assholes. And I had really great affection and respect for the TALF community. These were friends that were closer to my age and closer to my beliefs. And I got put kind of in the line fighting between them. And I remember Cookie Teer even asking me to ask TALF if we could have final say on the story they ran. And Patience is like, &#8220;What?!&#8221; SR: And Cookie was one of the owners? MI: Cookie was the owner. Cookie was the most ferocious anti-porn activist. So here I am explaining a policy that I don&#8217;t actually believe in but trying to make it clear and trying to make it as palatable as possible to my peers. And did I overhear, somehow I overheard her and it got back to me later, that after, and Patience was very gracious about accepting the piece and they ran it. Somebody else overheard Patience and another friend discussing this after the fact and saying, &#8220;Well, you know, Melody has to cover for them&#8221; [laughs]. And that was an enormous difficulty for me. I wanted Southern Sisters to be the best women&#8217;s bookstore in the country. Food is important, books are as important in a different way. And getting the right books into the right hands is, you know, what I lived to do, what I still do every chance I get. And so having to navigate this set of restrictions and set of misunderstandings and insensitivities, and you know, try to do the job any way I can. SR: What were some of the other difficulties of fissures that arose, either with the bookstore or organizing in general that you remember from this time period? Whether we&#8217;re talking about feminism or from the other work you did. Like what was some of those divisions? Like there wasn&#8217;t coalition building at times? MI: There certainly wasn&#8217;t. I remember going to, I was supposed to be employed half-time but of course it took over my entire life. I lost my regular job working on the &#8217;84 election for Freeze Voter &#8217;84 and went to a War Resistor&#8217;s Retreat which would be--. Mandy Carter was there and Mab Segrest was there. This adorable young African-American feminist was determined to have a crush on me and kind of chase me around and tried to kiss me and tried to get in bed with me and I kept saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re so gorgeous, you&#8217;re so lovely and I&#8217;m straight. You&#8217;re so gorgeous, you&#8217;re so lovely, get out of my bed now!&#8221; [Laughs] This was a gathering of all kinds of these organizations including some men that behaved badly. Our local, our shared method of working was feminist was consensus based was generous to a fault. And we had some guys [55:00]. There was one older guy that insisted on squeezing all the women because he loved them so much and calling us girls. And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;We&#8217;re women, thank you very much.&#8221; That finally blew up at the closing ceremony, and he had the nerve to be completely offended that his well-intended insistence on not listening to what we wanted. And at one meeting, a guy not from the area, a guy working for some other branch of peace and disarmament attacked me and by extension Freeze Voter &#8217;84 as being [hysterical and boisterous voice], &#8220;Completely ineffective.&#8221; He was like one of these new left guys with the big boots on and just wanted to jump all over Freeze Voter and [hysterically], &#8220;They&#8217;re not doing their analysis right!&#8221; And instead of him, you know, winning the day and getting him to go, the entire group turned to me and went, &#8220;We&#8217;re so sorry.&#8221; And turned to him and went, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8221; [Both laugh] At least for the folks I hung out with most, the hardliners were popular. The hardliners came in. And I was interviewed by someone, a young woman reporting for a communist newspaper that was suppose to be interviewing me about, you know, the local feminist community and I was answering them the best I could. And she kept interrupting me what they should think, what the proper analysis was. The only thing I said the whole interview that impressed her was I said, &#8220;Well, you know, let&#8217;s go back to my house and get a cup of coffee, but you know my housemate and I have agreed not to do housework unless we feel like it so it&#8217;s kind of messy.&#8221; &#8220;Oh God I wish I could get my roommates to agree to that&#8221; [both laugh]. Oh I hadn&#8217;t bitched about the radical feminist organizing but I thought of them as I read the essays, &#8220;The Movement of Booing&#8221; essays and I&#8217;m reading Sara Evans for the first time. Wonderful book came out in &#8217;79, which you know has a lot about the local movements. And she mentions I think it may have been a version, they&#8217;re called the radical feminist committee. This may have been a precursor. But these were very radical lesbian feminists, Separate Do, Separates Streak Fair, whose model was clearly Communist party and they had a consolidated line. And the second day the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange was open we were so thrilled. We had 200 books by women all in one room and here were women doing, women I&#8217;ve written about doing all these things women weren&#8217;t supposed to be able to do. And we&#8217;re so thrilled that we&#8217;re meeting each other. And this woman comes up and says, &#8220;Now don&#8217;t you think that there&#8217;s something wrong with this? You&#8217;re just a cultural feminist.&#8221; Like, &#8220;And what&#8217;s wrong with that? What do you mean &#8216;just&#8217; cultural feminist?&#8221; Oh she had some analysis that if war broke out, if all the men disappeared, only those that we like to if all the men disappeared were really feminist problems. SR: Wait, what? Say that again? MI: Yeah. I&#8217;m sorry I think I&#8217;m attributing a line I heard later from some really hardcore separatist. I think I&#8217;m attributing to the Radical Feminist Organizing Committee person. But there was some overlap. There were women in both groups. It was something like Radical Feminist Organizing Committee said, &#8220;Now why are you working for peace because if war didn&#8217;t exist anymore, women would still be oppressed?&#8221; The only thing you should work on is women&#8217;s oppression and the way you should work on it is directly and politically. And we&#8217;re like, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I kind of want to read some books about history and biographies and learn a little more. And I also organize for women&#8217;s rights. What&#8217;s your problem?&#8221; Yeah it was the hardcore separatists, and I&#8217;ve heard a lot of great stuff from separatists. But some took it to such an extreme that they refused to consider that violence against women was a problem because it was perpetrated by men. And because they were envisioning a world in which there were no men, problems that were perpetrated by my were not our proper business or not their proper business. Excuse me? You know, all problems would be solved if we just refused to have men in our lives [60:00]. &#8220;Excuse me. I think lesbians get raped too.&#8221; SR: Right. MI: And of course to the contrary, half the staff at the Rape Crisis Center are lesbians and are standing up for their straight sisters. And half the women protesting abortion rights are lesbian. But there was this for a while that they would say, &#8220;Not our problem. We don&#8217;t deal with men. We&#8217;re cool.&#8221; SR: There was, gay and straight women did work collaboratively did they? MI: Oh absolutely. SR: But the separatists, you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily sit next to them at a War Resistor&#8217;s event? MI: The Women&#8217;s Peace Encampment was largely separatists. I drove down with two very radical straight women friends, one of whom was engaged to be married to one of the guys who was performing for the mixed encampment next door. We were in a fascinating position of getting caught in the tension between these groups because the women has established their peace encampment first and it included older women from Women&#8217;s Intervention League for Peace and Freedom. It included a real spectrum of women peace activists. And then this kind of arrogant guy, as it turned out--I learned this story as the long weekend progressed--kind of arrogant guy kind of set up right next to it and had his, called in all of his folks. So we got men right next door and the people that set up the women&#8217;s peace encampment were like, &#8220;Who asked for this? This guy is grandstanding. This guy is stealing our thunder.&#8221; And I loved the women&#8217;s music festival, the women&#8217;s peace encampment had been my big experiences in women only space, which is wonderful. It&#8217;s wonderful. You can run around with your shirt off, you know. You&#8217;re safe in a way that you&#8217;re not safe in the world unfortunately. SR: And you&#8217;re referring to the Southern Women&#8217;s Music Festival? MI: The Women&#8217;s Music Festival and the Savannah River Peace Encampment. These were my big immersions in those. But yeah, so here was this camp with these arrogant guys and there were some sweet guys and some supportive guys who don&#8217;t know the politics of what&#8217;s going on with them moving in so that they&#8217;re this far apart from this group that just wants to be just women working together. And I&#8217;m there with brilliant straight friends and none of us know these politics and we&#8217;re like taking on the women&#8217;s face, but we&#8217;re also crossing the line to talk to folks over there, some of whom we found very very interesting indeed. And we found out kind of late in the day that some of the folks on the women&#8217;s side considered us traitors. SR: Right. MI: Got in trouble after we sat up late. There was more going on late at night on the mixed encampment than there was in the women&#8217;s encampment. We sat around a fire and talked to people that wanted to know, that were supportive of the women&#8217;s peace encampment but wanted to know about why it was separate and what was the history. And Kathy and I told them everything we could but we said, you know, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t set this up. We don&#8217;t know that much about it. Listen we&#8217;ll ask. We&#8217;re supposed to have a group meeting tomorrow. We&#8217;ll go ask if there&#8217;s anyone who wants to come talk to you who can really tell you the story.&#8221; And they went, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;d be great! Thank you.&#8221; And we get back home; we are choosing to stay in the women&#8217;s space because we love it. And there&#8217;s the big camp-wide meeting and Kathy and I bright-eyed and bushy-tailed say, &#8220;Listen! There are some folks over there that don&#8217;t, I mean I think we get it but we don&#8217;t know that much about why there are separate encampments and they&#8217;d love somebody to come talk to them.&#8221; And all our sisters groan and smack their foreheads. We&#8217;re like what did we say? We didn&#8217;t know that this fight had been going on for like two months before hand [SR sighs] over the separate camp&#8217;s right to exist. The organizers over there knew perfectly well where the tensions were and what the struggles were and why they should actually back off if they had any sense at all. And we didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of sympathy for saying, &#8220;No! These are nice people that weren&#8217;t in on that.&#8221; But anyway. And in spite of those bumps and dislocations along the way, one of the oldest separatists in the women&#8217;s camp, now this was a woman who was out in the 30s. Now this is courage. And she was one of the grandmothers there and universally adored. She came over and hugged us and said [65:00], &#8220;It&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re doing good work.&#8221; That was much appreciated. And my heroes Mab, Mandy, and Candy were there and I learned so much from sitting at their feet. And, oh, we walked up on our first Goddess circle and we didn&#8217;t know what it was. SR: Oh yeah! MI: &#8220;People sitting around a campfire! How nice!&#8221; They peppered us very kindly. They asked us to sing and the only hymn I could thing about that would be appropriate was the Shaker hymn, &#8220;Simple Gives,&#8221; which was completely incoherent to what they were singing about. They let me in anyway. They gave me a hug [laughs]. And out of the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange, several of my dearest dearest friends in the world who were volunteers there and members there joined a coven and educated me about what was going on with all that. One of these things, I didn&#8217;t join. I was a fellow traveler. SR: Right. MI: So I guess separatism, lesbian determinism, Goddess religion. I know a lot about, love knowing it, just didn&#8217;t do it myself. But my good friends did and they told me [laughs]. SR: So I think I have two final questions and one I will say is a harder question, or is more of an optimistic question and one isn&#8217;t so I&#8217;ll start with the one that is a little bit harder. Or maybe not harder, but isn&#8217;t as positive. So what do you think were some of the major setbacks during this time period for the feminist movement or for people who were lesbian feminists or in any of these groups? Because you know we talk about these spaces like the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange and you kind of mentioned tensions and stuff. I was just wondering if there was any local manifestation of resistance that made it hard for these groups to kind of engage with their mission. MI: Ok. That&#8217;s a really good one. Let me take another smoke break and think on that. Would you like some more tea? [Recorder turned off and turned back on, 67:16] MI: The major disruptions I&#8217;m aware of that shut down safe spaces for women to gather and communicate were the blowup, I know from a little more of a distance in Durham, at the Durham Y. The ripples affected the Chapel Hill community too. The shutting down of the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange; that was a huge rift in the more progressive and the more conservative parts of various women&#8217;s movements. And I would say the closing of Southern Sisters. It was, for all its laws and all the things we did wrong, it was a wonderful gathering space and people drove in from all over the state and from nearby states. Visitors that wanted to check in came there first. We were the lesbian welcome wagon. We were the gift registry for the community. We were, yeah, it was a great lost. I still run into people around here that say, &#8220;Well we miss Southern Sisters.&#8221; And I have to say I miss it too. SR: So these are really kind of place-based effects that you&#8217;re tracing. MI: Yeah. SR: Did other places step in and fill those gaps? MI: Internationalist had always been, Internationalist Books had always been among the many causes they supported was feminism. You know, they went on after the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange moved out. It was really rough when Bob was killed and that was very disruptive. The Regulator in Durham had always been very good at taking care of the feminist and gay-lesbian community. White Rabbit Books, there was one in Raleigh and one in Greensboro, they kept going. SR: What about social--I know that the bookstores and the Y were more than, especially the bookstore, were more than a business. It was also a social space and I think we talked about that. MI: Yeah. SR: But were there social spaces like caf&#233;s or in bars or restaurants that maybe filled some of those niches? MI: Well for about three years in Durham there was Our Own Place which was the women&#8217;s only space where the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange, we had to cut the library in half to fit there. It was maybe more than that. It was very hard. But it was a little house [70:00], not too far from Ninth Street, that funding was always a shoe string. But they managed. They had Lucy Harris manage the place and women drove in from all over the state for the privileges of being able to sit in a public space and hold a girlfriend&#8217;s hand. And it was, it was really essential for a while. And Spring, after we moved the Women&#8217;s Book Exchange out of there, Spring developed and managed their little library so they would still have some books. But our collection was too big and didn&#8217;t circulate from there. So Spring was really good at adapting to what they needed. And Durham still has a couple of wonderful gay-lesbian bars. I danced with a common woman of course at (indecipherable) last year. Oh the great dessert place on Ninth Street. That&#8217;s lesbian owned and very very gay-lesbian friendly and I&#8217;m blanking on its name. SR: I don&#8217;t know. MI: Shame on me. I can see its curbside. Anyone in Durham will tell you. SR: So my last question then is kind of what still kept people going even though there were setbacks and there were tensions and there were divisions, you know, particularly in the 70s and 80s. What do you think was propelling people to kind of spending their time and their energy on top of everything else into all of these movements? MI: We needed each other. We needed each other so much. You know, I met the best people I&#8217;ve ever met my dearest friends until this day in these movements. We needed to do something with our indignation, with our passion for justice, with our quest for more knowledge. We learned from each other. The basic plot of a feminist novel, The Color Purple is a great example, is the women the children and the marginalized men are in trouble and they&#8217;re isolated. And they get together and they talk to each other and things get better. And eventually sometimes some of the former oppressors, things get better for them and they come into the fold too. And what&#8217;s so great about that narrative is that&#8217;s how it works in life. SR: Do you still see strands of those movements currently? MI: Strands? There are--oh yeah! [Laughs] You know, do you remember my indignation at the restaurant where people talked about the failure of the 60s? Said who says they failed? Yes Reagan set us back, Bush set us back. All the crazy stuff going on in the meantime has set us back and has pressed us down and made it harder. It&#8217;s always still going on! Absolutely. And everywhere. I wrote to a wonderful young feminist scholar at Fairham College whom I know from my friend George; he sent her my way. He&#8217;s writing on feminist utopias. And she&#8217;s doing a class on the 60s and she&#8217;s asking questions that mirror what we were talking about in Jackie&#8217;s class. And you know it wasn&#8217;t, it wasn&#8217;t cut and dry. It wasn&#8217;t this movement and this movement and then this event and then please read Dr. Jacquelyn Dowd Hall&#8217;s fabulous essay &#8220;The Long Civil Rights Movement,&#8221; that&#8217;s a better description of how all this happened. And it hasn&#8217;t quit happening. We may not be making as many headlines. We may not be as visible. But I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s happening in more places from more perspectives from more directions. And women are in more leadership roles than ever before. And more power to us. SR: I think that&#8217;s the perfect place to stop [MI laughs]...
