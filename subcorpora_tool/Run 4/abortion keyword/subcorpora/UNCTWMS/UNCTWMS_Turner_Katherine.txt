 BRITTNEY DESGAGES: My name is Brittney Desgages, and I am interviewing Katherine L. Turner today. We are sitting in Kathryn&#8217;s home at Drake Court&#8212; KATHERINE TURNER: Drakes Way. BD: Drakes Way Court in Durham, North Carolina and it is Wednesday July 9th around one p.m. So first, thank you for doing this today, meeting with me. KT: Sure. BD: The first question I want to ask you is if you can tell me a little bit about when you were born and where you grew up. KT: Well, I was born in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1967, so I&#8217;m forty-seven years old. My parents were moving around a lot in those early days. My father worked for General Electric and was transferred a lot. I was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, but I didn&#8217;t live there very long. We moved usually every year or two or three. We never lived anywhere longer than three years when I was growing up because of the nature of my father&#8217;s work; as an engineer executive working for General Electric, he was transferred a lot. I was born in Erie and then we moved to New Jersey--two different towns in New Jersey--and then two different towns in Massachusetts, and then upstate New York, and that was all during my early years, preschool and elementary years. And then [in the] middle of fifth grade, my middle school years, we moved to London, England. He was transferred there. We lived in London through my middle school years. Then we moved back to a different town in upstate New York for my first two high school years. Then we moved out to California, northern California in a smallish town between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe for my last two years of high school. When it was time for me to go to college, my parents basically said &#8220;Look at all the colleges and decide where you want to go, because who knows where we&#8217;ll be living at that time.&#8221; And I actually did, a lot of my family members did, and I did a year exchange program called America Field Service, AFS, in the Netherlands, in Holland for a year in between high school and college. And then I came to Duke University for undergraduate, and that was how I first came to North Carolina. And sure enough my parents moved from California where we were living when I applied to colleges to Baltimore, the Baltimore area, north of Baltimore, Maryland, and that&#8217;s where they were living when I went to Duke. So I would go home to north of Baltimore for my summers in my undergraduate years. BD: And what made you choose Duke? KT: When you think back to what the criteria are for a high schooler versus maybe an adult, I remember I&#8217;m very attracted to aesthetics and history. The history and I think the architecture really had a profound influence probably because I had lived in London and I was attracted to older Gothic buildings. That probably reminded me of a lot of the architecture of older buildings in England. And I had never lived in the Southeast before. I don&#8217;t think I really thought a lot about the region that I was going to college in. I looked at schools in southern California, several in California. Mostly in the Northeast because I think that&#8217;s where I had mostly grown up, and the Northeast feels more -- or the East Coast feels a little bit more like home than the West Coast. I also knew that I was very interested in psychology at the time, and I knew that Duke had a strong psychology program. And it wasn&#8217;t until I was at college that I really discovered women&#8217;s studies and was fortunate to be in a university where the women&#8217;s studies program was so strong, and I ended up earning a certificate in women&#8217;s studies and that was a really formative part of my college years. But I&#8217;d say it was mostly the degree, the psychology degree program, and probably the beautiful setting and architecture of Duke. BD: And did you feel like there was a culture shock when you moved to North Carolina for school? KT: There was in a number of ways. I don&#8217;t know that it was so much [the] southeastern culture because Duke has a lot of people from the northeast and all around the country. It&#8217;s not at all representative of Durham and North Carolina as a whole. Certainly the culture shocks I experienced were around&#8212;excuse me for one second. BD: Oh yeah, that&#8217;s fine. KT: Do you want to pause? BD: Yeah. KT: I had just come back from a year abroad in the Netherlands. I had been living with a family in Holland, in eastern Holland, and it was a total immersion experience. We had five days of language camp in Dutch and I&#8217;d listened to some recordings ahead of time, but basically [I] was immersed in speaking Dutch and living like a Dutch person. So lived with a family, went to school and had a lot of acclimation to become immersed and acclimated to Dutch culture. And then [I] had acclimated and was used to thinking, writing, speaking, reading in Dutch and then came back to go straight to college. So I was adjusting from being back from living in the Netherlands for a year, and I had had so many formative experiences in Holland and then came back to be among first year college students who were living away from home for the first time. So I felt like I had matured more and had more life experiences. My family had lived in London. I had traveled a lot. So there was that kind of acclimation, and there was a lot of privilege at Duke among the students, students who came from very wealthy families. And my family was certainly--we were middle and upper middle class as the years progressed. But because both my parents and grandparents came from more humble origins, I think my family has more of a working class sensibility, and so it was a shock how many Duke students came from very wealthy families. The level of privilege was really high and the kind of material items that kids came to college with, their own cars and computers and electronics and things, [were] not the things that my family sent me to college with. Yeah, so that was a class and privilege shock and acclimation back to U.S. culture. But it&#8217;s been a more gradual acclimation to southeastern culture the more that I&#8217;ve lived in and gotten to know people from the South and become integrated into the southeastern region. BD: And when you came to Duke was that the first time you realized that certain people have privileges like that? KT: No. BD: When was that? KT: That&#8217;s a great question. Growing up when every time we moved, my mother would scope out the schools and that determined where we lived. So through most of my growing up experience, my parents--my mother, would again select the best schools knowing where we were moving in the city we were moving to. She would scope out the best, the highest performing public schools. We went to public schools my whole [life], all my family did until college. We definitely had a public school education, but she still would choose the best performing public schools in the district where we were going to live and then we would choose a neighborhood to be within that school district. I definitely went to school with kids who had a range of economic backgrounds. We really didn&#8217;t have a lot of exposure to poor people, poor children or people in my schools, and even my extracurricular activities were mostly with kids from school or our neighborhood, which again, kind of by selection, were middle or upper middle class. I would say when we lived in London in my middle school years, my parents gave us a lot of freedom. Because there was the public transportation system my friends and I--even in sixth and seventh grade, eighth grade, which I think back to that now and whether I would allow my son to have that kind of freedom, and I don&#8217;t think [I would]. It&#8217;s a different generation of parenting now. I feel like parents in general are much more protective. But my friends and I roamed London on our own and took the tube and went roller skating in Leicester Square, and so I definitely would&#8217;ve been exposed to lot of different people and homeless people and disparities in the city. And then yeah, once I moved back to the States and we were in a suburban town in upstate New York and upstate California again, it was probably kids with [a narrower] range of socioeconomics. In California, even though the town was fairly affluent, I do remember I had a friend who was an orphan and actually lived in a group home with other orphans, and that was my first time knowing someone who was orphaned. And he seemed to also get a lot of public assistance. And then one of my best friends, her family--you wouldn&#8217;t know it but she was in my school and she and her brothers fit in. But when we became good friends and I started going home with her, her dad&#8217;s work was really sporadic so the family would go through periods where they didn&#8217;t even have food on the shelves or food in the refrigerator. And I remember being shocked by that and, but still sensitive enough not to probe too much, and she was pretty sensitive about talking about it. And when I talked to my mom about it, she would find ways to send home food home with her in a way that wouldn&#8217;t make her feel embarrassed, like saying &#8220;Oh my gosh I bought extra, why don&#8217;t you just bring this home to your family?&#8221; or &#8220;We&#8217;re going to go out of town this weekend. Could you take this home with you?&#8221; [She] just would find ways [of] sending food home with her for her family. But she was one of my best friends, and if I hadn&#8217;t known her the way I did, I wouldn&#8217;t have ever known that about her family. So that really woke me up to the knowledge that there are people in the U.S. who are really poor or go through periods of not having what many would consider the basics and that it can be really hidden sometimes in suburbia even. And then in Holland I had a political awakening around liberal politics. My family--a lot of my nuclear family members are somewhere in the moderate range of Republican to Democrat, mostly socially liberal but fairly fiscally conservative. When I went to Holland, there was such a sensibility about socialism and capitalism. I engaged in a lot of discussions and arguments about American capitalism and was challenged a lot on that and came to an agreement with more of a socialist standpoint of feeling convinced that there will be a range but that the range should be narrowed. It&#8217;s government and society&#8217;s roles to make sure that nobody is too extreme, that there aren&#8217;t such extreme ends of the range. I came back to go to school, to undergraduate at Duke with that sensibility and found women&#8217;s studies right away, and then had what I consider to be my feminist awakening, although I certainly had all the makings of it before then. I continued on that trajectory of being politically liberal and progressive and challenging a lot of American assumptions about capitalism, the inherent superiority of capitalism and the notions of privilege and the &#8220;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&#8221; idea, and started challenging structural racism and sexism and classism. [I] made friends, my friends are all--I&#8217;m still close friends with my friends from those undergrad years, and they&#8217;re all progressive people, politically progressive people, feminist people. BD: How does, after you went through that journey of discovering yourself as a feminist, how did feminism affect the way that you looked at the world? KT: In every way. It wasn&#8217;t just about--it really was about critical thinking. I, in my family, my nuclear family and extended family, I&#8217;d say my extended family has a unique perspective on ourselves relative to groups of others. Because we moved around, my nuclear family moved around, but my grandparents moved some too and traveled more than many people&#8217;s grandparents would have. From growing up hearing stories about traveling and then traveling myself with my family, certainly I was confronted with a lot of other cultures and challenged with notions of ethnocentrism or the idea of cultural superiority, and the idea that people do things different ways around the world and that one is not better than the other. My family doesn&#8217;t have a strong affiliation with a particular region of the country. Some people affiliate really as a Yankee or a southerner, and we never did because we moved in and out of different regions. Or we would reclaim some of those terms or frame them differently than maybe people who had been there for generations. We [also] don&#8217;t affiliate [with] religion. Many of my family members [and I] are more agnostic, [we] certainly have a set of belief systems but aren&#8217;t highly religious. So that really informed that idea of identity and affiliation and insider/outsider and being more of a questioner or critical thinker, not believing that what&#8217;s written in the Bible is absolute truth or from the mouth of God. My parents and grandparents really were critical thinkers and critical consumers of the news and popular culture. I mean my father&#8217;s father, my grandfather--Byedaddy we called him--Richard Turner was a real personality, a very sharp personality, sharp thinker, very critical, and would love to engage in debate about politics and popular topics to the point that you&#8217;d finally want to stop arguing with him. But whenever he picked up the newspaper or Newsweek magazine, you just knew that you were getting ready for a big political discussion. My father also really likes to engage in dialogue and reads a lot, and so a lot of my family [members] are well read and informed, and yeah, I&#8217;d say critical. I certainly had that, but women&#8217;s studies gave me a lens on the world that was even more critical of everything, of questioning assumptions about gender, about class, about culture and countries and politics. Even though the focus is gender, the critical analysis, critical thinking skills, and the lens of being a questioner was something I learned how to do and then it became second nature. I used to talk about it almost as though once the veil is lifted you can&#8217;t put it back. Then you see things through these eyes, and you go to the movies and you see the movie through the lens, and you have a conversation with someone on the street and you hear their comments through that lens. It changes you as a person. Once you&#8217;ve embraced it--I do think there&#8217;s a period where someone has to embrace that or not because I certainly know there are people who have been exposed [to it] and opted on some either conscious or semi-conscious level not to adopt it, but rather to go with the status quo. Once you&#8217;ve chosen to adopt it, then it becomes a way of life and a way of thinking, a mindset that you take with you everywhere. It&#8217;s something I would love for more citizens of the world to have. Even as an undergrad, I remember designing in my head a course that all middle school students in the U.S.--a required course that would be a life course on how to live as an independent, autonomous person in the world. One of the key skills would be critical thinking and being a critical consumer of news and information because it&#8217;s key for a vibrant society and a thriving society that progresses, and it&#8217;s something that concerns me a lot when I see the absence of it. I do credit women&#8217;s studies at Duke as being a formative part of my education in those skills. BD: What led you to become involved in social justice work and activism? KT: Again, I think by the time I went to college I&#8217;d had enough experiences and exposure to diverse people and cultures and countries and was convinced--I&#8217;d say by the time I was [an] exchange student in Holland that I was really convinced of the way a just world would look and what is needed to create that. Anywhere where I saw a difference between what I would consider a just system or society, or even on an individual level, [a] way of people treating each other, [that] was something that I wanted to fight against. In those days, I think it was much more about fighting and [I] really saw the systems, the oppressive systems and structures, as impositions that needed to be pushed back into a form that would be more just and inclusive. As an undergrad at Duke I became--. Well, there were two areas. One was social justice work and activism as a whole. In particular, I was honing an interest in public health and health education, and seeing health as a key element of freedom and a lot of disparities around public health and wanting to address those. All tied into that, of course, were gender and class and race and ethnicity and wanting to address all of them together. I became--I joined this peer education group that was set up to educate undergraduates on sexuality issues, and so I became a volunteer peer educator the first year, and then one of my best friends and I became the co-presidents and ran it the next three years. At the time it was student run, so it gave us a lot of great experience working with these two mentors who were at student services in the public health field to really run a program. We would set up the whole recruitment process and recruit volunteers, and interview them and select them and train them. We designed a whole training program and ran the training program, bringing in expert speakers from different areas. It covered all aspects of sexuality and healthy sexuality. Then once the volunteers were trained, we had an office on campus and we were in charge of setting up the office and scheduling the volunteers to staff the office and have office hours. There were phone hours, and then we did a lot of campus-wide awareness-raising events. We would go to dorms or do events that were campus-wide that were designed to raise awareness about healthy sexuality. A key part of my activism was providing undergraduates with accurate, fair information on human sexuality that would allow them to make positive choices about their own sexuality and their sexual health because again, I felt that in our society in the U.S., there&#8217;s so much suppression around sexuality, healthy sexuality. There&#8217;s [such a] lack of accurate information provided to young people, and there&#8217;s so much distorted information and images that really hamper young people [from] having accurate information about themselves and each other and then making healthy positive choices for themselves. I saw that as an act of defiance against that system of suppression, and then [I] became really involved in the Women&#8217;s Center. We produced the women&#8217;s handbook every year which was information, all kinds of information for women on campus about their health. We did a lot of activism--Take Back the Night, and raising awareness about sexual violence and assault and domestic violence and rape. There was a lot of anorexia on campus, so again, about healthy body image and sexuality and films and discussions and marches and speak outs and a lot of different events like that aimed at helping people kind of come into who they were destined to be and to be able to live a healthy life for themselves. BD: As you were growing up, how did you understand sexual identity and race relations, and do you think that moving around so much during your childhood affected how you understood those things? KT: Yeah, I think certainly moving around and traveling exposed me to a lot of different people, and yet by the time I went to college, I hadn&#8217;t had very many close relationships with African Americans. Most of the schools where my family went, there weren&#8217;t very many African Americans, and we didn&#8217;t live in regions of the country--or where we lived regionally, again based on the neighborhoods and schools my parents chose, there weren&#8217;t a lot of African Americans. That was something I just didn&#8217;t have a lot of experience knowing. I mean, I had some friends, but I really didn&#8217;t know a lot of African Americans until more at college. Then even after college when I started living in Durham and working in Durham and the Peace Corps in Africa&#8230;and even Latin Americans or Latinos in the U.S., some Asian Americans&#8230;In my travels I was exposed to diverse people, but even where we lived in the suburbs was not very ethnically diverse. And class, there was again a range, but it was a narrower range. Certainly my travels exposed me to a lot of different cultures, and then you&#8217;re asking about&#8212; BD: How you understood sexuality. KT: Culture. Sexuality. Um hmm. I think it was really women&#8217;s studies. Both [through] my studies and some of my other students, and through my activism, becoming friends with diverse people. A number of my male friends as undergraduates were gay, and became aware of their identity and came out when they were undergraduates, some not till afterwards. One of my close friends was out from sophomore or junior year. Then we lived in Paris together for a semester my junior year and he was dating a Parisian young man, and he spent a lot of time [with us] and became our friend. I had a lot of gay male friends at that time. There was one woman who was also a women&#8217;s studies certificate earner at Duke, and she was one of the only &#8220;out&#8221; lesbians as an undergraduate woman. I always aligned with her in classes. Whenever we were talking about lesbian feminism or lesbian issues, I really aligned with her and was an ally, but I didn&#8217;t identify as a lesbian until after undergraduate. Although definitely those years and those studies and those conversations helped inform my growing identity, I&#8217;d say. Even by the time I&#8217;d finished undergraduate, I basically was feeling--I was dating men, but feeling like a political lesbian and would even say based on my politics, and beyond my politics, just my whole mindset, that I&#8217;d be better off being a lesbian. I didn&#8217;t think I was a lesbian at the time, just in terms of my sexual orientation. My identity, I&#8217;d say, was starting to become lesbian even before my sexual self followed. My friends and I talked openly about gay issues and were real allies again, or again, some friends were. Through the PISCES work, this Peer Information Services for Counseling and Education on Sexuality, again a lot of what we would counsel our peers on was their sexual identities. We also did a lot of work on unplanned or unwanted pregnancy and abortion and sexually transmitted infections. Sexuality was a big topic and something we did a lot of counseling on, so I think the counseling I was doing with my peers also helped sensitize me. I don&#8217;t really remember my family talking a lot about lesbianism or homosexuality growing up. My mom had an openness towards our bodies, and she wasn&#8217;t raised knowing a lot about her body. Even when she started becoming sexually active and became pregnant and ended up marrying my father, she had very little knowledge of her reproductive system and how it worked. It came as a real shock to her and my father and their families, and it ended up causing them to get married as under--she dropped out of college and got married. That had a huge impact on how she raised us. She raised us really wanting us to be better informed about sexuality. She talked to us more about our bodies and when--before we started our periods, and even just about vaginal hygiene, she would talk about not using deodorant sprays or products, and &#8220;Your vagina is a self-cleaning organ,&#8221; she would teach us. She had a progressive, and I&#8217;d say ahead-of-her-time view on the human body and how it works and letting it do what it&#8217;s designed to do and not interfering with artificial products that are produced for profit but really are unhealthy for women to use. Even using tampons that you insert yourself instead of with an applicator. So I always had an openness towards my body and the human body because of my mom and the way that she raised us to really be affirming about our bodies and our bodies&#8217; natural way of being. I&#8217;d say it was more--I did have some gay friends in high school, so in northern California. We would go out dancing and clubbing and go to gay bars, so I had already had exposure to and had friends who are gay, and I never remember feeling or thinking in a homophobic way. I do have--my father was very homophobic, and my brother was quite homophobic. The year after college when I was living in Durham with a good friend from college and then started working. I worked at the national STD hotline at the time that was based in RTP, Research Triangle Park, and I was working at a local, actually more than one local abortion clinic as a counselor. It happened that there were a number of lesbians who were working at both, and I had a group of lesbian friends and ended up falling in love with my first female partner. That was my lesbian awakening for myself and actually having my first lesbian relationship. I feel like everything was leading up to that and it was just a matter of time before I met the first woman to love. BD: After you realized that you were interested in women how did your family react to that? KT: I told my mother and my older sister fairly soon. I was never really closeted. I don&#8217;t know if it was because I came out later, or because I&#8217;d already done so much counseling and education on sexuality and had never been homophobic myself and had-- like I was saying, a lot of my family members are socially more liberal but more fiscally or politically conservative. Other than their--I do have my father and my brother and some other more extended family members who were homophobic, or who had shades of homophobia, but my mom has always been a very accepting person, and my sisters are very open to diverse sexuality. When I came out to my mom and my sister, they met Chandra, my first girlfriend, and they liked her and they were really--it was kind of a non-issue with my mom. My sister, I&#8217;ll never forget she said, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter to me if you&#8217;re dating a man or a woman.&#8221; Then later, she followed up with me saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying you don&#8217;t matter to me or what you do doesn&#8217;t matter to me. It matters, but I&#8217;m saying it doesn&#8217;t make a difference to me whether you date a man or a woman.&#8221; My younger sister, similarly, was a non-issue. They probably weren&#8217;t surprised at that point, even though I didn&#8217;t think I was a lesbian, but I was so steeped in feminism and was a very strident feminist and my mom would say, &#8220;Those were the years you were really hard to live with because you were challenging everything.&#8221; I was challenging sexism. I was challenging racism. I was challenging homophobia. Everywhere that I went I was challenging what people were doing and saying, including my grandparents and other extended family members. So in their minds it probably all went along with it so that once I started dating a woman, it wasn&#8217;t really a big surprise. My father, though, and my brother were really challenged by it. It took years, and even still I think my father is certainly a lot more accepting. He visits and he really loves my current partner and my previous partner who I co-parent my son with, but it was a real journey for him and for us. When I first came out to him, he was personally hurt. He really--my perception is that he really took it as an affront to him as a man and a rejection of him as a man and of all men. If I was rejecting men, in his view, and loving women, then somehow that meant that I was rejecting him as my father. It took a lot of conversations and for him to understand that it wasn&#8217;t a rejection of men. It was an embracing of women and my love for women, and certain women in particular, and it didn&#8217;t mean that I hated men. In fact, I felt like I was able to love men better when I wasn&#8217;t trying to have an intimate relationship with them because then, I didn&#8217;t have to fight against some of the sexism that is inherent in so many heterosexual relationships because that was a non-issue then. Like, &#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to have an intimate relationship with you, so I can have a platonic friendship or a collegial relationship,&#8221; or &#8220;I can have any kind of relationship with you and I can still challenge, but I&#8217;m not trying to engage with you interpersonally, intimately.&#8221; Anyway, it did take years and other people talking with my dad and helping him come around, but he felt really hurt and rejected. My brother, I think, was similar. I think it was his male ego and male pride that were hurt, and maybe some sense of our closeness worried him, that me being a lesbian would somehow impede with the closeness that we&#8217;d had growing up. And again, that it would be some kind of rejection of him, but at this point they&#8217;ve come a long way and I&#8217;ve encouraged their growth. I&#8217;ve really, from the beginning, felt strongly that it was who I was and my right, and I didn&#8217;t allow them to suppress me. Any time that they would have a problem with me being a lesbian or--my longest relationship was with an African American woman. We have a child together--Jaden, who&#8217;s ten--and me being in an intercultural or interracial relationship&#8230;also any problems that they had around race and ethnicity or class was their problem and that they needed to work on that themselves. It wasn&#8217;t anything that I needed to change about myself or my relationships. BD: Can you tell me a little bit about your career aspirations when you were younger and also your work history? KT: Um hmm. Well, my best friend from third grade in upstate New York says that at the age of third grade I was talking about being a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa. BD: Wow. KT: I know. I don&#8217;t remember that, but she brought that up years later when we reconnected as adults. So evidently, I do know that I&#8217;ve always had an affinity for different cultures, and in particular, the African continent calls me and I don&#8217;t know why. But I&#8217;ve responded to that call. I have always been someone who is most comfortable in relationships and settings where diverse people are making a meaningful life or working together. I&#8217;ve always been attracted to that kind of work and those kinds of settings. I&#8217;ve always resisted any kind of social imposition or suppression of what I believe to be our natural human selves that are needing to be expressed. So any kind of societal stigma that&#8217;s imposed based on what I believe to be an incorrect belief that is somehow inferior or wrong or unnatural is what I have gravitated towards working on. I knew Africa and I knew cross-cultural&#8230;and health, as I was saying--I think that the moving towards global health was based on a very profound experience that my family had when my father&#8217;s mother--my grandmother Lou, who my son&#8217;s middle name is named after, as well as his other mom&#8217;s mother&#8217;s name Betty Lou. My grandmother Lou was a twin, and she was died when I was one of ovarian cancer. Her death created such a profound effect on my father and his father, my grandfather Bye Daddy, that they were just--my grandfather went into this state of grieving and loss and wasn&#8217;t able to articulate that. It crushed him until he finally met and married my step-grandmother Ruth, who partnered him in a way that he needed in order to live out the rest of his life in a more vibrant way. My father was so pained by his mother&#8217;s death because it was essentially a secret. She--I have the letter that she wrote to her twin, Sue, where she described the lump that she felt in her ovary. And she drew a picture. She was an artist as was my grandmother Lou, my great aunt Lou--Sue, sorry, my grandmother Lou and my Great Aunt Sue who are twins and were both artists. I have the letter that she wrote to Sue where she described to Sue the lump that she felt in her ovary, and she was afraid to go in to have it checked because she was afraid of what she might learn about it. When she did, she learned that it was cancerous, and that it had metastasized because she had waited for a long time out of fear. By the time she actually started having treatments--she did undergo treatments, but it had spread and was too late. It wasn&#8217;t until--and she kept that secret from-- I believe my grandfather, her own husband, for quite a while, and certainly from my father and my aunt, her children, for a long time. When they learned that she was dying, when they learned she was sick, they learned she was dying and she didn&#8217;t have long to live. They didn&#8217;t have long to mourn or prepare for her death, and when she died, it was such a shock, and my father to this day visibly winces when you or anyone raises her name or talks about her. It&#8217;s better now. All while I was growing up, I felt that my Grandmother Lou was this benevolent specter in our family who my mother and my mother&#8217;s family would invoke very lovingly and paint a picture for us what a beautiful person she was and all of her quality. From my father&#8217;s side was silence, and so as a child I had this real longing for this grandmother who I missed knowing, and [I] did a lot of interviewing of her twin and my grandfather and my father about her to try to recreate her for myself and my family. That understanding of her illness and her delay in seeking assessment and treatment made a strong impact on me and informed my interest in public health. I didn&#8217;t know what those terms were. I didn&#8217;t know what to call it. I just knew I was interested in health in that way, human behavior and health. When I was an undergraduate and running this PISCES program, I was talking with one of my favorite undergraduate professors, Dr. David Goldstein, who I really credit with pointing me towards public health. He said, &#8220;Well, what are you interested in doing in your career?&#8221; I said--well I thought at the time I would become a clinical psychologist because I knew that I loved counseling and education and psychology. I was a psychology major and women&#8217;s studies. It all fit together, [and] I believed I would get my Ph.D. in clinical psychology and become a therapist. He said, &#8220;What do you love to do?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I love what I do with PISCES. I love one-on-one counseling and education, and I love larger events; awareness-raising events; raising people's awareness about different health issues and what they can do to stay healthy. So at the individual level and group level in society, community level and population level, I really want to effect positive change on people&#8217;s health and sexuality.&#8221; He said, "Well that is public health, and there is a really great school of public health right up the road at UNC.&#8221; As an undergraduate Duke student that seemed almost blasphemous. UNC? But I&#8217;m a Duke student. I mean, I wasn&#8217;t so strongly affiliated with Duke. So that caused me to look into it and discover this great school of public health, and then ultimately to find health education. Because he said, &#8220;What you&#8217;re describing sounds a lot like the field of health education within the larger field of public health. I think you&#8217;d probably be interested in that.&#8221; So that was what lead to me to look into UNC and investigate the school of public health and find the department of health education--health behavior and health education at the time, and then apply and get in. In my persistence to pursue this dream to be a Peace Corps volunteer, [I] applied to the Peace Corps and got in and decided grad school could wait. And so [I] went to Togo West Africa and&#8212; BD: How was your experience there? KT: It was amazing and life changing. I lived in a small village called Longabou on the north-south road in Togo, which is as very small country in West Africa, a Francophone country, and I was the first American, first non-Togolese person placed there. I was an oddity for sure. It was a smallish village, but because it was along the road, a number of different ethnicities had stopped and settled there. There were different quartier--different quarters, different ethnicities. It was fairly diverse ethnically and what really attracted me to the village is it was led by a female, a chieftain. She was the only female chieftain in all of Togo to my knowledge, and she came to that position because her uncle had been the chief of the village, and when he was passing along the crown, it was voted and decided because she was such a successful businesswoman that she would be chieftain of the village. That really appealed to me as a young feminist, and I had all these dreams of becoming friends of the chieftain and interviewing her and submitting it as an article to Ms. Magazine and all these, documenting her experience and her story. When I did get to know her and learn about her story, she was not a feminist-identified woman at all and wasn&#8217;t interested in changing feminist or gender norms, but really was living out her obligation as the chief and didn&#8217;t see herself as a leader of women in particular. That was kind of a disappointment. I ran a Guinea worm eradication program there. That was my Peace Corps program--Guinea worm eradication. It was dealing with water and sanitation. That&#8217;s where I focused initially, was working with a range of villages, fifteen or so villages in the Blitta district. I had a bicycle, ten-speed or something-speed bicycle to get around [in a hot,] hilly climate, and I had a counterpart at the Blitta ministry of health. He was at the district hospital there working for the ministry of health who was my homologue, my counterpart, and we worked together to go around to villages to do health education and community organizing around health and education, on health issues, and helping villages organize and create a healthy water source and latrines-- areas basically to use the bathroom to keep them separate from water sources. So I did that. As time went on, I became really involved in women and development. There was a Women in Development program through the Peace Corps, and so I raised money and got grants to help girls and on my own started a little scholarship for girls to be able to go to school because there was a real cultural bias against girls in education&#8230; BD: Amazing. KT: --And raised money, matching funds for villages who would organize the sweat equity, kind of like the Habitat for Humanity model that if a village said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll put in the labor if you will write grants and get money to provide the materials to build wells or to build latrines.&#8221; I did that in a number of villages as well. And again, [I] just had really amazing friendships, both [with] other Peace Corps volunteers who I&#8217;m still in close touch [with] from that time, and also my Togolese friends. So my best friend Aphi from the village, and then Comi, who I informally adopted while I was there. He was a young boy who was not in school because his parents didn&#8217;t have money and they&#8217;d kicked him out. I ended up paying for his education, his tuition, in exchange for him doing some different household tasks because the teacher had told me, &#8220;You just shouldn&#8217;t give people money. You should have it be in exchange for work so that it is meaningful to them.&#8221; It&#8217;s not--you don&#8217;t want to be the Westerner who just gives out money and creates a dependency that hasn&#8217;t been here before and that isn&#8217;t culturally appropriate. Comi ended up coming to live with me. He was about nine or so at the time and went to school. I thought a lot about adopting, but ended up feeling that I was going to go back to graduate school and didn&#8217;t feel ready to parent a child in the U.S. And so I&#8217;ve continued to support him, and he has gone on to go through college and university--I mean through university, and basically has his masters in accounting. BD: Wow. KT: Just a really resilient young man. BD: And y&#8217;all still have a really close relationship. KT: We communicate by Skype now, which is amazing when I think back to the telecommunications when I was living there. I&#8217;ve visited him a number of times when I&#8217;ve gone for work to Ghana, a neighboring country and want to continue to--he calls me his American mama, and I mentor him and help him as well as I can. But he&#8217;s forging his own life. BD: Wow. KT: But you were asking about--yeah, so the Peace Corps was, in addition to working at abortion clinics and the STD hotline, my first tangible work experience in public health in addition to the kind of undergraduate volunteer work that I&#8217;d done. My interest, my commitment to public health and global health at that point was really solidified. When I was still in Peace Corps, I reapplied to UNC to the School of Public Health and came back and acclimated for a couple of months, and then started graduate school in August of that year. That was--I was in the Peace Corps from 1991 to 1993, and then it was in August of [19]94 that I started graduate school. BD: You speak more than one language. Is that right? KT: I speak French fluently. I had started learning as a fifth grader in London, and then lived in Paris my junior year of college and lived in Togo, and that was the language that I mostly interacted with. It&#8217;s a Francophone country, but obviously it&#8217;s only people that have been through the formal education system or learned on the street who speak French. Many of the older women who didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to attend school and some younger women whose families didn&#8217;t opt for them to go to school, and older people in general didn&#8217;t speak French as well. So when I was there, I knew some Kotokoli and some Ew&#233; which was one, two of the local languages in the village. I would speak enough to converse with people. I took Spanish in high school, and I&#8217;ve used Spanish when I travel, and so I can get by in Spanish-speaking countries, though my Spanish isn&#8217;t great. I speak Dutch fluently, because again, I was living as an exchange student in Holland and really was immersed for a year. BD: Okay. So as someone who speaks more than one language, and also as someone who has traveled internationally so much, have you found that feminism looks different in different areas? KT: Yes, in my experience there&#8217;s--in Togo, it was a real awakening for me as an American feminist bringing my feminism to this experience and this life in this small village in West Africa. There were many experiences. But there was one in particular that I remember vividly that really caused me to challenge this idea of cultural appropriateness and awareness and sensitivity relative to feminism, and how to be an ally for women in ways that are culturally appropriate and helpful versus imposing our own cultural beliefs on what is right or good for other people. My best friend Aphi, who I mentioned was the pharmacist in the healthy center where I was doing a lot of my work in Longabou--it was a little dispensaire, just a little health clinic barely. It was tiny. She was the pharmacist. The chieftain of the village held an annual recognition banquet where she hosted the people in the village who were serving the villagers. She was hosting her annual recognition banquet and invited us to this meal and ceremony. Aphi and I and the others were invited, and Aphi and I went together, and when we got there, it was about maybe twelve people total. The others were all men, and they were the social worker and the agricultural extension agent and the nurse who worked at the same clinic, and a number of other professionals in the area and leaders. We came and we all sat around the table and we were being hosted. The chieftain came, and one of the women in her compound came, and then when it became time to start to serve drinks and serve the food, they asked Aphi to help them. I had a real problem with that because I said,&#8221; Well, Aphi is a guest here. So she should be served as the guest,&#8221; but because she was a woman and a Togolese woman--I was the only other woman, but I was a white American woman and they didn&#8217;t ask me to help. I was often treated at the same status as the men there because of my cultural difference, being an American specifically, and a white American. And so she became instantly relegated to a woman who serves rather than a honoree of this banquet who happens to be a woman. So I said, &#8220;No, Aphi needs to be served,&#8221; and everyone looked at me surprised and said, &#8220;Well, Kat it&#8217;s fine. Just, she&#8217;ll just serve and she&#8217;ll sit back down.&#8221; Even Aphi was really upset because she didn&#8217;t want me to be upset. She said, &#8220;No, no it&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll just help, don&#8217;t worry.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to worry. This is a problem. This is not acceptable.&#8221; And again everybody was trying to mollify me and assure me it&#8217;s fine. Finally I said, &#8220;If you don't stop having her serve, I&#8217;m going to get up and I&#8217;m going to leave.&#8221; And they didn&#8217;t. So I got up and I left and I cried the whole way back to my room. I was so upset about what had happened. Aphi came after me and said, &#8220;Kat you have to come back, everyone&#8217;s so upset. The chieftain is honoring us. And for you to leave is such a disgrace.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Aphi, I just can&#8217;t accept for you to serve everyone. It&#8217;s just wrong. They didn&#8217;t ask any of the men to serve. They&#8217;re only asking you because you&#8217;re a woman, and yet that&#8217;s not your place there.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Okay, they&#8217;ve agreed. I&#8217;m not going to serve any food.&#8221; So I came back and she sat and was served, and other women served us. Even though I &#8220;got my way,&#8221; I thought a lot about that experience and other similar experiences in which my understanding of what equality between men and women would look like and seem to be appropriate in that setting in that time, and that there were real differences. Throughout my life, there continue to be challenges of what is the appropriate role of someone who is coming into a culture from another culture and has a world view and is wanting to encourage a more egalitarian way of life and runs up against cultural norms. What is my role? What is the role of other cultural insiders? I learned a lot of humility and introspection around it, and wanting to be careful not to just react and assume that what I thought would be best in terms of promoting equality is what was most appropriate for that particular setting and time. BD: My last few questions are specifically about your involvement with the Pauli Murray project. I just want to ask you what lead you to become involved with it first off? KT: After graduate school, I had worked at Durham County Health Department for five-and-a-half years as a program manager and associate director of health education, and I loved that work. It was very grounded in the Durham community. We were downtown working with a lot of diverse Durham communities on&#8212;specifically, my program was communicable disease education focusing mostly on HIV and AIDS and STI prevention. We did so much awareness-raising education, counseling, testing, clinical work, community work and building, community health department relations building, and a lot of even statewide or national advocacy on harm reduction and needle exchange, really promoting good health and preventing communicable diseases. I loved that real health education work that was grounded in community. I missed international work so much. I then left and went to Ipas, where I still work full-time as a senior advisor in health systems. I work globally with different health systems around the world on integrating comprehensive abortion care into their health systems and structures, and building the capacity of personnel and health officials and lots of other partners in country to change their abortion laws or interpret their abortion laws broadly or implement safe abortion care in their existing systems or at the community level. I have, for thirteen years, been working at Ipas; since 2001. The health department was from--let&#8217;s see, the Peace Corps was [19]91 to [19]93, then [19]94 to [19]96 was graduate school&#8212;I actually started working at the health department before I finished graduate school and was working there from [19]96 to 2001, and then from 2001 until the present. For thirteen years I&#8217;ve been at Ipas doing this global health work on women&#8217;s health and rights, and more specifically, safe abortion care, and I started my own firm Global Citizen LLC that is consulting, teaching, and training on cultural global competence for improved relationships and outcomes on health and more generally. And so I&#8217;ve been immersed in the global health field. When one is living in a particular place--and I&#8217;ve been living in Durham this whole time, other than graduate school at Chapel Hill for two years. Other than that, I&#8217;ve adopted Durham as my hometown and really embraced--I love Durham, and I&#8217;m a Durhamite through and through. And in the Peace Corps, when I was living in West Africa and Togo, I thought carefully and long about--You&#8217;ve lived everywhere, you&#8217;ve lived around the world and been to a lot of different places, you can choose where you want to live. Where in the world do you want to live? I chose Durham because it has so much of what I want in a hometown. I never had a hometown, and so I chose to make this my chosen hometown and home state. It&#8217;s been the perfect place. I knew that I wanted to put down roots, I wanted to cultivate a community and hometown here, and I wanted to continue to work globally. That has been the perfect combination for me too, because I am very home and community oriented. I also am a big world traveler, and so to have both of those--I knew that I really wanted to create a home and community here and have this be the base from which to travel and do global work and travel with my family and friends internationally. And yet, having lived here and worked globally, I&#8217;m often not here. I travel quite a bit. Probably four or five times a year for at least a week-and-a-half to two weeks at a time, [I&#8217;m] in another country or region of the world working, and several domestic trips, and even when I&#8217;m physically here, I&#8217;m often Skyping or calling or meeting with colleagues around the world. It feels like I&#8217;m there in the other country. And so I haven&#8217;t been as present in the Durham community as I would like, and the change that I&#8217;m affecting is in other countries. In the early years when I was an undergraduate, and the years following when I was living in Durham and working in Durham, I was involved in so many community activism projects. I was helping to--I was a founding member of the Lesbian Health Center that later became the Lesbian Health Resource Center, which existed for years and was a real health and education and referral center for lesbians on health. I was the co-chair of the board of the LG, the North Carolina LGHP health project, and then was working with a group of people to try to establish an LGBT community center in Durham that was going to be called the Kerr-Lee Community Center after Kathy Kerr and Lester Lee. I was just doing a lot of activism mostly on health--[clears throat]-- excuse me, mostly on LGBT health in Durham and the state. Then when I started working with Ipas and working internationally, I had to let a lot of that go because I couldn&#8217;t really sustain--oh, and I was on the board of Rape Crisis of Durham for several years and was on several boards of directors of nonprofit organizations locally working on different health issues, a lot of women&#8217;s activism and political activism with the Democratic Party, and with voter registration and turnout. I still do a lot of voter registration and turn out volunteering, but I haven&#8217;t been as involved in local health activism or activism [in general]. More recently, I decided that I wanted to get involved with a local project that really brought together all the issues that are important to me, and I&#8217;ve known Barbara Lau, the director, for a long time and she&#8217;s been kind of a community friend for years. I&#8217;ve always been very interested in the project whenever I would see her and hear about it. It was very intriguing to me, and then when she reached out to me about a year and a half ago to say she was forming this programs committee and wanted me to join, I saw that as the time and the opportunity, even though I probably didn&#8217;t have any business signing up for one more thing to do. I really felt strongly that this would be the right place to put my time and energy because again, it addresses race, class, sexuality gender, and community building all in the same project, and because it&#8217;s so Durham specific and Pauli Murray is a person who I&#8217;ve admired. When I read Proud Shoes, I found that it was a very impactful book for me. Her story and her family history, which I really see as America&#8217;s story, and all of us are a part of that story. I think because she has white family members and African American family members, and maybe even Indian, and because of her work as a lawyer and civil rights activist and writer and poet, and her sexuality and her gender identity--so many of her characteristics bring together all of these issues. She embodies them in a way that is really important. Her work lives on as an important intersection of these issues, or addresses the intersection of these issues. I know there are complications with having a project based on a real person who has family members who have an investment in her identity and her legacy, and how that may reflect on them and their families. But yeah, I&#8217;m attracted to it because of Pauli Murray, because of the project and the mission, and because it&#8217;s grounded in Durham and it&#8217;s local work. Yet, as I&#8217;ve told Barbara many times, I&#8217;m very interested in bringing in a global perspective in all of our work and discussions around issues, tying the intersectionality of these issues in Durham with the intersectionality of these issues globally, and making sure we&#8217;re bringing a global lens and awareness to the work that we&#8217;re doing and making connections with people and organizing movements that are happening all over the world. BD: And how does Pauli Murray inspire you? KT: Well, her being true to herself and her self-expression, [and] that she not only lived her life but was a change agent. The fact that she was such a change agent and wrote about her personal and family experience, but also about the change that she wanted to affect in the world. Her writing has been paramount because it lives beyond her. Her means of expression--I find her a compelling writer and poet, and her--I know it was process, but her embracing of these diverse identities. There&#8217;s so many messages. In particular, our U.S. history is so fraught around race. Her forthrightness in addressing race and in speaking the truth about her family history when it must&#8217;ve been incredibly counterculture and unacceptable to so many people for her to reveal and write about her white family members. Even documenting and telling what her family history was, there was a huge amount of resistance to that. So I admire her courage in doing that. BD: Is there anything else about your story that you feel like people don&#8217;t usually ask you about that you&#8217;d like to share? KT: That&#8217;s a great question. BD: Anything at all. KT: Well, as a mother, there are always--everything that I do is informed by myself as a person, but now myself as a mother also. So much of my motivation is also around being a good mother to my son and being a lesbian mother to my multi-ethnic son whose other parent is African American, and again lesbian, and now divorced essentially, no longer together and co-parenting together. Everything that we&#8217;re doing around parenting is really transgressive in many ways and incredibly important in terms of acknowledging that many people feel a compulsion, a desire to parent, and parenting can look lots of different ways for lots of different people. But everyone has the right to parent, to have the children in the form that they choose, and to parent in the way they choose and to be supported and embraced by society in doing so. There&#8217;s a lot; so much of my motivation now and my thinking around a lot of these issues is also as a mother and what I feel will make me a better person and parent to my son, and also what will make the world a better place for him and his cohort. We didn&#8217;t really talk about me as a mother, and I think that&#8217;s really important. It&#8217;s still mothering as activism. Every day [I&#8217;m] being questioned or challenged or confronting messages or policies or laws that try to prohibit a person like me from having a child and parenting in the way that I deem my right and the way that I believe is right. In helping him navigate this world and helping him become the person he&#8217;s meant to be and blossom into that person and not feel limited by anyone or opposed or suppressed by anyone. So that&#8217;s a really important part of me and part of my thinking and part of my activism, I would say. Similarly, I guess, is around teaching. I also am adjunct faculty at UNC in the School of Public Health and have been pretty much since I graduated with my MPH, and so my relationship to students is really important, and I believe strongly in the power of mentorship. [I] haven&#8217;t always; I&#8217;ve always sought out mentors and haven&#8217;t always found the mentors. I have been blessed by a number of important mentors, but I haven&#8217;t always had the mentorship that I would&#8217;ve wanted at different times. I do a lot to make myself available to students to help them navigate their&#8212;[interview abruptly stopped]..
