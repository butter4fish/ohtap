 Evan Faulkenbury: Today is June 12, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury. I&#8217;m here in Lynchburg, Virginia at the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center and I&#8217;m interviewing Jennifer Snellings about her life history. So to begin, thanks for joining me. Jennifer Snellings: Sure. EF: The first question I have is for you to tell me about where you were born and growing up. JS: Okay. I was born in Greenville, South Carolina. My parents are both from that area. My mother is from Pickens, South Carolina; my dad is from Easley. We ended up growing up in Six Mile, which is a very small town right outside of Easley, South Carolina, a small town consisting of probably less than ten thousand people, so a very small town. Basically that&#8217;s where I grew up. We went to elementary school there, high school. I do have a younger brother who&#8217;s four years younger than myself, but that is basically where we grew up, in the same area that my parents were born and raised as well. EF: Okay. Well tell me about what your parents were like, or are like. JS: Sure. EF: Or were like growing up, I suppose. JS: Sure. Well my mom is one of seven children and she grew up in Pickens on a farm. My grandfather was a farmer/worker, my grandmother worked, I believe in a cotton mill, so they very much worked off the land. [Being one of] seven children my mother worked very much in the house, on the farm, along with her other siblings, and she was the second youngest of the seven. It&#8217;s interesting. She barely remembers my older uncle and aunt living at home. But I would say my mom grew up not having a lot of money. She did not have the opportunity to go to college because of such a huge family. It was mainly just trying to provide the basic needs of day to day living. My father grew up in Easley, South Carolina. He is an only child. They lived right in town so we always used to call my grandparents &#8220;Memaw and Papaw from the country&#8221; and &#8220;Memaw and Papaw from the city,&#8221; or &#8220;on the street,&#8221; is what we said. EF: Right. JS: So we distinguished them by where they lived because they lived on a farm and my other grandparents lived more in the city. But, like I said, my dad&#8217;s an only child. And both my parents were heavily brought up in the church and very active in the church. My grandfather is a World War II veteran. But anyway, my dad did go to college. He had the opportunity. He went to Anderson College. It was Anderson College at the time, I believe it&#8217;s Anderson University now, but it was a two-year school. So he was able to get educated, basically, when he was younger. EF: Okay. Well tell me a bit about&#8211;. You said you grew up in Easley, correct? JS: Mm hmm. EF: Well tell me a bit about the town and what you remember about town life growing up. JS: Well it&#8217;s actually Six Mile. EF: Oh, Six Mile. I&#8217;m sorry. JS: That&#8217;s okay. Yeah, Six Mile is a very small community. My parents ended up building a house when I was in sixth grade. We lived in one house from the time I was four until sixth grade but we ended up building a house right towards the town of Six Mile. But a very small community; it was one of those you could walk down the street and see everybody you knew. There was maybe one flashing light and that was for the fire department, so not so much like a stoplight or anything. But very close-knit community, everybody knew everybody, and most people were, I would say, very supportive, but very country-type community. High school football was a big deal, community sports was a big deal, church, obviously a very big deal. But yeah, I can&#8217;t say it any better than a small-town community. EF: Right. Well you mentioned church. Describe the church you grew up in and the kind of influence it had on you and your family. JS: Sure. Well, like I said, both my parents were heavily involved in church growing up and also my brother and I were brought up in the church, regular goers on Sunday, Sunday school and things of that nature. But I would have to say that we were Sunday morning Christians, as I refer to it. We went to church of course but then it was not so much thought about or talked about during the home during the weekday with my parents. I know that&#8217;s something they struggle with now, looking back on that. But my dad worked, and still works, for Duke Power, which was a huge industry there very close to Six Mile, so my Dad worked a lot, and my mom worked at Clemson University in HR, so of course they worked a lot when we were in school. But, yeah, church, I would say we were there but it was not talked about in the home so much. At one point when I was in fourth grade I did get baptized but it was more a peer pressure, I would say, type thing, went on a youth retreat and asking people if they wanted to give their hearts to Jesus and everybody else is doing it so I did it. Before I knew it I&#8217;m in the pastor&#8217;s office, we&#8217;re talking about baptism, but I didn&#8217;t know what was going on. So I ended up getting baptized but I can&#8217;t say that it was a heart conversion at that moment in my life. It wasn&#8217;t till much later. So church has been a very big presence in my life, whether it be head knowledge or heart knowledge. EF: Right. You mentioned baptism. So what type of church was it? JS: A Baptist church. EF: Okay. JS: Yeah. We bounced around between several different churches. I&#8217;m trying to remember. We went to Six Mile Baptist Church, Pleasant View Baptist Church, and Cannon Baptist Church. I would say those were the three main churches that we went to during my elementary years to high school years. EF: Okay. Going back to your parents and family, can you talk about the ways in which your mother, your father, siblings, or grandparents influenced you and more specifically their role in bringing you up? JS: Sure. The first person that comes to my mind is actually my great-grandmother. Her name is Emma Forrester. She lived with us temporarily when I was younger in elementary school but, gosh, such a godly lady. She was born in 1899, so she went through the Great Depression and I wish we had recorded more of her story. She loved to share her stories and whatnot. But she always had that godly presence about her. Like I said she lived with us when I&#8211;. Gosh, it was probably like second grade, third grade, somewhere around there to maybe fourth grade. She loved life and nothing ever really seemed to get to her. But she loved my brother and I so much because we were her only great-grandkids. Anyway, I would say she would probably be the one that really has resonated with me throughout the longest period of my life. Both my parents have had big influences on my life as well, if anything learning from their mistakes or things they wish they would have done. I can say they&#8217;ve pushed me to do the things that they didn&#8217;t do, like going to school, getting an education, especially my mother. That&#8217;s something she wished she could have always done was gone to school. So there were many times in my high school years I didn&#8217;t want to go to college but I knew I would benefit from it, so I can say she definitely pushed me in getting educated. EF: Great. Well talk a bit more about your education, especially middle school, high school. What stands out? JS: [Laughs] EF: [Laughs] I know that&#8217;s sort of a broad question. JS: Right. So this can be anything, really? EF: Sure. I guess in general describe your educational experience. JS: All right. Well school is not my thing. I would say even middle school and high school I was a B/C-type student and I really never thought that I would go to college, because I was always told, &#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t have good enough grades. You&#8217;re not going to be able to handle the course load,&#8221; this and that. I was even in some remedial classes, even in high school. Math: that was my biggest struggle. But when I graduated from high school&#8211;. Actually I played volleyball at the same time. I love sports. Anyway, I got accepted to Lander University, which is in South Carolina in the western part of the state. They were going to be forming a volleyball team so my hope was to go to school and then start playing volleyball there, but my senior year in high school I ended up getting pregnant and that derailed a lot of my plans at that time. I ended up not carrying the pregnancy. I ended up choosing abortion, which had a huge impact. It has continually had a huge impact on my life. So I ended up dropping out of school for that semester, went through a lot of issues with that, but I ended up applying&#8211;. I went to a technical school for a year, got a certain amount of credits, and then I was able to transfer into Clemson University. So, long story short, I got into Clemson. I majored in health science. I knew I wanted to stay in the medical field. I liked working with people, that always intrigued me, but health science was a new and upcoming major. Now it&#8217;s called &#8220;health promotions,&#8221; and &#8220;wellness,&#8221; it&#8217;s got a lot of different names to it, but when I was there it was very broad. So that intrigued me and, anyway, it took me five years to graduate but, praise the Lord, I graduated. So, yeah, again I never would have thought I would have gotten a degree from Clemson, but I did. Yay! EF: That&#8217;s great. Well you mentioned your senior year pregnancy. I wonder if you can back up and tell me about that a bit more and those circumstances, as much as you want to share. JS: Sure. Well most definitely, obviously being raised in the South and obviously being raised in the Baptist church and a Bible-believing family, obviously abortion was never something that, one, I thought I&#8217;d ever be faced with and two, I never believed in it, but it was different when I was standing at that door going, &#8220;What am I going to do?&#8221; Basically I had a boyfriend I started dating my senior year in high school. We were very serious, my first serious boyfriend. But anyway, in a moment of weakness, we ended up having sex and I got pregnant the very first time having sex. I was seventeen years old. He was a year younger than me so he was sixteen. But I went into this denial stage. I was getting ready to graduate from high school so I really did, I went into a denial mode, not wanting to think that this was happening to me, and it was actually my best friend who was the one who went and got a pregnancy test for me and said, &#8220;I really think you need to take one.&#8221; Of course all three of them came back positive. I went through graduation. [In] my prom pictures and graduation pictures I&#8217;m pregnant. No one knows except my boyfriend and my best friend. So we ended up deciding to look into an abortion clinic. We were going to Senior Week, going to the beach for Senior Week, getting ready to graduate, so we thought we&#8217;ll look to see if we can find an abortion clinic near Myrtle Beach and make the appointment and no one will have to know. I&#8217;ll pretend that I&#8217;m sick and it won&#8217;t be a big deal, but the closest one we could find was in Columbia, South Carolina. So we went to the Senior Week; halfway through we drove up to Columbia to the abortion clinic. My best friend drove my boyfriend and I. We went to the abortion clinic and we walked in and we couldn&#8217;t do it. The abortion clinic was&#8211;. The people, the smell&#8211;. I mean I can still remember the smells. I can remember the paperwork. The paperwork is what frightened me the most because it talked about death, it talked about not being able to have children ever again, and all these terrifying things that for a seventeen-year-old is a little overwhelming. So we ended up leaving and we went back to Myrtle Beach and finished out Senior Week and I went back into denial mode. I had no idea how far along I was and I didn&#8217;t want to deal with it. I&#8217;m going to college, this had been a dream of mine, even though&#8211;because my parents instilled in me education so I didn&#8217;t even want to deal with telling them. My dream and their dream is going to go down the drain. So again, it&#8217;s summer. My best friend again is going, &#8220;Jennifer, what are you going to do?&#8221; So she made an appointment for me at an abortion clinic in Greenville, South Carolina, so again she drives my boyfriend and I to the abortion clinic, and here we find out that I&#8217;m too far along. I&#8217;m actually in the second trimester at this point and the state of South Carolina, at that time they would not perform beyond first trimester abortions. So that was when I knew I was going to have to tell my parents, and I&#8217;m two weeks getting ready to go to school. I&#8217;m still pretending at home, packing up, getting ready to go to college, and really thinking something magically is going to happen and this pregnancy is going to go away. So it still took us a few days. Finally my boyfriend and I sat my mom down. I couldn&#8217;t even tell my dad. I just didn&#8217;t want to go there. We ended up telling my mom, and of course she was extremely devastated and sad and upset and disappointed and all those things. So I actually didn&#8217;t go home that night so my mom told my dad for me because I just couldn&#8217;t. I knew how disappointed he would be. So my mom decided to make an appointment with her OB/GYN doctor, just to go get a checkup, because I had not had any kind of checkup, nothing. We had no idea how far along I was, nothing. So when we go to my mom&#8217;s OB/GYN, which is in Greenville, abortion I guess was still on the table, which was one of those&#8211;. We didn&#8217;t know what to do. We were all in shock. EF: What year was this? JS: This was in 1993. EF: Okay. JS: So the doctor ended up telling us about an abortion clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. I guess in the state of Georgia second trimester abortions were legal. So we ended up coming home. I don&#8217;t think we ever really talked about it. I ended up calling the clinic and made the appointment. So both my parents went with me to that appointment because it was a two-day process because I was probably sixteen to seventeen weeks along at that time, based on measurements at that time. Ultrasounds were not done. I didn&#8217;t have an ultrasound till right before the abortion. It&#8217;s very different now. So we went through with the abortion. It was very life-changing. I do remember leaving the clinic feeling completely empty, completely like a part of me had been lost, and it had. After the abortion&#8211;and like I said, that was in September of 1993&#8211;I didn&#8217;t go to school that semester so I had to drop out, because I was supposed to go to Lander so that obviously never happened. I ended up kind of spiraling out of control after that abortion. My boyfriend and I started partying a lot more. We both regretted the abortion immediately afterwards. I can remember the next day my boyfriend telling me, &#8220;I wish we didn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; and I was so angry at him for that because I felt like [he] should have stood up, and my father was never on board with the abortion but he still&#8211;. We went through it. So, yeah, after the abortion it was spiraling out of control. My boyfriend ended up graduating the next year&#8211;he was a year younger than me&#8211;so he ended up going to Clemson and we both hit the party scene way too hard. We stayed together about a year, close to two years after the abortion, but we never, ever talked about it again. It really came down to we hated each other for it and we couldn&#8217;t get past that. As much as we wanted to talk about it we couldn&#8217;t talk about it. I ended up getting severely depressed. I ended up going on medication for depression but not really knowing it was because of the abortion because I never talked about it to anyone, ever, even to my parents. After we left the clinic that day we never talked about it. So over the next several years, still trying to go through school, "I&#8217;m going to do this school thing, I&#8217;m going to do it. At least I can focus on that and try to accomplish something with graduating from a university because a lot of people in my family had not." Even with my mom&#8217;s siblings their children had not gone to school, so I was more one of the first ones striving to get an education. So anyway, it took six years of really going through hell of trying to deny. I started jumping from relationship to relationship trying to fill a void that was there. EF: So you said a six-year period. What happened at the end of that six years to change? JS: I guess&#8211;. I mean, I guess I could make the story long, but&#8211;. EF: Please, do tell us more. JS: Right, right. Well, I was getting ready to graduate from Clemson, and I was dating a guy and he graduated at the same time. And we thought we were going to get married. We thought we loved each other but we were more just&#8211;. I don&#8217;t know what it was, but anyway he got a job in Maryland. And when I graduated he asked me to move with him to Maryland, and we would get married and live happily ever after. But anyway, moved to Maryland, the relationship didn&#8217;t work out after we both graduated. And being raised in the church, I really felt like I was coming to a point to my life where I&#8217;m like, "I&#8217;m twenty-three years old," and I felt like I was floundering. So my mom gave me the book Left Behind by Tim&#8211;I&#8217;m blanking on his last name&#8211;LaHaye. It was a series of books. Anyway, it was a lot about where are you going to go when you die, was basically the gist of the first book, and I couldn&#8217;t answer that question. And it really bothered me, even though I was raised in the church and, like I&#8217;d said, I was baptized when I was in fourth grade, but it didn&#8217;t mean anything to me. So I really felt like I needed to know where I&#8217;m going and the direction of my life. I felt this nothingness that bothered me. So when I moved to Maryland, like I said, my boyfriend and I, we didn&#8217;t work out, but I had applied for a job with the Food and Drug Administration because my degree is in health science. And I ended up getting the job and it was an entry-level position. So I ended up staying in Maryland, despite our relationship ending, because of this job. I knew I was not going to find a better job in South Carolina working for the government. But when I started working I met this wonderful lady, her name is Linda, wonderful Christian lady, godly lady. And I started talking to her about the book that I was reading and how I was feeling, so she ended up leading me to the Lord. That was in January of 2000. I made a commitment to myself and I made a commitment to God that I wanted to be a different person. I wanted to live a different lifestyle. I didn&#8217;t want to look to the world any longer to fill the voids that I had in my heart. So that January I started attending a church, Montrose Baptist Church in Rockville, Maryland. And I remember I went on retreat with them somewhere in Pennsylvania, I can&#8217;t remember the retreat, but anyway that was where I finally gave my life to the Lord. And I said from then on, the next person that I date will be the man that I&#8217;m going to marry. I didn&#8217;t want to think about men or boys. I wanted to focus on God, focus on me getting the direction in my life right. So, I got heavily involved with Montrose Baptist Church and, interestingly, a few months later I ended up meeting my now husband. I got involved with their singles ministry because I said, "I&#8217;m going to stop finding friends in bars and clubs." So that was the draw to Montrose because they had a really nice young people&#8217;s single&#8217;s ministry. So I did; I made a lot of great Christian girlfriends and I ended up meeting my husband through this ministry and got heavily involved. So we started dating, courting, in May of 2000. He proposed in July and we got married in November of that year. EF: Of 2000. JS: In 2000, yes, and we&#8217;ve been married almost fourteen years this year. EF: Great. Congratulations. JS: Thank you. So I would say that would be my big pinnacle, life-changing moment. EF: Okay. Well then I guess after you got married in 2000, did you stay at the FDA for a long time and lived in Maryland for a long time? JS: Yeah. We stayed in Maryland, gosh, until 2010, and I worked for the government the whole time. I worked my way up. I went in as a GS-5 and when I left I was a GS-14. EF: What does that mean? JS: It&#8217;s your grade level within the government. EF: I see. JS: So it&#8217;s responsibility, like I came in as a&#8211;oh, I can&#8217;t remember my first title. Oh, I don&#8217;t remember. I was basically an assistant to our director and then I worked my way up to a team leader, so I had like six people under me. I ran our regulatory review department. Basically when medical doctors and scientists come into the FDA they have to be trained on the drug review process as well as the regulations so [my responsibility was] developing basically that training program for these new reviewers, medical doctors and scientists coming into the FDA, which was a really interesting job. I miss it sometimes. EF: Yeah. It sounds exciting. JS: It was very cool. So I did that for ten years. My husband, when we met at Montrose, he was upcoming into the ministry. He had just been hired on staff as the newcomers&#8217; minister at Montrose Baptist Church. So we got married that November [and] in 2002, we actually went to plant a church in Laytonsville, Maryland. So we moved to Olney, which is right near Laytonsville, and he pastored a church there in Laytonsville, Morningstar Community Church, from 2002 and we left in 2010. EF: Okay. JS: We had two children during that time. Nathan was born in 2005 and Kaylie was born in 2008. Yes, that&#8217;s correct. EF: Okay. JS: And my husband during this time too, he went back to school and received his Masters of Divinity from Southeastern [Baptist Theological Seminary], so we knew probably after he finished school&#8211;. We knew when we started having children we wanted to leave Maryland. We both were raised in small towns so we felt we wanted them to have more of that type of upbringing than the city. So in 2010 we were called to Big Island, Virginia and we&#8217;ve been there almost four years this month. EF: Okay. Fascinating. So can you tell me the story about how you came to work here at the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center? JS: Yes, yes. That&#8217;s a great one. When we first moved to Big Island we knew that I would be able to stay at home. That was the goal, whenever we moved, is it would give me an opportunity, because when I worked for FDA it was forty, fifty hours a week, and that&#8217;s not counting commute time, so I really felt like I was missing out on a lot of time with the kids. So this was a great opportunity to be at home, and it was. I felt like we were running a hundred miles an hour and we moved to Big Island, and it was like this big&#8211;whoa!&#8211;ram-into-a-wall stop, but it was great. But after two years I was ready to get back into the work force, but not the forty-fifty hours a week. So I had already started praying about, &#8220;Okay, Lord, I know I want to go back to work, but I know it&#8217;s hard to find a part-time job.&#8221; So the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center had sent a flyer to our church, and we were always big supporters of the Rockville Pregnancy Center in Maryland, and even though I had not shared my story with anyone&#8211;but my husband knew, obviously, I was post-abortive. So anyway, we knew that we wanted to support the pregnancy center. He got the flyer and ended up calling up the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center and said, &#8220;Hey, why don&#8217;t you guys send somebody out here to come speak to our church.&#8221; So Lori, our executive director, came and spoke at our church. And it was not an audible sound but it was God telling me, "You need to get involved with the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center," when Lori came and spoke. So immediately afterwards I talked to her. I said, &#8220;How can I get involved?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want to come be a counselor.&#8221; So I ended up opening up to her. I shared my story with her, first time I&#8217;d ever shared it, and that had been twenty years, almost. She told me she was post-abortive and it was like this, "Oh my gosh, there&#8217;s other people like me." Even though I knew there probably were other people, but it was different talking to someone who had actually been through what I had been through. So she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, come on down. We&#8217;re going to do a volunteer training. Why don&#8217;t you take the volunteer training?&#8221; And I said great, and when I came a couple times for the volunteer training, their director of development was leaving. She wanted to be a wedding planner or something like that. So anyway, Lori said, &#8220;God laid you on my heart for this position. Would you be interested?&#8221; And I bawled because it was like God answering that prayer because it was a part time position, the hours fit in perfect with our family But it was also an opportunity that I was going to get to be in ministry, that I was going to be able to counsel other women and help them, which I wish I would have had someone counsel me when I was in that situation because no one ever told me what abortion looked like on the other side. So that is my whole mission, is to tell a woman who is thinking abortion, "The decision is yours, but here&#8217;s what you need to know, what it looks like on the other side, and consider that." Statistics show that women who especially see their babies on ultrasound monitors will choose life for their baby. I didn&#8217;t have that opportunity, to see my baby, so that&#8217;s what we strive to help these women to see their baby so they will not have years and years and years of heartache and regret. Now, we know that God is a forgiving God. I know that I&#8217;ve been forgiven by God because when I gave my life to the Lord in 2000, when I said I wanted to change my life, that was the first thing that I laid at his feet, and I felt that forgiveness. I still struggle with forgiving myself and there&#8217;s still the guilt and the shame, but God I know doesn&#8217;t want me to live in that guilt and shame. So that&#8217;s where I feel called now, is to help women, especially in the Lynchburg area, who have either gone through an abortion or who are thinking about it, and educate them. EF: Right. Well tell me a bit more about what you do in your position specifically and then the work around the community that the pregnancy center here does. JS: Sure. Well my title is the director of development, so my main job is fundraising and building relationships with churches and organizations within the area. We do several, maybe three, big fundraisers a year. One is our baby bottle campaign where we take plastic baby bottles to churches or organizations and for a certain amount of time they can fill up those baby bottles with change or dollar bills, checks, we take anything. But those are brought back to the center as then a fundraiser. We also do a banquet once a year that is our largest fundraiser where we usually have a featured speaker, and we invite donors and then we try to get those donors to invite potentially other prolife friends, neighbors, relatives, whatnot, to come and hear about the ministry. Then that night we actually have an opportunity for people to give or to give throughout the year, so they can give that night or monthly, quarterly, however they want to do it. But it&#8217;s to make a pledge throughout the next year of a certain amount of money that they would like to give. We also do a Walk for Life. Gosh, last year it was our second-biggest fundraiser, and again it&#8217;s to try to grasp young people to come out and walk for life, for the cause, and raise money. We get donations from certain businesses for prizes and things of that nature. Then another part of my job is meeting with pastors or leaders within churches to let them know who we are and that we&#8217;re here, especially if they have anyone in their congregation who is caught in an unplanned pregnancy or who&#8217;s post-abortive. We&#8217;ve seen women come through our doors for post-abortion Bible studies in their sixties and seventies, looking for and needing healing and counseling. EF: I wonder if you can talk about that. You&#8217;ve said several times now &#8220;post-abortive.&#8221; I wonder if you could explain what you mean by that and maybe what it signifies. JS: Sure, sure. Post abortion means someone who has had an abortion, so when I refer to myself as post-abortive just meaning that I&#8217;ve had an abortion, gone through that experience. EF: Okay. JS: Yeah. Does that answer your question? EF: Oh yeah, definitely. I wanted to clarify. Yes, it does. JS: Okay. EF: I guess can you talk a bit more about the pregnancy center&#8217;s work in the community? What messages are shared? You talked about it a little bit, but I guess when you go into churches or different organizations, what are some of the messages that you share and try to get across? JS: Right. Well one of the things that we most definitely say is that we are a Christian organization. We try to educate our clients on their options, and they have three different options when they come into our center, especially if they have a positive test. Let me back up a little bit. All of our services that we offer are free and confidential, and that&#8217;s one of the draws that we can have in bringing women in to come to our center, is that everything is free and, of course, confidential. So we offer them a free pregnancy test and it&#8217;s a lab-quality test. It&#8217;s a urine test but it would be something of a higher quality than what they would buy at CVS or Wal-Mart over the counter. We also offer free ultrasounds, and that&#8217;s limited obstetrical ultrasound, and when I say &#8220;limited&#8221; that means that we try to&#8211;. Most of our ultrasounds we do in the first trimester, up to twelve weeks, and we look for three things. We look to see that the pregnancy is within the uterus. If a woman is thinking about abortion and that baby is not in the uterus then abortion is going to be pointless. If the baby is in the fallopian tubes, she needs to go to the emergency room right away because her life is at risk and the baby&#8217;s not going to survive in the fallopian tube. So we can tell her that her baby&#8217;s in the uterus. We can also measure the baby&#8217;s heart rate to make sure it&#8217;s within a healthy heart rate. And then we can also measure the baby to see how far along she is because based on how far along she is depends on the type of abortion, because there&#8217;s the medical abortion, just the pill, and a surgical abortion where there&#8217;s more invasive going in and scraping and taking the baby out of the uterus. So we educate her on abortion procedures, we educate her on parenting, and we also educate her on adoption, so we go through those three different options with the client, but of course it is her decision. We are trying to help her to choose life but if she doesn&#8217;t we are nonjudgmental. We are a compassionate ministry mainly because six out of the ten women on staff here are post-abortive, so we understand what it&#8217;s like, and we can have her come back, if she chooses abortion, and try to help her cope with the decision she&#8217;s made. EF: Yeah, absolutely. Right. Okay. Maybe if you can go into more detail why, in your words, the work of the pregnancy center is important. JS: Well I know for me personally it&#8217;s very important because, like I said, I wish somebody would have told me what abortion looked like on the other side, the emotional effects, physical side effects as well as spiritual. Especially after my abortion in 1993, I couldn&#8217;t even walk into the church for the longest time, even though I was raised in the church, because I knew what I had done was so wrong and that completely separated me from God. Not so much God moving, me moving because of the guilt and the shame that I was suffering. So&#8211;what was your question again? EF: Why is the work important? JS: That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m sorry. So we want to educate her on those things, but we also feel that when we have clients coming into the center that most of them are lost. I refer to how I was feeling lost and not knowing the direction of my life, so we also speak the gospel to these women that walk through the door. We tell them that their greatest need and their greatest hope is Jesus Christ, and we walk them through what the gospel is and try to offer them that hope that they can have. But yeah, our biggest thing is saving mothers and babies, not just physically but also spiritually. EF: Okay. Well, maybe moving a bit beyond, you mentioned before I turned the recorders on, that you and your husband consider yourselves conservative politically. So I wonder if you can talk a bit about what forms of conservative politics you&#8217;re involved in, or what resonates most with you and how you&#8217;re involved in the community politically. JS: Right. I would say probably what defines us most is conservative. We obviously take part in every election, but of course we&#8217;re going to look at the conservative issues to us, meaning is this candidate prolife, is this candidate, you know, what is their stance on marriage? And we try to educate, especially my husband through our church, educate others, because our focus is on what the Bible says. We live by what the Bible says, and of course abortion is murder, that is taking the lives of babies, so obviously, no. That is not something we believe in, as well as same-sex marriage. We believe the Bible talks about one man and one woman coming together. So it&#8217;s taking the stand, I guess, with how we vote, how we talk with others in our community. We support leaders in our community who are conservative. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m answering your question. EF: Oh, you are. JS: Okay. EF: Absolutely. Beyond yourself, are there ways that the pregnancy center here is involved politically in the community? JS: No. EF: Okay. JS: Yeah, we are a nonpolitical, nondenominational organization. EF: Right. Gotcha. So part of this project that I&#8217;m interviewing other people for, I&#8217;m trying to look at what role women have specifically played in conservative politics, locally and nationally, but more so locally. So drawing on your own experience personally, but also maybe broadly, what influence politically have you seen women have in the political field, and what role do you think they should have, if that makes sense? JS: Yeah. EF: That was a long question. JS: Yeah. I&#8217;m not sure how to answer that. Well for me it&#8217;s most definitely taking the prolife stance. I mean, I&#8217;ve had conversations with women who are, &#8220;It&#8217;s my body, it&#8217;s my choice,&#8221; And yeah, I mean being prolife is a choice, but it&#8217;s seeing that as life, not just a choice. I mean, I love the opportunity to talk with women who are prochoice because sometimes they don&#8217;t think about that as a life, and I know that&#8217;s a whole debate on when life starts, [Laughs] so that&#8217;s a whole other conversation. I keep forgetting the question. EF: No, you&#8217;re right on track. I&#8217;m trying to think about the political realm, but that certainly makes sense. JS: Yeah. I mean I would say even for my husband and I, with political stance, it&#8217;s the whole&#8211;our constitutional rights, having free liberty, freedom of speech. We feel like more and more those things are being taken away. I look at my children in school, I mean they&#8217;re not looked down upon for praying, but I know that obviously it&#8217;s not encouraged. Like when I was in school in a small-town community we said the pledge and the principal prayed over the intercom, whereas now those things are slowly and quickly being taken away from our country. Even disagreeing with somebody or not believing the things that they believe in is coming to be considered a hate crime, or it feels like we&#8217;re heading in that direction and it&#8217;s frightening. So I feel like we need more voices standing up for especially biblical values that I know a lot of conservatives&#8211;not a lot, but there are conservatives who do take that stance and needing to speak those voices. EF: Well, you mentioned also enjoying a chance to talk with women who are prochoice. So another question I&#8217;m trying to get at by talking to folks is to try to understand the maybe multiple meanings of feminism. I know that can be a term that elicits different feelings in people so for you, what does feminism mean to you? JS: Um&#8211;. [Pause] EF: If anything. JS: Right, right. Well, my first thought is feminism is women&#8217;s rights, I&#8217;m equal to a man and I have the same rights as anyone. And I would say I agree with that to a certain extent but it&#8217;s&#8211;. I&#8217;m trying to formulate the words. It&#8217;s more of an excuse to be a way that you want to be rather than&#8211;. Again for me, it goes back to what the Bible says. It&#8217;s one man, one woman in marriage, and I think women should have the same rights, but can women do the same things as men? No. I mean could I go out and be a logger, logging trees? No. [Laughs] I mean some women can, but I think some women get offended by that if you were to tell them no, but it&#8217;s not because [Pause] you can&#8217;t do it but because can you physically do it? But I think women get easily offended by something when they&#8217;re told they can&#8217;t do something, but in reality most women probably can&#8217;t do that. Does that make sense? EF: It does. JS: Okay. EF: I understand what you&#8217;re saying. JS: Yeah. So, yeah, for me it is more like a fad or a, I don&#8217;t know, cultural thing where it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, making a mountain out of a molehill [Laughs] kind of thing. EF: Well it&#8217;s interesting. I wanted to ask, to get your thoughts, which you did, which is great. Well, really that&#8217;s about all I have. Is there anything else that you&#8217;d like to say or any other questions that I should have asked that I didn&#8217;t? JS: I don&#8217;t think so. No, I don&#8217;t have any questions. I mean if you feel like that is a good representation. EF: Okay. Well, great. Thank you for taking the time. I appreciate it. JS: Sure...
