 Jennifer Donnally: Good morning. This is May 24th, 2010, and my name is Jennifer Donnally. Today, I am interviewing Jane Weeks in her home in Maryville, Tennessee. Jane Weeks: Jane Sutherland Weeks. JD: Okay. JW: I love my maiden name; it&#8217;s a good Scottish name. JD: So my first question is where did you grow up? JW: I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. JD: What was your childhood like? JW: Well, I came from middle-class parents and I had a very easy childhood. Of course, I grew up during the Depression, but we didn&#8217;t suffer from the Depression in any way. My father was a businessman. I have an older sister and a younger brother; I was the middle child, which always made me very, I guess, ambitious or striving, as middle children are because they&#8217;re never happy with the way they are. My name being Jane, I always thought [it] meant &#8220;plain Jane.&#8221; My sister was very brilliant, and even in the thirties was going to special schools for skilled children. In the thirties, they had these special schools. My brother was a very accomplished musician, and my mother always said, &#8220;Well, Jane, you&#8217;re the one with common sense,&#8221; which meant to me, I was just common and plain Jane, [laughter] and[being] the middle child, of course, filled me with ambition. My father was Canadian and my mother was from Kentucky. She had come from a well-to-do family and had taught us to be very, very tolerant of blacks. We should never use the &#8220;N&#8221; word and we should not even say &#8220;Negro&#8221;; we should always say &#8220;colored people&#8221; because otherwise &#8220;It hurts their feelings.&#8221; So we grew up, my sister and my brother and I being very, very tolerant. I had a Presbyterian first and Episcopalian background, and then I went to the Methodist church and ended up teaching at a Baptist college and became a Unitarian. Now I&#8217;m living in a Presbyterian retirement community. [Laughter] Everything but Catholic and Lutheran. I guess that&#8217;s about it. Oh, I joined the Navy when I was twenty years old to get away from home. JD: Was this during World War II or--? JW: What? JD: When was--was this during World War II or--? JW: World War II, yes, when I was twenty. You had to be twenty to get in[to] the Navy. I had a year at the university and then I wanted to get away, so I went to the Navy and [had] two wonderful years in the Navy. I was in New York City for a year, where I was in charge of training troops, a sergeant type of person. Then I went to California for six months and then I went to Hawaii for six months. Then I came home and I went to school on the GI Bill, finished my education. JD: Where did you go to university? JW: University of Alabama. When I came back, I went to Birmingham Southern. That&#8217;s where I met my husband. We were both veterans, and so we got married and moved here so he could finish his work. Well, I hadn&#8217;t finished [my degree]; I had one more year of college, but he came for graduate work in--he&#8217;s a physicist. We&#8217;ve been here ever since. JD: So, how did your experience in the Navy, did it broaden your horizons, change you in any way? JW: As far as race relations, I was talking about this the other day, when they decided to let blacks in[to the Navy], I was at the training school which was at Hunter College at that time, and a number of people would say to me, &#8220;Jane, what do you think when these Negroes or colored girls or whatever?" and I couldn&#8217;t understand why they were asking me that question. Well, it doesn&#8217;t make any difference to me. Since I was from the South, they were asking me, but I was puzzled because it didn&#8217;t affect me in any way. Now my husband, he came from a very poor environment, and he saw many terrible experiences with blacks. He&#8217;s much more, he&#8217;s much stronger oriented toward civil rights than I am, [be]cause he&#8217;s seen some bad things. But we both had worked together and worked with our children, so--. JD: So you came here, then, probably in the late 1940s, early 1950s? JW: In 1948. We both went to the university, and we both got Masters at UT [University of Tennessee, Knoxville]. Then he went on to Brown and got his Ph.D. and I stopped at a Masters, but I taught at UT for about thirty years. JD: Wow! What did you teach at UT? JW: Sociology. Are you a sociology major? JD: I am not a sociology major, but I&#8217;m dating one, so apparently--. Also, I&#8217;ve dated a few sociology PhDs so I&#8217;m familiar with the discipline and I read a lot of sociologists. What drew you to sociology? JW: Yeah, I majored in sociology and stayed there and taught for almost thirty years, and [pause] I didn&#8217;t get tenure because I kept dropping out to have babies. You have to [teach] seven years [consistently to be eligible for tenure]. I would teach for a while and then I&#8217;d have a baby, and then I&#8217;d go back and teach some more and I had four [children]. Then we went off to Egypt and lived in Egypt for a year and I taught at the American University in Egypt. JD: So was it possible--did you face any discrimination when you were at UT as a woman teacher, a woman professor? JW: Oh, yeah, definitely; we were all low grade. We weren&#8217;t paid very much; there were no promotions. You know, we were the bottom of the totem pole, definitely. There were two women professors there when I went. They were both in physics. No, there were three; one was in geology. The English department was the poorest [paid] because they needed all these teachers to teach English [Composition], and they were the poorest paid and most prevalent around. And you couldn&#8217;t get your degree there. If you got your degree there, you couldn&#8217;t teach any more. I couldn&#8217;t leave to get my Ph.D. because I had four children. JD: Did you follow your husband to Brown when he went then, or--? JW: No, I stayed here. JD: And you stayed and taught while he was getting his Ph.D.? Did he get his Ph.D. quickly then? Was that an incentive? JW: I&#8217;m sorry. JD: Did he get his Ph.D. quickly then? Was that an incentive? JW: Well, yes, he did because he had worked for a while at Oak Ridge and so all that contributed [credits], and he had a good reputation; he already had a scientific reputation when he went. He did his required course work and then he came back and did his dissertation after he came back. He was gone for a year. They paid his way though. JD: Oak Ridge? JW: Yeah, they paid it [plus full salary]. JD: So, sociology. So did you form any good close relationships with any other female professors or teachers at UT when you were [there] over thirty years? JW: Well, there weren&#8217;t any women in the sociology department. JD: So you were the only woman teacher in sociology? JW: Well, no, seniors, there was another instructor or so, but there weren&#8217;t while I was there. I was there a long time and there were a number of [instructors] that came and went, but there were no senior sociologists. When I first went to UT, I was taking anthropology because I was very interested in anthropology. There was a woman anthropologist there, a woman by the name of Madeline Kneberg and a male anthropologist. They were the only two in the department, and I just adored her. I just immediately fell in love with her. I remember she stood outside the classroom smoking a cigarette. A woman about your height, and she told me she was forty-two, and she smoked that cigarette, and I just thought she was the most wonderful thing in the world. [Laughter] She wrote a book and they did most of the original excavations and things here in East Tennessee, the first ones that were being done on the Indians, she and this man. If I had a mentor, she was the one. We didn&#8217;t call them that back then, but if I had one, she was the one. I wanted to be just like her. Friendly enough to call and tell a student [she] was forty-two, you know. [Laughter] JD: Was she single? JW: Well, she lived with her mother and he lived with his mother, but everybody knew they lived together. But there was a nepotism rule, and they couldn&#8217;t get married. Now we&#8217;re talking about the forties, and everybody knew they were living together; there was no question about that, and it wasn&#8217;t even a scandal, it was just--. JD: That you couldn&#8217;t have two married people in the same department? JW: Two related in any way. JD: So they just became partners? JW: No, on the campus, they couldn&#8217;t even be on the--no nepotism at all on the campus, even in different departments. JD: Really? JW: Yeah. JD: Okay, &#8216;cause I&#8217;ve heard of nepotism within the same department, but not in different departments, but no married--? Well, that makes it awfully difficult. JW: Yeah. JD: If you&#8217;re in the academy. JW: Now [that] I think about it; I may be wrong about that because there were two professors; one of the women professors was in physics and her husband was in [Botany] but I guess I&#8217;m wrong about that. JD: As an instructor, did you get connected to the UT community in any significant way? JW: Did I get what? JD: Connected into the UT community in any significant way? JW: Yes, because we associated with the faculty, the senior faculty, my husband and I. On a married level, we were on a different [social] level than I was as an instructor. So we&#8217;d have the dean and the vice-chairman over at our house for dinner and go to their house for dinner. We knew all those people very intimately and I worked [with] them [and their wives on community committees], and many of us went to the same church. JD: Which church was this? JW: It was the Unitarian church, and we were all working together, trying to get the schools integrated and hospitals integrated and women&#8217;s activities started. Unitarians have always been very liberal. So, on a social level, [I knew all] these people quite well, but on the work level, I was the instructor in the department. JD: So when did you start becoming involved in civil rights in terms of trying to get the schools integrated and the hospitals integrated? JW: In 1950, [pause] let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;ve got a history of this organization called Fellowship House I&#8217;m going to give you, and it tells how it got started, but some women decided that we could speed along integration if we could get the children to become acquainted and play with one another. So they decided to set up an interfaith, inter-race day camp in 1950. They asked me--these were older women in the church and in the community. JD: What Unitarian church is this? JW: Tennessee Valley United [pause] Unitarian Universalist. Tennessee Valley--. JD: If you don&#8217;t have the exact name, that&#8217;s okay. JW: [Laughter] Anyway, I don&#8217;t go there any more. JD: It&#8217;s the Knoxville Unitarian church. JW: Yes, the first one in Knoxville. So they decided to set up a day camp, and they asked me if I would be director of a day camp. I was still a student at that time, and we had to have it in somebody&#8217;s back yard, and we didn&#8217;t want the newspapers or anybody to find out about it because it was still very, very dangerous at that time to do anything [interracial] of that sort. So we had a successful camp for about two weeks. Of course, we didn&#8217;t know much of what we were doing and everybody there was a volunteer. I had had no experience and no one else had, but it worked. Then it became [an] annual [event] and it went on for some twenty or more years, and it kept getting bigger and bigger and ended up in public parks, in Maryville, colleges and places like that. JD: Did you work with black women to do the interfaith camp? JW: Um-hmm. JD: Now I&#8217;m going to ask you an interesting question. You talked earlier about growing up as a very tolerant child, that your parents instilled tolerance, but there&#8217;s somewhat of a step of tolerance versus actively pursuing civil rights. What caused that transition to occur? JW: I guess it was this camp because we didn&#8217;t have--and there were a couple of black families at the Unitarian church, but there wasn&#8217;t that [black/white] interaction. When we started the Women&#8217;s Center, we got an awful lot of complaints from people about not getting blacks in. Well, we had to get out and really hunt around to find blacks to get them and bring them because, in the South, and probably in Arkansas too, where you live--Kansas, excuse me. JD: Kansas, yeah. JW: Kansas. [Laughter] You know, our cultures are separated and you don&#8217;t interact; there&#8217;s no place to interact. I mean, you&#8217;ve got maids in your home; I&#8217;m talking about back then. Now, the children [go to school together], but back then, they lived in one part of town; you lived in another. You know, they did jobs for you and there was no way to ever know anyone socially. JD: So that this day camp was a first step to getting to know them. JW: I guess it was, yeah, or at the church. Well, the day camp when I first began to work with them, yeah. JD: So what were some--were there any particular people or events that made you go--they deserve the same civil rights, and segregation and Jim Crow? JW: Well, then this organization, [Fellowship House], went on after the day camps. They modeled themselves after something called Fellowship House of Philadelphia, and they did a number of things. We had meetings and [pause] my husband was very active in getting the University of Tennessee integrated, and the hospitals. I was still teaching and he was a student at that time, so he had a little more free time to work on those things. I was teaching [and] I had children too, but he participated in the sit-ins and so on, so we began to have a core of people, blacks and whites working together on these things. It developed in Knoxville in the fifties. JD: Did your husband ever get arrested? JW: No, he never did. JD: So he just participated in sit-ins? JW: Yeah, he was in a few sit-ins. JD: It probably was good for your children that Dad came home at night. JW: How old were they? JD: It probably was good for your children that your husband got to come home at night. JW: Oh, yeah. [Laughter] JD: So you had four; how old were your children during this time period? You had a lot balancing. JW: Well, the first one was born in [19]53 [after the Fellowship House day camp] so we were--. You know, the sixties was when the civil rights thing started, so the oldest one was about ten, yeah. The youngest one would have just been born. JD: So you started in the day camps. What other activities did you do surrounding civil rights in addition to the day camp? And tell me a little bit more about Fellowship House. JW: [Pause] From there, we went into--I was working at Oak Ridge then. I may be getting a bit confused. This was before the children were born I was working at Oak Ridge, and of course, before the children were born that I was doing the Fellowship House. The oldest one was born in [19]53, and we had done all this stuff in the later part of the forties and the early fifties, so there was about a three or four year period before the children. After the children came, I didn&#8217;t have as much time to spend on these things as I had, [because] I was working and had children. JD: That&#8217;s understandable. JW: Yeah, and we had a big house and a forty acre farm, and you know, it just-- [laughter]. So I didn&#8217;t do very much for a number of years. JD: But your husband continued to be active, or did he--? JW: Well, then he went on; he went to work at Oak Ridge and then he went to Brown and we were just out of it, of that particular social activity. JD: What brought you back in the mid-sixties then? JW: I got into the women&#8217;s movement. I&#8217;ve always been a feminist; I was born with the feminist symbol in--[laughter]. JD: Did you have any history in your family of women&#8217;s activism? Your mom or your grandmother? JW: Not that I know of. I just was a rebel. I didn&#8217;t want to be like my mother. I loved my mother, just adored her, but she was a perfect lady; always the perfect lady, very calm and quiet and well-spoken and nice. My father was very dominant, and I didn&#8217;t want that [kind of marriage]. No way I was going to have that kind of life. You know, history is full of women like that. You read Virginia Woolf and you read, going all the way back to Sister Teresa or what was her name, [Hildergaard]? There&#8217;s always been women rebels. Unfortunately, they had a hard time because they could never find themselves or were never allowed to do what they wanted to do, but they&#8217;ve always, [pause] they&#8217;ve always been there. You&#8217;re going to inherit your personality [despite the time and culture]. So anyway, we went to Egypt in 1970. My husband and I both taught at the American University in Egypt, and that was a wonderful experience. The children all went and that was a great experience. We came back and [I] had been teaching part-time at UT for thirty years [but] I wasn&#8217;t sure I was coming back to a job. Carson-Newman, which is a little Baptist college--well, it&#8217;s not a little one, but it&#8217;s a Baptist college, about thirty miles--called me up and asked me if I&#8217;d come up there and teach. So I went up there and taught for ten years. That gave me time because the children were pretty well gone [from home] by then; I had one teenager at home. [Pause] I belonged to an organization called Knoxville Urban ministry, which was an interfaith, interracial group who did social things in the community. One of the women there--I met a number of young women whose husbands were ministers, and I was surprised by them. They too were chafing at the bit and couldn&#8217;t stand the role of being a pastor&#8217;s wife, and used to complain about it, which was a real shocker to me. One of them had found Mary Daly. Now, Mary Daly was a rebel nun who wrote a book called [pause]--. It&#8217;s not God, the Father [Beyond God the Father (1973)]. Oh, she was one of the first ones to write a book rebelling against the Christian religion, and they asked her to come here and speak, and she did. They got a well-organized group of women there [at the meeting]. I was surprised; there must have been twenty or thirty women at that meeting. She made some statements--first time, she&#8217;d speak in the afternoon and no men were allowed. [Laughter] Then she would speak in the evening and the men could come but they couldn&#8217;t ask questions. [Laughter] So, after the meeting, these women said, &#8220;There&#8217;s so much we don&#8217;t know, way down here in East Tennessee. There&#8217;s just lots to know; we need to know something [about the women&#8217;s movement].&#8221; So we formed a Monday night--what did we call it? Monday Night Book Club, I think, or Monday Night something like that. Actually, it was a &#8220;consciousness-raising&#8221; group but we didn&#8217;t know. That word hadn&#8217;t come into common use at that time, &#8220;consciousness-raising,&#8221; but that&#8217;s what we were doing. It was just like bubbles exploding. It was just phenomenal. Here were all these women, they were mostly college-educated; they were married to professional people and they weren&#8217;t happy. The only book coming out was Betty Friedan&#8217;s book. That was the first one to come out. JD: So was this in the early sixties then? Because Betty Friedan was 1963 if I&#8217;m not mistaken. JW: Okay, that&#8217;s when it was, yeah. JD: So you had that as your reading on those nights? JW: Well, then there were magazine articles. There were quite a number of magazine articles we could find, but there just weren&#8217;t books [many books about the Women&#8217;s Movement]. There was another little book called I&#8217;m Running Away From Home, But I&#8217;m Not Allowed to Cross the Street. [Laughter] And Mary Daly&#8217;s books, there just wasn&#8217;t--. And then, someone asked me if I would teach a course at the free university at UT. The students were organizing what they called a free university. That&#8217;s a university without walls, where a bunch of people get together and decide we&#8217;re going to study this. They go out and they find an instructor or a group leader or something, if they can find an empty room or a place in the library or out on campus or wherever, and have a free university. So they asked me if I&#8217;d teach a course in women&#8217;s studies. That must have been in, [pause] had to be in the sixties&#8230; JD: &#8230;The late sixties&#8230; JW: &#8230;the late sixties, yeah. I was teaching a course on television. Yeah, I was teaching a course on television. I don&#8217;t know; I can&#8217;t remember. Anyway, let me get to this point. One of the women in this group had been a student of mine at UT, and she worked for the Peace Corps in Washington and she had just moved back to Knoxville. Her husband was a lawyer. She said, &#8220;Jane, let&#8217;s you and I get a grant and set up a non-profit organization to get these women together.&#8221; No, no, to study minister&#8217;s wives. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get a grant to study minister&#8217;s wives.&#8221; JD: And who was this? JW: Emily Passino. She&#8217;s in Nashville now. She works for the state and her husband is--I think he&#8217;s an attorney general or he was; he may be retired now. Her daughter is here in Knoxville. Her daughter defended--you know this boy who got caught hacking Sarah Palin&#8217;s emails? JD: No, I haven&#8217;t heard about this. JW: Well, I won&#8217;t go into that. Anyway, her daughter is his defense attorney. So Emily [and I] now began to talk about [what we would do]. She knew how to get grants and things because she&#8217;d had this experience in the Peace Corps and the government. [Emily said] &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s make it a little bit bigger than that. Let&#8217;s do an organization. Let&#8217;s put together an organization. We can get these women in here. We&#8217;ve got women who have degrees in economics; we&#8217;ve got women with degrees in sociology, psychology, business; we&#8217;ve got [women with] this and this, and those who don&#8217;t have that kind of education, they can do the interviewing and the statistical work and we&#8217;ll put them all together. Then if somebody wants to get a grant, you can plug into this organization, we&#8217;ll find the grant for you and then we&#8217;ll have all these people to help you.&#8221; They won&#8217;t be making much money, but the women couldn&#8217;t get jobs then anyway. There weren&#8217;t jobs, and they were glad to have something to do. JD: What women are we talking about? JW: These women I was telling you about we&#8217;d met at this&#8230; JD: &#8230;Oh, the pastors&#8217; wives. JW: And other professional women, other women in town. I guess we were all in our, let&#8217;s say, our late twenties to our upper thirties maybe. That age group, who were well educated and married and had children and couldn&#8217;t get jobs, the ones Betty Friedan was talking about, that&#8217;s who we were. So we called it Group Associates, Inc. But then we had our first meeting and they said, &#8220;They&#8217;ve got all these people in there.&#8221; [Laughter] We found a lawyer here in town at the university who&#8217;s at the legal aid clinic. He helped us write a charter, assigned a student to us, a woman student. Oh, I should have given you her name [Carol Nickels]. We got into business as a non-profit group, and [this assembled group] decided at the first meeting that it should be called the Women&#8217;s Center. So we went to one of the women; one of the women was on some [pause] committees, some city committees. [At her suggestion] we went to the mayor. She knew the mayor and asked him to give us some space, and he gave us a room and a telephone and then&#8230; JD: &#8230;So you were welcomed, sort of. JW: We were welcomed. JD: Nobody fought against you. JW: Oh ,no, no, no, no. JD: Do you happen to have that law student&#8217;s name at all? Do you know her name? Can you recall? JW: Yeah, I&#8217;ve got a history of the Women&#8217;s Center I&#8217;m going to give you also. JD: Okay. JW: It has her name in it. So we set up the Women&#8217;s Center and it was very successful for about twenty-five years, when the funding gave out. We were doing real well under Johnson&#8217;s Great Society because we could get grants. We were a new group and the politicians just loved us because they thought we were going to vote as a bloc, [laughter] and they were wooing us. It was high times. JD: So this is all during the mid-sixties, late sixties&#8230; JW: &#8230;Yeah&#8230; [Actually 1974 to the 1980s] JD: &#8230;when this is happening. JW: Yeah. JD: So what kind of things did you do at the Women&#8217;s Center? JW: Well, the first thing we did, and the phones started ringing almost immediately, people calling for help, we started doing job training and legal [aid], helping people learn about their legal rights. At that time, women couldn&#8217;t even get a charge account. They had to get a charge account in their husband&#8217;s name. The black women&#8217;s problem was they wanted to be called &#8220;Mrs.&#8221; Nobody wanted to call them Mrs.; they wanted to call them Mary Sue Jones, and white women wanted to drop the Mrs. and be called Mary Sue Jones. We couldn&#8217;t drop the Mrs. and they couldn&#8217;t pick it up because of the certain former ways of doing things, and that was quite a problem. We&#8217;d discuss it, and the blacks would say, &#8220;Well, I want to be called Mrs. John Smith.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me Mrs. John Smith. My name is Mary Jane Smith.&#8221; So that&#8217;s when we really began to be aware of one another, I guess, that our lives, while so similar, were so different. We did job training, we got a big grant which we called the W.O.R.K. Program, W-O-R-K, Women&#8217;s Opportunities and Referrals of Knoxville. This is all in that history. We got state money, we got federal money, and we got trainers to come in. We did a Women in the Arts program every year. We [would] have a big program where we get local women performers, those could sing or--musical accomplishments, painters, and we would take over one of the local theaters, and they&#8217;d hang all their artwork and pottery and crafts out in the lobby. Then we&#8217;d have a program, and of course, we had professional people who knew how to produce and to put on shows. You know, people would do the printing for us; this was donated, and the bank across the street would donate the top floor of their business room to us. Caterers would donate things and we had a big wine and cheese party at the bank, and then you&#8217;d go down and go across the street to the theater and here were all the women in the arts. Oh, it was a fundraiser and it was a big production for a number of years. But then more and more women became employed, and as they got employed, they didn&#8217;t have time to work on these programs any more either, so you couldn&#8217;t find the volunteers to do these things. There was the W.O.R.K. program that was very successful and Women in the Arts was very successful. We did classes for women on assertiveness training early on. Assertiveness training, which was one of the big things we did. We had conferences; we had a conference for businesswomen up in Gatlinburg. One of the first conferences, and I remember this woman sitting there and she said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to come to this thing for women.&#8221; We all had that negative attitude towards women. You know, &#8220;Women are not as good as men,&#8221; and &#8220;Women sit around and talk about recipes and babies,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;I look around here and see, there&#8217;s a smart woman and there&#8217;s a smart woman and there&#8217;s another smart woman.&#8221; So we had a successful business conference and then we had a conference for law, and we had health conferences, and [pause] it&#8217;s in the history. We did a lot. We did an awful lot. JD: I have a few questions to follow up. First, you mentioned it a little bit when you started the Women&#8217;s Center in the mid-sixties. One of the things that you had to really work hard to do was to recruit black women into the Women&#8217;s Center. How did you guys go about doing that? JW: Well, they found us soon. We hired a black secretary. JD: Do you know her name? JW: No, and I don&#8217;t have it written down either. [Gail Robinson] That&#8217;s where I knew [Dr.] Doris Scott, and it&#8217;s Doris Scott Crawford; it&#8217;s not just Doris Scott. [Interruption] I was working very closely with this woman, Doris Scott Crawford. Actually, she told me how to write grants. I didn&#8217;t know how to write grants and she taught me how to write grants. Gradually, the blacks began to come in. Then, when we had the W.O.R.K. Program, of course, we got lots of blacks because we were fed the lower-class blacks, the women in need, and we had a clothes closet for women who [needed clothes to dress for job interviews]. We taught them how to go interview for a job and how to prepare for a job, and we taught people to do certain skills. Then we had closets of clothes for them, and they began to come in that way. We had a number of black women on our board. They just kind of came in. At that late date, [1985 on], there began to be more blacks. JD: Some of the programs you mentioned are addressing grievances, but what were some of the big grievances that women were expressing during the consciousness-raising group that you had, the Monday Night Book Club? What were some of the discussions? What were some of the revelations that you had? JW: Well, I guess one thing that came out was how many women resented their husbands. [Laughter] Because we were all taught you weren&#8217;t supposed to do that, and [that] a man was perfect. JD: You said it was particularly surprising with the pastor&#8217;s wives, right? JW: Yeah. Oh, because they didn&#8217;t want to live this life they were supposed to live. One woman in particular, she was an actress. She was a marvelous actress, and she said, &#8220;I just wish I could preach on Sunday. I could do so much better job than he can do.&#8221; [Laughter] And she could have. JD: Yeah, and you didn&#8217;t have women preachers at this point in time. JW: Yeah, but we didn&#8217;t--. JD: Which was a different movement that came to Knoxville too. JW: There was a young woman named Candy. Candy, Candy, Candy--and I don&#8217;t have her name written down. She was an [associate minister]. JD: &#8230;I&#8217;m interviewing her. JW: Is she still in town? JD: Her name is on our list, so I know one of us contacted her. JW: Well, I&#8217;ll be darn. She, I think, was about the first one [that I was aware of]. JD: She may be in Nashville. JW: And she was a member of the Women&#8217;s Center. Then she and somebody else tried to organize their own women&#8217;s center and it didn&#8217;t work. Well, they were charging and we were still offering free services primarily. JD: Why did she start trying to organize her own women&#8217;s center? Were there disagreements that led to that? JW: The other woman was a politician, and she said, &#8220;We can make money doing this.&#8221; We were urged when we first organized the Women&#8217;s Center to make it a profit--. A number of men told us that, because Emily and I went around and we talked to people all over Knoxville before we started this, and a number of men said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a wonderful idea and it&#8217;s badly needed," and &#8220;You can do this, but make it for profit. Don&#8217;t make it a non-profit.&#8221; But you know, I still had family and a job and she was trying to get pregnant. She was a young woman and we just didn&#8217;t have time. JD: To start your own business? JW: Yeah. But there&#8217;s one important person I&#8217;ve left out of all this because she doesn&#8217;t live here. Her name is Sara Gould, and she&#8217;s president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation. I called her the other day after I talked to you. I haven&#8217;t seen Sara or talked to her for a while. Anyway, she was a member of the Women&#8217;s Action Alliance in New York, and they sent her down here. This is in the history too. They sent her down here to talk to the Women&#8217;s Center to see if they could help us find some money to keep ourselves going. Sara came, and Sara and I hit it off just like two people do sometimes. You know, we just immediately hit it off. She always stayed with us when she came, and she always wanted grits for breakfast. [Laughter] I&#8217;d have to get up and cook grits for Sara. Originally from Michigan and lived in New York. For twelve years, Sara came in and out of Knoxville. She worked with Mary Ellen McLoughlin, who was the grant person for Levi Strauss, and she and Mary Ellen helped get us a lot of money. We set up a separate organization at Sara&#8217;s suggestion called Matrix, which was to be a business incubator for women. This was a new idea, this incubation, that we would get women--. Anyway, we got a school, or we got am space in a[n unused school building]; that&#8217;s another long story. But the idea was that we would provide a place for striving new entrepreneurs to come in and set up a business, and we would offer them stenographic help, a central telephone, and, I guess, printing; we didn&#8217;t have [many] computers; maybe we had [a few] computers then; and space and business advice, for which they would pay a certain fee. When they became successful, they would move out and somebody [else would move into the space]. You know, it was an incubator idea. Sara told us to do that, and that would be a business that would furnish the money for the Women&#8217;s Center. But we were also advised, I guess by a lawyer or somebody, to separate the two organizations, the idea being if one of them failed, it wouldn&#8217;t take down the other one. Well, it just so happened that Matrix, the board they had and as they went along, they decided they didn&#8217;t want to be a part of the Women&#8217;s Center, so they went their own way and they did fail, and they didn&#8217;t take down the Women&#8217;s Center because it stayed on. Anyway, Sara helped set up Matrix and the WORK program. See, she&#8217;s a wonderful person. I called her the other day. Do you know her? I asked you one time if you knew her. JD: Mary McLoughlin mentions her very fondly as well. They&#8217;re very close it seems. JW: With who? JD: Mary McLoughlin and Sara. She said she worked very close with Sara and that Sara was a huge component [of] the women&#8217;s movement in Knoxville. JW: She really was. I called her the other day after I had talked to you and [I also] talked to a number of these other people. I didn&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;d have any trouble getting through or not. I called the Ms. Foundation and I asked for Ms. Gould&#8217;s office and they put me right through. I said, &#8220;This is Jane Weeks. I&#8217;m an old friend of Sara&#8217;s and I&#8217;d like to talk to her if you&#8217;ll give her my number and ask her to call me.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s on the phone right now.&#8221; In a little while, Sara called me and she said, &#8220;I asked her, &#8216;Are you sure she said Jane Weeks? Did she have a southern accent?&#8217;&#8221; [Laughter] I said, &#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;d have to have a passport to get through to you or not.&#8221; Anyway, Sara was very important all the time here. Mary Ellen will tell you more about her. JD: So, again, I&#8217;m going to go back. You mentioned that you all realized how much you all resented your husbands in the conscious-raising group, but what were other things that you realized about women&#8217;s place alongside--? JW: Well, as I said, we couldn&#8217;t have charge accounts and we couldn&#8217;t have our own bank accounts. We wanted to use our maiden names. I was teaching a course on television and the producer insisted I call myself Mrs. Robert Weeks and I insisted I&#8217;m not going to be Mrs. Robert Weeks; I&#8217;m going to be Jane Sutherland Weeks. We had a big argument about that. Just these tiny little things that people take for granted nowadays. You just couldn&#8217;t borrow money from a bank; your husband had to [do it for you]. There was one woman I remember who had a number of charge accounts and she worked and her husband didn&#8217;t. They got a divorce and she couldn&#8217;t get new charge accounts. He had the charge accounts, but she was paying the bills, and they had got them because she had a job, but he was the man. It was terribly, terribly unfair. Terribly unfair. JD: And then, did many of the people who were part of your Monday Night Book Club then become part of the Women&#8217;s Center? JW: A number of them did. A number of them did. These women [were activists!] They became members of the school board and were very active in their own church groups. These were all women who were dying to do something, and had to [to be themselves]. They went off in many different directions. JD: How did they reconcile their religious participation with their burgeoning feminism? Or if you could tell me more about what Mary Daly said? This notion of still being a Christian, but fighting the patriarchy that&#8217;s part of Christianity, and how the tradition has been formed? JW: Well, of course, the conservative [Fundamentalist] Christian women did not have anything to do with us. One of the first things we did with the Women&#8217;s Center, in addition to seeking individual memberships, was group memberships. We asked various groups in town, the League of Women Voters; the Junior League, which was very much supporting us. You know, the Knoxville Junior League, the League of Women Voters, Church Women United, AAUW, all of these groups who were nebulous groups; we told them they could list their phone number with the Women&#8217;s Center, and then when people move to town and were trying to find these groups, they could call the Women&#8217;s Center and the Women&#8217;s Center would tell them how to get in touch with them. So we had a number of organizations, and Church Women United, which is primarily Methodist, I think; I believe it&#8217;s primarily Methodist, they were very active in the Women&#8217;s Center in helping with the programs and these things. I don&#8217;t remember the Baptists were. And then, several of us decided t hat we would try to organize an interfaith women&#8217;s group. There was in Knoxville an interfaith Knoxville Urban Ministry, which was the Knoxville males, and we decided we would see if we couldn&#8217;t organize Catholics, Jews; there weren&#8217;t too many Muslims; all the Protestant groups and so on into a strata of [interfaith women] connected [through] churches in Knoxville where we could then begin to work together to do various things that needed to be done about poverty and race relations and all of these things. I wrote a grant for the Tennessee Committee for the Humanities, and I stressed in this grant, I stressed that we would be, after the conference, we would be an ongoing group and we would be a great asset to the community, and they turned us down on that. They said, &#8220;You sound like you&#8217;re more interested in establishing a group than you are in having a conference.&#8221; Then they criticized us because there weren&#8217;t any men in the organization. Well, we had one man, but you know, it wasn&#8217;t to be a male organization. [Laughter] Then, they also criticized because we didn&#8217;t have enough lower-class churches. Well, they didn&#8217;t want to have anything to do with us. JD: Were the lower-class churches more conservative? JW: More, yeah. You know, the holy rollers and these people didn&#8217;t want to be a part of this group. So, we were turned down and I just got a bit discouraged after that. I&#8217;m not going to fool with it any more. To heck with that; let that one go. [Laughter] JD: Were many poor women ever on the board of directors? JW: Get who? JD: Were there any poor women, or women in poverty that became part of the board of directors, or how did that work? JW: I think so, later on, because a number of women from the W.O.R.K. program were. You know, I kind of got off of [the board] after a while. I was no longer actively involved in it. I got off in another organization, and I think there were poor women. The [Center] made an effort to get them on. JD: Were there any big changes between--you said you had the golden years was sort of under Johnson&#8217;s Great Society and then what were the changes when Nixon came in? JW: Well, we lost all our money, you know, because Johnson was giving grants for everything. It wasn&#8217;t Nixon that came in, was it, following Johnson? Who did follow Johnson? I guess it was. Anyway, the Women&#8217;s Center began to have a hard time making money and sustaining itself. JD: This was in the seventies? JW: After the eighties, in the nineties. JD: Okay. JW: Oh, it didn&#8217;t really go out of existence until in the late nineties. JD: Yeah, Wanda is going to tell me a little bit more about that. JW: Yeah. Well, then I got involved in--because [while] I was still teaching at Carson-Newman, that&#8217;s the Baptist college -- an organization, Council of Appalachian Women. Some North Carolina women decided that they would organize a group that would be urban-rural-mountain educated women, and this covered the whole thirteen-state Appalachian area from Georgia to New York. They got money from the Appalachian Regional Commission, which is a Washington, government association, and [it] gave quite a bit of money, and a woman by the name of Jean Hoffman--. I&#8217;ve got that history for you too. I&#8217;ve got three histories for you. At Mars Hill, North Carolina, her husband was vice-president, established an office at Mars Hill, and she had a [free] telephone. We did all kinds of things with the rural women, with the mountain women, the rural poor, the wives of the mining people, and then with colleges. See, that&#8217;s when I knew Marie Cirillo. Marie asked me when I talked to her the other day, said, &#8220;Where did I know you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, two or three different organizations.&#8221; One of them was we established a college up here in [pause] [Jellico]. Anyway, we got Carson-Newman and Roane State College to send teachers up to teach classes at night to the rural people who couldn&#8217;t get into towns to go to college. JD: So like the free university principle? JW: It was paid. The idea [was] that they would meet in a school or maybe a police department or something. JD: What caused you to switch from the Women&#8217;s Center? JW: I guess I got burned out. JD: At the Women&#8217;s Center? JW: Yeah, I think so, and it was when I got out that people like Bee DeSelm and Mary Lou Horner came in and a lot of those people, and they took over. The Women&#8217;s Center always had a lot of highly qualified professional women in there, always. The top professional women in Knoxville were part of the Women&#8217;s Center. I got burned out. Well, I was president for a couple of years and then I wrote a number of these grants and got them started, the WORK grant, the Matrix grant. You move on, and this other thing was opening up and so I went off that way. JD: What were some of the differences that you found between the Council of Appalachian Women and then the Women&#8217;s Center in terms of who you were working with and the problems you were addressing? JW: The Council of Appalachian Women was very well organized when I came into it, although I came in the first year and I was president of it right away too, the second year, I guess. It had a lot of government people in it, and it had money, but it was scattered. We would have a meeting in North Carolina or a meeting at Virginia or a meeting in--somewhere we&#8217;d get in the car and just drive off and have meetings here and there all over the Southeast. It was a big organization. JD: What were the programs you did? You mentioned the college that you created for rural people. What are other programs you had to address poverty and the status of women in the rural communities? JW: We worked with some of the poor women in the mining communities. There was a nun; I told you the mountains were full of nuns, and there was one woman, she was one of these hefty women, you know, one of these square women, walked like this. I think she was Sister Josephine, and she used to get out on the picket lines and walk with the miners when they were picketing, trying to get better wages or better conditions. &#8220;Hey, Sister Jo! Come over here, Sister Jo!&#8221; [Laughter] Some of the women up in Clearfield, up where Marie lives, organized a co-op, a mountain women&#8217;s exchange where they put together a co-op. One woman organized a health clinic somewhere in Virginia, I believe. You know, they were all doing all kinds of exciting, exciting things, just really exciting things. Oh, and another thing that these mountain women were learning to do [pause] through their interaction with others, was learning how to write grants. Then, they would get a certain amount of assertiveness training and they thought nothing of marching into a state legislature, asking for things. That was not at all unusual with these mountain women. JD: Can you go a little bit more into the assertiveness training? I&#8217;m intrigued by this concept. JW: By the what? JD: The assertiveness training, like what did that look like? How did those meetings run? JW: Well, of course I didn&#8217;t have to take it! [Laughter] JD: &#8216;Cause you were a rebel. JW: There was a woman at the university, Pat Ball, who&#8217;s in Nashville too. Pat was very active in the Women&#8217;s Center to begin with. Pat did a lot of assertiveness training. That is, to teach women to look at you when they talk to you instead of dropping their eyes; to say, &#8220;Well, I can do this,&#8221; instead of saying, &#8220;Maybe I can do it&#8221; or &#8220;If you try me, I'll see if I can.&#8221; You see, women had such a hesitant, unsure-of-themselves attitude. They were always afraid to do anything, and men were quick to knock them down if they did. I had several men when I was teaching at the university who said to me, &#8220;Jane, you&#8217;re a good teacher. You&#8217;re not like other women,&#8221; and they meant that as a compliment. I thought it was a compliment. I remember them saying it [pause] because I was not retiring and hesitant and shy, but most women were. My mother tried to raise me that way, I have to say. But that&#8217;s the way we were. You know the stories; you&#8217;ve heard about how the blacks were that way. A black person could never look a white person in the eye. A black person always had to step behind and be deferential. You&#8217;ve read these stories. With women, it was true to a certain extent. Not completely that way, but to a certain extent, women always had to defer to men, because if you got assertive, you know what they said: &#8220;They&#8217;re bra burners. They&#8217;re all a bunch of lesbians. They&#8217;re bra burners.&#8221; You know, there were terrible things [said about you] if you were aggressive. &#8220;Women are shrill,&#8221; all of these things they were saying about women. JD: How did they use lesbianism? JW: They wouldn&#8217;t even let women be radio announcers or television announcers. They said, &#8220;Their voices are too shrill.&#8221; I have a niece who&#8217;s very good in Virginia as a--. [Recording stops and is turned back on] That was part of our early philosophy. JD: So you wouldn&#8217;t take a position on gay rights? What were the things that you wouldn&#8217;t take positions on? Did you take a position on abortion? JW: No. JD: Just stayed away from--. JW: Just stayed away from all that. The newspapers would always call [the Women&#8217;s Center] because we were &#8220;the voice,&#8221; and they would ask us, and the directors or whoever was in said, &#8220;No, we don&#8217;t take a position on these things.&#8221; We were not an advocacy group. There were advocacy groups. There was NOW, and there were various other advocacy groups but we weren&#8217;t. We tried to keep ourselves neutral so it would attract everyone. So, those more radical women, then they were a part of us for a while, but then they had their own agenda and they, they went on. JD: Do you think that because they were radical that you were able to get more done [be]cause you were seen as moderates? JW: That&#8217;s my opinion, and that&#8217;s why I insisted we take that position, and then the others, we all agreed on that position. Because at that time, as I said, they were still criticizing us. That&#8217;s a bunch of radical, bra-burning women. They were out to take your jobs; they were out to take men&#8217;s jobs. I mean, here was a poor woman who was divorced or her husband left her after fifty years and she needed to work, and they said, &#8220;She&#8217;s out to take my job.&#8221; One of the first phone calls we got--we used to get these calls for help--was a woman from some little town somewhere outside--we kept a log for a while on the phone calls, and I guess it got lost somewhere along the way and they quit doing it--whose husband was a minister. He beat her and she couldn&#8217;t tell anyone. She couldn&#8217;t tell her family; she couldn&#8217;t tell anybody in the church; she couldn&#8217;t tell anyone, and he beat her--terrible. Those were the kinds of things we were running into. JD: When did the Domestic Violence Center get founded? It probably started in the Women&#8217;s Center and then--. JW: Well, these [active] women all belonged at the Women&#8217;s Center. The Women&#8217;s Center didn&#8217;t really start it. Cathy Waters primarily started it, and then Susan Conley, who was at the Women&#8217;s Center for a while, then she took it over. I never did have any contact with that group, they--. JD: Wait, is Domestic Violence and Rape housed at the same place? JW: I don&#8217;t know; I don&#8217;t even know. JD: Okay. JW: I asked Mary Ellen about that; she gave me Susan&#8217;s number. I kept trying to call; it was a cell number and all I got was the fax machine, so I gave up on Susan. JD: Did the Women&#8217;s Center have any connections with the students at the University of Tennessee? JW: With the what? JD: The students at the University of Tennessee. JW: Oh, we had some sort of vice-president or dean or somebody who decided to set up a women&#8217;s center at UT and called it the Women&#8217;s Center, which was kind of stupid, but it never did go very far. I guess it served the student needs, but the faculty women at UT belonged to the [Knoxville] Women&#8217;s Center. There was a vice-chancellor that belonged to the--she was on the board--those people all belonged to the Women&#8217;s Center [pause] because it was a bigger organization and it did more. Of course, the student Women&#8217;s Center could only do women&#8217;s things on the campus. I taught a number of women&#8217;s courses at UT. JD: Were you part of the founding of the Women&#8217;s Studies Department at UT at all? JW: No, [after I was gone] a woman by the name of Sharon [Lord was involved]. No, she was in education. I don&#8217;t even know that they have a women&#8217;s studies program at UT [anymore]. JD: They might not. I know a lot of them are closing right now. JW: Yeah, I taught courses there and when I went to Carson-Newman they let me teach women&#8217;s studies. Then the head of the Religion Department at UT called me and asked me if I wanted to teach summer school [as a visiting professor]. He said, &#8220;You can teach whatever you want,&#8221; so I organized two courses to my heart&#8217;s content. One of them was Appalachian Religion and the other was Women and Religion, and I taught those for a couple of years. JD: What were the kind of texts that you were using to teach? You taught a Women and Religion course; did you teach any other women&#8217;s studies sociological courses? JW: I did at Carson-Newman, but I can&#8217;t think of a text. JD: Did you read Gerda Lerner? I&#8217;m trying to remember some of the more popular ones. JW: Yeah, I&#8217;ve got some of those books, but I don&#8217;t remember that we used any of them as texts. What I did, here&#8217;s the way I taught my courses: I always had a great deal of freedom to do what I wanted to do. [Interruption] I would meet with the students, and this was in Religion, in Appalachia and [in] Social Studies; I taught these courses that way without textbooks, because there weren&#8217;t textbooks. I&#8217;d meet with the students three or four times and throw out a bunch of research projects that they could do that might interest them in any of these areas. I mean, in Appalachia they did [pause] snake handling and they did the history of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church and they did fundamentalists and they did whatever aspect of these things that interested them. &#8220;You go do the research on it. I&#8217;m in my office every day at this time. If you need help, come consult with me, and then I set a date [to resume classes]. I set each one of them up to present to the class the results of their study on these dates and I graded them on their research and their research papers because there was no textbook. That&#8217;s the way we got our material. [Laughter] JD: And then you would use some of the reports for the next class? JW: Yeah, then I&#8217;d lend them to succeeding students; here&#8217;s a paper on this or here&#8217;s a paper on that, but you&#8217;ve got to do your own. So that&#8217;s the way we did religion; there weren&#8217;t any textbooks on women and religion and oh, they studied all the way through, prehistoric on through. JD: This is more of a general question. Do you know when the Women&#8217;s Center closed in the nineties? I think it was 1996--. JW: I remember we had our twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth anniversary. I think it was [19]96 or [19]97. JD: So what was the year of its founding? Do you know that? JW: The founding? JD: The founding of the Women&#8217;s Center. JW: [19]74, we signed our charter in 1974, March of 1974, and it continued, you know, kind of dragged on for a long, long time after it was really lost. We started classes in assertiveness training and classes in [pause] preparing for jobs. Say, there&#8217;s something that you can do real well, so we&#8217;d let you teach a class to women on these things. They were all called self-help classes, and all the churches picked those things up and the churches started doing their own self-help classes. And [then] we started the W.O.R.K. Program to prepare women for jobs and teach them how to get jobs. We had a bulletin board and employers were sending us stuff, and we had an agent who would try to get jobs for people. Then the state did a program that took some of our [trainees] from us. Everything, it seemed, that we started to do somebody came along and copied it. [Laughter] One thing we started was a recognition of women, and what do we call it? We wanted to recognize women for courage, commitment, and compassion. We had a director and she was dying of cancer, and we called them the Selwyn Awards; her name was Annie Selwyn. This was in the eighties, in 1982. [Pause] When she died, her mother gave me a little cactus that Annie had, an aloe cactus. That&#8217;s it [points to a large cactus in pot on table]; in 1982, she gave me that cactus. It was this big when Annie died. [makes a tiny gesture in hand] But anyway, we call them the Selwyn Awards because Annie had courage as she fought this cancer up until the end, and she was committed to what she did and she was a very compassionate little woman. She was about five feet tall and she wore a T-shirt that said &#8220;Save the Whales.&#8221; So we decided that we would establish the Selwyn Awards and award outstanding women in Knoxville in education, religion [and] social services; we had these various categories. We did that for two years and then the YWCA decided they were going to do it. [Pause] Well, the Y came in and did a different approach. They got the News-Sentinel behind them, the paper behind them, although we always had the paper with us, but at this time, the center was going down. Annie was trying to hold the center together when she died. It was beginning to go down then. The Y is, of course, better known and wealthier than we were, so they took that over and we finally quit and didn&#8217;t do it any more because--. JD: Did they keep her name then? Or did they change the name of the award? JW: Oh, yeah, they call it Women of Achievement or something like that, yeah. But, it made me so mad; it just infuriated me, just infuriated me. [Laughter] And Mary Lou Horner said--Mary Lou was on the Y board and the Women&#8217;s Center board at the same time, and she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re so mad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am mad! They stole our idea and they took it out of our--.&#8221; But that&#8217;s what happened to us; every time we came along with a good idea, somebody came along and took it. It seemed that way to me; I don&#8217;t know. It was a time when ideas were developing and we seemed to get there first and--. JD: But you didn&#8217;t always necessarily have the resources to be able to compete when someone else decided to enter in? JW: [Laughter] Anyway, they were great years and lots of fun. JD: Just going into sort of the personal relationships, what were some of the great friendships and how did the Women&#8217;s Center forge great friendships? JW: Well, still my friendship with Sara Gould; we were friends for a long time and then I lost touch with her, and now I&#8217;ve got her back, thanks to you. Emily and I, as I said, Emily had been one of my students, and Emily and I are still close friends. She lives in Nashville. There was another student that was very active in the center by the name of Pat Green, and Pat&#8217;s still a very close friend. Jennifer, so many women my age, I&#8217;m eighty-six, have died. There are not a great many left, and we forget those that are [still around]. Our memories aren&#8217;t too good any more, and we don&#8217;t have the energy to do things that we&#8217;d like to do. I can&#8217;t think of anyone that I was very close to. I had a family and a full-time job and I didn&#8217;t even live in Knoxville. I lived outside of Knoxville and had to travel. JD: How did you balance all that? Four kids, a full-time job and all this activism? JW: High energy. Don't have it now, high energy. JD: Were your kids very supportive of all that you were doing? JW: Yes, they were and they still are. Again, this was back in the time when it was controversial for women to work. Articles would come out in the paper about where the working were [and asked] if a woman worked, was that bad for the children or good for the children? Studies were being made about whether kindergarten was good for children or not and whether children of working mothers were better balanced than children whose mother stayed home, and a lot of that kind of stuff. Men, of course, didn&#8217;t want their wives to work until they started earning a salary and then they were delighted. [Laughter] But the men just didn&#8217;t want their wives to work. JD: How many of your children&#8217;s classmates had moms that worked? JW: Well, in the early days, none of them did. JD: So the early days would be the sixties? JW: When the children were young, yeah, in the fifties and sixties. Now, I had some close friends [with children who worked], but after your children got older, women could then work. The [women] either went into community work with churches or non-profits or social agencies, or they would have businesses, like a gift shop or something of that sort. So, women started doing those things then. Actually, that didn&#8217;t really begin to happen until after that, long after the eighties that women began to feel free enough to be able to do these things. Except under the auspices of social work or church work or something, PTA and--. JD: What made you just determined right from the get-go to always work? JW: High energy. High energy; I just couldn&#8217;t stand to stay at home. Ask my husband now; he says I can&#8217;t sit down. JD: You just always want to be going, helping somewhere, doing something. JW: Doing something. JD: I have another question, a general reflection question. So you started in the late forties with civil rights activity, which I&#8217;m very surprised in Knoxville that you all were attempting to integrate the facilities even before Brown vs. Board of Education. So what was the instigator for that because you didn&#8217;t have any federal push? JW: Okay. TVA [was] here, and so we had a bunch of young, educated people move to Knoxville. JD: From usually outside the South perhaps? JW: From all over. JD: And that&#8217;s at Oak Ridge too? JW: And Oak Ridge, Oak Ridge was a little further away. Oak Ridge was much further away then than it is now, but it was still Oak Ridge and TVA and to some extent, the university that began to grow at that time, so there was a lot of infusion of new, young people, educated women who had college degrees, and professional husbands who were lawyers and college professors and engineers and scientists and so on, that moved into Knoxville. And Knoxville was a very set, old, established, run-by-the-business-people of Knoxville; they didn&#8217;t even want labor unions here. They fought labor unions for years because they didn&#8217;t want the wages going up, and they certainly weren&#8217;t going to have anything to do with racial progress. So, all those people came together in the fifties and the Unitarian church organized at that time, and a number of them joined the Unitarian church and made contact with one another. I&#8217;m not saying all of them because these contacts were being made with others--the university people--there was a great deal of diversion among the university people, and in Oak Ridge. You take an old, established city like Knoxville and you bring in this influx of a whole bunch of new people--. The League of Women Voters, that&#8217;s where I met most of my early acquaintances. I was a student and the women I met were the professors&#8217; wives and professional men&#8217;s wives at the university. See, I was an older student because I had been in the WAVES, so they were my age; I wasn&#8217;t a younger student. Anyway, that&#8217;s when they all came together [pause] I think. [Laughter] JD: And what do you think made them want to push for integration? JW: You know, again, another thing about Knoxville and the South: there are always those who felt that the racial prejudice was wrong. There have always been those people, and there were some here in Knoxville. There was one [woman] by the name of Petie Moulder, and that&#8217;s in the history I&#8217;ll give you of the Fellowship house. Petie was the one who really got started with organizing this interracial interfaith thing. There was a woman whose husband taught at the university who had lived in Oak Ridge for a number of years, and she had tried to work with--she was from New York originally--and she tried to work with the blacks in Oak Ridge, and when they moved to Knoxville, she wanted to do something. There was a man [Buzz] who owned a novelty store, where he sold these things they put in your hand that--. You know, things and funny moustaches; he sold all that kind of junky stuff; it was a novelty store; he was a very, very liberal man. And there was a lawyer here who was a very liberal man, and they were native-born Knoxvillians, and they found these people, these young people coming in or these young people found them. I don&#8217;t know how those connections were made, but they began to find each other. Petie got together these women who started this interracial interfaith day camp. They knew me, and as I said, I was a student and I had the time to do this, but they didn&#8217;t. They had husbands and children and so on. JD: What do you think the links are between poverty, racism and sexism in this particular area, if there are any links? JW: Well, the black women would say it all occurs with us. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. JD: Well, what is one of the things that you learned from interacting with the black women at the Women&#8217;s Center, and then I&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s not as many involved in the--this might be a wrong assumption on my part--on the Appalachian Women&#8217;s Council? JW: No, there weren&#8217;t because that was more of the rural people and the mountain people and there weren&#8217;t as many blacks. There are, and there were some; you&#8217;re right, but not like in the urban areas. JD: What were some of the things that you learned? You said you had this one interesting conversation about Mrs. wanting to be Mrs. versus wanting to have it dropped. Is there anything else that was kind of--that you can remember? That&#8217;s a very telling conversation in and of itself, but--. JW: Of course, the blacks couldn&#8217;t get their names in the obituary columns, either, of the papers. [Pause] There was a black minister, and I used to get him to come talk to my classes; Crutcher, Reverend Crutcher was his name. He was very active in integrating parts of Knoxville, and I&#8217;d get Reverend Crutcher to come talk to my classes. I remember one day we were waiting for class to start and we were sitting outside; it was a warm day like this and he had a black suit on. I said, &#8220;Dr. Crutcher, aren&#8217;t you hot, sitting there in that suit, that black suit? Well, he turned that on me, but he made a joke of it. He said, &#8220;You think because I&#8217;m black I get hotter than you do? You see my blackness?&#8221; or something like that. I was mortified. I was just mortified. [Laughter] He made a joke of it, but he--I would say it to you. [Laughter] In a black blouse, I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you hot?&#8221; JD: Do you have any other students that are still in contact with you? It sounds like you were a pretty innovative teacher. JW: I was. I still keep in contact with Emily and with Pat in Nashville. For a while, I kept in contact with some students from Carson-Newman, but these things kind of drop off after a while, and some of the male students would come around for a while. They liked to--we lived on a farm; we had horses, and the students would come out on Saturday. We may have four or five students that would come out on Saturday and several of them had worked with horses and had a lot of experience, and they set up jumps and barrels and fences and so on for the kids and would teach our kids how to ride. I&#8217;d always fix hot dogs and chili for lunch, and then we made homemade wine, Bob and I did. You couldn&#8217;t buy any alcohol then. We maybe had grape juice. We&#8217;d serve wine coolers, and we&#8217;d get the students to help us around the house doing things. I remember one of them came out one time and he looked at a stone wall and said, &#8220;Man that took a lot of wine coolers to make that stone wall.&#8221; But you lose touch over, we&#8217;re talking about thirty years ago, forty years ago. It&#8217;s a long time. JD: Do you feel that you used your classes to engage the students in contemporary issues? JW: Oh, I hope I did. You see, when Bob was sitting in and being more active in the race situation, the civil rights movement, and as I said, I didn&#8217;t feel I could; I hoped I was doing my part in trying to be more liberal in my classes and teaching classes. I hoped I was. That was my aim [pause] which wasn&#8217;t supposed to be my aim. [Laughter] As a good teacher, I shouldn&#8217;t have done that. JD: It depends on definitions of good teachers. JW: But that was sociology. I could do that. JD: Was there anything you want to add? JW: Well, I would like to see your written material that you were going to send me, and I do want to see the results of the study when it&#8217;s published. I think it&#8217;s very exciting, and everybody I talked to was so excited. It&#8217;s been a rejuvenation, and &#8220;Oh, Jane, we&#8217;ve got to get together.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s get together.&#8221; Oh, and I&#8217;ll tell you what came out of this was when I was talking with Nan Scott. Nan Scott was with TVA. I guess you&#8217;re going to get with her. We said we ought to do our own oral history right now, while there&#8217;s still a few of us left in this area. So I said, &#8220;Well, I have a friend that teaches sociology and Maryville College, Susan Ambler, and Susan was one of these women that was working in this stuff.&#8221; She worked with the mountain women and she&#8217;s still working with them. Marie told me she was coming. She&#8217;s working with them up there now. Susan says she&#8217;s going to do a class in research this fall, but I&#8217;m going to get in touch with somebody at UT because I think we&#8217;d like to see it published. You know, we&#8217;d like to see that somebody&#8217;s written up what we&#8217;ve done. So that may come out of it. We may start--we can help [students]find money if there&#8217;s any money available. I don&#8217;t know that there is any more. There used to be plenty of money. But if somebody wants to do a research project, we can make the connections for them and get them together. And that might be fun. JD: It is good to go back and reflect and see--. JW: My husband, he&#8217;s been writing his memoirs, so he keeps coming in here. He traveled a great deal, all over the world; we both did. I went with him, I mean. He&#8217;ll talk about people [interruption]. He&#8217;s been filling me in with that for the past year, so now I&#8217;m filling him in with mine. JD: Yeah. All the places you saw were probably fascinating. Spending a year in Egypt must have been very eye-opening. JW: It was. We taught at the American University. We both taught there. It&#8217;s like the American University in Beirut, you know, but it&#8217;s in Egypt. The kids went to school there. They met people from all over the world. We lived in a little town called Maadi, which is about six miles outside of Cairo. It&#8217;s M-A-A-D-I, Maadi. You know, long A, Maadi. They went to an American College there, and American College is elementary and high school and so on, but that&#8217;s where all the diplomats lived, in Maadi. Well, not all of them, but a lot of them did. So they met people from all over the world, and they had a great deal of freedom walking the streets. They&#8217;d take the train into Cairo and they just had a wonderful time. Robert Weeks: At least we think they did. JD: What sort of civil rights activity did you do at the University of Tennessee? RW: Say that again. JD: What civil rights activities did you do at the University of Tennessee? JW: He didn&#8217;t teach at UT. RW: No, I didn&#8217;t. JD: But when you were a student. JW: Oh, I&#8217;ve told her that [pause] that you were active in the civil rights thing [be]cause you were still a student and that I wasn&#8217;t doing much active work&#8230; RW: &#8230;Yeah&#8230; JW: &#8230;because I had family and stuff. But I&#8217;m talking about over a long period of time. He did the same thing I did. RW: My activities were pretty restricted. JW: Yeah, we both were [pause] except that he did sit in sit-ins and he was responsible&#8230; RW: &#8230;Active in getting the first student into the UT [pause] and getting the hospitals integrated. No, that was the Hill-Burton Act that did that. JW: No, you and Thelma did that. RW: Well, by the time--yeah, we were bringing pressure to bear on the hospital. JW: Let me tell you how the university got integrated. JD: When was this? Is this in the fifties? RW: Sixties. JD: Sixties, okay. RW: Nineteen sixty-[two]. JD: We can find it. JW: Jim Davidson, I guess Jim, Jim was assistant dean at the time. Anyway, he was out at our house one time and he said, &#8220;You know, I think we could--.&#8221; They had already had the trouble down in Alabama with the standing in the doorway, and he said, &#8220;I think we could get the university integrated without any trouble if we can just make the right connections.&#8221; Well, Bob was on several committees, interracial committees, and he said he would take it back to whatever committee he was on at that time. RW: I was on a committee looking, trying to get a student. JW: No, they weren&#8217;t trying at that time, Bob. RW: Yes they were. JW: Get out of here and let me tell my story! RW: [Laughter] I will. Sorry. [Mr. Weeks attempts to leave room but instead stays] JW: You tell your story and I&#8217;ll tell mine. RW: Yeah, well, you can call me in when you&#8217;re ready. JD: Now you know one of the fun things of oral history. JW: Anyway, he was on some other committees and they decided they would find a [speaking loudly to Mr. Weeks in the next room] they decided they would find a student. RW: Oh, yeah. I guess that was it, yeah. JW: So, somebody found this student, a man by the name of Theotis Robinson, who was a high school student. He later became a city council member, and he&#8217;s now, I think, a dean&#8230; RW: &#8230;And then he was vice-mayor for a while. JW: I think he&#8217;s dean at the university. Anyway, he was the first student. They went to his parents, some of the black people he was associated with, Crutcher and James and that bunch. RW: Yeah. JW: Okay. They went to Theotis&#8217; family and they asked if they would be willing to let him come to the university, and they said yes. Then [the committee members] called the president of the university and they said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a student who wants to enroll in September.&#8221; See, we were being fed this. The university people were telling Bob and Bob was telling the black committee that was working with getting the black student in, so there was this undercurrent that was working. RW: Back door discussions. JW: Played real politics. So they went to the president and they said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to enroll a student in September.&#8221; The president said, &#8220;Give me time; I have a trustee&#8217;s meeting in December and I think I can approach the trustees and we can get him in, but we can&#8217;t get him in until January.&#8221; Well, that came back to Bob, who then takes it to the blacks, and they say, &#8220;This is what the president said.&#8221; Then they think do we trust the president or not? Well, he was a very fine man and everybody liked him, a highly respected man. JD: Who was it? JW: Don&#8217;t ask questions &#8216;cause that makes you forget. RW: [Laughter] It&#8217;ll come to us. [Andrew Holt] JD: Okay, that&#8217;s fine. RW: Yeah, 1960. JW: They really debated it quite a while. Shall we trust him or not? Can we do this or not? Finally, they decided all right, we&#8217;ll go with what he says. So, come the first of January, in enrollment they had six black students. They enrolled and came right in and there was never any trouble. Now at that time, John Duncan, who was our state representative, our state congressman from this area, his father [John Duncan, Sr.] was mayor. His father was very, very fair-minded, and at the time of the race civil rights thing&#8230; RW: &#8230;The sit-ins&#8230; JW: &#8230;the sit-ins, he worked with the blacks and the whites together. When they tried to integrate the hospitals, he called the ministers. The hospitals were all church-oriented, you see. RW: Yeah, yeah. The Catholic, the Baptist, Presbyterian--. JW: There was one private hospital, and the rest of them were--. He called them together and he tried his best to make sure there weren&#8217;t any troubles, and there never were any real serious race problems here because the people did work together. They all worked together. RW: Well, one of the things Mayor Duncan did was to instruct the police force to behave themselves, and of course, the Knoxville police force had been integrated for a long time. It goes back after the race riots of 1919. JD: I didn&#8217;t know there were race riots in Knoxville. JW: Yeah, there were violent race riots. RW: Oh, yeah, there were a lot of people killed in those things in Knoxville. JD: I&#8217;ve heard of other race riots, but I didn&#8217;t know about the Knoxville ones. RW: [Laughter] So, after those race riots, they got together with the black community, the whites did, and they put some policemen on the police force--black policemen. They had been on the police force all during this time, but only in black communities, never in white communities. When the sit-ins began, there were no black policemen on duty in these stores, only white. Well, that&#8217;s probably a good idea because the rabble-rousers were pretty wild, and if they&#8217;d had a black policeman on there, he&#8217;d have had a tough time. He might not have survived. JD: It was a rather peaceful integration overall? RW: Well, yes, there were no--nobody was killed. Minor injuries were suffered on one or two occasions, as far as my knowledge is, [pause] but the situation in Knoxville had been quite different from what it was in Nashville or Memphis. JW: Memphis. RW: Oh, yeah. Or Birmingham. JW: Well, we never did have a very high black population because it didn&#8217;t lend itself to farming land; it was not flat; it was mountainous. It was only a small black population at that time. RW: Yeah, ten percent or fifteen percent, something like that. Not like the thirty, forty, fifty percent in Birmingham or Mobile or so on. Are you a Southerner? JD: No, I&#8217;m a native of--I was born in D.C. but I&#8217;m a native of the Midwest. I mostly grew up in the Midwest and I&#8217;m close to being a Kansas girl but I wasn&#8217;t born there. You can&#8217;t call yourself a Kansan unless you were born there. JW: When you say where you&#8217;re from, you want to know how far back do you go? RW: [Laughter] Yeah, yeah. JD: It&#8217;s still contested because I came in my last year at elementary school, so I had one element of childhood in Kansas, but I know native Kansans would not claim me. [Laughter] So there&#8217;s a difference in what you claim and what those who are true natives, who they will claim and who they won't claim. Just like, are you guys considered now, natives of Knoxville? Are you allowed to claim that? JW: I guess. We&#8217;ve been here sixty years. RW: We are approaching the pass-over point. JD: What is the pass-over point? RW: I don&#8217;t know for sure. JW: We&#8217;ve been here sixty-two years, so I guess we&#8217;re native. JD: Well, your children certainly are. RW: Oh, yeah. JW: Well, they were born here but they don&#8217;t live here. JD: Is there anything else that you guys would like to add before I wrap it up? JW: I&#8217;m going to go get you those histories. They will give you a lot of names and dates that I don&#8217;t have on the tip of my mind. JD: Who has dates on the tip of their mind? [Laughter] RW: Yeah. I participated in the sit-ins one day. JD: One day? RW: Yeah. I took a day off at the lab. Told them I had to go to Knoxville. JD: What did you think when she wanted to become part of the Women&#8217;s Center and founded it? RW: There&#8217;s something about your accent and the way--. Say it again. I&#8217;m sorry. JD: What did you think when she wanted to become part of the Women&#8217;s Center and founded it? RW: Oh, I supported her in every way she wanted. JW: He&#8217;s always supported me. RW: I have never had any problem with that. JW: Oh, we never had that problem, both being very liberal and broad-minded. RW: Yeah. Our political activities were completely compatible, our political viewpoints. We both joined the ADA when it was active here in Knoxville in 1950. JW: We were both Democrats. RW: Liberal Democrats. [Laughter] JW: My mother said to me one time; she said, &#8220;Jane, you know you and Bob were &#8216;pinko&#8217;.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even know what that meant. That was back at the time McCarthy was calling everybody &#8216;pinko&#8217;. [Laughter] I didn&#8217;t know what my mother meant. We weren&#8217;t &#8216;pinko&#8217;, we just weren&#8217;t conservative. [Brings in written histories previously referenced to] Now this is the Fellowship House I was telling you about, and I wrote it from the Unitarian Church viewpoint. It&#8217;s not the historical from the--it is historical, but it&#8217;s written for Unitarians because they asked me to write it. This is the history of the Women&#8217;s Center, and it&#8217;s never been edited well, so you&#8217;ll have to overlook all my--. JD: It looks pretty fantastic to me. JW: Well, it could stand a good editing job. And now this is the Council on Appalachian Women. You said cross-references; you&#8217;ll find a lot of cross-references in there because that is stretched across thirteen Appalachian states--a lot of North Carolina women in particular; they started it. JD: Well, thank you. Am I allowed to keep these materials? JW: Yeah. JD: Thank you. JW: And I have two copies of that book, so I&#8217;m giving you one because I think your study can use--I mean, the Appalachian book--I think they need that for their files. JD: I know. This is fantastic. Well, thank you both so much. JW: It&#8217;s been a pleasure, Jennifer. I mean a real pleasure. [Laughter] JD: I&#8217;m so glad, and I will be in touch about how everything comes through for the transcript, the audio, and what we&#8217;re going to be doing with the collection of interviews we have from this week of research. JW: Yeah, we&#8217;d all like to see it, I&#8217;m sure. And those of you who see my friends, give them my regards. JD: I will, I will. Thank you so much for contacting everyone for me. It made my scheduling of interviews very easy, which I was very appreciative because being in New York City and trying to call people; in a crowded apartment and thin walls. I was very happy to have a lot of the explanation, excitement already instilled in everybody coming from you. So thank you so much for doing all that. JW: And each one gave you other contacts. I just feel I failed you with the Rape Crisis Center. I just couldn&#8217;t get a hold of Sue and I couldn&#8217;t find Cathy Waters and I couldn&#8217;t find Doris Scott Crawford, but they&#8217;re all around, I&#8217;m sure. JD: Well, we&#8217;re hoping to maybe come back later on this summer; we&#8217;re not sure. We&#8217;re looking at our funding. We&#8217;re hoping to come back and do another sweep through of interviews. JW: Is this a big grant you&#8217;ve got? JD: It&#8217;s a Mellon grant, so it was a big grant. The problem is that this is the last year of the study, so with most grants--. [Laughter] Those who went over their budgets before now are taking the income for the last year of the study, so we are finagling with the resources that we have. You can&#8217;t do the typical thing of oh, there will be more money coming in. JW: Yeah, that&#8217;s right. We&#8217;ll ask for that because we need it. JD: Now we&#8217;re in the &#8220;truly sticking to your budget&#8221; stage, so yeah, but we&#8217;re hoping to work within this. We&#8217;ve done some really nice interviews about school desegregation and economic justice in terms of labor strikes, people going to Charleston and Charlotte and other areas. We&#8217;ve done a lot of nice--Louisville is another--(46:23) school desegregation in Louisville. We&#8217;ve done a whole series of interviews out in southern communities. And Knoxville, this is our time in Knoxville. JW: Yeah. I don&#8217;t know if Sara Gould has much money. I suppose there&#8217;s some in the Ms. Foundation. JD: We&#8217;ll see. They are probably very specific on what they are spending their money on at this point in time. [Laughter] One could hope. Well, thank you guys so much. I&#8217;m going to call it an end to the interview...
