 Jennifer Donnally: Good afternoon. This is Jennifer Donnally, and today is May 24, 2010. I am in the home of Bee De Selm to interview her. We are in Knoxville, Tennessee. So, my first question is going to be a bit of a surprise for you, which is what was your childhood like and where did you grow up? Bee De Selm: I grew up in Columbus, Ohio and lived in a neighborhood that was a middle-class neighborhood, went to a small, what we called portable schools. Remember this, it&#8217;s back in the early thirties. I went to a fairly large high school [2,500 students]. I had music education; I learned to play the piano and the violin. I played violin in a lot of small groups and in the orchestra at the university in high school, and also in the symphony in Columbus, Ohio later. I was in a sorority, a high school sorority, which was [laughter] something I would not advocate at this stage of my life, but anyway, it was helpful. JD: What are portable schools? I&#8217;ve never heard of this. BD: It&#8217;s what we have in some of our schools when they get too big for the main school they have two classrooms per portable. That&#8217;s what it was. You know, there are about thirty people in each room and you went right to the outside from the schoolroom. No lunchrooms or anything like that. JD: Did you grow up in Jim Crow schools in Ohio or were they integrated? BD: No, we only had one black person in my high school of several hundred people, so I did not. We had it very much segregated. East Columbus was where the black people lived, so I didn&#8217;t have any experience with segregation growing up. JD: Where did you go to college then? You mentioned that you went off to--. BD: World War II started when I was a senior in high school and I had already decided that I wanted to be a nurse, so I went to college at the university, Ohio State University, and went for four years. About the time I was ready to graduate, peace was declared and we went on from there. JD: What was it like growing up during the Depression? BD: That was very interesting. I was fortunate in that my parents had, I think, just bought a new modest home in a suburb. We had nice sidewalks and we had some vacant lots to play in, a vacant lot next door that when it flooded, we could ice-skate. It was a good place to grow up. Did I answer all [of] that question? I probably didn&#8217;t. JD: Do you remember any hardships at all for the Great Depression or do you just remember your happy childhood? BD: Oh, we visited my aunt about every couple of weeks up in the country. They were living from hand to mouth, and my aunt had a garden that she kept and my parents bought produce there. All they had was their farm, and of course, prices for farmers were terrible. I remember that every month at the end of the month, they didn&#8217;t know if they had enough money to make a payment on the mortgage, and it was pretty traumatic. Another one of my mother&#8217;s sisters lived in another part of town and her husband had died and left her with five children. Their sixteen-year-old daughter went to school to learn to be a stenographer [to] support the family while [her] mother stayed home and took care of the other four children. That was a tough one for them. They lived in the basement; at least they cooked down there where it was cool. Nobody had air-conditioning. There were some tough times for a lot of people, but I escaped most of that. JD: And then, what was it like going to college during World War II? You had no men on campus, pretty much? BD: That would be what you would expect. I took my violin with me and my nursing instructor told me that I could continue to play in the symphony orchestra if I wanted to; she&#8217;d see that I got the time off. So I did that and I found a room to practice in. I used to hear a noise from the other side of a locked door. One time much later on, after I had practiced many hours in there, I found out that was where the student in the--what the Army recruitment, living on campus, I can&#8217;t remember the name of the organization. But anyway, they all had their study hall over there, so we had a whole dormitory that joined ours which had recruits&#8230; JD: &#8230;Was it ROTC? BD: No, it wasn&#8217;t. They were in the Army. They recruited people faster than they could train them and didn&#8217;t know what to do with them, so they put them in dormitories in the colleges that had been evacuated by the people going into the service, and they took them out bit by bit. My husband spent a year in southern Ohio at [Miami] University doing the same thing. He got a year&#8217;s credit until he could be sent to training as a Marine. So anyway, there were plenty of men on campus, to make a short answer to your question. And we dated them, so it was fun. JD: Yeah. How did you meet your husband then? BD: Originally, I met him in junior high school. JD: Okay. BD: At least I knew him then. I knew who he was because his aunt was a teacher of mine, but he never heard of me until after the war. He came back and we met each other through church then. JD: So then what did you do after you graduated with a nursing degree? BD: I went to work at University Hospital as an obstetrical nurse, and worked on the floor, in the delivery room and all around. Eventually, I became a head nurse and it was kind of a bad experience for them and for me because I then transferred to another hospital, where I taught obstetrical nursing for a while, at White Cross [Hospital]. JD: Did you face any discrimination as a nurse during this time period? BD: No, the nurses were welcome then. JD: How did the doctors treat you other than listening to your oppositions? BD: Not very well. [Laughter] Discrimination as a woman probably, yeah. I think they were uniform in treating all the underlings as--they really didn&#8217;t look upon us as worth much. JD: Do you remember any instances that really got you quite upset, or did you stay above it? BD: I don&#8217;t remember specific incidents, but there were plenty of times when the[re] were--they never made mistakes. Their writing was impossible to read. No, I didn&#8217;t have any real bad--. In fact, one doctor I got to know rather well and he picked me up [as I was waiting] and took me back [home]--I lived with my parents up north and he took me up to their place after work when I needed to get home. He was the teacher of obstetrics, Dr. Chase Pavey, and he was an older gentleman and he was nice to me. [He was the first person who suggested to me that the Bible might not be a factual source of information.] JD: And what drew you into obstetrics? BD: You know, when you&#8217;re in training, you go through three months in practically every field, and I don&#8217;t know, I was just was interested in that part. I enjoyed working with babies and mamas and delivery. It was a really varied experience. JD: So then what brought you to Tennessee from Ohio? BD: Well, Hal got a job down here, first in Murfreesboro, and we were there for two years and he had contacts here at the university and so he was invited to come over and work on a project in botany at Oak Ridge. I should have him tell you about that, but anyway, there was an old lake bed over there called White Oak Lake which is still there where they were dumping nuclear waste. He went over to collect samples and see what it was like and everything and he had to wear a badge to record how much [radiation] he got. Who knows what that does to you? [Laughter] Anyway, while we were in Columbus before we left, since we&#8217;re doing this somewhat chronologically, we got our first child. We were unable to have our own biological children, so we adopted Diane and she was about a month old. When she was less than a year old, we moved to Murfreesboro. Then we had some interesting experiences with her. We went over to the Smoky Mountains for a trip for a week in the summertime and she was in her playpen in a tent over there with bears outside. She got along fine and we did too. We bought her a little rocking chair and she loved it, so she sat in it. You know, she was going to plan to spend the night there and we heard a crash sometime in the middle of the evening and she had fallen off to sleep. [Laughter] But anyway, we had some fun experiences over there. Then, the next summer we went over and spent the whole summer with Hal as a ranger, part-time ranger during the summer. JD: Oh. BD: And that was fun, yeah. JD: Did you continue nursing even after you started having children? BD: Not full time or anything. I worked at a Florence Crittenton home. I don&#8217;t know; they have them here too, I think, for unwed mothers. I did that part time, where you&#8217;d be on call and when they needed someone, you would go and stay with them until the child was born. That was an interesting experience too. JD: This is before the abortion push. BD: Abortion was not a question then, one way or the other that I recall. Well it was to the point that I think it was probably illegal, but I know there were some going on. JD: But you basically, you had spent a lot of time helping unwed mothers, and then did they often keep the babies or did they choose to adopt the babies out? BD: I don&#8217;t remember that we always knew. I think maybe there were more adoptions back then, but they did start keeping them home. We didn&#8217;t have any trouble getting young children, which you do now. JD: &#8216;Cause you adopted four children eventually? BD: Two. JD: Two, okay. BD: We got a little boy three years after our daughter. JD: Were you involved in any sort of volunteer activities? BD: Not very much until after the children were about four years, the little one was four years old. I had met a friend whose name was Lois Russell. Lois was teaching political science at Knoxville College, which is a black college here in town. She also was president of the League of Women Voters. I kind of got drawn in by her; she was pretty good at recruiting people, and first thing I knew, I was going to what we called units, which were discussion [meetings]. Pretty soon, I was chair of the unit and just getting more and more involved in the organization. By the time the kids were grown, I really was becoming more interested in what was going on in Knoxville. I had not been interested in Ohio at all. I was religious education director at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church back in, let&#8217;s see, that was about [19]60, [19]70 or something like that. While I was working, a young man, twenty-three years old, named Victor Ashe came to see me, and he was running for the State House of Representatives. He was in law school and he sounded like he had plenty of smarts and was interested in the right issues. I told him I&#8217;d work for him. Well, it turned out he lived right across the street from me. I was on Hillvale and he was across on Kingston Pike, and they had an office back in the pool house. I&#8217;d go every couple of days and help with addressing things and his campaign. His mother was managing the campaign office and she was an interesting woman too, Martha. After a while, he wanted to run for the Senate. Anyway, to make a long story short, he got sued because he wasn&#8217;t old enough to be a senator. You had to be thirty, and he was going to be thirty the first of January, which was [after] the election, but it turns out that the courts decided that he had to be thirty when he was elected, so that didn&#8217;t work out. The party and he got together and decided that they would appoint his replacement and they decided to appoint his mother, who just happened to have the same name as he did. They put her on the ballot and she was elected with the understanding that she would resign and Victor would be appointed by the County Court, which was a legislative body at that time, and that&#8217;s the way it worked out. JD: I want to go back for just a little bit and ask you some more questions about the League of Women Voters and the Unitarian Universalist Church. BD: Okay. JD: So, when you said that you guys studied units as League of Women Voters, what were the unit topics that you were studying? BD: We studied issues that--the League of Women Voters adopts issues at the national, state, and local level. After much discussion, they take a position. For instance, on schools they will support whatever [laughter] the schools need. Good management and adequate funding in schools and this kind of thing, and they would do the same kind of thing with water quality and with air quality and whatever our study issue is. Those were mostly national studies. Schools were state studies. Locally, we have repeatedly studied consolidation of city and county government and come out in favor of it, but that seems to be all it takes to get it defeated. That, and a lot of recalcitrant people who don&#8217;t like the idea. But anyway, that&#8217;s the kind of thing they do, and so the meetings are used to discuss these issues and reports are taken. JD: And is it an equal balance of Democrats and Republicans? BD: It&#8217;s a non-partisan organization. They do not support candidates; they support issues. JD: But do they have a good balance in terms of&#8230;? BD: &#8230;It depends on where it is. They&#8217;re all over the country, their organizations, and down South here, they have a lot of Republicans, at least in Tennessee. It used to be when I came here there were more Democrats, but it&#8217;s changed since then. JD: Now Jane Weeks told me that you had been a long-time Republican. BD: Yeah, [laughter] that&#8217;s true. I was elected as a Republican; my family was Republican, and living&#8230; JD: &#8230;It&#8217;s Ohio Republican. BD: Yeah, he was an Ohio Republican and the Tennessee Republicans were not in power down here and I thought it didn&#8217;t make any difference and there were more Republicans. I thought they needed to have a chance [at] the state level because it was organized completely by Democrats for the first twenty-five years I was here. So, even though by the time it reversed itself, I wasn&#8217;t so enthused with Republicans. I had become kind of upset with some of their positions. JD: Well, we&#8217;ll talk more about that. BD: Okay. JD: &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m really interested in your involvement and your take on how we can look in politics. [Laughter] Evolved in the sixties and seventies, to say the least. BD: Oh, well, we&#8217;ll see. JD: But I wanted to ask you a little bit more about that, the T[ennessee Valley] Unitarian Universalist Church. BD: We call it TVUUC. It&#8217;s a church which encourages people to find their own philosophy. We have people from devout Christians to atheists, wherever they&#8217;re comfortable. If they&#8217;re comfortable with us, we&#8217;re comfortable with them. We&#8217;re for treating people equally, so nobody--racists are not going to be happy at our church at all. JD: And you&#8217;re still a practicing member? BD: Oh, [yes], I&#8217;m still there. I&#8217;m not doing a whole lot any more. I&#8217;ve kind of aged out of being very active, but at any rate, I&#8217;m still a member, yes, and probably will be buried there. [Laughter] We have a nice memorial garden on the bank, and it&#8217;s a relatively new church. It&#8217;s been built in the last ten years. JD: So then, what were some, because there&#8217;s a whole group that seems to have come out of the TVUUC? BD: You kind of got those of us who are activists, and I was a member of the National Conference for Christians and Jews and I don&#8217;t know if anybody has mentioned that. That&#8217;s NCCJ. Now, there&#8217;s no longer a chapter here because we had some problems with the national organization, more financial than anything else, but it was a good organization here. They have a branch of it that&#8217;s not named that, but it&#8217;s still going on and working on the issue of racism. But I think it&#8217;s less of an issue here now, as far as I can see than it used to be. JD: So what what were some of the programs that the Tennessee Valley [interviewer and interviewee repeating, in unison, the name of the church] Unitarian Universalist Church? BD: Well, we operate in many different ways. We, of course, have our Sunday morning programs. Then we have our forums, which are also on Sunday morning for about an hour. The forum chairman and anybody who&#8217;s interested proposes a program that is of interest to a lot of people. Sometimes it&#8217;s kind of like the League of Women Voters &#8216;cause it&#8217;s interested in issues and other religions and just political topics, the whole bit. But again, the churches can&#8217;t support politics. They have to stay away from that but that doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t have discussions about it. JD: Were you part at all of--Jane Weeks was talking to me about the interracial summer camps that they started? BD: I was. You know, I didn&#8217;t get that on my [questionnaire]. I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that. But going back to the church, I did spend ten years as the Religious Education Director. I never felt like I did a very good job, but I was well-organized and I was scared enough that I&#8217;d have to teach that I found good teachers. We have a lot of university people in the group, and some potential teachers. But that was the ten years before I got into politics. JD: So then do you want to comment at all about that interracial summer camp that you guys did to try to ease integration in the community? BD: Yeah, well, Jane probably can tell you better than I can. I got involved because since I was RE director at the church. I was involved in helping with the finding of the [pause] what we needed to do projects: paper, paint, brushes, the whole bit, and just having them available. You know, it was only a week, or I guess it was two-week camp, so you had all those things. It was at Knoxville College, which is, of course, in the black community. They did try to have that balanced as far as the children in it. I took my two children, so it was a really good [experience]. A lot of the camp counselors were parents of children who participated, so that worked pretty well for us and gave them some opportunities. I think they even had an overnight camping situation at some place. I don&#8217;t think we went for one reason or another, but they had them and it was a good experience for everybody. JD: Okay, so now back to Victor Ashe and Martha Ashe. So, he was a young Republican, a rising Republican? BD: Yes. JD: And then, so you helped and got involved in the Republican Party by helping out on his campaign? BD: That was part of it, and it started originally--well, I helped out with his first campaign, just by doing whatever they needed. The most help I gave was when he decided to become a senator, which was about, that would have been six or seven years later, when he was almost thirty. Part of that set-up was that the County Court would be appointing his successor to whoever was appointed to serve the interim, which was only a month or two. He asked me to help round up votes on County [Court]. No, I didn&#8217;t; I think he would have had to have done that, to round up the votes on the County Court, but he asked me to round up some of his supporters to show up at the meeting so they could show support and I did that, which was a good experience. So, he&#8217;s been very grateful and helpful. So the next time that elections came up, he was looking for somebody to run, and so he asked me if I would and I said, &#8220;Well, why not?&#8221; JD: So when did you run for county commissioner then? BD: Well, I ran for County Court the first time, which was 1976. That&#8217;s when Mary Lou [Horner] and I were the first two women elected to County Court. We were called &#8220;Squires&#8221; and somehow or other, that didn&#8217;t seem to fit women being on the Court, so they decided to, throughout the state, rename the office to &#8220;Commissioner.&#8221; So that&#8217;s the way we became [Commissioners]-- then that was from [19]80 on. JD: Were you involved in the Women&#8217;s Center before running for County Commission? BD: Probably. I can&#8217;t remember what the dates were. JD: The Women&#8217;s Center opened up in 1974. BD: Well, I probably was involved, &#8216;cause I knew Jane well at the time. She probably would have had me in on it. [Laughter] And I was on the board later on. While I was on County Commission, I was on the board. JD: What was the dynamic of the Republican Party for women in the early 1970s? BD: I don&#8217;t know that I got a whole lot of heat, really. It was helpful to have a few of the Republicans that I already knew, and Victor gave me a list of names to go visit periodically and I dutifully went to talk to them. If they could agree with what I was trying to do, why they would be supportive. You may want to know what my issue was that I ran on. JD: I would to love to know that. BD: Okay. You know, if you live in Knoxville, you have two local governments. You have Knoxville City Council and you have Knox County Commission. Of course, for city council, they&#8217;re elected and represent only people inside the city limits. But, for county commission, they&#8217;re elected county-wide and divided into nine districts, and some of the districts are within the city, so those of us who live in the city pay both taxes, city and county. And at the time, they had two separate school systems, so if you lived in the city, you were paying the same rate for the county schools and then you had to pay extra for the city schools. Eventually, we were able to change that so that it all became a county-wide school system. JD: And that&#8217;s the issue that you campaigned on? BD: That&#8217;s the issue I campaigned on, and it doesn&#8217;t only occur in the schools; it occurs in law enforcement; it occurs in health care. That got changed so that the health department was county-wide. Libraries were consolidated, and just as a by, the West Knox County Library building is named for me, Bee De Selm. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen that or not, but I might as well brag a little bit. JD: Was it named because you were the first County Court--? BD: I don&#8217;t know how they decided, and if they had it to do over again, they&#8217;d remove it &#8216;cause they&#8217;re mad at me now. At any rate, it was done by the two guys who succeeded, and nobody knew me well enough to protest at that point and they just did it. [Laughter] JD: Did this in any way impact integration in the schools in Knoxville, the changing into a county-wide school system? BD: Probably, yeah. We had a gentleman named Cas Walker. I don&#8217;t know if anybody else has mentioned him or not, but he was against most things progressive, and he warned us that we would have integration problems and of course, we did end up having to integrate the schools, but we would have anyway, I think. JD: [sound break] this measure helps to integrate them? BD: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, they&#8217;re probably disintegrating now. I&#8217;m not sure exactly what&#8217;s going on. JD: Were you part of any of the civil rights initiatives in the area? Well, you were a part of the school for the church. BD: I was usually involved in the National Council for Community and Justice, as it&#8217;s called now. It used to be for Christians and Jews, and they were very active in the news. They always had speakers for their monthly meetings that stressed the issue. You know, a lot has improved in Knoxville; I hope it has all over the country. Of course, there&#8217;s a backlash now with some of the people who don&#8217;t like what&#8217;s going on. I don&#8217;t know what else to say about it. JD: We talked a little bit earlier about the Women&#8217;s Center, but what were your thoughts? Did you participate in any sort of women&#8217;s groups or were you part of the Monday night study club that Jane Weeks mentioned? BD: I&#8217;m not sure how much I was in that. I was always a member and supported their positions. I had been married the whole time through all this and feel a home responsibility. Now that I&#8217;ve retired, I stay home a lot more than I probably would have otherwise, but I had night meetings a lot, and I just felt like I couldn&#8217;t do everything, participate fully in everything I agreed with. But, I supported them with my membership and whatever other ways I could. Mostly, if it came to a vote, I was on the side of [pause] pretty liberal. JD: I can understand how a liberal Republican would have a hard time with the current transition. [Laughter] BD: Yeah, it is hard. JD: So, [sound break] a little bit. What were some of the things that you helped as a county commissioner, sort of issues for women at the local level that you kind of helped to push forward? Do you remember any specifics? BD: One that comes to mind which is not what you&#8217;re looking for, but we have something called the dancers [pause]. JD: The pom squad or the--? BD: No, this is modern dance for children, The Children&#8217;s Dance [Ensemble]. They perform not only locally but internationally. They went to China and Japan, and they needed support from any place they could get it, but they asked county commission to support them and I pleaded their cause. You&#8217;re never sure how much money you should spend on individual things like that and I think we&#8217;re going to be doing a lot less, but I think among all the causes, I thought that was worthwhile. It made Knoxville known all over the world because of their outstanding dance. Let&#8217;s see, you&#8217;re wanting to know what else I did. One of the things that commission and County Court did was make appointments, and Commissioner Horner and I worked together to be sure that a woman was considered for all of these. Now, many of the guys considered if you had a committee of seven and a woman was on it that it was balanced. It took a while to explain balance to them. [Laughter] While I&#8217;m thinking of it, another issue that she and I, as women, supported was anti-smoking. You can imagine a County Court where everybody would be knee-deep in smoke, and we proposed that smoking not be allowed. This was thirty-five years ago. Once we brought a smoke monitor in and when they found out what the side-effect of smoke was, why they did vote to prohibit smoking at meetings. But, next time they had an election, they got some more people in and they got together and removed that. So it wasn&#8217;t until someone just, whoever was managing the City-County Building just declared it off-limits for smoke, so that took care of it since that&#8217;s where our meetings were. JD: How long were you a county commissioner? BD: Twenty-two years. That&#8217;s including the four years of County Court. JD: Do you remember any sort of discrimination cases or any instances? BD: You know, I don&#8217;t and I&#8217;m sorry. JD: No, that&#8217;s okay. BD: We always had--the big thing was the same thing with women and black people was that there weren&#8217;t [represented] proportionately enough. So the guys had been appointing men for so many years, they thought that was normal. It&#8217;s taken a long time. At one time, we had six women on a nineteen-member board. I [was] the one [woman] that had been on there longest, so I called everybody and said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a meeting of the women&#8217;s caucus,&#8221; which we did. We went to the Regas Restaurant and had a lunch, and we all had a really good time. But, when it came time to function again on county commission, it didn&#8217;t take the guys long to make it clear to us that they were--if we were going to function as a group with six votes, they were going to do some of the same, so we just kind of let it drop from that standpoint. JD: Was there any discrimination that you had? I mean, discrimination is a very strong word, but any funny stories of exchanges on the commissioner boards, misunderstandings? BD: You know, I just don&#8217;t recall any. I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t. [Pause] If I think of some, I will call you. JD: That&#8217;s fine. So I want to get to the interesting questions. Do you remember anything about the Equal Rights Amendment in Tennessee? Did you support it as a Republican? BD: Oh, yeah, I would have supported it. I remember going to Nashville in support of it, and I think I went to Washington one time too in support of it. It just never had much of a chance in Tennessee as far as I knew. You already know about women&#8217;s vote and Tennessee&#8217;s part in that. I think Jane Weeks would have told you about that. JD: Are you talking about the famous suffrage vote in Tennessee? BD: Yeah, um-hmm. Did you see my suffrage statue when you came in? I&#8217;ll show it to you when you go out. JD: No, I didn&#8217;t see it. BD: They had little--I forget what they call them, (40:15) or something. JD: It&#8217;s the godless mother story. [Laughter] Well, I was going to ask you a little bit more. I am really intrigued about how you navigated the changing dynamics of the Republican Party. BD: Since I left? JD: Well, since you left or even during. At the national level, of course, a lot of things were going down in the 1970s. BD: Yeah. Well, see I left in--I never left the party while I was on commission, but I just voted my own way on things that came up, even if when you would go and they would say--. I had particular trouble with George Bush. Of course, that was after I had retired. JD: Is this Senior? BD: No. JD: Or Junior? BD: Junior, yeah. Senior I was okay with. But Junior did just what I thought he would and I thought it was awful. I think he was responsible for getting us into the mess he did. And you know, the thing that always bothered me was I wasn&#8217;t sure that he might be right, and he may have been in some of the things he did. The fact that he was able to stop further examples of 9/11 is a major accomplishment. I don&#8217;t know, but a lot of what he did I thought was really bad. JD: So I&#8217;m kind of curious about--I don&#8217;t know that much, actually, about Tennessee state politics, but I&#8217;m thinking about what I know about the Republican Party and what I know about in cases in other states, which is--you kind of identified yourself as a progressive Republican. BD: [Yes]. JD: Can you tell me what that means to you? BD: Well, it means I vote on issues mostly, and what I think in fairness to people. You know, I wasn&#8217;t about to vote for discrimination and never did. [Recorder is turned off and then back on]. JD: And we&#8217;re back again, talking with Bee De Selm on May 24th, and we were in the middle of talking about what the meaning of a progressive Republican to you is. [Laughter] Or a moderate. There&#8217;s many different ways of throwing about terms. BD: Well, I never bothered to mention it until the last time I was running. I was running against a Christian Coalition member of the Republican Party. I don&#8217;t know if you know what they are, but&#8230; JD: &#8230;Oh, I know them. BD: Okay, all right. JD: My dissertation is on the rise of the New Right, so--. [Laughter] BD: Well, when I went to my first public campaign event and they introduced all the candidates, I think it was a Republican event, and they had each of us tell what we believed in. Of course, my opponent was pro-life and [pause] very conservative in view, and I forget what beyond that. I introduced myself as a moderate and they all hooted. I thought what in the world? Moderate was a curse word to them. That really caught my attention because I was proud to be a moderate; I wasn&#8217;t one of those extremists. But anyway, that&#8217;s the way it went. The young woman that ran against me, first time I met with her in another meeting, she really gave me a going-over. I had to come up with some answers to what she was talking about, but she was going to get me on all of their issues. She was going to do the describing about what I believed. I had problems with that. Tell me what you are looking at, if you were looking at the right. JD: Oh, I was going to ask you a little bit more about what you thought about, even in national politics in terms of the Republican Party&#8217;s support of the ERA and then the withdrawal of support. BD: See, that just drives me wild that they&#8217;re so--I don&#8217;t know what the terminology is, but it doesn&#8217;t at all represent my feelings. It kind of hurts me to have to--you know, I like our representatives and everything, good Republicans, but I don&#8217;t like some of the things they do, and some of the ways they vote; it is so over-the-top business. You know, I haven&#8217;t told you some of the other things I&#8217;m doing, but I&#8217;m involved in the inner-city community with Big Sisters/Little Sisters and working in a school with Project Grad, with kids who have really been deprived of a decent education one way or another. I think they need support and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re getting it. The rich people send their kids to good schools and the public schools get what&#8217;s left, and it&#8217;s not a good decision for improving the community. JD: This is interesting. Were there other Republicans like you in Tennessee? Was Victor Ashe one, sort of more moderate? BD: Pretty much, pretty much, yeah. He&#8217;s still a Republican; he hasn&#8217;t rejected it or anything. JD: How did you get nominated in sort of a Democrat-controlled state? How did that work when you first got elected? BD: Well, the way you run is just to get twenty-five signatures and then go campaign on everything. And that&#8217;s what I did, and then Victor Ashe told me how to campaign. He said, &#8220;Ring doorbells. That&#8217;s the way it works,&#8221; and somebody said, &#8220;Use signs.&#8221; Well, I hated the darn signs but finally I agreed to do it. The first day my signs went up, they had pictures on them and I was known at every house, so it really made a difference to have it. So that&#8217;s what you need is name recognition. JD: I&#8217;m trying to figure out, what are your reflections in terms of how and why do you think Tennessee, which had been a Democrat-controlled stronghold, though it&#8217;s still a swing state in some instances, but how it became even--. The question would be how--and is this area now majority Republican or is it still &#8216;cause it&#8217;s Knoxville and the university? BD: East Tennessee has always been Republican ever since the Civil War. JD: Okay. BD: So, it&#8217;s West Tennessee that is the Democratic side. East Tennessee has a terrible time getting anybody elected in its Democratic Party. I suspect the civil rights issue was what changed people because they really had some hard words after the Civil War, and then some of them never got over it and passed it down through the ages. I don&#8217;t know. JD: When you ran, was this a Republican stronghold then? BD: Yeah, it was. You know, they could agree with most of my issues. JD: Which were support of civil rights. BD: Well, I didn&#8217;t run on civil rights. I voted that way, but I didn&#8217;t run on it. My big issue was finance and the fact that the city people were being double taxed, and I did everything I could to change it. We used to--we still have, about every ten years, redistricting. You know what that&#8217;s about. We collect taxes countywide for the county and then we&#8217;d collect taxes citywide for the city. What that did was change the districts a little bit, but also, that&#8217;s where they decided what your tax rate was going to be. It costs money to work out the tax rate, which the county did, and then they charge the city for using that information. It took a while and it was a comparatively small amount, but it was a big way to point out that there was no reason for city taxpayers to pay twice for that because we were already paying for it at the county level. So they did change that and I think it&#8217;s still that way. Sometimes when they get rid of people like me, they change them back. JD: You&#8217;ve got to be vigilant. BD: You do, that&#8217;s for sure. JD: So I want to ask you a couple more questions. You mentioned that you ran against--you said that they were a Christian conservative and you identified as a moderate, so I&#8217;m going to ask you a little bit more about some of the big issues that made these Christian conservatives rise in the Republican Party. So the first one: I talked to you a little bit about the Equal Rights Amendment. BD: Yeah. JD: The second one is abortion. BD: Well, let me tell you what they did. Just as it was getting to be time to find nominees back in 1994, they brought three resolutions in to the commission to be voted on and one of them had to do with abortion, and one had, let&#8217;s see--. There were several. Oh, I wish I could remember those. I&#8217;m sorry. But anyway, they were ones that identified me as a liberal. One of the things that really threw me: I didn&#8217;t vote against nude dancing, I think it was, or something like that. I couldn&#8217;t remember why I voted the way I did, except I thought it was kind of silly to have it on there anyway. What it turned out was that--my campaign chair went back and looked it up. And that&#8217;s another story; I need to tell you about her. But anyway, it turns out that it had already been passed elsewhere and declared it unconstitutional. That was the reason I voted for it, but I really couldn&#8217;t remember at the time why I had voted against it. So, I was able to answer all those, but I really had to answer. Some people say just ignore those charges. Well, I don&#8217;t think you can. I think if they&#8217;re giving a charge that rings in people&#8217;s ears, then I think you&#8217;ve got to answer why you did it. JD: So then, do you remember what the--and this might be asking a lot. What was the abortion vote? Was it on, like a clinic zoning? Was it just something to figure out? BD: You know, I really don&#8217;t know. It may be that they just identified me as a supporter of [pause]--. What&#8217;s the organization? JD: Was it Planned Parenthood? BD: Planned Parenthood, yeah. They thought that we were abortionists, which we&#8217;re not, but anyway, they thought we were and they were going to make it sound like it. That&#8217;s the problem you run into is the opposition telling people what you think, or what they think you think. It really is kind of damaging sometimes, unfairly. I&#8217;ll tell you about my campaign. JD: Your 1994 campaign? BD: Anyway, when I first ran, I got a telephone call from Sandra Clark. Are you going to interview her? JD: No. BD: She&#8217;s a business partner of Mary Lou Horner. In fact, Sandra is the [pause]. She&#8217;s the editor of the &#8220;West Side Story&#8221; and all of this little enclosure, The Shopper-News. That&#8217;s in Halls and down at the city, which is North Knoxville, where Mary Lou is. She had done that for years, and when I got ready to run, I had been mad at her [be]cause she messed up consolidation at the state level. She had spent one term as a state representative. When she called and offered to help me, I thought [sigh]. But anyway, I accepted with thanks and it was the smartest thing I ever did, &#8216;cause she a political science major and she was a real sharp gal. She knows the Republican Party and she&#8217;s been able to keep me out of trouble a lot. [Laughter] JD: And she&#8217;s been your campaign manager ever since? BD: Yeah, up until the time I retired, yeah. I don&#8217;t know that she&#8217;s real happy about what I did with the term limits deal. That&#8217;s something else you may want to look at. JD: Did you limit terms? Did you believe in term limits? BD: Term limits are not an important issue to me, except that in 1990 somebody thought they were important and I think it was Mike Ragsdale, who is our present county mayor. He said he was going to retire in eight years, which he did. He put the thing on the ballot and the people voted for term limits. Well, the Knox County Attorney General--I hope I&#8217;m giving the right titles of everybody. Not the Knox County--the state attorney general, Tennessee Attorney General said that term limits were unconstitutional. Why he said that, I don&#8217;t know. I have a feeling that some of the county people got to him and persuaded him that they were unconstitutional. So when [19]98 came up, I quit &#8216;cause I figured that if we were allowed to stay eight years, two terms, they couldn&#8217;t grandfather it, so we still got two terms. I would have quit in [19]94 except for that Christian Coalition woman. I didn&#8217;t really want to leave it to her, so I went on for another term, but in [19]98 I did retire, as did the one that&#8217;s run for mayor next time, and Mike [Ragsdale] retired too. Where was I going with this? JD: Sandra was upset about you and term limits. BD: Yeah. So after eight more years had passed--no, I guess at that point, some people came up to me and said, &#8220;We need to challenge this in courts or they&#8217;ll just get away with it.&#8221; You know, it stands if the attorney general [sound break] unless it&#8217;s changed in the courts. So, Memphis had the same kind of charter government we did, and they had amended their charter and they had challenged it in the courts. So we decided that we would do the same thing, which we did. I think we started in 2004 and went through--you know, you have to go through all the courts on the way up, and from the beginning, they wouldn&#8217;t let me have standing in the courts. You have to be somebody who&#8217;s intimately involved. Well, you know, I was thrown out too with it. Finally, [my] lawyer decided that if we got ten people--there was a precedent that that could get them standing, so that&#8217;s what we did. We challenged it all the way to the Supreme Court and won, but this was long, about five years doing it. All these people had run and won during that period and they had to leave office in the middle of their terms and other people had to be appointed. That was done, and the way it was done, it was called &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; on January 30th, 2001. It was illegal. You know, we&#8217;ve got an open meeting law and they would go back in the back and decide who was going to do it and appoint them. So the News-Sentinel, a big paper, and our group sued them and got them all thrown out. It&#8217;s not a way to make yourself popular. Some of my friends went out. Mary Lou went out; she got thrown out. So did Wanda Moody, another good friend, but I don&#8217;t think they took it personally, I hope. JD: To try to get rid of the term limits? BD: Yeah, and now it&#8217;s working and we&#8217;ll see whether it was a good thing or not. But if the people voted it, I think to just ignore it was really unconscionable. So that&#8217;s where we were. JD: Was 1994 the first time you were really aware of the Christian right in terms of the Republican Party politics? BD: Oh, no, I knew about them when they started running somebody for commission on that basis. I thought we really don&#8217;t want that. I was surprised that we were able to win that one. It was a close race because she had a lot of support. JD: Do you remember, did you ever attend any national conventions, Republican National Conventions in the [19]70s or [19]80s? BD: I don&#8217;t know. I hope I mentioned the National Association of Counties, which is another organization that I worked in and I did attend those. I can&#8217;t remember that they took positions on [pause] segregation. You know, I always had my opinion and I worked locally to try and make it work, but I didn&#8217;t do a whole lot of running around the country. JD: Since you remember the Republican Party, was there a lot of support for school integration amongst Republicans locally? BD: Not that I know of. JD: Did they just--did they go along with it? Did they go along with it and why, if they did? BD: I don&#8217;t know. I think there were plenty of moderate Republicans like me that went along with it and the other ones fought it, I guess. It was fought in the courts for twenty years around here. Finally, [pause] I can&#8217;t think of the judge&#8217;s name. His daughter [Ann Taylor] is on public radio [pause] as a commentator, but anyway, they did. They fought it here a long time. JD: Did the Democratic Party lead it, or did the Republican, or was it just a segment of--a cross segment? BD: The Democrat Party was never very active here. They could not get people elected to county commission very often. They did in the black community and they did in a few others, but mostly it was a Republican place. JD: When you moved down to Tennessee, did you notice any differences in the Republican Party from, say, Ohio? BD: I didn&#8217;t participate in Ohio. JD: What was it like to be a woman in the Republican Party? BD: Well, by the time I was elected, I guess they were glad to see [women] doing it. I came across some woman who didn&#8217;t think a woman belonged on it. Shut the door and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you ought to be running,&#8221; or something like that, but not many. JD: What did you think of Phyllis Schlafly and her role in the Republican Party? BD: I couldn&#8217;t understand why anybody paid any attention to her but they obviously did. We&#8217;ve still got some women that are selling women down the road, but there&#8217;s room for all kinds of opinions in this country, and that&#8217;s the way it goes. You better be prepared to argue your side of the event. JD: So you got elected in 1976, and I don&#8217;t know what Tennessee State Republican Party platforms were, but what did you feel about when the Republican Party in [19]76 began to come out against abortion and then took off the ERA and abortion in 1980? BD: I couldn&#8217;t believe people would get so upset about something that wasn&#8217;t imposed on them. Choice made sense to me. I didn&#8217;t like abortion. I don&#8217;t think anybody really wants abortion, and to call us all abortion lovers and that kind of thing is just absolute wrong. We just think that we&#8217;ve got some real problems. And I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;re doing the country a whole lot of [good] --not being very helpful by overpopulating the country with unwanted children. That will probably be used against me someday when I&#8217;m gone. JD: The Republican Party, who knows? BD: You know, I think overpopulation is something we need to look at because part of the economic problems of the world are too many people. JD: [sound break] your support, or I don&#8217;t know if you did actually tell me it&#8217;s a part of Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood&#8217;s [sound break] concern about population measures. BD: Sure, that&#8217;s their [belief]. JD: The primary concern. BD: Yeah. You&#8217;d find a lot of Planned Parenthood people in our church. Many of them will feel that way. JD: It&#8217;s interesting that 1994 was sort of the big year for you in terms of the Christian Conservatives, because she ran against you. So it was with Newt Gingrich coming in and consolidating. BD: I guess that was part of it. They were just getting stronger and stronger, and it came close to being my Waterloo because there were enough of them around by then. They could have gotten me if I hadn&#8217;t had some really strong support from people who believed the way I did. JD: Do you believe you got a lot of Democratic voters in the area? BD: Probably. JD: I mean, there&#8217;s not that many, but do you think that you got Democratic&#8230; BD: &#8230;I think so&#8230; JD: &#8230;the swing votes on the Democratic side. BD: I did, yeah. Could be. JD: And independents. BD: Yeah, I think that would be true. JD: Do you remember any sort of issues that you had to deal with locally with the Title IX in the schools in terms of adjustments you had to make to make the schools [sound break] in light of the Title IX? BD: Oh, it just made the men unhappy. JD: How so? BD: Because they had to share their money. If I&#8217;m thinking Title IX is sharing the&#8230; JD: &#8230;Yeah, making sure the funding is equal. BD: I have a son who&#8217;s a swim coach at Chapel Hill, so&#8230; JD: &#8230;Oh, yes. BD: I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s aware of it. JD: Male sports did not get the same amount of funding that they had in the past as [a] result. BD: Yeah. But I think they&#8217;ve gotten used to it, and I think certainly our country is better for it. JD: Well, I mean, I know it was a big deal in sports because there&#8217;s men&#8217;s teams--sort of all male sports take a lot more players, so, like the football team, by having to fund a football team, they&#8217;d have to cut a whole sport out for men to keep it equal. BD: Of course, they earn more than anybody else does too, so it&#8217;s kind of a double-edge sword, but I think they&#8217;re ruling the universities too much now and I really hate that that&#8217;s happening. JD: State interference? BD: Yeah, it&#8217;s too much money and too much emphasis on sports, even though I&#8217;m a swimmer and my family&#8217;s swimmers, but that&#8217;s not where it&#8217;s excessive. It&#8217;s excessive in a lot of other places. JD: Do you remember anything at all with the--other than just being a supporter of the Women&#8217;s Center? BD: Well, only that I was on the board for several years, and supported all their activities, but I&#8217;m not remembering really well what they were now. You know, it&#8217;s a long time back for me. JD: It&#8217;s thirty or forty years back. [Laughter] BD: Jane probably gave you a better idea of that than I could. JD: She did. BD: Have you talked to Nan Scott? She was one of the more recent people. JD: I was planning on talking to her, I think, either Wednesday of Thursday. BD: Actually, I supported, I think, the closing of the Women&#8217;s Center, and I don&#8217;t suppose Jane liked that very much. I felt like we were spending too much time on separate women&#8217;s issues and we ought to be more consolidating in, not spreading out the people we had so much. One of the things on here is, I think it was the Women&#8217;s Center, that [sound of pages turning during long pause]. Yeah, they gave me an award for courage, commitment, and compassion. That wasn&#8217;t what I was thinking about. JD: That&#8217;s the Annie Selwyn award. BD: Yeah, um-hmm. And Jane was instrumental in that, I think. Oh, in the political caucus was another one. JD: Oh, what&#8217;s the political caucus? That&#8217;s the Women&#8217;s Political Caucus that you said that the three formed. BD: Women&#8217;s Political Caucus, yeah. JD: Was that in the eighties that you got [sound break] nominated? BD: Yeah, at least that far back. We had a really dynamic Democratic leader here. She went to the convention, and on the way up was visiting friends and fell down the basement steps and fractured her skull and died. It was really sad. I don&#8217;t think we ever got back on schedule, but what that was, was a group of women from both parties; it wasn&#8217;t just one. JD: It was a national movement with state and local chapters. BD: Yeah, yeah. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s still in effect or not; it probably is. JD: It&#8217;s still is going. It varies between each state in terms of who&#8217;s--. BD: Yeah. JD: Do you know the name of the woman who unfortunately passed away? BD: Oh, gosh, I probably could find it if I really looked. JD: The Women&#8217;s Political Caucus was very much about just getting women elected and getting women&#8230; BD: &#8230;Yeah, it was&#8230; JD: &#8230;into office&#8230; BD: &#8230;Yeah, that&#8217;s right&#8230; JD: &#8230;achieving representation. BD: Yeah. And we had done fairly well there for a while, but I know we&#8217;re going to try and get a county mayor this next time. Whether we&#8217;ll make it or not, I don&#8217;t know. JD: This is an interesting question: Do you consider yourself a feminist? BD: Oh, yeah. JD: And how would you define feminism? BD: Favoring issues that are important to women. That&#8217;s probably not a good definition. How do other people define it? JD: It&#8217;s one of the hardest words to define. [Laughter] BD: Okay, well, we&#8217;ll take mine then, until somebody comes up with a better one. JD: I&#8217;m trying to think what else I was going to ask you a little bit. So, I&#8217;m going to ask you a little bit of interesting questions about women in politics. Were you expected, when you did become [sound break], were you often asked your opinion based on the fact that you were a woman? In the sense that, &#8220;You&#8217;re a woman and you speak for all women; give us your opinion.&#8221; BD: There was some of that by the newspapers, especially early on. Being [one of] the first woman, I don&#8217;t remember any specific--. I&#8217;ve got a whole file of clippings, for some reason or the other that I clipped out. You might be interested in looking at them, but I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;d be very constructive. JD: Did you ever tell them that you don&#8217;t feel comfortable speaking on behalf of all women, or [did] you accept it? BD: I don&#8217;t know that I felt like I had to say that, but maybe. I don&#8217;t remember that. JD: Were you given a lot more committee assignments or was your workload roughly equal? &#8216;Cause I know, in some instances, women sort of as the minority representative&#8230; BD: &#8230;They put one on every committee&#8230; JD: &#8230;put on every single committee so they could say that they were not sexist. BD: Yeah. JD: Did that happen to you? BD: No. JD: I mean, I guess it helped because you and Mary Lou came in at the same time. BD: Yeah, yeah. JD: So there&#8217;s two of you. BD: And then they kept adding up until we had six, and then they [were] booted off, for some reason. JD: Well, it was probably because you guys might have been approaching--if you got nine, &#8216;cause there&#8217;s eighteen, or a board of nineteen, I guess, if you&#8217;re at nine or ten, then you would have had significant voting power. BD: Well, that just happened this last election. That hasn&#8217;t even gone into effect yet. JD: Oh, okay. BD: It starts in September. So, yeah, that will make a big difference, and they&#8217;ll probably do well to have one woman on there again. It&#8217;s going to be hard to get elected to that. That was one thing when I was doing it, but there were two [Commissioners] for every district [sound break] district of about thirty-five thousand people. And they had a pile, a list, that sometimes half a dozen people in the top two ran, but I supported changing that system and having designated seats, so if there was somebody on there that you really wanted to get rid of, then you ought to be running for that seat &#8216;cause if you took the top two, you might still end up with a person you didn&#8217;t want, without having any chance to really get rid of them. So then we vote in term limits and that gets rid of about everybody. [Laughter] It&#8217;s hard to serve too long that way. JD: Is there anything else that you would like to add? BD: No, but I&#8217;ll think of a lot after you leave. [Laughter] JD: Well, I wanted to&#8230; BD: &#8230;Do you want to look at that and see if there&#8217;s anything on there you want to ask me about? [sound of pages turning] It starts on the other side, so I don&#8217;t know if that--. JD: Tennessee Lawyers Association [sound break]? Did you get your law degree? BD: No. JD: [sound break] part of it? BD: No, but I knew a lot of lawyers and worked with them. JD: Oh, that&#8217;s an honor. BD: Yeah, that&#8217;s an honor. The political career and stuff is on the other side. JD: Oh, I do want to ask you about the Rape Crisis Center and the Domestic Violence. Did you participate in any of those&#8230; BD: &#8230;yeah&#8230; JD: &#8230;and if you have any comments about that? BD: No, only that we worked for a long time getting the police departments to train their officers well, and I think they are training now and I think it&#8217;s working fairly effectively. JD: So that was a big movement in 1980s&#8230; BD: &#8230;Yeah&#8230; JD: &#8230;which was education&#8230; BD: &#8230;and the YWCA really got involved in that and they may still be. I think they fund Rape Crisis pretty heavily. I never was very active in the YWCA. I was on their nominating--I joined them and I was on their nominating committee for a few years &#8216;cause I had some good friends who I thought would help in it and they did for a while. JD: I&#8217;m trying to think. [Long pause] No, I think we&#8217;ve covered most of the stuff about women&#8217;s activism. BD: Well, anything up here that you&#8230; JD: &#8230;Oh, and you continued playing violin&#8230; BD: &#8230;Yeah&#8230; JD: &#8230;when you&#8217;re raising your children in the fifties and sixties. BD: Yeah. JD: Yeah, Jane Weeks told me to ask you about that. BD: [Laughter] JD: That you continued--your love was a violin and music. BD: I did. And you know, I&#8217;ve been going to a neurologist lately, having memory problems. She said I should go back to playing the violin because that helps build other pathways in your brain. JD: Oh. So, have you started again? BD: No, I&#8217;ve given it serious consideration, but I don&#8217;t think I could. [Laughter] You know, violin&#8217;s not an easy instrument to play. JD: No, it is not. BD: I quit once before and went back, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready for a third time. JD: Well, thank you so much. It&#8217;s been a wonderful interview. BD: Well, I&#8217;ve enjoyed being with you. I was, as you knew, a little bit concerned about doing it, but I didn&#8217;t blow it too many times. JD: One quick question a little bit before I interview Mary Lou on Friday. Is she a Republican or is she a Democrat? BD: Oh, she&#8217;s a Republican too. JD: Okay. BD: Yeah. I first met her at a Republican picnic or something, and she had a ring on every finger. I&#8217;m anxious to hear what you think, what your impressions are, &#8216;cause she&#8217;s really a&#8230; JD: &#8230;I&#8217;ve heard she&#8217;s very much a character; she leaves an impression.
