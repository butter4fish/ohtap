 Elizabeth Lundeen: Today is August 6, 2012 and this is Liz Lundeen of the Southern Oral History Program. I&#8217;m here in Winston-Salem interviewing Meyressa Schoonmaker and we&#8217;re just going to get started talking about her life and her activism in the women&#8217;s movement. I&#8217;m just going to start by asking you to say something about where you grew up, something about your parents or your siblings; anything of that nature. Meyressa Schoonmaker: Okay. I was born in Guilford County, North Carolina and lived in Greensboro probably until I was around ten, I guess, and then my family, we moved right outside Greensboro but continued to go to school in the Greensboro school system. We moved to the country. [Laughs] EL: Okay, great. MS: Really to Brown Summit, North Carolina. EL: I know exactly&#8211;. I have a friend from there. MS: Yeah, Brown Summit&#8217;s more well known now than it was then, [Laughs] since there was a dirt road that went from Greensboro out to Brown Summit. EL: Wow. MS: And then I lived there, actually my family lived there, until long after I had graduated from high school and college. [I] went into town to the city schools. I went to Greensboro High School. EL: Greensboro High, yeah. MS: Otherwise it would have been out in a county school. My family was very concerned about quality of education and wanted to make sure that I had a good high school education. I had two siblings, a sister who was born when I was seven, Buena, and a brother who was born when I was ten, Lee. So I was somewhat raised as an only child&#8211; EL: For awhile. MS: &#8211;for a good while, which is not a bad thing. [Laughs] But then I really did a lot with the two younger children. I enjoyed it, and I enjoyed the country. I always liked out-of-doors, working in the garden, just the freedom of out-of-doors. So, I don&#8217;t know where you want to go beyond that. EL: Could you say a little bit about what your parents did? MS: My father worked for Cone Mills in Greensboro and then I guess while I was still in high school&#8212;he actually took a job down in South Carolina in the textile area&#8212;and I did not go with the family then because I was a junior in high school and needed to keep&#8211;. EL: Finish, yeah. MS: Yeah, needed to keep in the same school because Greensboro High School was an excellent school with a good reputation, so I stayed back with my grandparents for those two years but then, at that point my family had already moved back, [laughs] back to the same house, so it was a very stable environment. My mother was early on a dancer &#8211; ballet and tap &#8211; but in those days women didn&#8217;t stay too much with careers like that, so then she stayed home for a long time and raised the kids, raised us, but when I was around I guess sixteen or eighteen then she went to work in a credit bureau, and Sears Roebuck, and stores like that and did that until later. But actually after I started a law practice, which would have been in [19]68, after about two years she began working for me. EL: Oh wow. [Laughs] MS: [Laughs] EL: That&#8217;s great. MS: Because I needed someone to help with children and to help in my office, so it was an interesting combination. She, for awhile there, worked in the office in the mornings and took care of the young kids in the afternoons. [Laughs] But then she worked for me really for fifteen years I guess, at least, as my secretary and confidante. [Laughs] EL: [Laughs] Nice to have her close, right? MS: Well it really was, &#8217;cause I always had a small practice. I practiced at first with two other women in a partnership but I just did that for like two and a half years and then I went out on my own. EL: So were there strong expectations that you would go to college? I mean education, [it] sounds like it was important to your family. MS: Yeah, education had always been important. My mother had actually gone to&#8211;at that point it was the Woman&#8217;s College. EL: In Greensboro. MS: In Greensboro, yeah. She didn&#8217;t graduate because I came along and at that point that&#8217;s the way your life turns. She did actually later though finish at Guilford. That was always a real goal. In my family, particularly from the maternal side, there was always a strong push for education. EL: So there was no question you were going to go to college after finishing high school. MS: No, there was no question, and I actually was the valedictorian of my high school class. They didn&#8217;t put pressure on, but&#8211;. The pressure was, I think, very internal with me. I wanted to be independent financially and otherwise. I just had that streak in me and education looked like the one way you did that. [Laughs] EL: Right, right. And what about your female friends that you went to high school with? Was that sort of the norm for people, for women, to go straight on to college, would you say? MS: There was a good percentage. I don&#8217;t know any of those statistics but there was a&#8211;. Of the friends I had a very strong percentage went on to high school. EL: To college, yeah. MS: Yeah. But at that time the schools&#8211;. Well it was a big school. Our graduating class was like five hundred, and that was just tenth through the twelfth grade, because that was&#8211;. At that point the schools were segregated and that was the school that all of the white young people went to school if they were in the city system, and Dudley was the&#8211;. EL: African American MS: Yeah, African American school. So it was a different makeup of student body and, yeah, there were a very strong number of people who went mostly probably to the North Carolina colleges. EL: UNC schools, yeah. MS: But there were some that went out of state. But, yeah, it was a pretty elite group in a lot of ways, and Greensboro, you know, was a bigger town. EL: Lots of colleges around too. MS: Yeah, right, lots of colleges. There was an atmosphere, I think, for education, so I was just doing my bit. [I was] in the band. I played clarinet. I started in the fifth grade, I think, playing the clarinet and then in high school switched over to the bassoon. EL: I play the bassoon as well. MS: Do you really? EL: I did. MS: I play the bassoon now. EL: Oh wow. I&#8217;d love to get back into it. MS: Well, maybe that&#8217;ll happen to you. [Laughs] EL: [Laughs] I hope. MS: So, and I played in college for the first two years and then my third year I went to Germany for the year so I didn&#8217;t play and when I came back the fourth year, just trying to get all straight where I was&#8211; EL: Too much, yeah. MS: &#8211;and graduating, and getting ready for, hopefully, a professional school of some sort, I didn&#8217;t&#8211;. I think actually what I did is I played in the band but I no longer was a majorette. That was the deal, &#8217;cause I had been that. But then I took up the bassoon again three years ago. EL: Wow. That gives me inspiration. [Laughs] MS: Yeah. There&#8217;s a real movement that&#8217;s been I guess probably the last five or more years, the New Horizons bands, and they were founded by a fellow who had been a player and instructor, and they&#8217;re really designed for people who are retired to come back into music. In different towns there are groups that have gotten together and affiliated with the New Horizon band, so there was one here. In fact, Peter Perret, who was the director of the Winston-Salem Symphony, is the director of the New Horizon Band. I mean you know he&#8217;s in his early seventies and this is something much below what he was capable of doing earlier [laughs] but it probably matches what he&#8217;s willing to do these days. I had a friend who was actually a graduate of Wake Forest. She was in the band with me at Wake Forest and she was in this New Horizon Band and she kept bugging me. She said, &#8220;Meyressa, you have to come play in the band.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sarah, I don&#8217;t even have an instrument.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know about you, but with bassoon&#8211; EL: They&#8217;re expensive&#8211; MS: &#8211;it&#8217;s unusual&#8211; EL: &#8211;to own one. MS: &#8211;to own your own&#8211; EL: Exactly. MS: &#8211;unless you really&#8211;. So she kept saying, &#8220;You just have to come. You have to do it. It&#8217;s fun. You&#8217;ll enjoy it.&#8221; So she even got me to contact Ms. [Barbara] Trautwein at Wake Forest, who was in charge of one of the bands, and I got with her and she said for me to come by and she would let me use one of the bassoons, because I just felt I&#8211;. I looked into renting and it was a ridiculous type thing. You rented one from California and I mean, you know, whatever&#8217;s going on. So she let me use the bassoon for about four months and I said at that point I would decide whether to buy one or what to do, so I did. But there&#8217;s hope for you. [Laughs] EL: Yeah, exactly. I&#8217;m just worried I&#8217;ve lost the embouchure and wouldn&#8217;t&#8211;. MS: You really don&#8217;t. EL: You get it back. MS: No. I mean I was at practice this morning&#8211;we practice on Mondays&#8211;and we have concerts and things like that. It&#8217;s sort of fun. You know I&#8217;m never going to become a great bassoonist but, you know, I&#8217;m passable and I can keep the beat [laughs] and the embouchure and the breathing and all, it comes back easily. EL: Well let me flash back a little bit to&#8211;. MS: Yeah, because we got&#8212;. [Laughs] EL: No, it&#8217;s great. So, you&#8217;re at Greensboro High School. This would be the late [19]50s when you graduated? MS: I graduated in &#8217;58. EL: So can you say a little bit more about race relations really, your parents&#8217; views? MS: Sure. EL: Whether or not you felt out of place, or sort of in the mainstream with that? MS: Well as you probably know, at that point things were changing but not at the school. In fact I don&#8217;t recall the first year that there was a black student&#8211; EL: It would have been later. MS: &#8211;but it was definitely when I was a senior at least. EL: Right. MS: And it might have just been one, and I&#8217;m very remiss that I haven&#8217;t checked that out for myself. I do remember one time going over to sit with the person at lunch. I don&#8217;t remember the name, I don&#8217;t remember anything, and I know I did not do it again and I don&#8217;t know why. But back to the other question, my mother particularly, and my father too, were always very liberal in reference to race relations. My mother was really very proactive in that respect. When we lived in the country my parents had bought the house when I was about six&#8211;it was an old farmhouse&#8211;and then for the next four or five years we redid the farmhouse and added on and all these things, dug the sewer lines and the septic tanks and all those things, and put in the electricity. Fortunately, my father was very good&#8211;. And fortunately for me I actually participated in all of it, so, you know, that&#8217;s how you grow up [laughs] knowing how to do those things. But, around the corner from us was an African American family, and there were a lot out there, but this particular one, the Wilsons, they owned their own land. I&#8217;m sure they had been cropping for somebody but they had their own land and had their own farm and pigs and all those things, their hogs and all, and they often did come over and help my dad out with some things, but we never had a really working farm. We were not farmers. I wish we would have been. So, and that was a black family, African American, with all their kids, and they became our friends out there and we interacted all the time. Ernest was the father and he would always bring over to me the first tenderloin from the first hogs they slaughtered, and he would come and sit by the fire and my dad and he and all of us would talk. Sometimes he brought the little kids and his wife Myrtle, who mother did a lot of things with, and even after I moved away from there I saw them and I visited her. She was in a group type home, not a nursing home. I guess assisted living or something. But [I had] very comfortable interactions with African Americans but never went out pursuing that type of relationship. But my mother in her work with the Methodist Church was very involved with the youth groups trying to bring about changes in attitudes and things of that nature. EL: Did they take a stance on integration in terms of the church? MS: The Methodist Church, there were no blacks in that church. I think there are now. EL: Right. There might have been another black Methodist church. MS: Yeah. I think really more of what was going on was the students were, you know, we put the onus of integration on schools and students and that&#8217;s&#8211; EL: Talking to youth groups. MS: &#8211;you know, these students were being&#8211;. They were facing these type of relationships, and my mother thought those things were important and the church did too. I think the Methodist Church really was more, in a quiet way, wanting relations to improve. EL: Right, right. MS: But I mean there was never an effort there to make any black church or to integrate the church as such. EL: Right. So what kind of an impact do you think that had on you when you went to college at Wake Forest? MS: Well I went to college at Wake Forest and there was no integration at all. EL: Yeah, absolutely, but I imagine there was a gamut of opinion in terms of whether or not integration should take place. MS: You know, I don&#8217;t recall that being a real big issue. I mean I don&#8217;t recall it as an issue at all. It&#8217;s more as I look back, because it was really when I was here as a student is when the sit-in in Greensboro took place. My husband, [whom I later married and] is now deceased, was a professor at Wake Forest&#8212;Don [Donald Owen] Schoonmaker, and he was a professor in politics. He was friends with a couple of people who went over [to Greensboro] for the sit-in and he was always so angry at himself afterwards because they actually asked him did he want to go and he had something else that was going on so he said I really can&#8217;t go. But he&#8217;s from New York, from Long Island, and he was very committed to better race relations and he was always sad that he didn&#8217;t commit to the right thing [laughs] at that time. But you know those people were two years ahead of me. They were seniors and at that point I was a sophomore, so that was happening, but you know that, too, was happening among a select group. They were the more intellectual ones, the ones who were really looking at those type of issues, those in the thespian group. So he was more involved with the group that was dealing with that type of issue and thinking about it, and you know it was I guess a year or two after that when Wake Forest, through the back door, had their first [laughs] &#8220;African American&#8221; student, that was named [Ed] Reynolds, who was a part time or [laughs] something of that nature. I don&#8217;t recall the details but he wasn&#8217;t admitted as a full time open door student. [Ed Reynolds of Ghana was able to enroll at Wake Forest in 1962, after having spent a year enrolled at historically black Shaw University in Raleigh. Progressive students, working in conjunction with missionaries, had formed the African Student Program to bring over an African student to break the color barrier at Wake Forest.] But as I look back, in fact I&#8217;ve looked back some in the last few years, as to why I didn&#8217;t do more, because I was very comfortable with the issue but I was never out there promoting. I think I&#8211;. You know, if the issue came up I was always positive about [race relations] but it wasn&#8217;t something that I, you know, took an aggressive stance on. Now I have a daughter-in-law who&#8217;s African American, [Laughs] so those things happen. [Laughs] EL: Absolutely. Could you say a little bit about your time at Wake Forest in terms of what activities you were involved in, what kind of classes you were taking? MS: Well at Wake Forest I&#8211;. [Pause] I started out in pre-med. EL: Wow. [Laughs] MS: Well, yeah. And had always thought I would be a doctor and really enjoyed science and that type of academics, but I always wanted to go to Europe and I always wanted to learn German. My grandfather, the name there is Bumgarner, which is Baumgartner, which is &#8220;tree gardener.&#8221; So I was really curious about the rest of the world. I had that somewhat as a goal and also medicine. So I started out and started taking German and then I applied to go as a foreign exchange student to Berlin and I was chosen for that. That was my sophomore year so I guess that would have been [19]60/[19]61. EL: Wow. MS: Yeah. So one year I was in Berlin rather than at Wake Forest. The two years before I went I was just basically a student trying to do as well as I could, learn German, hopefully go to Germany, and come back and finish my education and go on to medical school. But the main thing is I really wanted a profession, and once again this idea of wanting to be independent, personally, financially, and whatever. So I did that and came back and I got credit for courses that I took in Germany. I had to take exams when I came back in those courses. But then I started a couple of the chemistry, quantitative, qualitative chemistry, and it was getting a little tedious. [Laughs] It was different from what I had been doing, and I&#8217;d been so exposed to the world, to politics international, particularly in Germany because I lived with a German family. In fact I lived with two, the first one for two months while I was in language school, which became friends that I see back and forth even till today, and the last part in Berlin itself. I lived with a German family whose son was at Wake Forest. EL: Okay. So it was truly an exchange. MS: Truly an exchange. EL: Right. MS: But he lived in a dorm and I lived with [his family]. In fact from that year when it was time to come back the wall had not been built yet. EL: Mm-hmm, I was going to say. MS: But earlier they had had what they called the Luftbr&#252;cke where Berlin was closed except for flights that went over, and of course for a good while they didn&#8217;t even have those. So when I was there I had planned to come back in August but the German family&#8212;the wife was actually from East Germany, East Berlin, although they lived in West Berlin&#8212;they knew that something was going to happen politically that involved East Germany and they were not certain, but they thought it was going to be August the 1st. So I decided to leave on July the 31st, because I thought, this has been a great year,&#8211; EL: But I might get stuck. [Laughs] MS: Berlin is a little isolated anyway. I did not want to get involved in that type of political thing so I actually left on the 31st, and as I was on the boat coming back the wall was built. EL: Wow. MS: Yeah, on the 13th. EL: Wow. MS: Yeah. So, that was happening in my life, that type of intrigue and what&#8217;s happening in the world with politics. Also when I came back my feelings about what I wanted to do and where I might make some contribution changed. At the same time I had a situation at Wake Forest that was not very positive. My biology professor&#8212;I went in to see him for a counseling [session]&#8212;said that as a woman, he said, you know, if you go into medicine you&#8217;ll never have a life, and why are you thinking about something like this, which would not happen today, but it was very negative so it really sort of reinforced a shaky feeling that I was having. So I said, well, okay. I didn&#8217;t say that to him but I thought well maybe I should be thinking about law instead. [Laughs] EL: And had you thought&#8211;. MS: So I did. EL: Had you perceived any sort of limitations on what you thought you could do as a woman before that or was that really a turning point? MS: No, that was the first time I&#8217;d ever had anyone start putting some limitations, because that was the one thing with my family. They thought I could, you know,&#8211; EL: Do anything, yeah. MS: &#8211;that I could do anything. There was never a question about what I could do. It was just the matter of time passing and making the right effort. So that really had a profound effect on my future. Without that I would have really stayed with the medical part I&#8217;m sure, but like I said all these other things were happening and if you stack up the two sides of what you&#8217;re going to do, I thought, well, maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have a life, and of course that&#8217;s not really true but it was more difficult at that time. So that was the limitation. [Laughs] EL: And what about for law? How many women were going into the legal practice? MS: There were practically no women in the law at that time, it was very limited, but people didn&#8217;t perceive it the way they did with medicine. In medicine at that time, a layperson looking at it particularly only could look at their&#8211;. They only looked at their family practitioner or specialist who was working day and night. You didn&#8217;t look at research. You didn&#8217;t think about the fact [that when you] work in a hospital you have time off. You just thought you were totally committed. But in law I think the feeling was always you could decide how you were going to work because the profession at that time was very different than it became like the last twenty years with the type of situations that people are in, the pressures of working in bigger firms where you work eighty hours a week. That was not really considered that much earlier. So at that point I decided, well, law was very interesting for me because of my new experiences and it was a profession that I should be able to do okay in. So next thing I knew I was applying for law schools and fellowships. [Laughs] EL: At Wake Forest, or did you not&#8211;? MS: Actually at that time I was&#8211;. My senior year I was engaged near the end of the year to my husband [Don], who was at Princeton University, so I applied to Rutgers, that&#8217;s in Newark, in New Jersey, and I didn&#8217;t even apply to Wake Forest then. But then we were in&#8211;. I went to one year of law school at Rutgers and then [Don] completed his doctorate at Princeton and we went to Europe for two years. During that time he decided to come back to Wake Forest to teach so then I applied to Wake Forest and got in, while I was teaching German at Salem College. EL: Wow. MS: [Laughs] Because something unfortunately had happened in the meantime. He became very ill and that was taken care of. At that time he had a type of cancer that totally was taken care of through surgery but it sort of changed our plans of what we were going to do. So at that point I wanted a job, at first because seeing how his health was going to go, which went fine. Actually the dean at Wake Forest let me in the law school as a part time student the first year, which he had never done before. He was really pressing himself because he was very traditional about what could be done and couldn&#8217;t be done. So I taught at Salem for two years while I was&#8211;. EL: Part time. MS: Mm-hmm. EL: Wow, and did you have&#8211;? MS: Yeah, and was taking three courses. EL: Did you have children yet? MS: No, no. EL: Okay. That was later. MS: Not until I graduated. EL: So part time at law school, teaching at Salem. MS: Right. EL: And how many other women were in your class, would you say, at the law school? MS: Oh, in my class there were two other women. There were three of us in the whole law school. EL: My goodness. MS: The last year, because the year before there [were two]&#8212;. After we graduated, except for the next incoming class, there were no women. When I began practicing in [19]68 four percent of the national bar was female, and now it&#8217;s like around fifty. EL: Fifty. MS: Uh huh. EL: What was that like? Did you have negative experiences with people thinking that women shouldn&#8217;t be in the profession or shouldn&#8217;t be in law school? MS: Not that much. I mean really, I don&#8217;t&#8211;. You know as a woman in an all male type of situation you have friends with a certain small number of people, but I think that&#8217;s true of men too, you know? EL: Yeah. MS: So I&#8217;m sure there were some [who] thought I shouldn&#8217;t be there but I think most didn&#8217;t care. They were just doing their thing. I did have one experience with a professor which I thought was really unfortunate, but besides that, no. I mean the dean was very open about women to be there, that wasn&#8217;t the issue, and I think with other professors, if [there was] a professor that was on everybody they were on you too, so I never felt any situation like that. But you know, I&#8217;m never looking for that, you know? EL: Exactly. MS: But I really don&#8217;t think it was there, but I do know there are people who are always feeling that someone&#8217;s looking over them, but I think those people, [laughs] it doesn&#8217;t matter whether it&#8217;s just race relations, sex relations, or walking down the street in a friendship. There&#8217;s some people who just are always not comfortable with themselves and I&#8217;ve always been comfortable with myself so I don&#8217;t really perceive these other things happening, unless they&#8217;re really pronounced, and then of course I would. But I didn&#8217;t really see any of that. EL: So what kind of law did you think you wanted to practice? MS: Well I thought I wanted to just be a general practitioner. I mean that&#8217;s what people were in North Carolina. I mean we were not in a big city, we did not&#8211;. You know, big corporate and tax attorneys and large firms, international firms, that really was not the scene. The profession itself has changed so&#8211; EL: I bet. MS: &#8211;in the last forty years. It&#8217;s just unbelievable. But, you know, I saw around me and in Greensboro where I&#8217;d grown up people who were in solo practices, three, four, five, six people. I mean eight people was a big firm, except for the very largest in the state. So I just thought, you know, that&#8217;s what I would be doing, and that&#8217;s what I began doing. I practiced first&#8211;. I guess at that point I had a child so I worked part time with another woman who was a woman down from New York who had gone to Wake Forest and passed the bar as a second career for her. She had been in real estate. She knew the ropes of business and things like that. So I started with her and practiced with her for a couple of years and then I became involved in the women&#8217;s movement and at that point&#8211;. One of the reasons I actually stopped working with her was that I became&#8211;. We founded the National Organization for Women in Winston-Salem and I was the president and one of the founders&#8211;not the first one to get it going but I was in there and one of the founders&#8211;so I at times took positions and the other woman I was working with, who was the head partner, said to me that I should not&#8211;. I had made some statement, and she at that point wasn&#8217;t a feminist and was very protective about the business. She said that in the future I should speak with her first before I took some of these positions in the paper, and I said, well, I&#8217;ll tell you. I&#8217;ve never even gotten permission from my husband&#8211; EL: [Laughs] MS: &#8211;for what I&#8217;m going to say. EL: Right. MS: And I&#8217;m a responsible, professional person and I&#8217;m not going to be getting permission from you. So I said if that&#8217;s an issue probably we should be friends but I should really be out on my own, and I did. [Laughs] EL: So you went solo practice at that point. MS: Mm hmm. EL: So tell me about how you sort of got in with the women&#8217;s movement. Would you say there was a defining moment or a first event? MS: To getting involved with the movement? I think I was reading, and it must have been in the newspaper because one didn&#8217;t read too much beyond that, newspaper, maybe some magazine, but there was interest in women getting involved more publicly and there were a couple of cases in reference to women in the workplace, and I just thought it was ridiculous, some of the things that were happening. I remember this one case, the Weeks case. It was in a federal district court in Georgia, I think, Lorena Weeks, and she had worked for Southern Bell, I think it was, for years and she wanted an upgrade into another type job. She was in the line of &#8211; where they&#8217;re doing work outside and she applied for the job and was not given the job because the job had these requirements. You had to be able to lift thirty pounds, and there were some other physical type things, and actually the statistics showed that the men who were working in that job rarely even lifted thirty pounds, it was just a requirement they had placed on it, and women pick up thirty-pound kids all the time. So I started getting really interested in the issues of work discrimination for women, because I thought this is ridiculous, to hold women back from moving ahead. So that was really the first time that I got involved with the issues from that standpoint. Then it was later that I got involved with it from the standpoint of family law. Are you warm? I&#8217;ll turn this fan on. I&#8217;m getting a little warm myself, actually. Then in my practice I started to, you know, had a lot of female clients and I remember there was one lady who&#8211;. Well at that point you have to understand that there were no marital property laws in North Carolina, so if a couple had property they had owned during a marriage&#8211;. EL: It became the husband&#8217;s name only. MS: If it was in his name it was only his property. EL: Right. MS: So cars would be often just in the husband&#8217;s name; well he owned the car. Retirement plans, whoever was the employee owned that plan and the other spouse had no rights to it. So I started having these clients come in with long-term marriages and the husband committing adultery or abandoning for whatever reason, doctors, lawyers, professional and businessmen. I remember this one lady came to see me in 1979 and she told me about her situation, and there was a lot of money in a retirement plan and the cars were all in the husband&#8217;s name. The house was in both names but all the investments were just in his name. So I told her that indeed she could force this issue because of the adultery and that this was what was going to happen. First of all, all of the property was going to be his and that she would be entitled to alimony, but if he died the alimony would stop and if she was out seeing someone else the alimony would stop. All you have to do is go to court to get [alimony stopped]. It was rather automatic in that respect at that time. She had four kids and for each one he would be required to support the child till age eighteen, because that was the law at that time, and he would have no responsibility for college. She looked at me and said, &#8220;I came to see you because you&#8217;re supposed to be a good lawyer.&#8221; EL: [Laughs] MS: She said, &#8220;What are you going to do about this?&#8221; [Laughs] And I said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a real challenge because I&#8217;m just telling you&#8211; EL: What the law says. MS: &#8211;what the law is.&#8221; So I really, at that point, became dedicated to try to find out, what can one do? I established the North Carolina Center for Laws Affecting Women. EL: And that was the late [19]70s, is that right? MS: Yes. EL: Okay. MS: In &#8217;79 or &#8217;80, and the idea there was to research the laws that relate to man, woman, and family and to promote change. Although technically it&#8217;s a research center, and that was the idea, to do the research, to get the information together, to get the argument together, and to get women and the public committed, first of all aware of the situation, because that was the problem. EL: People didn&#8217;t know. MS: People just didn&#8217;t know. And then to bring about some change. EL: And how did you, I mean in terms of getting the public to know as well as lobbying the General Assembly, right, or going a litigative route, how did you see the Center as operating in that regard? MS: Well the interesting thing that happened is, at that same time&#8211;. See I started practicing in 1968 so this at that point was around nine years later. So I had been practicing a lot and had gotten a reputation of being concerned about women&#8217;s issues and I began giving a lot of talks, and particularly through the Center, once that was set up, that gave an avenue for actually presenting information. So I became a speaker all over the state, in Winston-Salem but literally all over the state. For a few years I probably did thirty or more talks a years out of Winston-Salem. The women&#8217;s clubs of North Carolina often had me come to their meetings, and other groups. We often sought out a place to go, but after awhile that wasn&#8217;t really necessary. These groups, they need a speaker, they like to educate and inform their members, so really [there was] quite a bit of demand. At that point in the bar association I was a member of the family law council and so in&#8211;let&#8217;s see, what year was that? I gave a talk. I asked if I could make this presentation to the North Carolina Bar Association, the annual meeting, and that was in 1980. It was called &#8220;A Proposed Concept for the Equitable Distribution of Property in North Carolina.&#8221; Another thing that had happened, right before I gave this&#8211;and I had incorporated it into it&#8211;was a case in North Carolina, Leatherman v. Leatherman, and in that case a woman and man, they had this construction company and they had really started it during the marriage but all the stocks were in his name. Are you familiar with the case? EL: I think I read about it in your stuff. So because she wasn&#8217;t a stockholder&#8211;. MS: Right and she had worked&#8211;. She was actually the office manager and the promoter and she did all of those things. She got the business going and kept it going and he had his people out in the field and he got the work done but she was the glue that held it together. But at the end of the marriage the court said that it was all his, that she had no interest in it whatsoever. So that had just happened and so I was able to incorporate that into my talk, and at the annual [NC Bar Association] meeting. [The talk was] on the general agenda [for] the husbands and wives&#8211;. And a lot of the wives had heard that I was going to be there to give that talk, and they came. I must say that the bar itself was very concerned about the issue and they were very receptive and a lot of people just really&#8211;. The idea that it was that way really astounded them, or the women it astounded. The men, they knew, but they didn&#8217;t know why it should be changed or should it be changed or whatever. But at that point then I went ahead and drafted, with a couple of other women helping, drafted a proposed equitable distribution statute, and the atmosphere was just right for it. I actually got the bar association to endorse the proposed legislation. EL: And this is going to the General Assembly? MS: Yes and at that time there were a couple of North Carolina senators, Helen Marvin, and for the moment the name slips me of the male, but they said they would sponsor the legislation, which was really&#8211; EL: Big. MS: &#8211;big. They had a lot of legislative pull. They were both senators who were well known as being effective and thorough and being able to bring together consensus, and I worked directly with them, because with the Center I wasn&#8217;t out there lobbying individual persons but I was trying to be a resource and to bring about the change from that angle. I can remember days of being down in Raleigh with their legislative assistants who were also looking at the language, trying to work with what could be the end result of this language or the other language, what will go, what will not go, and then they would be out dealing with other senators [discussing] what can be included and what must be excluded for it to pass. At the very end the consensus was they could get it passed if we took out the retirement part, and would I agree to that. I did agree because you have to go in stages and I figured they&#8217;d get the other&#8211; EL: You have to be pragmatic about it. MS: Right. And also at that time the governor, [Jim] Hunt, was able to be convinced by the North Carolina Council of Women. See all these things were happening in the state. You had a North Carolina Council of Women that was actually very effective at that point. Now it&#8217;s not. So he put it as a part of his legislative agenda. You have the governor making it a part of his legislative agenda because the council encouraged him that it was a positive thing. You have to have all these other people and involvement. You can&#8217;t do something on your own. So you had the bar association that supported the legislation, you had the other happening, and normally any type of legislation like that would have to go through&#8211; EL: Committee. MS: &#8211;committee, but this did not. [Laughs] EL: It just went straight through. MS: It went straight and was actually approved. EL: Wow. That&#8217;s amazing. MS: There was discussion on it but it went through [and was passed]. EL: And this is [19]80, &#8217;81, something like that? MS: It went into effect in &#8217;81. EL: Okay. MS: It [was passed in] July of &#8217;81, [and became effective in October]. As has been pointed out by others, [Laughs] I really took the mission of creating awareness of the problem. Normally a piece of major legislation, social legislation, would have been subjected to committee hearings, study commissions for a year or more, but not in this case it&#8211;. EL: You had all the ducks in a row. MS: Yeah, sort of ahead of time in a way. EL: Right. MS: So it went through which was great. [Laughs] EL: I&#8217;m just thinking this is sort of in the midst of the rise of the new right and a lot of backlash to feminism. MS: It was before that. EL: Before that? Okay. So before Reagan gets elected. I&#8217;m just trying to think in the climate of North Carolina how this would have been received. MS: Well I&#8217;m trying to say, see, this wasn&#8217;t women&#8217;s rights, and I always am very careful in what I did for it not to be that type of approach. Everything at the Center was the family. EL: Gotcha. MS: The family and children and what&#8217;s right. So I never took it as women&#8217;s rights, the woman has the right to this, that, and the other. It was the family and&#8211;. EL: Protect the family. MS: Yeah, protect the family, and what women within the family are entitled to. And you know I testified in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment and all those things and did my part. It probably was good that that effort had [failed] right before this, because you&#8217;ve got to give women something. [Laughs] EL: In the aftermath of that defeat, yeah. [Laughs] MS: So, I mean, you know, I feel the climate was right, but I must say I put in endless work in&#8211; EL: Sounds like it. MS: &#8211;speeches across the state and developing literature and getting the literature out to all these groups, and women in the law was a big topic, and if you added to that the situation with inheritance laws it got no better [Laughs] for women. So it was a hot topic. Then after that I picked up on other issues that were important for women and children. At that point the issue of child support came up. We did not have any guidelines for child support. There was something from New York or somewhere that talked about a certain percentage of someone&#8217;s income could be considered for child support. Today we have these guidelines where you click [on] whose income, whose take-home, whose whatever income, how many children from another marriage, all those things, but at that point it was totally subjective with the judge as to what they were going to award for child support, so I did spearhead some changes there. Then another very interesting area had to do with domestic violence. I don&#8217;t know if you saw any of that on my&#8211;. EL: Yeah, I did. You wrote a similar kind of awareness and lobbying campaign. MS: I did, and that was really through the Center because that gives me a neutral way of educating. What had happened is we had in North Carolina a very good law for domestic violence protection, and it was actually based on uniform law and it was very pretty sitting there in the statute books, but it was very expensive to use. Even at that time it cost a minimum of five hundred, and more like seven hundred to a thousand dollars, to get an attorney to bring [a domestic violence] action, and rightfully so because it required a total new complaint that had to be prepared, like filing an action to sue someone for defamation or whatever, a total complaint in a civil action. It required the filing fees and then the attorney had to come for the hearing and then the other side&#8217;s going to file back their answer so that requires more pleadings and more time, so the cost on it was just prohibitive for the people who needed it. The people who needed [protection] were the ones who really could not afford it, and in fact different legal aid societies or programs tried to look at ways to deal with it. They would get certain money and they would say, okay, we will put five thousand dollars into domestic violence and that means we can hire ten attorneys, or whatever, to help ten people. So I kept looking at this and I thought something is just really so wrong because it really shouldn&#8217;t work that way. I also looked into what other states were doing and Oregon had a very good plan, and so I got copies of the statutes from Oregon and then I worked up a situation of how to deal with it. The idea was to let women&#8211;and men, although it was generally women at that point&#8211;bring their own action, but what you needed for that was you needed some forms for them to fill out the forms, so that gave you the complaint, and then you needed other forms to be filled out for the judge&#8217;s decision where they could decide what the ruling would be. So then I tried to think, where can I get people who are interested in this and will partner on this and get this done? I hooked up with some legal aid attorneys in Asheville, actually, Buncombe Co., who were dealing with the same issue. We met in my office for about two months, I guess, and we [used] the plan they did in Oregon. We really took the very same statute and we put in pro se, which meant you represent yourself. So at all these different stages we didn&#8217;t change the meat of the statute and its protections but we said that the complaint can be brought pro se. Then we worked it so that it would be in the clerk&#8217;s office, because every county has a clerk of court&#8217;s office and [they] have personnel there who can do this type of function. We prepared some of the forms that could be used so at least one would have an idea. All this so that you don&#8217;t require an attorney that has to come and do it. You&#8217;ve got the form that the person can fill out and the clerk has to [give] their signature for it. Then the judge. You&#8217;ve got different boxes for the judge to determine what the result is and a portion for individual type situations. So we did this, and I don&#8217;t recall right off who in the legislature we got to introduce this legislation but there were a couple of senators and representatives who said they were in favor of this issue. What really happened is once we became sort of public with it&#8211;. Or we kept it quiet enough, so &#8211;and I can say this because I&#8217;m not working now. [Laughs] I&#8217;m not going to make any enemies&#8212;the clerks&#8217; association in North Carolina didn&#8217;t get wind of it until it was passed. They were incensed. EL: They would have been like, don&#8217;t create more work for us. [Laughs] MS: They were incensed, and when I came back to town after this passed and I went in the clerk&#8217;s office, you could have cut the&#8211;. [Laughs] EL: Oh no! [Laughs] MS: Then I sort of made friends with a couple of [the clerks]. You know, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get so upset. Think of all these people you&#8217;re going to be helping.&#8221; EL: Right, exactly. MS: Then what we did through the Center though was literally set up over the state workshops for clerks and other people and personnel that work with legal aid groups and work with women in these types of situations, with the battered women&#8217;s shelters, and in fact the shelters partnered in setting some of these workshops up, and we did them all over the state. EL: Kind of a training, almost. MS: Yeah. EL: How to do the paperwork. MS: Yeah, and then we actually drafted the legislation so that the onus was placed on the [administration of justice] department for them to clear the forms, because they did forms all the time for estates and other things so their being in charge of forms was not a totally new thing. So we had our suggested forms because we didn&#8217;t want to leave them totally [laughs] at will to do whatever they wanted to. Then a couple people in our group met with the person who was in charge at the administration of justice and got very nice forms. Then it sort of [went into effect]; it&#8217;s always a work in progress. I&#8217;m not sure what stage it&#8217;s in right now but I do know that people can [proceed through court] on their own. EL: Okay. MS: But it became very effective and it was used constantly. That was I guess the other legislation that I had a lot to do with that I&#8217;m really proud of. EL: Absolutely. MS: But that&#8217;s just, you know, being aware of where issues are and having a desire to try to right the situation. EL: And a knowledge of the system, too. MS: Exactly, knowledge of the system. I need some water. Do you want anything to drink? EL: I&#8217;ll take a glass of water. Let me just pause this for a second. [Break in recording] This is Liz Lundeen. I&#8217;m back with Meyressa Schoonmaker and we&#8217;re talking about her involvement in some awareness efforts and lobbying efforts, and I&#8217;m going to ask her if we can step back and talk about her involvement with the ERA a little bit before that, right? MS: Sure. EL: So before those two things came along. MS: So far as the ERA is concerned in North Carolina, I&#8217;m trying to remember&#8211;. The Women&#8217;s Forum of North Carolina sort of took on the banner for that pursuit. I was a member of the Women&#8217;s Forum and I spoke at many of the forums across the state on the issue and talked about it to a lot of groups through the North Carolina Center for Laws Affecting Women. They would contact me in that capacity, and as a lawyer. I did appear before the committee in Raleigh and gave a presentation. But I was in law school at the time when a lot of this was being discussed and my professor of family law at that time was Dr. Robert E. Lee. EL: [Laughs] MS: He was a great guy but he had very different ideas about women. [Laughs] His approach was women are on a pedestal. [Laughs] I used to say, yeah, they&#8217;re on a pedestal but it&#8217;s on some pretty thin stilts. [Laughs] It&#8217;s real easy to get them off the pedestal. [Laughs] In fact in his capacity as a professor of family law he went to Raleigh and spoke on the issue, and he came back to class the day after he had made his presentation and of course gave us all of his reasons, that in North Carolina women were protected and they did not need these laws coming from somewhere up in the North that were going to take away their rights, which was really just totally not the case, and I think that energized me a little bit. [Laughs] EL: I would say so. [Laughs] MS: Because it was really after that that I became more involved with [the issue], but I remember that very well, all the reasons that the Equal Rights Amendment should not be passed and what it was going to do to women, his negative approach to it. So I was involved with the movement and very much wanted it to change. The main reason of course was to give some definite equality to women that could not just be changed by the whim of another legislature. All we have to do today is look and see how legislation totally changes from year to year to see how transient all of it is, even the Constitution, but at least you have something to depend on there. You know I still don&#8217;t understand totally the harsh reactions against [the ERA] but I think it was a real fear by men that women [laughs] would not only become equal but would excel beyond that. Something else came to mind right at that point and I&#8217;m trying to&#8211;. Oh, what the legislature did, of course, not just in North Carolina but in many states, they agreed that they would go through the statutes and change everything that was discriminatory. The issue at that point was whether the women&#8217;s groups would even consider that and become a part of that effort, and I really argued that you should become a part of the effort. You know, you make progress in small steps. And so I participated in that and they had many good lawyers that were a part of their staff for the legislature who went through and also pointed out areas. I mean there were ridiculous things it&#8217;s true, peeping tom type things. It was a crime to be peeping through a window to see a woman, [laughs] but not a man. There were a lot of crazy laws that everyone agreed immediately they were really out of date and had no real significance, but it also pointed out the fact that there was an ongoing need for something like the Equal Rights Amendment because attitudes and things change so far as laws. But I tried, and I was involved with it all the way. It wasn&#8217;t the type of thing that, when [the ERA] didn&#8217;t pass, I thought it was the end of the world, but I thought it was unfortunate. EL: I can imagine it was very disappointing. MS: Yeah, but you know you work for what you can get. [Laughs] EL: Would you say there were things you felt committed to in the women&#8217;s movement personally but felt you couldn&#8217;t necessarily get involved with them professionally without jeopardizing your practice? MS: No, I didn&#8217;t feel that way. The issue of male-female relations and homosexuality and things like that were not really hot issues for me, so if I had been more committed on those issues I think I would have been very upset, but I felt I had enough to tackle [laughs] with the family and general rights of work and family and inheritance and domestic protection. Well I just never&#8211;. I thought it was important but it just wasn&#8217;t on the top of my list. I was very supportive but I didn&#8217;t feel the need to undertake them, and it wasn&#8217;t because of my profession and how I thought it would be perceived that I didn&#8217;t. I just didn&#8217;t have the same fervor for it that I did with other issues. EL: What about the laws surrounding abortion? MS: Well I&#8217;ve always been in favor of abortion and the right of a woman to an abortion but I never [undertook the issue]. I think I looked at wanting to make the changes that I could and feeling that I had to choose what those issues&#8211; EL: Absolutely. MS: &#8211;yeah&#8211;what they were going to be and what I could achieve and I don&#8217;t think I ever thought abortion was one that I could&#8211;. I always took a position on it but it was never in the forefront, because even with women&#8211;. I needed women to support what I wanted to do in order to achieve goals. It wasn&#8217;t personal goals, but to achieve what I thought was important in the area of women&#8217;s rights and family and children. I needed their support, and abortion is such a hot issue that divides even women so much, and you get into religious and other aspects, so I&#8217;ve always had a personal position but the reason I didn&#8217;t pursue it more openly wasn&#8217;t because of what it might do for my profession. It was just that I needed to choose what I think I can achieve. EL: Right, absolutely. MS: Yeah, very practical, what I think I can really make an improvement in. EL: Right. I want to ask you about two other things that I have written down. One is you ran for the North Carolina Assembly at some point, is that right, in the primary? MS: For judge. EL: For judge, okay. So can you say a little bit about that race or what motivated you to run? MS: Wanting to change the law, and at that point&#8211;that was before I got into more legislative things&#8211;I thought that&#8217;s where you could change the law, as judges, but district court judges, they can&#8217;t change law. All they&#8217;re doing is interpreting, and they can be more compassionate at certain levels but at that level the law is there and you have to impose it. In custody cases they have a lot of leeway and they can be very subjective there because it&#8217;s really a judge&#8217;s decision what&#8217;s in the best interest of that child considering all the evidence that comes before the court. But at that point custody was not a real issue that I had as a priority, so I thought, well, I want to see change. I should run for judge. It was really interesting because I won in the primary and then lost in the general election. At that point [judgeships] were politically&#8211;. EL: They&#8217;re nonpartisan now but&#8211; MS: Right, but&#8211; EL: &#8211;they were partisan then. MS: &#8211;it was partisan. So that&#8217;s what happened with that. [Laughs] And I really had no desire to run again. It was interesting, and I talked about a lot of the issues I talked about otherwise. It was just really sort of a furtherance of my own profession. EL: Then the other thing is, you were involved with the Association of Women Attorneys in North Carolina. MS: Yes. EL: Did it all relate to your work with the Center or was it separate? MS: Well that just happened in the profession. Because of things I was doing I came in contact with these women and several of those women were actually with legal aid programs and so I knew them through that and other things I&#8217;d done in the state. See I was a charter member, so the people who were wanting to get this going they contacted other women in the profession who they thought would be supportive and would be a good basis for starting the association. EL: And was the association&#8211;? I mean obviously bringing together women in the profession is a huge goal, but was it interested in targeting particular issues, like the Center? MS: Well the Equal Rights Amendment was definitely one of the issues that were part of the mission. I think other than that&#8211;. [Walks away briefly] Let me look. It really was for furthering women in the legal profession, something that I was definitely interested in. EL: Yeah. MS: [Flips through papers] I was thinking just if there was a&#8211;. So, the goals, yeah: &#8220;To increase the effective participation of women in the justice system, public office, and the legal profession; promote the rights of women under the law; promote the welfare of women attorneys in North Carolina; and promote and improve the administration of justice.&#8221; So those were all things that were interesting to me, and then I finally became actually the president in 1990, I guess. EL: Okay. MS: So those were important issues, and actually if you go into&#8211;. We also have resolutions, and I was thinking that they were all right here. Maybe they&#8217;re somewhere else. But the Equal Rights Amendment, you have to be&#8211;. Here they are. In fact at this point we had forty-three [pause] resolutions that had been started. Each year they adopt new resolutions that are important. So here is, in 1980, equitable distribution: &#8220;Be it hereby resolved, the NCAWA does endorse the right of marriage partners to an equitable distribution of property upon dissolution of marriage.&#8221; EL: There you go. [Laughs] MS: One of my issues. Okay, 1982, domestic violence: &#8220;Be it resolved that NCAWA does hereby endorse the permanent funding for maintaining domestic violence programs through the state of North Carolina.&#8221; Same year, ERA: &#8220;Whereas the NCAWA endorsed the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution in 1978 and maintain need for the amendment is still needed.&#8221; So they&#8217;re still, you know, promoting. So it&#8217;s really all of the issues that were important for me, and once again, in &#8217;85, endorsing again the domestic violence programs. So all of these things really worked together in a lot of ways so it was a great thing to be a part of that association, and I still am. EL: I think I read somewhere that there was definitely sort of a feminist organizing style about it, like in terms of the hierarchy of who was in charge in terms of figuring out, like all coming together and collaborating on bylaws and how the structure of the organization would operate. MS: Now what do you mean by feminist? EL: I just mean less hierarchical than having one person in charge. MS: Oh. Yeah, that&#8211;. EL: I think it was like a reflection piece on the history, and also that the organization was very racially diverse for the time. MS: Yeah, and we&#8217;ve tried to keep that. It&#8217;s difficult. EL: Yeah. MS: Yeah, but definitely. EL: But significant, especially in the &#8217;80s, right,&#8211; MS: Right. EL: &#8211;as a women&#8217;s organization. MS: Definitely. I really don&#8217;t know the percentage now. But you know that was one thing that always bothered me, and that is we never could get black women, African American women, as involved in the movement, and I do understand they had many more problems and things to deal with than the Equal Rights Amendment and women&#8217;s rights. But you know that&#8217;s the sad thing with Pauli Murray, who was African American. She never was able to bring around enough African American female leaders for it to really be a part of [the National Organization for Women&#8217;s] program. But that&#8217;s another whole dissertation. [Laughs] EL: Oh yeah, and there are people writing about it&#8211; MS: I&#8217;m sure they are. EL: &#8211;I&#8217;m sure. [Laughs] MS: But it made me think about it more when I just read&#8211;. In fact I just read the Proud Shoes this summer, the early part of the summer. Also, have you read The Life of Dovey&#8211;? Oh, I&#8217;ll have to get my&#8211;. EL: Yeah, definitely. MS: If you want to turn that off I&#8217;ll get the&#8211;. EL: Or do you want to grab it right after? MS: Yeah, okay. EL: I&#8217;m almost&#8211;. MS: Well I just wanted to get the name of it. EL: Okay. MS: Roundtree, Dovey Roundtree, I think that&#8217;s the name, from North Carolina, a woman who became a lawyer and became also an Episcopalian&#8211; EL: Priest? MS: &#8211;priest, which is just very interesting, how much of her life dovetails Pauli Murray, and they did know each other. EL: Wow. MS: Neither of them married and they were really committed to the profession, both black women, and it&#8217;s very interesting. EL: Yeah, I definitely want to write that down. So you showed me before we started this summary of the&#8211;. You were inducted into the North Carolina Bar&#8217;s hall of fame in 2009, and I happened to notice in the photo you were the only woman inducted that year. I&#8217;m just curious if you could say something to the effect of how much you feel has changed in terms of the profession. Obviously these are people who have had longstanding legal careers, but do you think things have gotten a lot better for women as lawyers or are there some things that haven&#8217;t improved that should have? MS: Oh, I think the opportunities for women in law have greatly improved. The whole attitude about hiring women has changed. I do understand that for many women who are in more high-powered firms that breaking into the partnership where you really share the big money is still a big issue. But I think beyond that, the opportunities there, the biggest problem that has been for women is these bigger firms, and even smaller, have begun this practice of really just&#8211;. It&#8217;s like having sharecroppers. I mean they really work their people to death, whether it&#8217;s young male or female new members of the firm, and it&#8217;s unconscionable. They work them for all they can, they pay them less, and then they throw them out the door and the partners at the top reap&#8211; EL: Keep getting the money. MS: &#8211;big benefits. Lower people are now earning more money but this quality of life issue has become a real issue within the profession and the profession itself has become so difficult now so far as pressure is concerned. Really technology has made it more difficult because you&#8217;re on the spot every minute. I would not want to be practicing a court practice at this point. EL: I don&#8217;t think I would either. [Laughs] MS: I really wouldn&#8217;t, because you can&#8217;t get away from it period, and now electronic filing. There&#8217;s no peace and there&#8217;s no time to even think about what you&#8217;re responding to. The time&#8217;s already passed to do something. So I think the profession has become more of an enemy to women than other people. [Laughs] I mean when I started out there were men who didn&#8217;t want women in the profession, but there was more discrimination from other males even my own age when I started practicing than from judges. Judges were pretty friendly. I never had a judge that I really felt made a decision negative to me because of being female, maybe because of my clients or that they didn&#8217;t like what I wanted to get done, but not because I was a woman, but there were a couple of men who were just really snippy and calling you really nice names and all. Actually I had a case, and it wasn&#8217;t that long ago, probably ten years ago, with an attorney who&#8217;s still very well respected, and it was a civil case and he was drawing up the order. What happens in these cases, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s correct, but the attorney who wins that particular argument, issue, is the one who&#8217;s allowed to draft the order and then it&#8217;s up to the opposing counsel to come in and object to some of the findings and what&#8217;s going on. Well in the first of pleadings you start out with the order: &#8220;Be it resolved that,&#8221; and it says, &#8220;The plaintiff, represented by so-and-so attorney at law, and the defendant, represented by Meyressa H. Schoonmaker, witch on a broom.&#8221; EL: What? Wow, put that in the order, wow. MS: And you know, I never&#8211;. I could have taken this up to the bar but I don&#8217;t want that kind of publicity. So I wrote a letter about it and I wrote it to the judge and to the attorney, who said, &#8220;Oh, some little mistake in my office. It must have been the secretary writing it.&#8221; I mean, give me a break. EL: Right. MS: And I thought there are some things you can just chuckle about and move on, and the thing was it was around Halloween. That was the other thing. So someone was having fun and they just forgot to clean up their fun. EL: Mm-hmm. Wow. MS: [Laughs] But that&#8217;s probably, I mean a couple other little insignificant things, but that really hit me to the core a little bit. EL: I would bet. MS: Because I&#8217;m talking about not more than ten years ago, and a younger guy, much younger than I, and I thought to myself&#8211;. I was just disappointed. Aren&#8217;t we beyond this type of stupid thing? EL: Yeah, you would think. MS: Yeah. [Laughs] EL: So, I&#8217;m curious. You&#8217;ve just finished talking about how young attorneys are worked so much and so hard. I&#8217;m curious as to how you were able to balance work. You had three children, is that correct? MS: Two. EL: Two children, sorry. How did you feel that worked out? MS: It worked out great&#8211; EL: You said you had your mother MS: &#8211;because I decided early on that I had to be in charge of what I could do, and in fact when I was&#8211;. This was the other discrimination that was to my advantage in the long run, but when I was in law school at Wake Forest I interviewed&#8211;. I had two interviews, I think, and one was with Wachovia Bank at that time. It was their trust department, I guess. During the interview the fellow from the bank said to me, &#8220;And you will have a child within a year and we will have trained you and invested our money in you as a woman and you will not even be there to work for us in this area of trust,&#8221; and I looked at him and I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you, I can promise you one thing, and that is I will not be having a child within one year and I would work for you for one year,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;You find another male who could promise you more than he will work for you for a year,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I should tell you one other thing. I&#8217;m not interested in your job.&#8221; [Laughs] EL: Wow. MS: That was in [19]68. So I thought to myself, you know, I&#8217;m going to have to be in charge of what happens here, [Laughs] not someone else. EL: So is that part of the motivation to&#8211; MS: Yeah. EL: &#8211;open your own practice? MS: And, you know, the other situation is I knew at that point that I had the opportunity with Barbara Westmoreland who had been in law school and who I was a friend of, and she always said I could come and work for her. Having a family was always a priority for me and so I knew that I had to be able to work it out so it was good, and if it wasn&#8217;t good I wouldn&#8217;t be doing it. So I started out working part time. I worked two and a half days a week and that worked out fine. It was easier in those days, I think, to do something like that. Then, like I say, after two years I had another child so there was another child and I guess at that point Trevor was two, yeah, so Barbara gave me an opportunity to just decide I could go on my own. [Laughs] So I did and at that point I contacted my mother and said I was going to do this if she would come and work for me, because I needed a secretary and I needed someone to help with the kids, and she said she would. She was living in Greensboro. So I had the children in a church daycare in the mornings and she picked them up at noon and brought them home. We had the telephone so that it, even at that those times, where it would ring here and she would answer for the law office&#8211; [Laughs] EL: [Laughs] MS: &#8211;in the afternoons. And you know we could do it that way for a couple of years and then after that I really had to have someone where I was more of the time than just the mornings. But if we had things to be notarized and things like that, and it was always the morning when they could come, I mean you work around those things. You don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s because my mother has to be home taking care of my kids in the afternoon. [Laughs] EL: [Laughs] Right. MS: You just say, well the only time we can do that is&#8211; EL: Is in the morning. MS: &#8211;in the morning. So I just&#8211;. For me always having the time was important, and it was good, too, that my husband was a professor so as the children were older he was able to have more time, like in the afternoons, but he never did that much until they were older. I really made arrangements, and I had someone who came in when they were really young before my mother came. I think Kirsten was in a daycare for a couple of months when she was like two. Other than that she&#8217;d always been at home. But I mean I hate to think about what would have happened otherwise, if I had gone into a firm. I sort of knew that I couldn&#8217;t do that. I had to really be in charge of when I was going to be home with my kids or when I had to be. But I kept very set hours. I wasn&#8217;t here part of the time, there part of the time. I just made the arrangements so that I had the care for them. But I&#8217;ve always lived my life that way. EL: So what&#8217;s come after the practice? What are you doing these days? MS: Well, I&#8217;m playing the bassoon. EL: Yeah. [Laughs] MS: [Laughs] So I&#8217;m doing that and also I do some, I guess you&#8217;d call it volunteer work, at the Pilot View Resource Institute, which is a nonprofit, environmental, not just group. I mean they are really into stream restoration and very big environmental water issue projects, and I&#8217;m on the board there and do a lot with that now. It&#8217;s taken a good bit of time. And we travel a lot. I&#8217;ve really traveled extensively in the last fifteen years or so. And I have grandkids that I try to do a lot with, all granddaughters at this point. EL: Oh my. [Laughs] MS: Yeah. So eighteen, sixteen, seven, and two and a half. EL: Wow. That&#8217;s enough to keep you busy. [Laughs] MS: Well it is, and I like to keep up on current issues and things like that, and just trying to keep up with the kids and what they&#8217;re doing and being involved. I just took the sixteen-year-old to Italy for a couple of weeks. I told each of them when they get sixteen I&#8217;d take them on a trip. I want them to know Europe a little bit. The eighteen-year-old, I took her two years ago to Paris. She wanted to go to Paris so we went, the two of us, to Paris for about ten days, and this time, the sixteen-year-old, she wanted to go to Italy. It was supposed to be because of their language, and Kaitlyn, who&#8217;s the older one, she had been studying French for three years so that was appropriate. But Haley, who&#8217;s sixteen, Spanish was her language but she did not want to go to a Spanish speaking country; she wanted to go to Italy. So I said okay. [Laughs] So my husband said to her&#8211;I remarried about eighteen years ago&#8211;he said, &#8220;Well how&#8217;s your Italian?&#8221; [Laughs] EL: [Laughs] I&#8217;m sure she picked up some while she was there, right? MS: A little bit, but it was fun, and it was more for some time, some grandmother-granddaughter time, and for her to be exposed to other people, other cultures, language, and learn a little about the world. So those are some priorities. [Laughs] EL: Good. Well is there anything else you want to add that I haven&#8217;t asked about? MS: I don&#8217;t think so. EL: We&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground I think. MS: Right. We have. No, I think not. I think those are&#8211;. I think we covered probably everything. As I said when I look back on the issue of race relations I am remiss that I didn&#8217;t do more, but I think within our own family we reached out. In fact our son, Trevor, went to Nigeria for six weeks or more while he was in college, or maybe it was right after. You may have known Yomi Durotoye at Wake Forest? EL: Yeah, absolutely. I took a couple of classes with him. MS: Okay. Well in fact Trevor stayed with Yomi in Nigeria because he and my husband, Don, were good friends from the department. Trevor was in art history but he went to Carolina and got a degree in art history. Then he was at Michigan in Ann Arbor, and at first he was really in the African project for his [master&#8217;s] degree, contemporary African art. He got a master&#8217;s in the area but he didn&#8217;t go on for his PhD, as it turned out. He wanted to get out into the curating. EL: I don&#8217;t blame him. [Laughs] MS: He is at the Nasher Museum. EL: Oh yeah, great. MS: He&#8217;s the curator of contemporary art. He&#8217;s been there about five years. Before that he was in New York for several years curating on his own as an independent curator, and you may have&#8211;. Have you come across the name Fela Kuti? EL: No. MS: He was a Nigerian&#8211; EL: Artist. MS: &#8211;artist and musician, really musician and politician. EL: Okay. MS: But a lot of art was done around his life. So, I guess you&#8217;re saying what do I do now, so I have to keep up with all these things, you know? [Laughs] EL: [Laughs] Absolutely. MS: It keeps me busy. I have to keep up with what the Nasher&#8217;s doing and what&#8217;s happening in art. My daughter&#8217;s a therapist who&#8217;s just opened her private practice. She had been working with institutions before. EL: Are you going to go be her administrative assistant? [Laughs] MS: No, I&#8217;m not going to do that, but she&#8217;s already had these issues about being called in for a deposition, and what can she do, what can she not do; how should this happen. I think we spent a weekend on and off the phone about what was going to happen at this deposition that she had never been to before. [Laughs] But she did well. So, you know, those type of things are always fun, to be able to deal with the kids in areas where you have some expertise and they&#8217;re searching. [Laughs] EL: Well it&#8217;s been a real pleasure. MS: And mine, to meet you, and I hope your project goes well. EL: Thank you. You&#8217;ve had a fascinating career and lots of important issues that you&#8217;ve been involved in, so I appreciate it. MS: It was a good time to be involved in those issues. EL: I&#8217;m going to go ahead and turn this thing off...
