 Joey Fink: It&#8217;s December 11th, 2012, this is Joey Fink, I&#8217;m with Ivanna Gonzalez, we are interviewing Nancy Shoemaker today for the Southern Oral History Program&#8217;s Long Women&#8217;s Movement in the American South project. We are in Nancy&#8217;s home in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thank you so much for agreeing to be interviewed and inviting us to your home. Nancy, can you start by telling us when and where you were born and a little bit about where you&#8217;re from. Nancy Shoemaker: I was born in 1949 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. My father had grown up there and my mother had grown up in an Ohio town not far from there and her mother had moved to Pittsburgh to be closer to her family after her mother&#8217;s father died. Um, dad worked as an insurance agent, when I was about three or four we moved to Springfield, Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia, where I started school, and a couple years after&#8212;no, that&#8217;s wrong, we first moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where he did his trainee at the insurance company. Then moved to Springfield, Pennsylvania for a couple years, and then at the end of my first grade year, which would have been &#8217;56, I guess, we moved to Long Meadow, Massachusetts, which is near Springfield between Springfield and Hartford, which is where I grew up. I graduated Long Meadow High School there, it&#8217;s a small bedroom community, you know, just not very diverse. I mean it was the wealthy suburb of Springfield, though, I don&#8217;t think we ever had&#8212;I never felt we had that much money, dad&#8217;s business career was never particularly successful, my mother was home with us. I have a brother two years younger than me and a sister eight years younger mother did go back to work when my brother was in college. You know, it was David first you know, and, I went to college, I got a good scholarship, National Merit Scholarship through IBM, which pretty much paid tuition at Swarthmore&#8230; went from there&#8230;I never really worried about where the money was coming from, but-- JF: Was there an expectation in that you would go to college&#8212; NS: Yeah. JF: --when you were growing up? NS: There was, and I came across the other day, my third grade teacher wrote on my report card, you know, in the little comment section, you know, &#8220;Phi Beta material&#8221;, which, you know, I didn&#8217;t know what that meant, I realized later that not only was I expected to go to college but make Phi Beta Kappa when I went there, so [Laughter] so, I was&#8212;you know, but that, and I almost didn&#8217;t go to Swarthmore because of that, but, you know, I ended up&#8212;that worked, went on to graduate school at Wisconsin, married a classmate&#8230;he&#8230;was in a two-year program at Princeton&#8230;I&#8217;d applied to be a Ph.D. program at Wisconsin but left after the calendar year with my Masters&#8212;the plan was he was going to go back and get a job in Madison&#8230;but&#8212;he was in public affairs, you know, public administration&#8212;but [pause] I suppose I can say this&#8230;the way we described the family story, is that, Wisconsin was not hiring white males from out of state into government service in&#8230;1973 and so he took a job in New York, I moved to New York, uh, you know, had a six-month period of&#8230;.um&#8230;the only time I actually was paid to write Cobalt., um, but went back to graduate school at Grand Collier, which was uh&#8212;you know, my undergraduate work at Wisconsin had been pretty much pure mathematics Grand Collier was a much more engineering school, much more applied mathematics&#8230;um, and, you know&#8230;.it wasn&#8217;t really a good fit, but, I kind of made it work&#8230;graduated, fairly quickly&#8230;I mean, seventy--I guess, what three and a half years, or something, after&#8230;um, and then&#8230;took a job teaching in New York and when my&#8212;when that marriage&#8230;fell apart, that&#8217;s when we get into the whole two-bot war, but [laughter] um, you know, taught&#8230;so&#8230;I mean, various different things&#8230;North Carolina is the tenth state I&#8217;ve lived in since I got out of school&#8230;and we&#8217;ve been here since, um, 1996&#8230;so just going on seventeen years&#8230;yeah, I think that&#8217;s right, yeah. JF: Can I take you back to Swarthmore College? NS: Umm-hmm. JF: So I, being the good researcher that I am&#8212; NS: Umm-hmm. JF: --looked up Swarthmore College because I think this is&#8212;is this a 7th Sister School? Why do I know this? NS: Uh-huh. JF: And when I saw this&#8212;oh, right&#8212;it&#8217;s uh, known for being founded by Quaker Abolitionists and women&#8217;s movements&#8212;is this part of the atmosphere there? Like a long history of&#8212; NS: I was there from &#8217;67 to &#8217;71&#8230;which, um&#8230;and, it&#8217;s in&#8230;freshman year [pause] how does this work? I&#8217;m trying to remember exactly what the whole&#8230;I mean, there were&#8212;there were&#8212;three of four major events during my four years there. One, sounds really weird, is the release of a strategic plan for the campus&#8230;which they essentially cancelled classes&#8230;I think for a week in December of my freshman year, where we all got to talk about the college going and, I was a freshman, this was a new week to study for finals! [Laughter] It was, you know, still, you know, kind of introspective&#8230;we need to do the right thing&#8212;and, and one of the things that was coming up and that, but then&#8212;I think it was the fall of the next year, um, the black students on campus&#8230;occupied the President&#8217;s office with a&#8230;um&#8230;we&#8217;re tokens, you know&#8230;there are so few of us&#8230;that&#8230;this is&#8230;crazy, you know? You know&#8230;and&#8230;and it was, you know, as a good school that thinks that discussing things will get through&#8230;there were all-campus meetings&#8230;and on and on&#8230;and what&#8217;s the story and what&#8217;s the problem&#8230;and&#8230;and the President died of a heart attack, and so it was kind of short-circuited. You know, things weren&#8217;t really resolved, you know, it was clear the faculty wanted to resolve them, but&#8212;how do you, how do you do this&#8212;I mean, it&#8217;s&#8230;it&#8217;s&#8230;how do we&#8230;you know, it&#8217;s not like there were&#8230;it&#8217;s just&#8230;there were easy answers&#8230;and so that was a stra&#8212; and then, spring of my junior year, it was the spring of Kent State. And it was, so, you know, it was&#8230;partly mocking that whole 1968&#8230; presidential election, and things are kind of jumbled&#8230;and there was one march on Washington that I can&#8217;t really tell you which&#8230;which year it was that I went down there&#8230;that whole turmoil of that whole era&#8230;was very much on campus, um, you know&#8230;the&#8230;the war&#8230;you know, it was during my time there was when they switched to, um [Pause] the lottery&#8230;for the draft&#8230;and, you know, it was&#8230;it was ten, fifteen years later that I thought&#8212;I don&#8217;t know what my lottery number would have been [Pause] I mean, it wasn&#8217;t my problem to that extent&#8230;I know what my brother&#8217;s lottery number was&#8230;I know what my roommate&#8217;s, you know, husband&#8217;s lottery number was, but I don&#8217;t know what mine would have been, should I? Well, I don&#8217;t&#8230;I mean, the way things have changed for women over the years, but that just wasn&#8217;t part of it&#8230;And, and&#8230;the racial tension on campus&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure where that goes&#8230;I mean, I&#8217;ve been back to couple of reunions and [pause] well&#8230;some&#8230;it&#8217;s some people are still fighting&#8212;fight for social justice in many ways&#8230;I mean it was&#8230;.they came in with that as part of why they chose Swarthmore and that they had spent their lives doing that&#8230;um, you know, others have, well, I&#8217;m smart enough to get into Swarthmore, smart enough to get a good job, I can make a good life for my family&#8212; JF: Umm-hmm. NS: --that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important to me. And so it&#8230;I was exposed to a lot of stuff&#8230;I went off graduate school after the&#8212;I got there, got to Wisconsin, it had been a year or two, um, when there was a bomb in the physics department, and, I forget exactly what the issues were&#8212;I wasn&#8217;t on campus when it happened, but that was still an overlay of&#8230;so it was more the war, I think, and okay, the law says we&#8217;re all equal and we should go to the same schools and&#8230;but, it was&#8230;what does that really mean in an elite, Eastern&#8230;um, university, college. You know, and, and that was my&#8212;I remember the&#8230;my spring, spring of my senior year, I was, um&#8230;I actually could have graduated in December, but, much to my father&#8217;s chagrin, I could have graduated, I had enough credits to graduate&#8230;I, I really wanted to take a course, you know, I was offered that in--that spring. And one of the students in that course that spring was a freshman, you know, who had come in very well prepared, and he was the son of, um, [pause] I can&#8217;t remember his father&#8217;s first name, but he was, um, president, you know, chief executive, of the National Negro College Fund. And&#8230;and Chris, you know, was probably the fir&#8212;I can&#8217;t remember, I mean, again, there were so few black students on campus&#8212;it was, you know, there were a couple of girls in my hall, but it wasn&#8217;t&#8230;it wasn&#8217;t a [pause] you know, not, you know&#8230;.it still&#8230;it may still be today&#8230; you know, it was segregation in the&#8230;dining hall kind of thing,, but Chris was a freshman I really got to know, um, pretty well, I mean he, he went on to Harvard Law School and um, was on Clinton&#8217;s staff, um, not sure what he&#8217;s doing now [11:57]&#8230;I mean&#8230;if you were at Swarthmore there were many things you could have done&#8230;I don&#8217;t know there were some&#8212;I had a friend, they had a&#8230;um [pause] there was another math major, another woman math major, um, there were only a handful of math majors, and&#8230;there was another woman&#8230;and, um, she was a physics minor, where I had said &#8220;eh&#8221;&#8230;I looked at the number of history books on the history shelves&#8230;you know, the number of shelves of history books in the library&#8230;and said no I&#8217;m not going to do that. I was a philosophy minor, and&#8230;um&#8230;but she was a physics minor, and um, I think she had a really rough time&#8230;as a woman&#8230;in the physics department. She went on&#8212;she&#8217;s now Dean of Engineering at a school whose name I never remember in Colorado, but&#8212; JF: Why do you think she had a rough time? NS: I&#8212; JF: Did she talk to you about it? NS: I mean&#8230;it was not&#8230;I guess I&#8217;m not&#8230;[pause] she doesn&#8217;t have a good feeling about Swarthmore&#8230;she doesn&#8217;t come back for reunions, we don&#8217;t talk&#8230;um&#8230;we haven&#8217;t talked about it for years. But it was&#8230;you know, there were the expectations&#8212;I mean, I don&#8217;t know, weather it was&#8212;and I&#8217;m not sure how much was&#8230;but&#8230;it was&#8230;you know, again, married a classmate, and it was&#8230;probably three years later, um, there was a lawsuit a woman faculty member brought up&#8230;a suit&#8230;against the college&#8230;for sex discrimination. And&#8230;it was my husband who said something&#8230;about&#8230;you know, he learned at Swarthmore&#8230;that&#8230;women&#8230;could be&#8230;bright. You know, kind of something he hadn&#8217;t learned in his high school. And it was&#8212;it kind of &#8211;I, I probably never have processed that well, um, you know, that&#8230;what did that mean? You know, why&#8230;and that wasn&#8217;t the word he used. But it was, um, how were we treated differently&#8230;you know, it was kind of a&#8230;fish doesn&#8217;t see the water&#8212; JF: Hmm. NS: --kind of thing. But, you know, it was [pause] and I remember&#8230;you know, changed my name on my first marriage to his name&#8230;and&#8230;but when Ms. started publishing in &#8217;72-- JF: &#8217;71 or &#8217;72, around there, yeah. NS: And, um&#8230;and that was a wonderful solution, because I did not want to be Mrs. Richard Hegner, professionally&#8230;I didn&#8217;t want to be Mrs. Nancy Hegner professionally because that, in the culture where I has grown up meant you were divorced, and&#8212; JS: Oh! [Laughter] Had to process that for a second. Oh, yeah I get it! [Laughter] NS: And, so Ms. , you know, finally there was something that&#8230;would work. JS: So how did you, um, discover Ms.? Either the magazine or the concept of it. NS: Uh, we were subscribers, to New York Magazine, I think in the first issue was published&#8230; as sample there&#8230;so I&#8217;ve&#8230;it&#8217;s been a hard organization to stay in touch with&#8212;I mean, you know&#8212;I&#8217;ve been a subscriber ever since, and when we left, in one of those many moves, I gave a twenty-year, twenty-five year old collection to [16:09] University of Women. You know, kind of an interesting&#8230;I&#8230;I don&#8217;t really read it as carefully as&#8230;you know, maybe I once did, but I still find it&#8230;you know, the only women&#8217;s magazine that speaks to me&#8230;you know&#8230;so&#8230; JF: So&#8212;was there a visible women&#8217;s movement when you were an undergrad? I guess&#8212;it&#8217;s a funny way to ask this question but I can&#8217;t find a better way&#8212;like, how did you find feminism or find the women&#8217;s movement? NS: Well it was&#8212;you know, there was this kind of&#8230;you know, subscriber to Ms., but that was about the level it was. I mean, I don&#8217;t remember that there was a women&#8217;s center, or&#8212;I mean, there were no sororities left at Swarthmore when I was there, there was no&#8212;I mean, there were segregated dorms&#8230;um&#8230; JF: Sex segregated? NS: Yes, sex segregated dorms&#8230;um&#8230;though that was breaking down I was surprised to see boys, it&#8217;s just now, that, you know&#8230;people of the opposite sex can say they want to room together at UNC it was&#8230;I guess, I guess I understand it now, but um&#8230;it was&#8230;I don&#8217;t&#8230;feminism was there, and, aside from the war, and the civil rights movement, there was this feminism around, and reading Ms. you get the sense that yeah, women needed to be treated better, and they need&#8212;if they&#8217;re part of, say, the civil rights movement, they need to be acknowledged as something more than&#8230;um&#8230;administrative help. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: Um, so that was&#8212;so, so I was aware of it, but it wasn&#8217;t really&#8212;you know, I was either in school, or working, or staying in&#8212;you know, we never had children&#8212;his family was one place and my family was another place, so we were just trying to keep track, you know&#8212;when you don&#8217;t have children you&#8217;re expected to show up at the parent&#8217;s door more often than folks with children. And&#8230;so I never really thought about it. And then, um, and that the&#8230;leaving academia [pause] and, I mean, that was the risk of&#8212;well, the place that I had the first job, there was the&#8212;well yes, the interview, the discussion with the dean for my second year, and it was, yes, you&#8217;re obviously better qualified then these people we were going to give the raise to&#8230;but you might leave&#8230;so we&#8217;re not going to give you a raise. A bigger raise as you are qualified&#8230;you know&#8230;it was kind of like, well, if you don&#8217;t give me a raise I&#8217;m probably going to leave! [Laughter] And, at the other job, um, the second place, I mean there were&#8230;I mean they had the sense&#8230;[pause] I&#8217;m not sure how to say how there was anything explicitly gendered about the treatment&#8230;of the faculty. But, the whole academic atmosphere&#8230;and&#8230;what you needed to do to get tenure&#8230;just in&#8230;giving up the rest of your life&#8230;just didn&#8217;t seem to be something that I wanted to do&#8230;you know, and I said, I just don&#8217;t want to work that hard. And then I ended up, you know, later in my career, working even harder, but, but you know&#8230;it just&#8230;it just didn&#8217;t&#8230;and again, there were&#8230;I should have remembered this interview coming up and there was get another woman on the faculty&#8230;she may have been the only other woman on the math faculty, but she&#8217;d been there for a while, her husband was on the faculty, and she was still being treated as junk, so it was back in the days when&#8230;you kind of couldn&#8217;t have-- JF: Oh, the anti-nepotism rules? And this was when you were at Princeton? NS: No, I was at Oakland, Oakland University, yes, yeah&#8230;so, um&#8230;and yeah&#8230;it was just [pause] I don&#8217;t know&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure how to&#8230;you know, there was a game being played, I think, that I think is something to come back to in other&#8230;parts of my career, other places I&#8217;ve worked. And&#8230;you&#8230;you have the sense that there&#8217;s a game that&#8217;s being played&#8230;and nobody tells you what the rules are&#8230;nobody tells you what the point of the game is&#8230;but&#8230;the guys seemed to figure it out [Laughter] and, I just, you know, I just didn&#8217;t want to push hard enough to figure out what it was, so my&#8230;reaction over my career has been&#8212;okay, I&#8217;m going to do something else. And then I get this [21:37] this game going on&#8230;what it&#8217;s supposed to be&#8230;okay, I&#8217;m going to do something else. And so when I got&#8212;found&#8212;the hooks for a AIEW that I found, um, was&#8230;they were funding, um, a Sex Discrimination In Higher Education&#8230;so they were fun, you know, mostly women, although, there were some men in Title Nine cases who would bring a court case&#8230;and say&#8230;&#8221;I have been treated terribly in my tenure review process&#8221; or, you know, &#8220;I was fired and a man that was less qualified was hired&#8221; &#8230;I mean, there were all kinds of cases, um, you know, and there&#8217;s actually a book&#8212;which I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve got an extra copy&#8212;but it&#8217;s available for download; Tenure Denied. You know, cases of women who just didn&#8217;t get tenure, um, and they would&#8212;and they would start&#8212;it started in New York, um, small, small group of women collected up, you know, saw this case in their local university&#8230;started collecting money for filing fees, you know, some of the expenses, the taste, I mean they couldn&#8217;t raise enough money to actually hire the law firm that would go&#8230;go in and blast the other side out of the water, but they, you know, they provided the moral support&#8212; JF: Mmm-hmm. NS: --And, and so that was my first connection to AIEW is donating to that, because I had left, you know, I just didn&#8217;t want to deal with it, but hearing these women who stick it out, and put their families through years of court cases, um, you know&#8230;seeing, I can&#8217;t do much&#8230;but&#8230;I can write a check&#8230;and so when I was, you know, still working&#8230;you know, kind of what I was&#8230;you know, the connection to AIEW was a donor as much as anything. So that was, um&#8230; JF: I really like that description of&#8212;that, that it&#8217;s a game&#8230;[laughter]&#8230;but nobody tells you the rules, and men&#8230;seem to just know them. You know, it&#8217;s a really good way&#8212; NS: And, you know, there was one explicit time when I was working for a private company in northern Virginia when we were living in Maryland&#8230;and for some reason I got into this meeting&#8212;I forget why&#8212;but, the president of the company and a couple of VPs were there, and&#8230;and it was&#8212;I mean&#8230;I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s my perception&#8230;I mean, they may have just been doing good management, or whatever, but, it was&#8212;there was something else going on in that room that had nothing to do with the good work the people under them were trying to, you know, the services the people under them were trying to provide to the clients&#8230;I mean it was&#8230;something else was&#8230;was going on&#8230;and I just wasn&#8217;t interested. And then, you know, my last job I worked&#8212;you know, I was working for a woman who had figured it out&#8230;and she was playing that game&#8230;and&#8230;and, again, the work we were doing&#8230;just, you know, my memory, my perceptions could be completely wrong, but it was just [pause]&#8230;she was out, and, and, there&#8217;s nothing in inherently wrong when she was out&#8230;to maximize her income, and her status, and, you know, where she was going. But somehow it didn&#8217;t jibe with helping the rest of us provide the good services to the&#8230;uh&#8230;to the clients&#8230;so I was, I don&#8217;t know&#8230;I mean, there&#8217;s no doubt there&#8217;s a real twist in my memory there, but it was&#8212;and we just couldn&#8217;t, you know, and I don&#8217;t&#8230;and, weather the fact that she&#8217;s a woman made it&#8230;harder to deal with&#8230;[pause] I don&#8217;t know. And then I mean, [26:02] with the other women, did we talk about it, about her that way? I...[pause]&#8230;[sighs]&#8230;you know, some&#8230;I don&#8217;t know&#8230;and in the management in general [pause] didn&#8217;t seem as overtly, you know, [26:27] as one, you know, we&#8217;re in charge, and they hadn&#8217;t hired this women into her&#8230;.you know, senior VP position. But it was, uh, just&#8230;I don&#8217;t know. JF: Was it almost like the males&#8212;the men&#8212;had sort of an implicit authority in a sort of&#8212;an assumption of authority, and the woman had this very&#8230;visible, explicit demonstration of her authority. NS: You know&#8212;I mean, she seemed prepared to fight, to show she was&#8230;a group, you know, and could do things&#8230;that&#8230;they didn&#8217;t have to come across, it was just&#8230;you know, so hard&#8230;and you know, I&#8217;m not sure, I certainly haven&#8217;t managed my career well, but it was, um,--because you know I just walked out of that job&#8230;and&#8230;thought I&#8217;d&#8212;I mean, there were a number of reasons I walked out, I mean, it was, you know, the family and there were things that were going on&#8230;just meant&#8230;so that was 2001, and I thought, well, you know, once all these other things settle down in six months I&#8217;ll go back to work&#8230;and at that time&#8212;I mean, the crash had come, there really weren&#8217;t any jobs, I found lots of my friends&#8212;you know, I walked out without a package, for my friends who stayed two or three months later, and, you know, longer&#8230;got placement counsuling and that kind of stuff. But&#8230;um&#8230;people were spending forty hours a week looking for jobs and finding none, no jobs. I mean, I&#8217;m not sure how much worse it is now, but, you know, I can&#8217;t&#8230;um&#8230;but, it was&#8212;so I just started, um&#8230;you know, got involved in NC Women United during the website then decided, okay, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. So, I&#8217;ll hang up my shingle and do small websites for non-profits&#8230;and the business plan never really knew&#8230;written, but it never really had any&#8230;reality to it. And I&#8217;ve been, so&#8212;doing websites along the way, and, you know, a couple of paid clients, a few, you know, over the years. Clients that payed me&#8230;.but it&#8217;s been mostly pro-bono, and, uh, you know, I had been doing the AIEW and carrying on the website so, you know&#8230;it&#8217;s nice&#8230;you know, a Raleigh website had been doing AIEW websites since, what, &#8217;95&#8230;&#8217;94&#8230;&#8217;95, whatever it is&#8230;um, and so I kind of segwayed into NC Women United, and then other things. But then, you know, doing the websites that I&#8230;where I&#8217;m involved in the organization, it&#8217;s a whole lot easier to make up the content. But then, you know, some of the other organizations would have to [29:28] them for content. It&#8217;s probably about time to shut down the paid work and go do something else, and it&#8217;s&#8230;you know, still learning stuff, and, being involved in non-profit technology organization here in the triangle. You know, maybe I&#8217;m thinking of doing more of that over the next year, and then we&#8217;ll see where it goes. But, AIEW is getting a little frustrated, but, um&#8230;okay, so NC Women United is where I spent a lot of time as the AIEW representative to the Coalition, and that&#8217;s probably where&#8230;.the deepest feminist learning has taken on, but my role has been&#8230;kind of the person who keeps the lights on&#8230;you know, it&#8217;s kind of a&#8212;I got involved at the end of 2001, there was some major project..um&#8230;starting up in 2002&#8230;and&#8230;the way&#8212;it&#8217;s a biannual project, so the way it was done in 2000&#8230;was with a staff non-profit NC Equity, I don&#8217;t know, Becky may have mentioned them, you know, it may have come up in your &#8230;you know, talking to people--- JF: Mmm-hmm. NS: I&#8217;m not sure how long they were around, but they were funded by [30:58] Reynolds&#8230;he did work on, um [pause] you know, women&#8217;s issues&#8230;and, they ran the Women&#8217;s Agenda Assemblies&#8230;that&#8230;Becky was very much involved in, um, [pause] you know&#8230;champion in Alamance County&#8230;and&#8212;but they lost their funding. So they essentially folded over the winter of 2001-2002, and the group of volunteers that had developed the project and handed it off to them to run, got back together and said&#8212;can&#8217;t let this die. And, so, my head, like, if it&#8217;s going to be a living thing, it needs a website, and,, you know, I&#8217;m not sure that was the case&#8230;you know, the website, the mailing list&#8212;how do you get a statewide group together with no money and no office [laughter] you know, no support. So, a lot of the last, you know, ten-plus years now, you know, has been keeping that group together&#8230;and it was probably 2004, maybe 2006, um, [32:17], um, maybe if you&#8217;re looking for another name, is, um, president of North Carolina Now, um, and I think she&#8217;s probably&#8212;I mean she&#8217;s done that for the last four years I think and I think she&#8217;s president for life of Raleigh Now&#8230;but you know, that a whole&#8230;she brought Kim Gandy to one of the agenda assembly planning meetings, and&#8230;and Kim was saying, you know, a lot of other&#8230;the volunteer group that had developed projects and handed it off had grown, and grown from the women, a group of women who&#8230;um&#8230;tried and failed to get the ERA passed. JF: Um-hmm. NS: And, there were many of these groups across the country, you know, typically known to something like women&#8217;s legislative agenda, you know, who would&#8212;you know, a coalition would get together what&#8217;s important, let&#8217;s write it down and lets tell the legislature what&#8217;s important. Um, she&#8212;as far as Kim knew we were the last ones left. You know they just&#8212;and I don&#8217;t&#8212;I think there&#8217;s&#8212;I think the Florida group is still working&#8230;I think Maine has a good Women&#8217;s&#8212;I think Minnesota, Montana&#8212;but they&#8217;re much smaller coalitions, and I&#8217;m not sure&#8212;but this keeping NC Women United together, all volunteer, is tough, you know? JF: Um-hmm. NS: Uh, we don&#8217;t want to do fundraising that competes with our other organizations, um, we live on&#8230;dues, I mean&#8230;we only spend five thousand bucks a year&#8230;or something like that&#8230;and so&#8212; JF: A shoestring budget. NS: Yep. [Laughter] Um, so it&#8217;s, you know&#8230;what could we do&#8230;we have applied for a couple of grants over the years, but we haven&#8217;t gotten any&#8230;I think the last one was&#8212;and, and you know, our programs are shrinking&#8230;you know, I don&#8217;t think we had very many agenda assemblies this year, and, and this whole notion of non-partisan, issue-oriented 501C3, um, organizing, is, in this climate, is just&#8230;really hard. You know, and then, there was another coalition that started in the last year, um, one of the member organizations of NC Women&#8217;s United&#8230;had a couple of their people get together and say &#8220;Well we need&#8230;.we have to increase the percentage of women who are voting.&#8221; You know, you have to&#8212;and that&#8217;s, um&#8230; [Pause]&#8230; and so they pulled that together, and&#8212;as a coalition, it was probably fifty to sixty percent overlap members of the coalition with the Women&#8217;s United, they did bring in, um, North Carolina Association of Educators, they did bring in some other, um, you know, grassroots, organizing unifor, I&#8217;m not quite sure who they are or what they do, but, um&#8230;they brought them in&#8230;and I think they did a credible job, now it&#8217;s a question of, do we need one more coalition&#8212; how, whose&#8230;where&#8217;s the fundraising going to come from that? And so there is this&#8212;I mean, I can&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s what you want to hear, but the whole litany of what are the organizations working on&#8230;on these issues&#8230;are they funded, how are they funded, um&#8230;you know, how&#8230;you know, Lillian&#8217;s List has been, you know, the North Carolina version of Emily&#8217;s List, you know, working on electing Democratic, pro-choice women&#8230;um, they were focused on the legislature less this election cycle&#8230;they did include the counsel, the state&#8230;they would have included the governor but&#8230;[Laughter] Ah yes, and&#8230;um&#8212;but they&#8217;re starting&#8212;I don&#8217;t know weather they&#8217;re starting&#8212; see they&#8217;ve been a pack, clearly partisan&#8212; JF: Um-hmm NS: But they&#8217;re starting a 501C4, maybe even a 501C3 as well, um, to do&#8230;not the grassroots stuff that NC Women&#8217;s United tries to do, and the NC Women&#8217;s Matters that the &#8216;get-out-the-boat&#8217; coalition tries to do, but at least developing, you know, being the think tank- JF: Umm-hmm. NS: -producing&#8230;women-focused issue papers&#8230;um&#8230;and I&#8217;m, you know, that may be, you know, where&#8217;s the overlap with the Justice Center, where&#8217;s the overlap with Democracy North Carolina, you know, what are the other organizations, but I mean, I think there was a sense that there&#8217;s a need&#8230;to focus on women&#8230;still. I mean, the issue hasn&#8217;t gone away. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: Um, you know, the [37:49], the, you know, reproductive rights&#8230;are&#8230;you know&#8230;are&#8212;and a litany of other issues, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of, you know, what&#8212;to holding, you know, there are some signs, that, if I fell of the planet tomorrow, NC Women United could&#8230;hold things together. There&#8217;s a couple of other people who are learning this Bisantine structure that I&#8217;ve set up&#8230;know how to add people to the mailing list, to let everyone&#8212;I mean, the one weak point is still our database, and we&#8217;ve got to&#8212;I mean, we don&#8217;t have&#8212;it&#8217;s not that many supporters, but it&#8217;s&#8230;how do you reach out to them, you know, how do you keep track of who your supporters are, um, you know, do you&#8212;I mean, we haven&#8217;t sent out a newsletter in a year, just, you know, kind of&#8212;it&#8217;s just the things that drop off the plate while people are&#8212;you know, um, I was out of town for the week around our Advocacy Day, so Laura Leslie from WRAL shows up at our&#8212;not our Advocacy Day, but our release of report cards day, you know, we do a report card on the long session that we release the following April, and I was out of town, and so Laura Leslie has us on the news, but the report card isn&#8217;t on the website. And I think we&#8217;ve&#8230;we&#8217;ve shifted, we&#8217;ve finally upgraded our websites, so it&#8217;s a&#8212;one that other people can post to, and I don&#8217;t know, there was something that should have gone up ten days ago that went up yesterday, and I was just dragging my feet, but somebody actually&#8230;somebody else actually did it! [Laughter] So this is&#8212; JF: Hope Springs! NS: Hope Springs, and it&#8217;s&#8230;it&#8217;s&#8212;she couldn&#8217;t take it quite all the way, because I hadn&#8217;t given her the authority yet, you know, to take it all the way, but I think, you know, I think it&#8217;s a&#8212;you know, how do you put this whole communication strategy to things that a staff&#8212;non-profit&#8212;spend a fair amount of time thinking about. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: You know, how do&#8212;and you need it in fifteen minutes here, and twenty minutes there, and there&#8217;s, you know, and we&#8217;ve been, you know, back and forth&#8230;do we hire an executive director, and make her responsible for raising her salary, or, I don&#8217;t know&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what the answer is, but we&#8217;re, sort of not&#8212;I mean, the good thing, I mean, something I really do want to mention about NC Women&#8217;s United&#8212;I walked into that meeting in, uh, 2001-2002, I was pulled into it by women&#8230;um&#8230;older than I was, you know, they weren&#8217;t all my mother&#8217;s age, but, some of them were, some of them were that old, you know, and some of them&#8212;most were a little older, you know, so...I was fifty-one at that point, um, and most of them were over sixty. So it was&#8230;there were a couple of people younger than I was at the table, but it was certainly&#8230;the bulk of the folks were people that had been doing this work for a long time, had been that ERA, roots on the ground&#8230;and&#8230;it has shifted. I mean, NC Women United is now run by women in their thirties and forties, you know, some members in their twenties on the board, so it really did&#8212;and that was, you know, a couple of, um, you know, the first three&#8230;you know, all the presidents have been younger than I, and uh, and it&#8217;s been uh, interesting shift, to see that there are, uh, young women, willing to do that&#8230;that work. JF: That raises a lot of interesting questions. NS: Yeah. JF: Do you think that shift was sort of a consequence of&#8230;time? That women were getting older, and had to, for various reasons&#8212; NS: Yeah. JF: --had to give up certain activities? Or more of a deliberate change? NS: Well, I think there was some&#8230;recruiting, you know, but I, I think it was&#8212;you know, again, Kim Gandy saying that the other states fell apart, there was something about the way we did it, that allowed the young women to come in, get that critical mass again&#8230;they weren&#8217;t the token, they weren&#8217;t the only ones there&#8212;and be able to say yes, and they were supported, and, you know, the women who had been at the table&#8230;were willing to back away. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: Where I&#8217;m not sure that was the case everywhere else. JF: Umm-hmm. Do you feel there was a good, like, transfer of experiential knowledge between generations? Because when you were talking about this incredibly conservative, difficult climate right now, I was just thinking of quickly the ERA sailed through Congress, and then hit a wall of resistance. So are there&#8212;is there a transfer of that kind of historical memory and knowledge? NS: I, I mean, [Pause] that&#8217;s an interesting question. I don&#8217;t&#8230;I mean there are some&#8230;I think some people have found their own individual mentors, and some people have, you know, I wasn&#8217;t really&#8230;you know, I&#8217;m sort of in-between, um&#8230; JF: In-between the&#8230;? NS: In-between the ERA folks and the new ones, so I don&#8217;t , you know, and I haven&#8217;t really, you know, just like there weren&#8217;t computer science classes, I don&#8217;t remember their were women&#8217;s studies classes that I could have signed up for, but, um, so&#8230;so some of the younger women had that academic, you know, background, where they could have taken the time, as part of&#8230;whatever else college is supposed to do for you&#8230;to learn that history. JF: Uh-huh. ND: And I think that you know, a fair number&#8212;you know, we haven&#8217;t actually done the survey, you know, what do you know about these things&#8212; JF: Uh-huh. NS: Um, but I&#8212;I, you know, I&#8217;m not sure, you know, leadership is hard, you know, it&#8217;s certainly not a skill I&#8217;ve got, but its interesting to see the one person whose get out the boat coalition&#8212;I mean, you know, she came in, and she knew, okay, you got to, you know&#8230;pull people together and be able to know, you know, we&#8217;re not going to get this scoop creep to other things and I mean yeah, and you know, I mean, I think a lot of us had felt, oh, I could follow her to&#8230;wherever. But uh, I&#8217;m not&#8212;and NC Women&#8217;s United,; it has been such a loose collection, that it&#8217;s been hard&#8230;you know we try, but I&#8217;m not sure we have anyone really strong to know&#8212;well, that&#8217;s not the case, Allison Kesier did a good job, you know, board orientation, yow know, kind of a, the folks with the social work background, and, you know&#8230;but we&#8217;re not [Pause] There&#8217;s a&#8212;I guess what I&#8217;m trying to express to you&#8212;probably [46:01]&#8230;there&#8217;s some organizational problems with NC Women&#8217;s United. I&#8217;m not sure how it&#8217;s going to be surviving, but you know it, it&#8212;and the things like when we applied for the Z. Smith Reynolds Grant we said that we need some money to do a better job to the agenda assembly, linked with your small groups, meeting around the state to discuss this, you know, series of position papers, or whatever they wanted to discuss, we hand them the position papers and say okay, you can talk about these or you can talk about whatever you want to talk about&#8230;that&#8217;s issues effecting women, and&#8230;you know, the CSR service said, well, what do you learn? How do you track it? And we just&#8230;we just don&#8217;t get&#8212;I mean, there&#8217;s nobody sitting in the office, making the phone calls and&#8230;we haven&#8217;t seen your final report yet. You know, it&#8217;s that kind of stuff, you know, we got it out there, let them deal with it&#8212;and we just&#8212;even this year, very soon after we&#8217;ve had that feedback from CSR&#8230;we had the surveys online, you know, because what&#8217;s in the past has happened, some people sent in paper, and God knows where they got lost in somebody&#8217;s office&#8230;so the surveys are online now, but no one is filling them out, and, and I&#8217;m as guilty as them, you know, I haven&#8217;t gotten&#8212;I sent out the attendees at the Wake Forest Assembly, I sent out the Tell Us What You Thought, about the survey, but I got&#8212;okay, I didn&#8217;t go back, and I think it&#8217;s a reminder of the people who didn&#8217;t respond, you know, and it&#8217;s that kind of stuff, and I just&#8212;you know, collecting that data, analyzing it, and you know, what is it we&#8217;re really learning, is it going to effect what we got to the legislature with, and&#8230;Women&#8217;s Advocacy Day&#8230;I mean we&#8217;re planning a Women&#8217;s Advocacy Day, but how do we get the bills, and, and&#8212;and that was, and that was going to be [48:09]. We made some&#8212;I mean, that was our goal, just two years ago, just to make some noise and I think we got really better lead here, you know it had the bigger&#8230;bigger group than we had. And it&#8217;s&#8230;you know I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to do with this legislature, but&#8230;we&#8217;ll see. But...anyway&#8230; Ivanna Gonzalez: So I&#8217;m kind of interested in, the uh&#8230;American Association of University Women. NS: American Association of University Women. IG: Yes. I&#8217;ve heard it come up a couple of times and one of the things that I stumbled upon while doing some background research was a&#8230;a word-press site that I think is maintained by [48:57]&#8230;I may be wrong, but it is a push to get the AIEW to open it&#8217;s membership, to people&#8212; NS: Oh yeah, open up to AIEW, yeah, yeah. [Laughter] IG: Can you tell me a little bit about that? NS: Uh, yeah. Okay so I joined AIEW in 1995&#8230;94&#8230;I don&#8217;t know, &#8217;94 I guess, in Starkville, Mississippi&#8230;and, about that time&#8212;and the AIEW was founded by&#8230;Women College Graduates and has, in the charter, was wording that said, you know, fellowship of women and college graduates, or something like that, and&#8230;we shifted&#8230;well, in sort of the late &#8216;90s, there was some discussion of, does this still make sense? I mean, the&#8212;and you know, some people&#8212;and I went to my first National Convention in &#8217;99, and where the question was on, you know, to be voted on. It&#8217;s a change to the bi-laws. It&#8217;s to say&#8230;this doesn&#8217;t make sense. And, and I was&#8212;and I went , thinking, well, I mean&#8230;I forget what the mission was&#8230;I think equity and education for women and girls, lifelong learning, and positive social change, which was, pretty big, but, you know, we all knew what&#8212;I think they at one of the previous conventions actually tried to say what they meant with a positive societal change, and everybody just sort of&#8212;we know what we need, we don&#8217;t need to&#8212;[Laughter] JF: It&#8217;s like the old quote about pornography, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to describe it, but I know what it is when I see it&#8221;. NS: [Laughter] Yes, so that was the same. Um, so it was&#8212;you know, and I looked&#8212;I joined&#8230;I joined, um, partly the legal advocacy fund that I talked about, but I was actually joining a branch that was doing a project that was doing a career day in the [51:18] County Schools, and it was, you know, we&#8217;re trying to get&#8212;you know, it was a [51:23] school system&#8230;in Mississippi, and the [51:27] County Schools were&#8230;pretty awful. The Starkville City schools were&#8230;not so bad, but the county surrounding Starkville was&#8230;was pretty awful. So we had&#8212;and it was, you know, AIEW was the one immigrated organization that I saw there. I mean, the guidance counselor from the county school was one of the um...you know, leadership in the AIEW branch, so she took the whole branch and said we&#8217;re going to do a career day in the county in the county schools so the county school kids can see that there are other jobs that they might have, and, you know, and so we worked on that. So that was&#8230;you know&#8212;and this is what I see, you know, AIEW&#8230;okay, you don&#8217;t need a college degree to help with us&#8230;you don&#8217;t need a college degree to&#8230;and it just really didn&#8217;t seem to make sense, and, you know, big problems and small resources&#8230;let&#8217;s all work together. And so the &#8217;99 convention we also released a report that was, um&#8230;talked about how women go to college&#8230;I mean you know, they go home&#8212;they stay home, they go to school, they go to work, and so, you know, it&#8217;s this cycle through this&#8212;and it can take years to get a degree. And we just had&#8212;I was in Raleigh by that time&#8212;and we had just had an example where, a young woman of the Meredith Over Twenty Three program&#8230;um, working on her bachelor&#8217;s degree, and join the branch as student affiliate, which now all UNC undergraduates can join {53:05] students for free, because&#8230;that&#8217;s another whole story&#8230;but she just joined, paid her seventeen dollars, and then the next year&#8212;and her husband&#8212;it was her husband&#8217;s turn to go to school, and she went to work. She didn&#8217;t have a degree, she wasn&#8217;t in school, and according to the AIEW by-law there is no way to&#8230;connect her. This is kind of dumb. We should have just&#8230;I mean, we should have just connected her&#8230;and not&#8212;and there are branches that&#8230;just&#8212;this is dumb&#8230;years ago, and just take people&#8217;s money, but, um&#8230;and then the&#8212;and then so the vote&#8212;so there was a speaker, talking about something else, but, you know, talking about&#8230;if you&#8217;re going to solve a problem, you need the right people at the table. So we release this research report, talking about the difficulties women have getting through school&#8230;we say we&#8217;re, you know, in favor of education for women, but we&#8217;re not bringing the women who were affected&#8230;into the&#8230;into the fold. And&#8230;and, so I even quoted the speaker and used that line in different context. And I&#8230;I stood up in front of a thousand people and I spoke at the convention, but&#8230;we went down in flames because people&#8212;in the charter, it&#8217;s just says&#8230;we&#8217;re about&#8230;Fellowship for University Women. And, and it&#8217;s crazy, you say you&#8217;re AIEW and people ask&#8212;you say you&#8217;re in&#8212;if you say you&#8217;re in the AIEW people ask well, what in the world is that, and it&#8217;s the American Association of the University of Women&#8230;and we tried for a couple of years to stop saying the words&#8230;but that didn&#8217;t go anywhere. Because we&#8230;we admit men, so, you know, it&#8217;s kind of&#8230;the wind, but, I mean, people were&#8212;they just&#8230;go crazy when you talk about dropping the degree requirement. You know, even though we changed the&#8212;so in 2009 we did a complete re-vamp of the bi-laws, because, I mean, you know, there were just all sorts of organizational issues. And we took that wording out, you know, the purpose was for, um, the fellowship of college grads&#8212;the fellowship of woman college graduates&#8212;so that wording is gone, and at the same time the proposal that went to the membership for a vote&#8212;took out the degree requirement. But on the floor of the convention people put back in&#8212; JF: Really? NS: The, uh&#8212;I mean, there were all kinds of people who showed up at that convention just to vote against taking the degree requirement out of the requirements. 2005 we had&#8212;and that was [55:55]&#8212;2005 we pre-laxed it to an associate degree&#8230;and, that was kind of sad, because&#8230;I mean, there were two proposals, one to drop it entirely and one to move to an associate degree. And, the drop it entirely was brought up first, voted down, because it made it&#8212;it got a majority, but didn&#8217;t get the two-thirds&#8212;and the associate degree was brought up second. And the associate degree passed because this fifty-year-old member who couldn&#8217;t get out of her seat&#8212;I mean, they had to take the microphone to her&#8212;made this impassioned short statement about&#8230;our&#8212;do we care about&#8230;equity for women or do we care about showing off that we&#8217;ve got degrees? [Laughter] You know, it&#8217;s kind of&#8212;so I was part of&#8212;there was a&#8212;you know, &#8217;99 it was on the agenda, 2001 I don&#8217;t think it was, and that was when I had my&#8230;my meltdown at convention&#8230;um, about the&#8230;information technology&#8230;the info structure at the association was just&#8230;so bad&#8230;I mean, branches couldn&#8217;t figure out who was on their payroll, who was doing this, who was paying dues, who was on the honor roll&#8230;I mean, it was just&#8212;it was 2001, I was hoping there was going to be a dot-com, you know, escapee millionaire woman out there who was just going too write a check and solve the problem, and, you know, that didn&#8217;t work. But, um, you know, I spent about an hour today fighting over the same problem, you know, board members telling me&#8212;oh, just put it on the agenda for the February meeting&#8212;but, whatever, it&#8217;s better than it was, you know, in 2001. But that&#8217;s just&#8212;anyway, it was 2001, and the degree requirement was&#8212;and in 2003, a group from Maine came down and said look, women&#8217;s organizations are not like what they were, you know, we are not, you know, the Robert Putnam Bowling alone, you know, all of the grafts going south, um, you know, AIEW does have their&#8212;not more women who are eligible, but&#8212;a lot of these towns, you know, in rural states, if you&#8217;ve got any&#8212;you know, the chances of having more than one women&#8217;s organization&#8230;it&#8217;s really small, so we need to be able to have everyone join us, because we&#8217;re the only game in town. So, that was the Maine, the Ohio, the Idaho, the Montana&#8230;argument, but&#8230;voted down. 2005, we actually pulled the Maine, the Montana, the Idaho people back together and Nancy and I&#8212;you know, I can start an email list&#8212;oh, well I can start a website&#8230;you know, kind of pulled stuff&#8212;you know, we got a little bit better, people&#8212;we had buttons, we had flyers&#8230;um, but yeah&#8230;and we got the two-year degree pass. 2007&#8230;I don&#8217;t think we brought it up again. 2009 was the major bi-laws change and people were just&#8230;they were upset about&#8212;they were changing the size of the board, they were changing about who was getting elected, I mean, they were just&#8212;they just, they showed up angry, and it&#8217;s&#8212;it&#8217;s really, for some people, that&#8217;s what it is. It&#8217;s the college women&#8217;s club. It&#8217;s the, you know, it&#8217;s the&#8212;and I had the daughter of one of my, you know, AIEW friends show up, and I mean she&#8212;she&#8217;s just one of these people who loves to argue for the sake of argument, I think, but she was&#8212;oh, well what AIEW branches do, is, you know, raise money for scholarships, therefore, all AIEW members must be college graduates, otherwise&#8230;you&#8217;re not setting a good example for these people that you&#8217;re giving scholarships to. And I just said, well, I&#8217;ve never been in a branch that raises money for scholarships, you know, we all just&#8230;you know, national organizations provide funding for graduate student women who&#8212;where you can write check there, or to the Legal Advocacy Fund, or, since that massive thing in 2009, there&#8217;s now 501C3, there&#8217;s&#8212;it does public policy, advocacy, there&#8217;s a separate 501C4, but, you know, spent half a million dollars trying to get out of the millennia vote this year&#8212;I mean, there are lots of things to give money to&#8212; JF: Umm-hmm. NS: Um, you know, raising money for high school&#8212;raising money for scholarships for either returning women, or high school students&#8212;I mean, it&#8217;s a good thing to do, but it doesn&#8217;t define anyone for the AIEW for me. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: I mean, it&#8217;s the equity for women&#8212;I mean, I just, pour&#8212;I mean, we elect our board, we don&#8217;t&#8230;[Pause] And I mean, for me, you know, we&#8217;re crazy people, so we elect some crazy people, but I mean, you know&#8212;and they can&#8212;and I&#8212;I mean, we hire strategically planned consultants who just take us off the weeds, but, so, our mission now is just equity for women and girls, you know, advocacy, education, philanthropy, and research. And, well, equity&#8212;and, well, I keep&#8212;okay, equity for women and girls, fine. But do we have to put tactics in there? I mean what&#8217;s-- [Laughter] you know? You know it&#8217;s kind of&#8212;and there was this big fight about&#8212;I mean, it was equity for women and girls, with advocacy, education, and research. And I had this whole presentation when I was state president and I had this whole&#8212;okay, equity for women because we got rid of lifelong learning&#8230;that was um&#8230;you know, that&#8217;s a done deal now. Everybody understands that. We don&#8217;t have to fight for that anymore. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: Um, and we got rid of the positive societal change, and sort of just morphed it into equity for women and girls&#8230;um, because, you know, that&#8212;a positive societal change&#8212;that affects equity for women and girls. Um, and we support that, with, you know, advocacy, education, and research, which, you know in&#8212;but people say no, we have to put in the philanthropy back in there because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re known for is giving out fellowships. And I was&#8230;you know, whatever, they won. So&#8212;[Laughter} But, it&#8217;s a&#8212;yeah, they do the&#8230;um&#8230;it&#8217;s a&#8230;[Pause] So I&#8217;m now this&#8212;I mean there&#8217;s the up-and-up AIEW website, and it&#8217;s pretty much&#8230;there&#8217;s not much been happening&#8230;since 2009&#8212;or 2011, when it went, um&#8212;when it didn&#8217;t&#8212;it wasn&#8217;t on the ballot, but we did kind of tell people, you know, we&#8217;re still here! We haven&#8217;t gone away! And it&#8217;s&#8230;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;d going to be on the ballot on 2013, partly because we&#8217;ve gone one member one vote, which means they send the ballots out to everybody. It used to be that, if you showed up at a convention, and if your branch gave you a vote, then you had a vote. But, it&#8217;s a&#8212;and the branches had limited numbers of votes to give away, but it was&#8230;I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know. 2015 maybe. But, I&#8217;m not sure. But it&#8217;s&#8212;there&#8217;s still a lot of&#8230;hubbub. I mean, that&#8217;s the kind of thing were somebody&#8212;why do I stick around? [Laughter] I mean if&#8212;so they&#8217;re&#8212;but it&#8217;s, um, yeah&#8230;so that&#8217;s a&#8230;yeah, like I say, I can go off on tangents, but it&#8217;s, I mean I think it&#8217;s AIEW, Equity for Women and Girls, we&#8217;re the strongest women&#8217;s organization. You know, folks don&#8217;t know&#8212; legal women voters&#8230;are&#8230;it sounds like they&#8217;re surviving. You know, I talked to somebody yesterday who says most&#8212;you know, almost all of the local leagues in North Carolina are growing, which is not the case for the AIEW branches. Business and professional women, they went through they&#8217;re&#8230;hoo-hah&#8230;.I mean, it took AIEW three or four years to&#8212;okay, lets plan this, lets talk about it, lets figure it out, and then in that 2009 merger of the 5O1C3 and 5O1C4, and the shifting the membership base&#8230;from the 5O1C4&#8230;into the 5O1C3. So, we pay our dues to the 5O1C3, you know. JF: Uh-huh. NS: And, in doing away with the two big boards, you know, electing the two big boards&#8230;and&#8230;they did that, like in January, they&#8217;re&#8212;the states presidents were told&#8212;we&#8217;re going to do this in June&#8230;[Laughter[ So, you figure it out, so they&#8217;re now collecting&#8212;and they&#8217;re&#8230;not in good shape. NOW has&#8230;a big mailing list, but I don&#8217;t&#8212;you know, I&#8217;ve been a member for several years, but I don&#8217;t get the sense that they&#8217;re a healthy organization. Um, you know, I&#8217;m not sure how much AIEW still has a staff&#8230;you know, they&#8217;re still doing lobbying, they&#8217;ve got a, um, lobby core that goes to the hill&#8230;they&#8217;re&#8230;rolling out a&#8230;um&#8230;a search engine for all of the state legislature sites that will kick out lists of bills that relate to women&#8217;s issues. You know, key words from the public policy program, and they expect to follow that with a&#8212;write to your legislature&#8230;application sometime next year&#8230;which is, you know, something we haven&#8217;t had&#8230;.I mean, NC Women&#8217;s United, around Advocacy Day, will often have a write to your legislature campaign for people who can&#8217;t make it to Raleigh for Advocacy Day, but we picked to piggyback that on say, Planned Parenthoods&#8230;you know, and we never get around to get the names back, of the&#8212; JF: Oh. NS: You know, you know, who actually took action, or whatever, and that&#8217;s Planned Parenthood&#8217;s day now&#8212; JF: Umm-hmm. NS: So, you know, have AIEW to have that kind of feature, you know, talking to the national organization&#8212;how can we share that, you know, because we don&#8217;t&#8212;we don&#8217;t&#8212;within AIEW you just do not have the strong&#8230;advocates, that can&#8230;you know, there may be two or three, but it&#8217;s&#8230;you know, we have to depend on folks from the Justice Center, or folks from the, you know, this new Lillian&#8217;s List piece, or whatever, to partner with us, to say&#8212;if we&#8217;re going to send a write to your legislature, you know&#8212;on what? We need to figure out what&#8217;s really important, even if we have&#8212;I mean, somehow, the automatic spider of the legislature sites&#8230; JF: Yeah, people would be writing all day and all night, if it was just everything! NS: Yeah, and it&#8212;how do you&#8212;[Laughter] And&#8230;yeah, I mean&#8230;so, I mean, it&#8217;s going to be&#8212;so that&#8217;s why, I mean, NC Women United has been so important, because, you know, it&#8217;s a filter, it gives us a local information&#8230;for AIEW. And then the other&#8212;the piece that I&#8217;ve been doing for AIEW for the past three or four years, has been this statewide virtual branch&#8230;which is&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to go to another meeting, you know? [Laughter] I mean it&#8217;s just&#8212;and I&#8217;ll, you know, if I have to go out to two or three professional meetings a month, and you know, I mean, you saw&#8212;we&#8217;re kind of&#8212;we&#8217;re not that far Raleigh, I mean, we can get to Memorial Auditorium in fifteen minutes but, you know, it&#8217;s still&#8230;you know, Wake County&#8217;s pretty big, and trying to pull people in&#8230;and, um, the Raleigh branch has been limping along with seven or eight people showing up at meetings, and for seven or eight people, who are you going to invite to come to a meeting? And this whole monthly meeting, but there&#8217;s this mindset&#8230;of&#8230;AIEW&#8230;[Pause]&#8230;is, you know, we have monthly meetings with speakers&#8230;and it&#8217;s just&#8230;I mean, the continuing education from the campuses here&#8212;if you want to hear a talk you can find something there, I mean it&#8217;s&#8212;take a class, do&#8230; do&#8230;whatever, but&#8230;um&#8230;so, the virtual brain branch&#8212;we&#8217;re all across the state, so you don&#8217;t have to go to meetings. I mean we say we get together once a year and at the state meeting, and, frankly, for the last six months, we haven&#8217;t done much of anything. You know, because I&#8217;m the president, and there&#8217;s been so much, I mean, just&#8230;assuming everybody else has been tied up with this crazy election, and&#8212;you know, we send out little notes about what&#8217;s going on, but it&#8217;s just been the mailing list, you know? And it&#8217;s a mailing list, it&#8217;s a Facebook group, and it&#8217;s a website. And&#8230;we add people to the mailing list when they join, but&#8230;um, if they&#8212;you know, we send them another little note, saying, you know, these are all the resources that you have available, and then they get information from the national organization, and they get a couple of issues of the state&#8217;s newsletter, but, you know&#8230;we&#8212;if they don&#8217;t see the benefit of that, we&#8217;re&#8230;you know, it&#8217;s just a baseline connection to the feminist conversation, is what I&#8217;m saying. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: You know, because it&#8217;s for people who don&#8217;t have other connections. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: And, it&#8217;s&#8212;we&#8217;re finding&#8230;that on&#8212;at Western Carolina, you know, there was a group there, that said, um, they signed the campus up as a campus member of, and then said, we want a group, you know, we want a branch here at Western Carolina, because I think the nearest branch was in Asheville, um, so, we want to have our own group here, we want to have an AIEW group, we want to use AIEW&#8217;s name, and they were sent a branch formation kit. And a busy faculty member looked at it and put it in her file&#8212;and the hoops she would have to jump through as far as where as with a statewide virtual branch, they can say, just have your people send their dues to us, we&#8217;ve got the PayPal set up, you know, we can put [!:10:56] on our rooster, and&#8230;they&#8217;re members. And then you can see them on the rooster, and you can, you know, if you want to use AIEW&#8217;s name in a campaign campus event; they&#8217;re members, so&#8230;you know, that&#8217;s great. And some&#8212;you know a lot of them dropped off, joining a year or so ago and didn&#8217;t renew their membership this fall, so I&#8217;m not exactly&#8212;we haven&#8217;t found the solution yet, but I mean looking at all the other virtual branches around the country and there are, you know, ten or eleven of them now, um, and they&#8217;re all&#8212;I can&#8217;t get this message of lightweight&#8212;you know, just, it&#8217;s a connection, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s not going to&#8212;we&#8217;re not doing a lot so you&#8217;re not going to feel guilty if you&#8217;re not doing a lot, you know&#8230;[Laughter]&#8230;It&#8217;s&#8212;they&#8217;re all trying to to be&#8212;to look&#8212;just like branches except they&#8217;re working in cyberspace. I mean I joined the New York one that just started&#8212;they&#8217;ve got like fourteen people on their board, they have monthly conference calls, they&#8217;d have fellows who call into the conference call to talk about their work, they have agendas, they have&#8212;I mean, they&#8217;re all&#8212;so I&#8217;ve been, part of what I&#8217;ve been doing is trying to sell this&#8212;people need a way to connect. I mean there are women out there&#8230;who&#8230;maybe I&#8217;m projecting...I mean, I know there are people who are not like me, but, you know, I didn&#8217;t really know&#8230;there was a way to connect. JF: You mean when you were in Mississippi&#8230;or&#8230; NS: Before that. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: So, you know, through my twenties and thirties, you know, when it might have been helpful to have an AIEW branch. The connection, when I was trying to go through that&#8212;this whole tenure thing, it just doesn&#8217;t make any sense. And there&#8217;s a branch in that town now, which was probably there, you know, when I was there, but I just didn&#8217;t have a way to connect to&#8230;that. So, you know, this women on campus&#8230;you know, women working in these environments, you know, I&#8217;ve found&#8212;you know, I mean, working in a male-dominated environment&#8212;it was good to find AIEW as a group of women in different&#8230;occupations, you know, and just have that&#8212;you know, I&#8217;m not going crazy, there are other people out there, who are experiencing these problems, and it&#8217;s somehow&#8230; different. I mean I know&#8230;Ms. has morphed over the year, the feminist majority, um&#8230;doesn&#8217;t talk about subscribing to Ms.,, they&#8217;re talking about joining. You know? JF: Hmmmm. [Laughter] NS: And I don&#8217;t&#8212;I&#8217;ve never really&#8230;I mean, to me, Ms. is a magazine that shows up, and I read it, and I enjoy reading the letters, but I don&#8217;t&#8230;I don&#8217;t think of it as a community. JF: Umm-hmm. NS: And when I&#8212;when NC Women United has tried to connect with the feminist majority votes, that hasn&#8217;t really worked all that well. So I don&#8217;t know quite what that is, but I think the benefit of&#8212;and again, going back&#8212;part of what&#8217;s made me stick it out with AIEW; is going back to Robert Putnam. And the, you know, the communities that have organizations like AIEW, or any of them, you know, other membership organizations committed to&#8230;making their communities better&#8230;those are healthier communities&#8230;than the ones that don&#8217;t. Um, and so I read that probably in 2002&#8230;or 2003&#8230;and, um, and if I hadn&#8217;t, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have&#8212;I would have just&#8212;this is nuts&#8212;and walked back into my life. And, um, you know, stayed&#8230;disconnected from, you know, NC Women United, and, um, anything else. And, I don&#8217;t know how I would have, you know, connected. And now when I go out and talk out statewide virtual branch, to get people connected, um, I use Putnam as a lean-in but I also talk about Clay Shirkey&#8217;s organizations, that&#8230;people don&#8217;t need AIEW anymore for a book group, you know, they don&#8217;t need it to raise a scholarship, I mean, it&#8217;s just&#8230;he world is so different that it just&#8212;go meet up, you know, whatever, to get that connection, but there&#8217;s still some value in the&#8212;in what they&#8217;re trying to do, and I&#8212; JF: When you were in your twenties and thirties, and&#8230;there&#8217;s pressure and&#8230;your work life and&#8212;the question was this worth it? Did having that connection to a feminist conversation or just an institutional space for women like you&#8230;did that help you develop&#8212;was that sort of like a support or a&#8230;? NS: I don&#8217;t remember that it was there. JF: Not at all? NS: I mean, I don&#8217;t&#8230;you know&#8230; JF: Did you have any kind of&#8230;connection to a feminist conversation? NS: Not really. JF: Or&#8230;sense of being in a&#8230; NS: I mean, RPI was&#8230;um&#8230;I don&#8217;t remember when it was [1:16:52]&#8230;in [1:16:53] there was there the&#8212;he was living in the graduate student&#8217;s women&#8217;s dorm&#8230;so there was a group&#8230;you know, a group of women, you know, in the dorm&#8212;it was a private &#8211;so there was a support group of women&#8230;there. Um&#8230;and I forget how I found out&#8212; I mean that was 1971 or 1972, and the law in Wisconsin was that doctors would not discuss contraception with unmarried people. And somehow, probably through that community, I found zero population growth where the doctor was willing to&#8230;you know, prescribe the pill. Um, I&#8212;but I don&#8217;t remember&#8230;. JF: What a catch-22. [Laughter] You need a prescription to get the pill but you&#8217;re not allowed to ask your doctor about the prescription if you&#8217;re not married. [Laughter] NS: Yeah, I mean it was just, um&#8212;so I mean, I&#8217;m sure there were other solutions, but it was just going to&#8212;you know. But that whole control of your reproductive rights, even though I&#8217;ve never been pregnant, you know, has been part of what feminism means to me. But, you know, it&#8217;s&#8212;so, from Wisconsin it&#8217;s New Jersey, and it was working for some women, um, you know, older women, you know, that probably weren&#8217;t quite as old as my mother. Um, but it was a very small group, and I don&#8217;t remember&#8212;I mean, that was more my husband&#8217;s environment, was, the, you know&#8230;I was a graduate student wife, as well as&#8230;working at the computer center. Um&#8230;Wisconsin to, you know, Albany&#8230;Troy&#8212;I don&#8217;t&#8230;I mean, RPI had been co-ed since forever, um, I mean, not forever, but for a long time. And&#8230;um&#8230;but there were still urinals in the&#8230;you know&#8230;.at the gym, in the women&#8217;s dressing room&#8230;in the gym. I mean it was still&#8212;you know, and I don&#8217;t remember&#8230;it was still&#8212;this was, what, &#8217;73 to&#8230;&#8217;77. And I don&#8217;t&#8230;I don&#8217;t remember&#8212;and that, that was, you know, I remember a sense of it was a male-dominated&#8230;environment. And it was&#8212;one year we were living out&#8230;the road past the fraternity house&#8230;in a small apartment. And I was catching the campus bus next door to the fraternity houses, and it was &#8211;so I was standing on the street corner, the, um&#8212;there were a couple of fraternity undergraduates there, on the street corner. Well, and the traffic kind of died down, and I heard&#8212;the two boys were looking at me, and I heard of them say, I don&#8217;t know. Must be sleeping with somebody in&#8230;whatever the other fraternity was. You know, it was kind of&#8212;there&#8217;s no reason for a women to be on campus unless she&#8217;s attached-- JF; Hmmmm. NS: --to one of the men. I stayed up late last night trying to figure out algebra to you guys. [Laughter] It was just&#8212;uh, I don&#8217;t know how I got through that class, but it was&#8212;[Laughter&#8212;so I don&#8217;t remember a support group and so from RPI&#8230;um&#8230;you know, taught a Suni, and that was where the dean kind of&#8230;you know, didn&#8217;t want to give me a raise. JF: Because&#8230;? NS: It was, you know&#8212;I was going to leave&#8212;and my title was visiting as a professor, so, I mean, there are some&#8212;you know, they hadn&#8217;t put me on the tenure track, I wasn&#8217;t in the business school, but I found out I was not only making less than everyone in the business scholars, I was also making less than everyone in the math department, so that was&#8212;so, I don&#8217;t know, I mean, maybe he knew I was going to leave, so I left. JF: But do you think that the assumption was because you were a women in your twenties&#8212;you were in your twenties? NS: Yeah&#8230;late twenties&#8230; JF: Clearly, you&#8217;re going to go have a baby soon, so, you know, why should we invest in you? NS: Yeah, you know, so it was&#8212;in Oakland, two years there, and it was just&#8212;again, I&#8217;m not the one who seems so gendered. At Oakland it was just, you know, it was a commuter school, it was struggling, they were trying to have a PhD program, and who wants a PhD from Oakland, you know? [Laughter] You know, I was kind of&#8212;it just bizarre, but it was&#8230;Oakland to Baltimore, Baltimore to Virginia, and the Western Langeley Research Center is an engineering center, um, and we were working for the, you know, a small, nonprofit research institute within the center so the government would fund it. But it was &#8211;you know, were getting TIA Creff benefits and stuff while we were there&#8212;um, that&#8230;that was the high point in my professional&#8212;you know, I went through training at [1:22:52] and, you know, helped with the overall shift from propriety operating systems to open-source in the research&#8230;you know, the environment&#8230;and, um, one of the engineers at NASA said Nancy has proved that learning [1:23:06] doesn&#8217;t turn you into an asshole. [Laughter] So, that was my, you know, kind of &#8211;I was able to adapt in that environment. And I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d seen mostly in my college, and, you know, high school&#8230;was&#8230;yeah, I can do well, and it doesn&#8217;t&#8212;there wasn&#8217;t that much gendered stuff&#8230;through there, and I, you know&#8230;.I don&#8217;t know, doesn&#8217;t make any sense. [1:23:34-1:23:38] IG: I was&#8212;it seems that your&#8212;I guess your bosses and supervisors, for example, had this expectation of, you know, what a woman in her early twenties was supposed to be doing, and what was going to come for your life now. NS: Yeah. IG: Where were you parents and what were their expectations for you while you were off&#8230;all over the country, and in so many states&#8230; NS: Um, they were still in Massachusetts, and it&#8217;s, um&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure they liked my first husband a whole lot, I don&#8217;t know&#8230;um&#8230;and that&#8230;I mean, that was&#8212;but there really&#8212;I guess there really wasn&#8217;t any push, you know, where are the grandchildren, where are the grandchildren. Um, my second husband, um, he really didn&#8217;t want children, he his sister is&#8212;his younger sister&#8212;the one who started, you know, with the grandchildren, shortly&#8212;you know, within a couple of years of when we got married, so that was, you know, sort of took the&#8212;so there really wasn&#8217;t any, uh, of that&#8230;&#8217;where are the kids&#8217; kind of pressure. And other than that it was kind of whatever, you know, what I wanted to do was fine, they were, um&#8212;you know, dad had been concerned about the cost of college, but scholarships made that work, pretty well, I think I did learn that they took a second mortgage on the house, at some point, but, you know, and, um, you know, my mother was here over Thanksgiving&#8230;she just turned ninety in September. So she&#8217;s, you know&#8212;and she&#8217;s not&#8212;she&#8217;s living with my sister and is helping out my sister as much as she&#8212;so the finances worked out in the end. Um, you know, it&#8217;s kind of&#8212;it&#8217;s been, you know&#8212;I think they were&#8230;.you know, dad has been gone for&#8230;.twenty-five years now, so it&#8217;s, um, it&#8217;s hard to&#8212;but it was always, you know, supportive, you know, again&#8212;you will go to college, and it was not &#8211;there wasn&#8217;t much&#8212;wasn&#8217;t a whole lot of discussion about&#8230;different things. And I (felon?) to math and was good at it, and enjoyed doing it, and, you know, computer science would have made more sense but&#8230;it just wasn&#8217;t there. So I was, um&#8212;you know, I fake it a lot now. [Laughter] JF: Well, you&#8217;re clearly doing a good job of faking it. [Laughter] NS: Yeah, but it&#8217;s a&#8212;you know, I don&#8217;t know, the non-profit technology in communities, but in another&#8212;you know, a group of mostly women&#8230;you know, it&#8217;s been&#8212;there have been a lot of discussions&#8212;I remember a few women&#8217;s groups, you know, little meet-up groups&#8230;.and that&#8217;s been&#8212;there was a flap a couple years ago about&#8212;you know, just some blatantly sexist slides in a&#8230;.um&#8230;technical conference that a man came up with and said&#8212;you know, that issue, how women were treated&#8230;in technology in particular&#8212;is kind of something I&#8217;m on the [1:27:31] of, and, um&#8212;but, kind of&#8230;I&#8217;ve sort of aged out of doing some of that&#8212;though there was a word-press conference a couple years ago where some guy had&#8212;you know, I missed a talk, and I was looking at the guy&#8217;s slides, one the&#8212;they were posted online, and there was a&#8212;just a&#8212;scantily clad women in zombie makeup that I&#8217;m not sure&#8212;I&#8217;m not quite sure how it applied to what he was trying to say&#8230;.[Laughter] But&#8212;and I called it on him, and I think what had happened was there was a hidden slide&#8212;it hadn&#8217;t shown up in talk, but when he posted it on Slideshare, you know, it had popped out. So it&#8217;s kind of &#8211;do you really want to &#8211;you know&#8230;.so I took a bunch of the AIEW report on why so few women in science and medicine&#8212;and you know, I handed them out at the secondary conference. But it was&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s really&#8212;I mean, it&#8217;s kind of&#8212;there are some women who see it and feel it, and&#8212;but it&#8217;s still not clear how to fight against it, you know, how to get more women speakers, how to get&#8212;you know, there are a few rock star women, particularly nonprofit technology are, but&#8230;how does that affect the rest of us? How do we&#8212;you know, are we&#8212;and it, again, I can&#8217;t say that there&#8217;s been much gendered&#8230;discrimination, except for those few cases, but, you know, awful slides&#8230;just&#8212;but, um, you know, those haven&#8217;t been in the nonprofit technology side of things, so&#8230; JF: They had been in the&#8212;sort for&#8230;for profit, or corporate? NS: Yeah, corporate, or, you know, um&#8230;you know, language-specific conferences, you know, where&#8212;I think the first one was&#8230;I forget, Python or something&#8230;.and, uh, you know&#8212;so it&#8217;s been&#8212;and it, or just general, you know, technology focused, as opposed to&#8212;we are doing technology, and it&#8217;s sometimes hard to describe what&#8230;nonprofit technology means, you know, why are there issues&#8230;in nonprofit&#8230;that are different from the issues in the corporate environment, but, you know, there are things like&#8212;corporations don&#8217;t have things like donor databases&#8230;but are they that different in the customer-relationship management system? I mean it&#8217;s&#8212;I don&#8217;t know. So, I mean, there is this whole, um, you know, group of people, and that&#8217;s what they focus on&#8230;and I guess I haven&#8217;t quite made the decision if I&#8217;m going to the nonprofit technology conference in Minneapolis in April, or AIEW convention in Louisiana in June, or both. And I, you know&#8212;part of me is thinking this week&#8230;you know&#8230;Steve and I can go to New Orleans some other time. [Laughter] But it&#8217;s um, yeah, you know, I don&#8217;t&#8212;you know, it would be interesting to see&#8212;I mean, we didn&#8217;t&#8212;several years ago we made a pitch to do a&#8212;you know, and had a professor at Peace lined up to say&#8212;what is the status of organizations like this, like NC Women&#8217;s United across the country? You know, how many of the organizations still exist, do they hire lobbyists? You know, how do they actually make an impact on their state legislatures? Um, and having that network across the country would have been really interesting to me, you know, leading into this next legislative session. JF: Yeah, it would. NS: You know, is Indiana&#8212;I mean, what&#8217;s Indiana doing that North Carolina can learn from? You know, how do we, you know, or do we all just move to Massachusetts? [Laughter] I mean I woke up the day after&#8212; JF: Or Colorado or Washington! NS: Yeah! Yeah, I woke up the day after the primary and said...okay, we&#8217;re out of here. You know? It&#8217;s kind of&#8212;this is&#8212;you know, it&#8217;s kind of, um&#8212;but then we looked around and said &#8216;ehh&#8217;. We have to get the house ready to sell, and&#8230;[Laughter] JF: Don&#8217;t let your them push you out! NS: Yeah, but it&#8217;s, um&#8230;I don&#8217;t know what the&#8230;. JF: Well, we had talked about&#8212;before I turned the recorder on&#8212;this&#8230;defining feminism and that the only definition is that there isn&#8217;t one definition&#8230; NS: Umm-hmm. JF: So I thought maybe a different way to ask the question I usually ask, which is how do you define feminism, might be more like&#8230;what parts of feminism have been most significant to you or what parts of the women&#8217;s movement have affected your life the most? Or what are you most invested in? NS: I think&#8230;I mean, I came of age when it was just, um, beginning to be possible to control your reproductive life&#8230;and that&#8230;freedom, though personally it turned out not to be&#8230;an issue, I guess, but I think that&#8217;s&#8212;that has to be key, it&#8217;s an economic issue, it&#8217;s a health issue, it&#8217;s a&#8212;you know, just &#8216;how do I want to live my life&#8217; issue. So, the easy access to contraception, and, you know, when things go wrong, it&#8217;s a safe and legal&#8212;without fear of reprisals or whatever access to abortion&#8230;is important. Um, I think seeing&#8212;you know, again, in my years&#8212;seeing women being able to move into roles that had formerly been white male [1:33:45] has been important. Um, you know, it&#8217;s been&#8212;you know, just the number of women in the&#8212;I mean, twenty percent women in the Senate, you know, it&#8217;s not all that much but it&#8217;s&#8230;better than it has been. You know&#8230;who was the main senator? JF: Olympia Snow? NS: No&#8230;the, um, the&#8212;you know, way back when, when women were first in the Senate&#8212; JF: Oh! Uh, Bella Absink? NS: No&#8230;. JF: [Laughter] Okay, I&#8217;ll stop trying to guess. NS: If we had Google, you know&#8212;well, it interested me. Margaret Chase Smith, you know, I think&#8212;I mean, she was the only woman, right? No women on the Supreme Court, um&#8230;yeah, so it&#8217;s been&#8212;seeing women as governors, you know, wondering how girls growing up today see what they&#8217;re options are, and technology stuff. I mean, some of the work AIEW has done on, um, what&#8212;you know, I think one of my favorite reports was the um&#8230;tech savvy&#8230;um, educating girls in the new computer age&#8230;that came out about ten years ago. But it was, um&#8212;it&#8217;s still available for download. But it&#8217;s&#8212;it&#8217;s a&#8212;and I like it because&#8212;at least I think I like it because they hired journalists to help write it. [Laughter] JF: It doesn&#8217;t read like the instructions to my laptop. [Laughter] NS: Yeah. [Laughter] I mean, how many more graphs of this data can we see? So, yeah, it&#8217;s&#8212;you know, with recommendations to parents and teachers on um, how do we engage girls? You know, and other underserved populations, you know, minorities&#8230;seniors, whatever. I mean, they&#8217;re not going to just go and play with it for the sake of playing with it. They need to know there&#8217;s a reason to be able to use this&#8212;it can improve lives&#8212;and so that work, and the work you know, to help, in that&#8212;you know, I don&#8217;t know why I decided now math is where I needed to be, but, um, you know, it&#8217;s kind of that&#8230;opening up the jobs in general, and in particular, you&#8217;ve got the whole&#8230;not allowing stereotypes&#8230; like the Barbie who doesn&#8217;t like math, you know, to persist, and affect impressionable girls with what they&#8217;re&#8212;you know, how that works. So, and how it works with everything I&#8217;ve done with NC Women United I&#8217;m not sure, but, it&#8217;s been a, you know, group that&#8217;s working in general for social justice and trying to make women understand that they&#8212;that their voices count&#8230;.and though I&#8217;m not sure&#8230;[Laughter] And the three people I know representing me in the North Carolina House Senate and Congress, you know, we districted&#8212;David Price represents us for another three weeks, but&#8212; JF: Oh dear, yeah. I don&#8217;t&#8212;yeah. That was not women&#8217;s fault&#8230;. NS: And so how&#8212;and, I mean, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just women&#8230;I think the people in this country who vote against their own&#8230;economic and other interests. It&#8217;s just&#8230;astounding. And weather that&#8217;s a fact or the&#8230;power of the media, and just, you know, how people know&#8212;I mean what takes&#8212;I mean people taking&#8212;you know, we know how to sell ties so we&#8217;re going to apply that to selling candidates&#8212;I don&#8217;t know. JF: There&#8217;s a lot of, um, money. NS: Yeah. JF: A lot of money and power operating behind the scenes, and when something is behind the scenes it&#8217;s really hard to combat it. NS: Yeah, and that whole [1:38:15] stuff&#8230;I don&#8217;t know. So it&#8217;s um&#8230;I don&#8217;t know. So I&#8217;ve&#8212;I don&#8217;t feel&#8212;I mean, it&#8217;s been part of my life, you know, graduating from college in &#8217;71, so it&#8217;s&#8212;hit that second wave, I&#8217;m not sure what the&#8212;and you know, I&#8217;ve been pleased to see younger women who are willing to stand up and call themselves feminists, you know, and the&#8230;fair support of NC Women&#8217;s United coming from nonprofits like Planned Parenthood, and so there&#8217;s that whole&#8212;but the justice and democracy in North Carolina and the issues that&#8212;you know, voting rights, the way we break NC Women United&#8212;it breaks down health, economic, self-sufficiency, violence against women&#8212;and that seems to be getting worse, if anything. And how they can&#8212;anyway, and the civic participation and equality, that&#8217;s where we lump the voting rights and the LGBT rights and the rest, but it&#8217;s, you know, education was not one of those, you know, things&#8212;I mean, AIEW was at the table for those four categories where, you know, we kind of condensed the&#8230;.you know&#8230;a longer list than we had&#8212;so we condensed them into those four, and it keeps coming back, particularly in the last two or three years, and particularly in Wake County, but&#8212;how do we talk about education? What is going to happen with the UNC system with people like Art Pope on the strategically planning? You know, I mean, I&#8212;you know, the University of Massachusetts was there but it wasn&#8217;t anything like&#8230;[Pause]&#8230;the special-ness of the UNC system. And then K through twelve education&#8230;I mean, what will happen if it&#8217;s previtized? Which is pretty clearly&#8230;a go. So education wasn&#8217;t in one of those it&#8212;it&#8212;it&#8217;s generally under self-suffiencey when anybody&#8217;s had&#8212;which, coming from a liberal arts college, it isn&#8217;t really the only thing education is about. But it&#8217;s&#8212;it&#8217;s been a---you know, I don&#8217;t know&#8230;it&#8217;s been a&#8212;I mean, there are lots of issues. [1:41:11] the voters was mainly&#8230;my time there&#8212;I mean, they&#8217;re certainly a feminist organization, strong member of the Coalition, but their charter is so broad. You know, I couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around that, so I dropped my membership there, um, I joined as preparation for presidency varied, I mean in North Carolina&#8212;kept my membership for NOW, joined BPW later and kept my membership there, just because, you know, I like the people. But it&#8217;s&#8212;and some of them joined in to the AIEW so&#8230;[Laughter]&#8230;it&#8217;s a mutual support society, but you know, I think the [1:43:59]&#8212;I mean they&#8217;re&#8230;the National Counsel For Negro Women dropped their membership in NC Women United a few years ago, over, um, gay rights. JF: I think I read something about this&#8230;hmmm&#8230; NS: Yeah&#8230; JF: And so NC Women United supported gay rights, and the North Carolina Counsel For Negro Women dropped their membership because of that decision? NS: Yep. Yeah, I mean it was&#8230;{Pause]&#8212;and we haven&#8217;t really gone back to try to re-engage them. There&#8217;s a national association of university women, which we&#8217;ve made some tentative contacts with, um, tried to get them engaged in the Wake County women&#8217;s agenda some, something like two years ago, I think. And we should do a better job&#8212;I mean, the IRS having&#8212;making available the searchable database of Nine Ninety Ms, it means&#8230;you could find these people now. Um, you know, some of them may not really be active, but, you know, it&#8217;s kind of&#8212;it&#8217;s been a&#8212;I mean, they&#8217;re out there. But it&#8212;you know, I&#8217;m sort of the&#8212;me and Mackey, who are sort of the founders of NC Women United. She was willing to sit on the phone, and make phone calls, and bring people in, and then, you know&#8212;so she was&#8212;when she was running the women&#8217;s agenda assembly, she&#8217;d have, you know, fifteen organizations represented at the planning meeting, and sixty to ninety or a hundred people at the meetings. And, you know, this last year, well, I mean, it was a tough year, but we didn&#8217;t have any face-to-face meetings. It was just the people who had been running it just kind of&#8212;okay, we did it this way before, lets just do it again&#8212;any objections to doing it that way again? And then we just kind of&#8212;but we only had thirty people there. So, and so Tara Ramado is the&#8212;you know, she&#8217;s the first vice-president of NC Women United and she&#8217;s been chair of the Wake County assembly, she&#8217;s got&#8212;she went to the Orange County assembly and said they did a much better job in Orange County&#8230;of bringing in people for whom this was an introductory conversation. And the people who show up at Wake County are the&#8212;we&#8217;ve been here four times before. JF: Seasoned veteran. [Laughter] NS: Yeah, or working&#8212;I mean they were working towards a particular issue, I mean we had a con tray of about five people, from the Friends of Midwives, you know, trying to get licensure, you know, down there, and it&#8212;I mean there are a lot of issues, and how do we&#8212;you know, keep this legislature&#8212;and it&#8212;just the mindset, I mean the, you know, the forty-seven percent was pretty awful, but the binders of women&#8230;.you know, it&#8217;s just&#8212;and they&#8217;re going to have to go home&#8212;we can&#8217;t keep them late because they have to go home and make dinner&#8230;I mean, it&#8217;s just&#8230;craziness. But it&#8217;s&#8212;and you know, I&#8217;m not sure how we got to all the feminist&#8212;you know, is that&#8230;.? JF: Yeah, kind of got it covered. Is there anything you thought we would ask that we didn&#8217;t? Or that you&#8217;d like to make sure is&#8230;included in the interview? NS: Yeah&#8230;I think that&#8217;s&#8212;I&#8217;ve kind of given you my&#8230;taglines, I think, and again, I don&#8217;t live a very examined life&#8230;I guess&#8230;just sort of bounce from one thing to another, and leave things when they get too painful, and so it&#8217;s, um&#8212;it&#8217;s been an interesting conversation to reflect back on other things, and, um, you know, I&#8217;m not&#8212;next life it might be different. Better well be. JF: Well I&#8217;m really glad that you sat with us and gave us this life&#8217;s&#8230;. [Laughter] I think in the bouncing around you&#8217;ve clearly seen so much and taken a lot in, and this is so valuable to have as part of our archive. NS: Oh, well thank you, thank you. It&#8217;s been&#8212;I haven&#8217;t&#8230;there hasn&#8217;t been too many&#8212;I mean I made the choice in 2001 to leave the job, and part of me, you know when we talk about the [1:47:15], you know, there are people that made the argument &#8216;it&#8217;s women&#8217;s choices&#8217;. And in my lifetime my earnings certainly have been lower&#8230;based on my choices, but I was&#8212;you know, we made the decision when we were married, that we were going to live on one income, and we never children, so the financial stability has kind of been there, and, um, I don&#8217;t know too many&#8230;you know&#8212;yes I haven&#8217;t&#8230;really worried about how much money I made for a long time, or even how much money the family made&#8230;for a long time, and&#8230;I realize that&#8217;s a gift, especially in this environment, um, not to have to worry about that, um, and, and that does&#8230;and&#8230;you know, I don&#8217;t know. I just&#8212;again, a pay gap issue, but it&#8217;s, um--that&#8217;s where my life has taken me so it&#8217;s-it&#8217;s not&#8212;having have been able to do some of the stuff&#8212;doing the things like NC Women United and United Together, that I just wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do, um, if I hadn&#8217;t had that background where we were both making enough money for long enough; he was willing to stick with a job that had health care for long enough, and he&#8217;s retired from the federal service so we&#8217;ve got health care. You know, the civil service&#8212;and so that health care&#8212;I mean, the issue of&#8230;[Pause]&#8230;when the country is going to figure out how to provide universal health care, so that women don&#8217;t go bankrupt when their children get sick&#8212;that whole&#8212;I mean that&#8217;s going to be a&#8212;a change in our generation, the next twenty years, I think, but we&#8217;ll see how that works. And I&#8217;m, you know&#8212;the people in Congress are really interested in cutting taxes&#8230;not that I think we&#8217;re going to do that&#8230;but, you know, we&#8217;ll see. JF: Okay, well I&#8217;m going to turn the recorder off, thank you so much for being a part of this NS: Thank you...
