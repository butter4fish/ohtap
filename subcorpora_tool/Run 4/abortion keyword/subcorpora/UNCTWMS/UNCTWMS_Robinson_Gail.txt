 Joey Fink: It&#8217;s May 18, 2011. This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee, with Mrs. Gail Robinson. Mrs. Robinson, can you start by telling me when and where you were born? Gail Robinson: I was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, at the Knoxville General Hospital. That was one of the first hospitals here in Knoxville, Tennessee, maybe the only one, I&#8217;m not sure, because that was back in 1945. I was born at that hospital. My mother only had one child. She and my dad had one child. My dad had several children after they got divorced. So I do have some half siblings. We have the same dad but not the same mother. We do communicate and talk, but I was raised as an only child. And a strict mother was what I had. She was a petite woman, 4&#8217;11&#8217;&#8217;, 98 lbs. But she was rough and didn&#8217;t take no stuff. I towered over her but that didn&#8217;t mean anything. She said &#8220;do&#8221; and &#8220;when&#8221; and I did it. I finished high school - Austin High School, that was the old Austin High School -- JF: That was an all black high school? GR: Right, that was the only black high school that serviced this area. Children came from Sevierville, Oak Ridge, down in [1:50]. [From] all the surrounding counties, the kids had to catch the bus and come to Knoxville to Austin High School, that was the only high school we had. They would have an elementary school that was probably near their homes but the African American kids still had to ride the bus. Then when they reached -- I don&#8217;t know what they call it now, but we were calling it middle school, seventh through the ninth grade. They had to go somewhere else. They had Beardsley [Middle School] which was out in Mechanicsville. I went to Vine Junior [High School] that&#8217;s the school that is now owned by KCDC [Knoxville Community Development Corporation]. They more or less helped people in getting financial assistance, food stamps, housing, that kind of thing. That's the school I went to from the seventh to ninth grade. I made honor roll, I did good in school. I wasn&#8217;t real active in a whole lot of things for the simple fact [that] my mother was a single mom. She worked, but being active in some things required money for outfits and that kind of thing. But I was happy because I didn&#8217;t want for anything, as far as clothing, gadgets, sewing machine, camera, bicycle. I had all those things. But I didn&#8217;t go out the way to be a part of, like, the Girl Scouts. Now I liked seeing them, what I thought they did, but I didn&#8217;t want to put that strain on my mother. I think if I had told her I wanted to do that, she would have made a way for me to do it. But I didn&#8217;t do that, I didn&#8217;t put that strain on her. JF: Sounds like you kind of grew up fast, you know, that you recognized these subtle things that children usually don&#8217;t think about. GR: Right, they don&#8217;t think about it. Before I graduated from high school, Glen and I - she was like a sister to me - we&#8217;d babysit for this lady and she paid us real well. We would use the babysitting money to go buy little things we wanted, a little short set or something like that. Because she paid us real well. I never did work until I got out of school, until I was 21, because Mama didn&#8217;t want me to work. She said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to work. I&#8217;ll take care of you.&#8221; But I wanted to work because I wanted to feel grown. Everybody else around me had a job. JF: What did your mother do? GR: Day&#8217;s work. She worked private homes. $4 a day. JF: Must be hard. GR: $4 a day. And that&#8217;s why I did not want to put that strain on my mother. Because, bless her heart, catching the bus - she would leave home before I went to school around seven in the morning. Because all the African American women who worked in the private homes of Caucasian people would have to catch one bus, transfer to another bus. They worked down in Sequoia Hills, that&#8217;s down there off of Kingston Pike. JF: I was down in that neighborhood. GR: That&#8217;s where almost all of them worked, in Sequoia Hills. My mother worked down there and then she worked off of Chapman Highway. I&#8217;m not sure what that area is called, but there are some rich white people out there. That&#8217;s where she worked, for $4 a day. But we didn&#8217;t know any better - we were happy. I grew up in the era where we couldn&#8217;t do certain things: we couldn&#8217;t ride in the front of the bus, we had to sit on that back seat or stand up. If you were downtown and went to use the restroom at Chris&#8217;s - a five-and-dime store - they had one - one - [restroom] for colored and the others were for the white people, as they put it. So if you were a male or female [African American], you just had to wait until somebody came out to use the restroom. That&#8217;s the way that was. Miller&#8217;s had a lounge, and a restroom, but we were not allowed to use it. We could not use it. That&#8217;s the way I grew up. I couldn&#8217;t understand. I didn&#8217;t know why we would have one stall and you got a man and a woman out here that needs to use the restroom and they got three or four up here that says &#8220;For White Only.&#8221; But I made it through that okay. Then when I got to the point where I got a job, at Standard Knitting Mill. And, honey, I made $50 a week. That was big money to me! [Laughs] With my poor mother making $4 a day [phone rings, brief pause in recording] JF: You were telling me about working in the mill. What was the name of the place? GR: Standard Knitting Mill. They made underclothes. Men&#8217;s briefs and undershirts. I made men&#8217;s briefs. I worked there for six years. When I left there, I was a housewife for a little while. JF: Can I ask you a question? GR: Mmm hmm. JF: I spoke with a woman Saturday. Luvernal Clark, she worked at the seatbelt factory. She told me - I think you two are about the same age - she said when she was getting out of high school, looking for a job, a woman from the Urban League came to her and said, &#8220;There&#8217;s new laws passed. The mills have to hire African Americans, too. You should go down and apply.&#8221; Did you have any similar experiences with that? GR: That sounds like the same thing that had happened at Standard Knitting Mills, because every employee over there was Caucasian. I heard about them having to hire some African Americans - some &#8220;colored people&#8221; as they called it - and all of us that went over there got hired. That was a first, them being integrated, having black and white working. I never experienced any prejudice. Never did. The employees were friendly. Didn&#8217;t make a difference. The supervisors - [Paused recording to move into the other room.] JF: Was the mill you worked at unionized? GR: They would not let a union come it. Several of the workers got together and drew up a petition for workers that wanted to have a union and gave it to the head man [at] the plant. They agreed to let union people come in and have a vote. But they had people telling [workers], &#8220;Don&#8217;t vote for that union. And you tell so-and-so not to vote for that union.&#8221; So we all went and voted [phone ringing] [brief pause in recording] GR: We voted for whether we wanted a union or not and they said we got beat [pause] maybe by ten points, more or less. We lost by a difference of ten. And I just don&#8217;t believe that because just about everybody you talked to said they voted yes. Because that was a factory and you could get hurt, and you didn&#8217;t have a leg to stand on if something happens. People did get their fingers and hair caught in the machines. They never did have a union. I didn&#8217;t know anything about the seatbelt place because I never worked there. JF: How did you vote? Did you vote for the union or - - GR: I did. [coughing] I voted for the union because I felt like that would be a good thing for us. Because women had to take maternity leave with no pay. Sick leave - no pay. It was just the thing - you knew that if you had to be off, you would not be paid for it, no matter what. Death, sick, or whatever. We went along with it. It was a job. I stayed there for six years. JF: Did you start there when you were 21? You said your mother didn&#8217;t want you to start working until you were 21 -- [coughing] GR: I&#8217;m so sorry. I have asthma and my chest is congested. I haven&#8217;t done this all week and now, I&#8217;m trying to do an interview&#8230; excuse me. When I got that job, Mama didn&#8217;t even know I was going to go look for a job. I didn&#8217;t tell her when I went over there for the interview. But when they called me and told me I had been hired, then I had to tell her. And she said that my daughter - my husband was in the military, we hadn&#8217;t gotten married yet but I had a daughter - and [my mother] said, &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to keep the baby?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s it going to have to be somebody good. Somebody we know that&#8217;s going to keep her. You can&#8217;t work and keep her, too.&#8221; She didn&#8217;t want me to go to work. My grandmother said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep my baby,&#8221; and that took care of that problem right there. Let&#8217;s see, Keenan was born in - I graduated from school in [19]63. She was born in [19]65. We got married in [19]66. He was in the military. He got out just before the Vietnam War. We got married in [19]66 and he worked driving a truck. For C.M. [McClung &amp; Company] - that big building you probably heard about [it] burning down, off of Jackson. It was a warehouse, they sold different things to stores: appliances, housewares, toys, all kind of stuff. He would have to drive the truck out of town to different places, he would be gone. I worked at Standard Knitting Mill - that was my first job. Then I went to the Women&#8217;s Center, then I went to the Urban League. All of my jobs [after Standard Knitting Mill] had been for non-profit organizations. But the one that focused on women was the Women&#8217;s Center. We grew and people learned about us. And people always want to associate - when you say &#8220;women,&#8221; they think about abortion. But that&#8217;s not what we did. We helped people find housing. I did a lot of research - and when I say research, I would take it upon myself to call different organizations to see if they could help &#8216;Betty Sue&#8217; out because she&#8217;s got two children and she doesn&#8217;t have any place to live. &#8220;Is there some way you could help her out? Or do you have a room?&#8221; I think I called one of the missions and they said they normally didn&#8217;t do it but they would let her stay one night. And she started crying, and she was so happy and grateful. Her husband beat up on her and had put her out. Those were the kind of things that we dealt with. We were blessed to have people on our board that had husbands that were lawyers, so they could advise us on what was right and what was wrong, what we could do, how far we could go. That kind of thing. I will never forget, Bill Waters, his wife&#8217;s name was Cathy, she had been a rape victim. She worked with the Rape Crisis Center and not worked - volunteered. She would volunteer with the Women&#8217;s Center because there times when we would have women coming down there and they were carrying that burden, of being raped and not telling anybody. So Cathy started talking to them. She was there for that and her husband was there to give us legal advice, no charge. We got to where we got a grant from CAC [Community Action Committee] to start the WORK Program. Did they tell you about the WORK Program? JF: I heard a little bit about it. The &#8220;Women&#8217;s Opportunities and Referrals of Knoxville?&#8221; GR: Thank you. I tried my best to remember what WORK stood for. JF: I had to look at my notes. [Laughs] GR: We started the WORK Program, the director was named Rita. They gave me the choice of being her assistant or staying with the Women&#8217;s Center. I wanted to branch out, with Rita. That way, I could interview some of the young women for the training that was done at Austin High School. They were doing electronic training. Working on televisions, repairing radios. I did the payroll, I would pick up their checks. I had to keep a record on each one of them when they were out. If they stayed out too many times, I&#8217;d have to have a conference with them about what was going on. Because they knew they would get paid. JF: They got paid during the training? GR: They got paid during the training. We didn&#8217;t want someone taking advantage of the program when there was people that really wanted to learn and would come to class. I pretty much got along with all of them. I may have had two that were not too crazy about me. Because I told her, &#8220;We&#8217;ve talked before about this. This [missing class] has happened several times. First you said your baby was sick. Then you told me that your sister was sick. And then you&#8217;re telling me something else. One of the times, I called your home and you weren&#8217;t there. They thought you were at school and you weren&#8217;t here, Vicky.&#8221; Her name was Vicky. [She said,] &#8220;Well, why did you call my house?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Because I wanted to talk to you. That&#8217;s why I called your house.&#8221; [Big sigh] &#8220;So, you all going to start following up on us and calling us?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, if I have to, I will. Because there&#8217;s a lot of women out there [who] are trying to find a trade.&#8221; And this is one that - you would be surprised at the women that were interested in that particular trade. So we got along pretty well. I&#8217;m trying to think of how long it lasted. How many months they had to take the training before they got their papers saying that they had completed the course and they were ready to go to work. Some of them went to Comcast Cable. You know, the cable company? There was a place down on Severen Avenue, this man had electronic repair. He hired some. There was another place around here&#8230; They got hired. As a matter of fact, Marcia - that was my girl - she was with Comcast up until a few years ago. She got cancer real bad and she had to stop work. But she was telling me about different ones. She would keep me posted on what they were doing. Lonnie was the instructor there. He made sure they knew what they were doing. He told them, "Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask me questions. I can&#8217;t help you if you don&#8217;t ask me. Don&#8217;t tell me you understand, and you don&#8217;t.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You know what I&#8217;m going to do? I&#8217;m going to bring some things in for you all to work on. I&#8217;m going to find out whether my teaching has done any good or not.&#8221; When he did that, we were all interested in seeing that. Rita, myself, and the others. He brought two TVs and two radios. The ones that had been making really good scores on their tests, they did fantastic. With those wires and connecting them and everything. And we wouldn&#8217;t have them all doing it at the same time, because he said, &#8220; I can&#8217;t keep up with you. And somebody might come over and tell you, put this right here, this is the way this is done.&#8221; They all graduated. Then I went to the Urban League. Joyce took my place. JF: Is that Joyce Johnson? GR: Yeah. JF: I&#8217;ve heard her name before. So that would&#8217;ve been, like, [19]75? [19]76? GR: Let&#8217;s see&#8230; I went to the Urban League... I went to the Social Security [office] in [19]81&#8230; so that probably would have been [19]75, [19]76. Something like that. We may have had two groups do the WORK Program. But I know that they completed the course and they got their little certificates. Then when it was over, we went back downtown to where our office was. I&#8217;m trying to think if there was anything in between because - I know, we had a program going on upstairs. Yeah, that was the Ely Building. The old building that&#8217;s downtown on Church Street. Shuckran hired this woman Catherine - she was an older lady, she was older than everybody. She had been in the military, if I&#8217;m not mistaken. She was pretty good with the ones she had. She had a couple [women] who had just gotten their bachelors from UT [University of Tennessee, Knoxville] and they came there to work. I don&#8217;t know if they did grants or they set up programs for people that would come to us downstairs and then we would send them upstairs to them. They would do, like, a mini-quiz to determine what they were good in. JF: Like an assessment? GR: Something like that. JF: Did most of these women who came to you - did they have any kind of job experiences or training or education? GR: Hmmm&#8230;. No, maybe &#8230;. No. As I can remember, the last person who came down to volunteer with us, she brought a friend with her - they hadn&#8217;t worked before. And it was hard trying to find something for women, period. But I&#8217;ll tell you what: the black women who knew about the Women&#8217;s Center - I would tell them but they wouldn&#8217;t come. JF: How did you find out about it? GR: I found out about it through CAC. I knew the person that was working over there, she was the pastor of a church, Gloria. She&#8217;s deceased now. She was telling us about this place that had just been funded and they needed some people to work. She sent me there and she sent my girlfriend over to a place like, a school for mentally challenged children. This school was over on Dandridge. My girlfriend went over there to work. We all worked for non-profit organizations, so our salaries were small. But we enjoyed our job. I really did. I enjoyed my job very much. And I loved Shuckran and I just hate that I didn&#8217;t keep up with her, didn&#8217;t keep in touch with her. JF: So you would tell other African American women about this place and -- GR: They would want to know, &#8220;What do you do? What do you all do? Do they do abortions?&#8221; I&#8217;d say, &#8220;No.&#8221; They&#8217;d say, &#8220;Well, what do you do?&#8221; I&#8217;d say, &#8220;We try to help women. In other words, make them feel good about themselves. Boost up their ego. Because so many of us - me included - we don&#8217;t have much self-esteem. And that&#8217;s what the Women&#8217;s Center is there for. They had workshops, they have training. As of today, my husband? He blames them for me being so outspoken. [gestures towards the other room where her husband is] &#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t got that job with the Women&#8217;s Center, then you wouldn&#8217;t be talking back to me like this.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You are not my daddy. Yes, I would.&#8221; But he just felt like - he wouldn't say, &#8220;I want you to quit.&#8221; But he would say, &#8220;That Women Center messed you up.&#8221; And I thank that Women&#8217;s Center! Because they let me know, I am a woman and I can do whatever I choose to do. When I make up my mind I&#8217;m going to do something, I do it. My daughter can tell you. And he [her husband] can tell you, too. Going somewhere, doing something&#8230; Because when I applied for the job at Social Security, I was working with the employment person at the Urban League then and this job [at the Social Security office] came through and they said, &#8220;Worker training program. No experience necessary. We will train you.&#8221; So Wandalynn, who was a counselor there, said, &#8220;Gail, look at this!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Oh Wandalynn. I need to go over there. &#8220; She said, &#8220;Get your resume together.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I got it together.&#8221; She said, &#8220;You need to take off a half a day and go.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am. I&#8217;m going to.&#8221; I took [my resume] over there and the lady said, &#8220;How did you find out about us? How did you find out that we were hiring?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I work at the Urban League. I don&#8217;t know who sent [Wandalynn] this announcement, but she had it. I was helping her.&#8221; Yes, I was cheating, I guess you might say that, because I wanted to better myself. I said, &#8220;I wanted a job where I could move up. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the Urban League is okay, but I want something else.&#8221; So I turned in my resume and filled out an application. I guess maybe two weeks after that, my boss - I was the secretary and my desk was by his door. He came in one day and he passed the receptionist desk and then me, and we said, &#8220;Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Jim.&#8221; He said [in a gruff tone], &#8220;Good morning. Good morning.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with him?&#8221; He came back to the door and said, &#8220;Gail, I need to see you in my office.&#8221; I said okay. I got up from my desk and I stepped inside his office. He said, &#8220;I need you to shut the door." And I&#8217;m thinking, okay, what&#8217;s going on? I shut the door and said, &#8220;Yes, what did you need to see me about?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I understand you put in an application for a job at Social Security?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221; [pause] &#8220;Oh. Well, were you going to tell me?&#8221; I said, &#8220;If I got the job, I was going to tell you. But before, no, I was not. Jim, I would work out a notice for you if I get the job. &#8220; [He said,] &#8220;Well, Gail, okay. I just - somebody told me that you had been over there. She said that one of my employees had been over there and put in for a job and I think her name was Gail Robinson.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Is that all you need from me?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, you can go back to your desk now.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know if he thought he was going to intimidate me and I was going to lie and say no. I was glad to tell him yes. And let me tell you what, it was so funny! I had put in for my vacation - I always take my vacation in June or July. I took two weeks. I came back and got a call from Dorothy at the Social Security office. She said, &#8220;Gail, we picked you for our position and we need you to come over here and read and sign some more papers.&#8221; I said, &#8220;When do you want me to come? I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; I went over there and I had to be interviewed by their supervisors and the office manager. They were all impressed with me. They told me that. They liked the answers that I gave them. You know, that&#8217;s a very, very secure place. You have to be bonded. You don&#8217;t discuss people&#8217;s business that you come across on the job with anyone - not your family or anybody. I can&#8217;t remember his name or what question he asked me. He asked me, &#8220;If someone came up to you and asked you, &#8216;You know Marry Sue? Why did she come up to your office today?&#8217; What would you tell her?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I would tell her, &#8216;That&#8217;s not to be discussed with you. That is private. We don&#8217;t discuss who comes in our office with anyone.&#8221; &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t tell me what she came for?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, I would not. I&#8217;m not telling you anything. We do not discuss who comes in that office and what they come for. Because it&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business.&#8221; He said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve had people say, &#8216;Well, if it was my cousin, I might tell her a little something.&#8217; But you made it plain and clear that you wouldn&#8217;t tell nobody nothing.&#8221; Because I know, this is an oath you take, that you are not to discuss anything about anybody who comes into this office. You don&#8217;t do that. I came back from vacation. I typed up my little resignation, put it in Mr. [36:14] mailbox. He said, &#8220;Oh you got the job?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I sure did.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Your last day is going to be next week?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Uh huh.&#8221; &#8220;But Gail, you said you would give me two weeks.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m giving you what they gave me. They told me so and I&#8217;m getting ready to go.&#8221; I stayed [at the Social Security office] until 2005. I went there in July of 1981 and I stayed until December of 2005. Twenty-four and a half years I stayed over there. I was a development clerk. [At first,] I would never apply for positions because I felt like some of them I couldn&#8217;t do. But then I started thinking, &#8220;Wait a minute. Anything you put your mind to do, you can do it.&#8221; So I applied for a service [representative] position. That&#8217;s where we answer the phones, work out different formulas, set up insurance for people, and all kinds of things. Service reps do a lot. Work the front window. Do social security numbers. After getting that position, I went to Jackson, Mississippi, for training. I met this woman - I called her my buddy. We were dragging around these big old thick manuals - like five of them. One was on social security, one was on retirement, one was on disability. We were lugging home every day! We were down there for six or eight weeks. I said, &#8220;Dee, I&#8217;m tired of this.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I know, but we got to study.&#8221; I said, &#8220;We been studying!&#8221; We&#8217;d go to each other&#8217;s apartments and ask questions. I had this problem with what we called &#8216;work problems.' Oh honey, you wouldn&#8217;t believe it. When people work, and they done so many quarters. Then they stop working and they got &#8220;x&#8221; amount of quarters and they want to retire but they need to get some more. You&#8217;ve got to sit down and go by the rules and see how many more years they have to work so they can have &#8220;x&#8221; amount of quarters to retire. So, that&#8217;s a work problem, okay? I said, &#8220;I just can&#8217;t get that!&#8221; She said, &#8220;Gail, I promise you, one day you&#8217;ll sit down and it&#8217;ll come to you.&#8221; I did get better with it. When I got back to the home office, I told Linda, &#8220;I just can&#8217;t think darn solution to this problem.&#8221; I&#8217;d get halfway through it and it&#8217;s like my brain would just lock up! But anyway, when we went down there [to Jacksonville], I said, &#8220;Dee, I am not bringing another manual home. I am tired.&#8221; We stayed out the Marriot suites. Honey, we were living the life. Let me tell you something. We all had separate suites. I mean, a suite with a kitchen - fully equipped, dishwasher, ice-maker in the refrigerator, stove, plates, pots, pans, little stools. Then an area with a couch, TV, chair. Further over, there was your bed and nightstand. Bathroom stocked with plenty of towels. JF: [laughs] Sounds nicer than my apartment! GR: Breakfast every morning. I don&#8217;t mean continental breakfast. I mean, real breakfast. Grits, eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, bagel. If you wanted cold cereal, you got it. If you wanted to make pancakes, you could. Orange juice, yogurt, fruit. Then in the evenings when we got out of class, about 3:00 p.m., they would have food for us. So our little money that we got, we didn&#8217;t have to spend it on more food, because they were feeding us better!&#8221; JF: [laughs] Sounds like a pretty good deal! GR: I thought, oh man, this is the life. My daughter and grandson came down for the fourth of July. Down through the years, I can look back and say, God has really been good to me. He&#8217;s blessed me tremendously. For me not to have been to college or any technical school, I feel like I&#8217;ve had good jobs and I&#8217;ve learned a lot from those jobs. So I really don&#8217;t have any complaints about anything that I&#8217;ve done with my life. Right now, I&#8217;m getting ready to go on another cruise. I love to go on cruises. You&#8217;ll probably never see another couple like us. [Laughs] But like I said, I&#8217;ve had a good life and I&#8217;ve enjoyed it. God has been good to me. I lost my mother at an early age She was forty-nine when she died. I was working at the Women&#8217;s Center when she died. JF: Can you tell you me a little bit more about your mom? How she&#8217;s influenced you? Your relationship? GR: Sure. My mom and I had a very good relationship. When I say good, I mean, we could talk about things and I confided in my mother and she&#8217;d guide me, steer me the right way. She let me know that we don&#8217;t always get what we want, but we get what we need. She always told me, &#8220;If there&#8217;s something in life that you want, and you don&#8217;t get it, don&#8217;t feel like you've lost that. Because God doesn&#8217;t intend for you to have that.&#8221; I&#8217;ll tell you one thing that really made me realize what Mom had said was so true. I had gone up to TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] to put in for a job as a clerk. I took the test and I passed the test, but then they said they were not hiring. So I met this woman named Velma. They say she was a psychic, I don&#8217;t know. But she&#8217;s a religious woman. I told Velma, &#8220;I have been trying to get another job at TVA.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Oh no, Gail. You don&#8217;t want to work there.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Because it&#8217;s going to crumble.&#8221; She said it was going to crumble. And when I say crumble, I mean crumble. She said, &#8220;Something else better is coming for you. You&#8217;re gonna get something much better.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, okay.&#8221; And I thought about what momma said. About two or three years [later], they started laying off all these people. People were jumping out windows, committing suicide. Couples that worked there, they were being laid off, losing their homes, their cars. And I said, that is unbelievable. It&#8217;s so unreal. Momma said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;s not for you. When something is for you, you will get it.&#8221; Then Velma told me, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want that, you don&#8217;t need that, because it&#8217;s gonna crumble. And when it crumbles, it&#8217;s gonna crumble hard.&#8221; And it did. They let so many people go, [people] that had been there fifteen years, twenty years. You know I would&#8217;ve been there a few and they sure would&#8217;ve let me go. There were couples there and they laid both of them off. That was it. Your job is no longer needed. Reduction in force. I started hearing about all these people. I have a friend, her husband was on one of them. He was Mr. TVA, you know, he would always have a job. They let him go. They gave him a little severance pay and told him, bye bye. That&#8217;s the way they did. Momma instilled in me having faith in God. And I do have faith. To put things in his hands. Because we cannot handle all our problems. I tried to do that sometimes, but then I have to stop and think about it. It&#8217;s not mine, it&#8217;s the Lord&#8217;s. She also would tell me to be a lady. Be respectful. Definitely be respectful to older people. You give respect, you get respect. That&#8217;s one thing that she taught me to do. She was not a person that was always talking about people, putting them down. She didn&#8217;t do that. She said, &#8220;That&#8217;s not good. You don&#8217;t put people down. Everybody doesn&#8217;t have the same thing.&#8221; When I say that, I mean, this one may have something that the other one thinks that they want. But they don&#8217;t have it because they probably don&#8217;t need it, they just want to get it because that one&#8217;s got it. She taught me morals. She&#8217;d tell me to be a woman that believes in God and knows the Christian way to do things. Don&#8217;t do things to hurt people. Someone might talk about you or hurt you that way. You don&#8217;t go back and try to do that to them. Don&#8217;t judge. Definitely don&#8217;t judge. All of these things she was telling me, I&#8217;ve been realizing, comes from the Bible. What I learned from her, I&#8217;ve carried it with me all my life. And I&#8217;ll carry it to my grave and I&#8217;ll pass it down to my daughter. I can say that I&#8217;m truly proud of [my daughter], because she&#8217;s been through some hard, hard times. Very hard times. I mean, with her son&#8217;s dad. When she was here with us, we did for her and provided for her. When she got married, that&#8217;s when the trouble started. Then she got a divorce from him. He gave her a hard time, wanting the baby. He never really wanted that baby. Aryiann was four, I think, when they got divorced. He would pick our baby up from Apostolic Church School. The lady let him have Aryiann. She had a list, Keenan gave her a list saying that he is only to go with his mother Keenan, his grandmother Gail, his grandfather William, and his godmother Beverly. Never to leave with his father. She let him go with the baby. Keenan called the police. The police said, &#8220;Why did you do that?&#8221; [The woman said,] &#8220;Well, he had on a suit.&#8221; &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, because he had on a suit? You don&#8217;t know what frame of mind this man is in. If something happens to that child, you&#8217;re going to be in real big trouble. Real big trouble. Really, you&#8217;re in trouble all ready for releasing a child to a father who is not supposed to have him.&#8221; I wrote a letter to this officer, thanking him. Commending this officer, because this particular officer, my baby was crying so hard, he said, &#8220;Where do you think he might be?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I know where his mother lives.&#8221; He said, &#8220;That&#8217;s not my area tonight, but I&#8217;m going to go with you to her house.&#8221; So they went over to Marie&#8217;s house. She came to the door. He showed his badge and asked her, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m Officer So and So. Where is your son, David? Do you know where he is?&#8221; &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave a message with you. If you know where he is, call him and you tell him to get his son back to up here to his mother. ASAP." &#8220;Oh, well, okay, I&#8217;ll see if I can find him.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m serious now. I mean this. Because he has kidnapped this child and we don&#8217;t know what he might do to him.&#8221; &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s not gonna --&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want you to tell me what he&#8217;s not gonna do. We don&#8217;t know what he might do since he doesn&#8217;t have full custody of him.&#8221; He told Keenan, &#8220;I want you to go home and wait for a phone call from me.&#8221; She [Keenan&#8217;s mother-in-law] knew where David was. She called him. He had took our baby to Georgia. He took him to Georgia. But let me tell you, he got back on the highway and brought him up here, because they were staying with us. He brought Aryiann here. He said, &#8220;I just wanted to spend some time with him.&#8221; She said, &#8220;David, this is not your weekend for him. You didn&#8217;t even ask me if you could take him.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Momma, I should&#8217;ve sued Apostolic. What if he had done something to my baby and I never saw him again?&#8221; He would do mean things to her, to try to hurt her. &#8220;I want my son, I want to get him.&#8221; David would come up here on Fridays and get Aryiann. We would have to go down there on Sundays to pick him up. We had to work Monday morning but we couldn&#8217;t pick him until after 6pm on Sunday night. He had to go to school. This baby was tired. We did this for a year. It tore up my other car. The other one it kept the highway hot, going back every other week, going to get Aryiann. That rascal moved to Georgia to keep from being here, so he wouldn&#8217;t have to pay child support, and nobody could find him. Those are things he did to her. But through it all, she&#8217;s been strong. She&#8217;s made it through. And now he&#8217;s got a son that doesn&#8217;t even want to talk to him. And we did not put that - we never, ever talked against his dad. I said one thing about his little [half] sister. It&#8217;s funny now, but I know I shouldn&#8217;t have said it. His dad sent some pictures of him and his wife and his daughter. The girl is on a couple of pictures. I said, &#8220;She sure is a funny looking little cuss. With them big eyes and big teeth.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Okay now Granny, you can&#8217;t talk about my little sister like that.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Oh baby I&#8217;m sorry, but she has big teeth!&#8221; [Laughs] He said, &#8220;Okay, now.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I take it all back.&#8221; JF: That&#8217; beautiful though. That speaks so highly of him. He&#8217;s got this sense of - GR: He is a fine young man. I give it to him. In spite of the things that have happened, he still carries himself in a manner respectable. Everybody that has met him and been around him, they say, &#8220;You have a beautiful grandson. You really do.&#8221; I say, &#8220;Well, thank you.&#8221; JF: Can I ask you a couple more questions about the [19]70s and the Women&#8217;s Center? GR: Sure. JF: I was thinking when you were talking about working at the social security office, how important it was for you to respect people&#8217;s privacy and take that seriously. I thought about that quality you have must&#8217;ve been very good at the Women&#8217;s Center where women would come with problems and issues. So without betraying any confidences to anybody, of course, I was wondering if you could tell me a little a bit about, what were some of the issues and problems the women came to the Women&#8217;s Center about? GR: [pause] There were different things. Some things would be&#8230; jobs. That was one of the main things. Helping them to find a job. Secondly, abusive husbands. And then, a third thing would be maybe a housewife but she wanted to do something, to get involved. So we said, &#8220;Well, come on and volunteer here. Because we have a newsletter and need somebody to help put it together. That would be something for you to do. Would you think you would like to doing that?&#8221; They would say, &#8220;Yeah, I would like that.&#8221; I would say, &#8220;We&#8217;ll talk to Shuckran. I can&#8217;t bring anybody in here, Shuckran is the director.&#8221; Some of the other things that were going on with them&#8230; When I think about this, it makes me want to cry. But this happened not at the Women&#8217;s Center, but at Social Security. I went into the restroom and this young lady was in there and she was crying. I had seen her out in the lobby. She came up there to try to get her social security card. I said, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Well, my boyfriend, the guy I stay with&#8230; he fights me. His mother, we live with her and she takes sides with him. I have a baby and I&#8217;m trying to get away from him. But I don&#8217;t have a job and I don&#8217;t have any money.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Where are you gonna go when you get your job?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have a friend who has an apartment and she told me if I got job, I could help her pay the rent. So I came up here.&#8221; And bless her heart, she was up there, combing her hair down and putting something on it. She was going to see about a job and she wanted to make herself look decent. I said, &#8220;What are you gonna do about the bus?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have a bus card.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Do you have any money?&#8221; She said, &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, I don&#8217;t have any.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well stay right here. Let me go see what I got. I don&#8217;t have much.&#8221; She said, &#8220;No that&#8217;s okay.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, you stay right here.&#8221; So I went and I did find four dollars and I brought it back to her. I said, &#8220;At least you can buy some chips and a coke or something. When you get a job, I want you to come back up here and tell me about it. Will you?&#8221; I told my name. She hugged my neck and cried and had me in tears, too. But I just felt so sorry for her. I was just thinking, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;m so blessed. Thank you so much.&#8221; The women who came in the Women&#8217;s Center usually they were either in an abusive relationship, trying to get out. Or they were single parents in housing projects and not having to pay but a little bit and had food stamps, but they wanted to better themselves. They wanted to see how they could. That&#8217;s basically what we did. That&#8217;s what I would hear. See, I was the first thing they saw. Shuckran and them were in the other room in the back and I was in the front. I would talk to them and listen to them and try to send them to places - I would send them to CAC too, because I knew CAC was a place to help women. People period. You know what that is? Community Action Committee. They are a non-profit, government program that helps seniors, mothers, single moms, even men, in different capacities. With housing, food stamps, getting food from different pantries that we have around here. If you go to them, usually they can tell of one that&#8217;s giving out food today. That&#8217;s what they did and where I could send them to. I sent several people over there and luckily, they would have someone driving them because the office was over on Magnolia and we were downtown on Church Street, and that&#8217;s a good piece from where we were. That&#8217;s basically what I did in my commission with the women. A man came up there for something, I&#8217;m trying to think what it was. We got a good laugh, he even laughed about it. He said, &#8220;I saw the sign say &#8216;Women&#8217;s Center,&#8217; but I thought, well, they still might be able to help me, too.&#8221; He was inquiring about the ALCOA aluminum plant over in Blount County. JF: The ALCOA plant? GR: Mmm hmmm. He had heard that they were hiring. I told, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t know anything about that. I know they work men and women, too. We haven&#8217;t gotten anything on that yet.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, okay, you did help me anyway. Although you haven&#8217;t heard anything about them hiring, but I started not to come in here but I&#8217;m glad I did anyway.&#8221; I told him I was sorry I couldn&#8217;t help him, but I did find a number for him to call. I called upstairs to where Jane Redman and Catherine were working and putting things together, and I asked them if they had heard anything about ALCOA hiring males or females. They told me that they had not heard anything about it. He thanked me for it. That was the only man that we had to come and inquire about what we did. So, shoot it to me. What else? [laughs] JF: You said that you would tell your friends and neighbors about the Women&#8217;s Center, but not many African American women were interested or - GR: They wouldn&#8217;t come. JF: Why do you think that was? GR: I guess maybe they felt like they didn&#8217;t need to come, they didn&#8217;t need anything. Because the ones I told, well they were married. They had a job. So they really didn&#8217;t have a reason to come. I told, &#8220;Well just come and see the building. Just come and look. Because what we have is artwork done by women. At Christmastime, when we&#8217;d exchange gifts, it had to be made by a woman.&#8221; I told them about the books. Most of them are written by women, a lot of women writers. I said, &#8220;We have black and white.&#8221; Because I didn&#8217;t realize that myself, until I started working there, all the people that wrote books. I&#8217;m not a reader. I didn&#8217;t know that there were a lot of African American women that wrote books. To me, that&#8217;s very - that&#8217;s history, that&#8217;s something that we all should know about. Yes, we do have some African American - And watching Oprah, I had a chance to see these women. Great writers. I was more or less just trying to get them to see that there are things that our people have done that you don&#8217;t know about. A lot of things that they have done. We&#8217;ve got a lot of it at the Women&#8217;s Center. You just need to come and see. They promised me that they would come but they would never come. They would ask me, &#8220;Have you got so-and-so&#8230;&#8221; And I wouldn&#8217;t tell them. You&#8217;re gonna have to come and see. [Laughs] It&#8217;s a very educational, interesting place to be because of the fact Shuckran was --- oh God, that was a smart woman, I&#8217;m telling you. And she was so sweet. Jane Weeks, she was a professor at Carson Newman [College]. I&#8217;m not quite sure what Jane [LeDain] did, she was involved in a whole lot of things. Shuckran&#8217;s husband worked as an engineer at TVA. She read a lot, read all the time, and could tell you anything. One thing I could say for her, she believed in everybody being treated the same. No matter what color you were, no matter where you lived, you treat everybody the same. That was her philosophy. She wasn&#8217;t one of these, oh they don&#8217;t live down here, they live over in east Knoxville. JF: Shuckran treated everybody the same? GR: Oh yes and she felt like everyone should do that. She and Jane had gotten into a disagreement on a subject. I don&#8217;t know the full extent of it, but she and Jane LeDain had gotten into a conversation about something that was going on around here in town. It had to do with colored and white and City Council didn&#8217;t want to do something. Shuckran said, &#8220;Jane, you tell me why you think they shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8220;Well, Shuckran, they need to earn their way --&#8221; Shuckran said, &#8220;How they gonna earn if they don&#8217;t give them a chance? You need to give a people a chance to prove what they can do. To me, that&#8217;s not being fair. How can you sit there and make a judgment and say they don&#8217;t need to help them or whatever?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Shuckran, I didn&#8217;t mean to upset you.&#8221; [Shuckran] said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just surprised to hear you say that, Jane. Because I thought you felt that everybody should be treated the same and given the same chance or opportunity to do things. But apparently you don&#8217;t.&#8221; JF: So Jane, was it that she thought - that if you made too much money or had --? GR: The City Council was trying to make a decision on [whether to] help some place. And that particular area was where the black people stay. And Jane was saying that possibly they may tear it up or it may not be worth it. And Shuckran said, &#8220;But you don&#8217;t know that. And they&#8217;ve spent money on other things and for other people, and they tore it up. So what&#8217;s the difference here? You know?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I know, I was just saying, I can see why they wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Well, Jane, I&#8217;m just surprised that you&#8217;re saying that.&#8221; She [Shuckran] would speak what&#8217;s on her mind. And she was fair person and a good person. You couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better boss [than] Shuckran. I get so angry with myself because I stayed in touch with them for a little while after I left, but then when Merikay Waldvogel took over - Merikay said that Shuckran went back to Egypt. JF: I think she said she went to Washington, DC. GR: Did she? Oh okay. JF: To work in a language program? GR: With all that going on in Cairo, I thought about her. I thought, &#8220;Oh Lord, I hope she is not over there, because I know her people over there in Cairo.&#8221; So she&#8217;s doing a program in Washington? JF: I think that Merikay knew that&#8217;s where she went when she left Knoxville, but I&#8217;ll try to find some information on her. If I find an email address or a phone number, I&#8217;ll let you know. GR: Oh, I would love to talk with her. Keenan, my daughter, she even remembers her. She said, &#8220;Momma, you should&#8217;ve kept with her.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I know, I should have.&#8221; I knew and I felt like, we were progressing enough here for her, for women. What she was doing, she liked, but she couldn&#8217;t get it going, getting more people involved. All our money came from money, a grant from this place, money from this place, then this place. That made up all our salaries. She wanted to get things going, maybe open up a place or build something and hire women, or hire men and women, lower class, you know, not like TVA where everybody&#8217;s all dressed up and they lived down in West Knoxville. She said, &#8220;They think they&#8217;re better than everybody. I don&#8217;t like that.&#8221; She told her husband, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want move down here.&#8221; At the time they moved though, it was just like where we are. There wasn&#8217;t anything around us. I wonder if he went with her, or if she just up and left him? I would love to hear - Keenan told me I had to google her. I don&#8217;t know how to google people on the internet. JF: If I find her, I&#8217;ll let you know, pass along any information. GR: I would really appreciate it. JF: Yeah, for sure. GR: There was somebody I called&#8230; It was somebody I had worked with. I&#8217;m trying to think what job it was. I know, it wasn&#8217;t a job, it was school. Bea. &#8220;Is this Beatrice Edwards?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes it is.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did you take a class on social security in Jackson, Mississippi?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, I did. Who is this?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Beatrice, This is Gail Robinson.&#8221; &#8220;Gail! Girl! How you doing?&#8221; That was back in [19]99, and we hadn&#8217;t talked to each other. I don&#8217;t know how I found her number. I think I might have found a sheet where we had some names and numbers on it. I guess if I was to get Shuckran on the phone, I would really, really have a ball. She was so sweet and so caring. She&#8217;d never raised her voice. But she&#8217;d get the point over to you, though. But she wouldn&#8217;t raise her voice. Now, Jane, she would get to going and Lord, she&#8217;d be nonstop. Did Jane Weeks say that Jane LeDain was home, or is she with her kids? JF: I&#8217;m not sure. I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s in the area right now. I&#8217;ll have to double check. GR: Because she was always on the go. She had friends, male and female. She&#8217;d be talking about Harvey. &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s got a pacemaker, he can&#8217;t do very much.&#8221; &#8220;What?&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s got a pacemaker, he can&#8217;t do very much.&#8221; &#8220;Well, what does he have to do?&#8221; &#8220;Oh. Okay, we won&#8217;t even get into that.&#8221; We would just laugh at her because she&#8217;s talking about him being careful with that pacemaker, he couldn&#8217;t exercise too much. [1:17:30] Cause he had gotten a girlfriend, and that&#8217;s what she was saying, &#8220;Well, he can&#8217;t do very much, cause he&#8217;s got a pacemaker and he knows he&#8217;s got to take it easy.&#8221; We said, okay. [Laughs] But I really enjoyed working with them. That&#8217;s the first time and the only time I&#8217;ve ever worked in a place that I was the only African American person there, but I was always treated nice. It did not make a difference in the way they treated me. They weren&#8217;t cool to me, or talk down to me or anything like that. We were just like family. We were just like family. That&#8217;s why I was hoping so bad that I could find that darn newsletter, but I don't know. I said, &#8220;If find it, I&#8217;m going make a copy and mail it, to just let you see us on the front page.&#8221; JF: I would love to see it. GR: I would have liked for you to see it. Do you have any other questions? JF: A couple. Did you feel like you were part of a bigger women&#8217;s movement that was going on in the [19]70s? GR: [Shakes head.] No. I really didn&#8217;t. I guess because I was not - when they started the civil rights movement, period, for everybody, in the [19]60s. The sit-ins and the marches and all that. My mother wouldn&#8217;t let me take part in that because she said you might get hurt. Well then, with the movement as far as the women was concerned, I still hadn&#8217;t really gotten myself into what was trying to be displayed by Shuckran and them, until after a few years, then I could see where they were coming from. That we were not treated like men. We were not given the opportunities that men were given. We were not paid the salaries that men were paid, you know. I think it was more or less after I had maybe left there, that it really dawned on me. Then I would talk out about it in the conversation, you know, not speaking [in public] you know. But that&#8217;s when it really, really hit me and I could see why Shuckran was so bent on trying to get - this city is slow, okay. South. You know, redneck. Alright. Okay. And that&#8217;s it. I didn&#8217;t expect her stay here very long because they&#8217;re not going to go anywhere, not if they can help it. They&#8217;re not going to go any farther than they have to. I know you heard about our interim black mayor. That&#8217;s my classmate. He was my classmate. Now, who would have ever dreamed that Knoxville, Tennessee, would have a black man as the mayor, even just for a year. Because they don&#8217;t have them holding high offices. Now we have some very talented, educated men here in this city, but they wouldn&#8217;t give them a chance. While I was at Social Security, a man from the office down in Atlanta, he was detailed up here. He was supposed to become the assistant manager of our office because the one that was there was supposed to be leaving. When Sherman came, and he was well-dressed, well-educated, he was aware of everything that was going on. He knew about social security, all the stuff. Their information comes in a book called &#8220;Palms.&#8221; It&#8217;s a book that explains about how things are done, the different programs and what you do to get this and how you get up to this point. When he came to our office, David changed his mind about leaving. So David and the manager they stayed like [fingers crossed]. Well, Sherman always wore a suit - always! - and his shoes, his shirt, his tie, his handkerchief, they all matched. They gave him a little office, it wasn&#8217;t as big as this room. All he could get in there was a desk, his chair, and he had a plant. And he said that Jim came up to him. [Sherman] had taken his coat off. And [Jim] said, &#8220;Why are you walking around this office without your coat on? You know, you&#8217;re in a position where you&#8217;re supposed to have on that coat.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yeah, but you go in and you sit in that room with your coat on and let&#8217;s see if you can keep it on.&#8221; [Jim] said, &#8220;Well, I hadn&#8217;t thought about that. I guess you got a point there.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I know I&#8217;ve got a point.&#8221; When he was telling us about it, he said, &#8220;Jim don&#8217;t want no part with me. I used to be on the police force in Atlanta. I have kicked some butts. And I&#8217;ve reached the point where I&#8217;m tired of them. I&#8217;ve already called to Atlanta and I&#8217;ve told the deputy, whatever down there, to get me back down there, because I don&#8217;t like this. David and Jim, it&#8217;s like they&#8217;re against me.&#8221; They had this man doing things like sending letters to [1:24:22]. Where people had wrote or called us, complaining about things. This is something that we - the clerks, the D.C.s - should have been doing. David had been doing [and] passed it on to Sherman, the little junk. Sherman says, &#8220;Look at this, this is what they want me to do. Not that I'm too good, but I didn&#8217;t come up here for this.&#8221; So that&#8217;s why I was saying about you know, progress. Seeing it move up. And women, they&#8217;re doing a little bit better, but not a whole whole lot. But they&#8217;re doing a little bit better. I was glad to see the Urban League has a woman as their director now. They&#8217;ve got a woman. I was glad to hear that and see that because it&#8217;s always been a man that was the director over there. Let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;m trying to think if there was another place, probably is. But I can think of it right now. So you just go ahead with your questions. [Laughs] JF: Did working with Shuckran and the women at the Women Center, did that affect you at all in the way you approached parenting or in your personal relationships? GR: No. No effect at all. Everything was fine. Everything was fine. No problems. No misunderstandings. It was just fine. I enjoyed it. I did. So no, we didn&#8217;t - I was so anxious for my daughter to meet them and they wanted to see her. I&#8217;ve been to Jane's house, I&#8217;ve been to Shuckran&#8217;s house. We just, like I said, we were just like family. It just didn&#8217;t bother me at all. Didn&#8217;t have any kind of effect on anything with me and my friends and my family. JF: Anything in a good way? Because you said, working at the Women&#8217;s Center, you felt like you got a lot of self-confidence? GR: I did. Oh he could tell you that. I say As of today, my husband&#8230;Oh he [gestures towards her husband who is in the other room] can tell you that. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just being assertive. I&#8217;m just telling you how I feel.&#8221; I let people know. That was one thing about Shuckran. If she got into it with somebody about something and they brought a man on the phone, she would say, &#8220;So what? Bring him on.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Gail, don&#8217;t ever let anyone make you think that just because it&#8217;s a man up in that phone that you got to bow down to him - it does not work that way.&#8221; And I have remembered that ever since. Honey, I tell you what. I have been on the phone with some, and I chewed him up, spit him out, and then ready to do it again. [laughs] I don&#8217;t fool with them, they don&#8217;t mess with me. And if they do, I got something for him. He knows that. He&#8217;s says, &#8220;That Women&#8217;s Center - it just made you feel like&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. The women&#8217;s movement - &#8221; I said, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have no women&#8217;s movement up there. I just went to work.&#8221; &#8220;But I know y&#8217;all talked about the women&#8217;s movement!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well of course we did! Okay, yeah, we&#8217;d talk about. But nobody tried to shove down anybody&#8217;s throat!&#8221; I said, &#8220;But if you sit and listen to what they say, it makes a lot of sense. People like you that think that women don&#8217;t have a say so-so about anything and they have to listen and take what other folks say&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Hrmph.&#8221; Oh he&#8217;d get angry. But I don&#8217;t pay him no attention. None at all. My daughter is the same way, she&#8217;s the same way. She works in a doctor&#8217;s office and she&#8217;s like the medical assistant in the clerical part up in the front office. And some of the girls that work up there, they may be in a relationship with someone that is not working. They [the girls] work and then they want them to give them money. They do. They keep their car while they&#8217;re at work. You know, that kind of stuff. And [my daughter] said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I couldn&#8217;t do this. We sit here ten hours a day and take all this bull crap from these patients, the nurses in the back, and then you&#8217;re going to take it from a man? No. I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t see it.&#8221; [Her co-worker] says, &#8220;Well, Keenan, I wish I could be like you.&#8221; She says, &#8220;You can be like yourself. You just say, I&#8217;m going to do this. That&#8217;s what you have to do.&#8221; &#8220;Well&#8230; but he&#8217;s just&#8230;&#8221; She says, &#8220;He just what?&#8221; &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s talking about going to look for a job and...&#8221; She says, &#8220;Has he found one yet?&#8221; She says, &#8220;Well, I drive my car to work and then when I come home he says, I don&#8217;t have a job.&#8221;[Keenan] says, &#8220;He best start looking and catch the bus to find one. [Tell him] you living off me. I&#8217;m taking care of you and my children.&#8221; This ain&#8217;t their daddy. Boyfriend. What I learned and saw and paid attention to, I passed it on to [Keenan]. I didn&#8217;t have to tell her very much, though. I guess when she came here, she came here with that mentality. [Laughs] Don&#8217;t be used by no man. You move up, when you go through these phases. Don&#8217;t let nobody intimidate you because you&#8217;re just as good as they are. And you can do whatever they can do. Might take you awhile to do it, but you can do it. I&#8217;ve heard her talking to one of the girls. One of the doctors had come in and didn&#8217;t speak to them. [Keenan] said, &#8220;You know what, if she can live with that. We all work here together. If she doesn&#8217;t want to speak to us, hey, that&#8217;s alright baby. We don&#8217;t care. We get along. We talk. We don&#8217;t have to talk to her. So remember that.&#8221; [Laughs] I said, &#8220;Good for you, baby. Good for you.&#8221; Some people, bless their hearts, it&#8217;s hurt them so bad if a person that been talking to them but then all of the sudden they act like, because you made one mistake, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk to you.&#8221; You know, that kind of thing. I&#8217;m proud of her for that. I am. I&#8217;m proud of her. Now I&#8217;m not going to keep lingering on something. [laughs] You want me to answer something else? JF: You know, you&#8217;ve said such great - great stories! GR: Have I been helpful to you? JF: Yes, yes. Very, very much. You&#8217;ve helped me get a better picture of what was going on and what your life was like. GR: I&#8217;m glad. JF: And I think your grandson is pretty lucky. He&#8217;s got such a legacy of strong woman - GR: Thank you. JF: Looking out for him and raising him right. GR: People have said that before, too. They have. And I thank you for saying that. Because when they talk about him, they say, of course he&#8217;s got a support of you and his mom being strong and you all let him know what you can do. You&#8217;ve got to apply yourself and you can do this and you can do that. I said, &#8220;Well thank you. Thank you very much. I just hope he doesn&#8217;t let it go --&#8221; They say, &#8220;He&#8217;s not, Gail. He&#8217;s nineteen, going to be twenty.&#8221; So I say that to say this, that Aryiann, so far, knock on wood, he has not been in any kind of trouble. And I thank God for that. I do, I thank him every day. And I pray that he continues to keep a level head. Because for boys, you know - I know you wouldn&#8217;t know, but for our young black boys, it&#8217;s hard for them. Harder to a degree of finding employment. And being given a chance to prove what they can do. And most of them come from single parent families, but like the preacher says, that&#8217;s no excuse. When mom says do, you do. Because mommas can raise good boys, just like momma and daddy can. Better with a man because he&#8217;s got a firm hand. But my daughter says, I got a firm fist, too&#8221; [Laughs]..
