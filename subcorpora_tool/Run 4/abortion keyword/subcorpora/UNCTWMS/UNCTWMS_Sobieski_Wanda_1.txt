 Jennifer Donnally: Good afternoon. This is Tuesday, May 25th, 2010. I am Jennifer Donnally and today I&#8217;m in downtown Knoxville interviewing--do you want to say your name so I make sure your last name is said correctly? [Laughter] Wanda Sobieski: Wanda Sobieski. JD: Okay, and my first question is going way back, which is where did you grow up and what was your childhood like? WS: I grew up in Kansas, actually born in Missouri, but grew up in Kansas. JD: Okay, that&#8217;s forgivable. [Laughter] WS: Not far across the line. Sort of a [pause] lower-middle-class setting with two brothers and parents who thought that girls should get married after high school and have a family, and sending them to college was a waste of money. JD: Did you end up fighting to go to college then? WS: Well, I actually never really thought about it much. I accepted it as just the way it was. We had a very conservative church, a Baptist church that was a part of the General Association of Regular Baptists, who believed that the Southern Baptist Church was too liberal to join, so it was a very conservative background. In my junior year in [high school], my mother was ill and I had to stay home until my little brother went to school. [I] could catch the school bus later in the day, [but] I missed my early morning classes and had to come back after school. I was meeting with my history teacher and he asked me if I had put in my applications for college [yet], and I remember laughing at him and saying, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding; we can&#8217;t afford college. And besides, my parents would like to send my brothers, but they see no reason for me to go at all.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, you could do it yourself.&#8221; I must confess, I really hadn&#8217;t thought that that was possible. I just thought it was too expensive. The next day when I came back, he had figured out how much money I would have to earn working part-time and save up in the summer to make it work at a state school and showed me it could be done. JD: So what school did you choose in Kansas? WS: I went to Wichita State. I chose it scientifically; I applied to all the in-state schools and took the one with the biggest percentage of financial scholarships and grants to help cover, so I didn&#8217;t really know anything about it and hadn&#8217;t visited it or anything, [laughter] but that&#8217;s where I went. JD: Did you enjoy college? WS: I really enjoyed college. It was a very different experience. It was a little startling, coming from such a really, really sheltered life. I didn&#8217;t realize how sheltered I was. JD: What town was it in Kansas that you grew up in? WS: Kansas City, Kansas. JD: Okay, so you grew up in the city. WS: It&#8217;s the city, but the community was organized around this very conservative church, so there wasn&#8217;t much contact outside of the church, so going to college where people drank and smoked and did all those horrible things was a little bit of a culture shock. JD: When did you go? WS: I started in 1965, in the fall of [19]65 and graduated in [19]69. JD: So was there any--I know it wasn&#8217;t the University of Kansas with all the social unrest. [Laughter] Wichita State takes pride in the fact that they were not, but was there any campus activities that you got involved in? WS: I did. [Pause] I&#8217;m almost embarrassed to say I was in a sorority. JD: It has a different meaning when (4:05) [Laughter] WS: Well, I didn&#8217;t really--I don&#8217;t know why I did that. I thought it was something else. They led me to believe it was something different than I experienced, so I didn&#8217;t stay active very long in the sorority. I was on a debate scholarship, so that had a small community of close friends and I did travel lot, was away from school a lot. I paid my way through school, working for an ice cream company, ringing a bell on a little jeep, [laughter] driving around the neighborhoods in Kansas City. That&#8217;s really where it started. Then they wanted to open a branch in Wichita, so I became the manager and stayed down there year-round the last couple of years. So that&#8217;s really how I paid my way through was the ice cream company, which was its own set of experiences too. But I was working, and between working and running the little company and doing all the debate requirements, I didn&#8217;t do a whole lot of other things. I mean, there was Mortar Board and a few little charity things, and that was about it. JD: So then what happened after college? WS: Well, I got married the summer after college and moved to Vermont, and watched as I heard about people forming the National Organization for Women and was really intrigued by that. I signed up for Ms. Magazine. I don&#8217;t have the first issue, but I have most of the issues. I began to teach in the school up there, high school. JD: Oh, so did you get your degree in public education or--? WS: No, actually it was English and Chemistry, [laughter] which bore no relationship to one another really, but I took Chemistry for fun and English because I thought I could get a job teaching. So I taught English and I taught Chemistry and I coached debate in the high school up in Vermont and New Hampshire. I was just there a couple of years. JD: So then what brought you down to Knoxville? WS: A desire to get away from there [laughter]. I came from Kansas, and really, there were a lot of cultural shocks for me, partly because I just started out in such a conservative setting, but the people in Kansas are pretty friendly, and if you go shopping or walking down the street, at least in those days, you&#8217;d smile and wave at people you don&#8217;t know because you&#8217;re just expected to. When I did that in New England, they acted like I was trying to rob them or something. [Laughter] It was much harder to get to know people in New England because they were much more reserved, by and large. I made a lot of really good friends there in a short period of time, but it just wasn&#8217;t Kansas any more. JD: No. WS: So I wanted to move south, thinking that would get me back in a culture that wasn&#8217;t quite so--it was very classist. My husband was teaching at Dartmouth and the people there, the faculty wives, didn&#8217;t like it when I took secretaries to lunch because I shouldn&#8217;t be seen in public with people below my class, that kind of thing. I could not tolerate it. I had to get out of there [laughter]. So, the best job offer south happened to be in Knoxville, so actually, we came to Knoxville thinking that we wouldn&#8217;t stay more than a couple of years because Knoxville was the South, really south, not the Midwest. My concern was that I didn&#8217;t want to raise a family in what I assumed to be a very racist society, so I was quite uncomfortable with the notion of staying. Then I got here and the people are wonderful, and I loved it and I&#8217;ve been here ever since. JD: Do you remember any sort of--I&#8217;m trying to think--(8:33) and you watched as NOW was founded in [19]67 and you watched as a burgeoning feminist movement emerged. What then got you to start wanting to participate in it? WS: You know Kansas at the time was culturally probably about ten years behind everyone else. Even in dress and styles and everything, it just was behind. It took me a while to adjust because it seemed to me that the people who got the coverage for the women&#8217;s movement were coarse. JD: And you&#8217;re speaking of the radical feminists? WS: And it didn&#8217;t feel like a Kansas thing to me, so I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was all about, and of course, we also had all the Vietnam protests going on. There was a lot of upheaval. You know, I lived through watching the Martin Luther King assassination, the Kennedy assassination, Robert Kennedy assassination. There was just a lot of very confusing things happening, and no one that I really knew to connect to, to the movement. In New Hampshire and Vermont, I didn&#8217;t know of anyone that was active in the movement at all, so it was long-distance, watch it on the news and read about it in the papers. JD: So then, when did you hear about the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center? WS: Shortly after I moved here. I moved here in 1971 with a one-month-old child, and [pause] I&#8217;m trying to remember, it had to be the Women&#8217;s Center is the first real connection I made to any of the feminist groups here. It was called--it had a much more generic name originally, Partners and Associates--. Did Jane Weeks tell you I can&#8217;t remember now? JD: No, she just always called it the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center. WS: No, it had another name to start with and a difficult to understand purpose statement. By the time it became the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center, I was pretty involved. JD: She talked about the consciousness-raising group that was--it wasn&#8217;t really a consciousness-raising group but the Monday Night Book Club, where everybody--. WS: Well, there was the Monday Night Book Club, but the Women&#8217;s Center--and I can&#8217;t remember now the year, although I have boxes of paper I saved about all this--was a place where women&#8217;s groups could meet, and a lot of different groups met there, from things like La Leche League--and that may have been my first contact in Knoxville, was the La Leche League. JD: Because you had a one-month-old. WS: Had a one-month-old, and many of those people were involved in other things in the community. La Leche met there; NOW met there; even women&#8217;s church groups met there. It was an amazing group of people that met and held their meetings at the women&#8217;s center once we had a physical location. The first rap groups that I remember being involved with were NOW groups essentially, and I quickly learned I was way behind the time when I met with them. JD: What were you learning? What did you learn from your experience? WS: Well, the first one I remember going to was at the Unitarian Church, and Judy Goans was there; she was one of the officers. Robbie Weaver was there; I remember that. I didn&#8217;t know either of them before, and frankly, I don&#8217;t think I really knew anybody in NOW, I just decided I wanted to go. I saw it on the--Every Woman was the name of the newsletter for the Women&#8217;s Center--probably saw it there. So I just showed up, and the hot topic of the night was domestic partnership issues, you know, who does the dishes and who does the laundry and that stuff. I was struggling with the notion that my then-husband thought that the house could be a wreck; he didn&#8217;t have to ever pick up anything or do anything because he didn&#8217;t care if it was a wreck. So if I picked up his stuff and cleaned it, that was my problem because I was the one that wanted it neat. And that made some sense to me; I&#8217;m not sure why. [Laughter] But it made a bit of sense to me, so I remember making a comment about that. You know, &#8220;Is that really fair?&#8221; Or, &#8220;If they don&#8217;t really care, then why should you involve them in keeping it at your own standard of what&#8217;s clean?&#8221; Judy Goans looked at me and she said, &#8220;That&#8217;s the oldest cop-out in the book.&#8221; I&#8217;ll never forget her saying that. I thought wow! It kind of surprised me. I started thinking about it and she was probably right, but it was just a little shocking to me to have her just--it was such an easy question for her, and I was really struggling with it. [Laughter] Then I got pretty involved in NOW. JD: What other things did you guys discuss at the meetings? WS: At the rap meetings, we would talk about issues in the workplace and getting interviews or jobs; that was one of the issues; equal pay issues, because that rarely happened. There was a lot of concern. Our group was pretty young, for the most part, so there was concern about how young mothers got excluded from the community because there was no acceptable child care, and how hard it was to work and have child care, to earn enough because most of the jobs available paid so little. I remember I thought about teaching when I first moved here, and at that time, if I had been supporting a family of four as a public school teacher I would have qualified for food stamps. So, it was a lot of emphasis on how much we need to open up the economic sphere to really create opportunities for women. Back then, there were a lot of issues over admissions to school, a lot of discrimination still going on, not just in professional schools, but in various departments within even big universities like the University of Tennessee. JD: Oh, I&#8217;m sure. WS: Yes, there are several stories about that. So, it was pretty practical, for the most part, and it was not formal; nobody really took charge or lectured. It really was more like a discussion group and trying to come up with ideas to somehow make things change. JD: Do you remember any of the stories about discrimination at the University of Tennessee? WS: Oh, I do. [Laughter] I had one real personal one, as a matter of fact. Because one of the things I did in the seventies was I somehow--and I can&#8217;t remember how I wound up doing this, but I was on a committee to review grant applications for the National Institute of Mental Health. I can&#8217;t remember how I got that, but anyway--. I had gone back to school at UT and got my master&#8217;s degree in communications/speech and my thesis really arose out of one of those feminist moments, I guess. My professor that was to oversee it--I can&#8217;t remember now what they called him--I submitted a number of topics for my master&#8217;s thesis and he kept rejecting them. Then, I had written a paper in a class I had taken from him, and he wrote on the top of my paper--he gave me a good grade and he wrote on the top of it, &#8220;This is the best paper I&#8217;ve ever gotten from a female graduate student,&#8221; and I got mad. [Laughter] I went back to see him and he thought he was complimenting me, and I thought he was insulting me because obviously [I read his comment as] &#8220;it&#8217;s not as good as a man would do, but for a woman it&#8217;s not too bad.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t really mean it that way; it&#8217;s just that he was surprised to see a woman write a good paper. So we began having a communication issue of our own. Eventually, I did a sociolinguistic study, historical and empirical, on how feminine sex designators affect the perceived credibility of various sources, and he finally approved that one because of our miscommunication over the paper, and I did that work. Then, when I was doing the work for the NIMH, they became interested in my thesis. Somehow, it got put on microfilm, put some place where people could order it. I don&#8217;t really understand how all that happens, but I started getting calls to go to conventions and do programs on this phenomena of sex designation and how it affected the credibility of professional women of various types. The NIMH contact I had said I should apply for a grant, that they&#8217;d like to see me expand the study. Well, then I had two children; my daughter was getting ready to go to kindergarten, and my plan was to go back to school and get a Ph.D. when she started kindergarten. I decided I had the perfect plan; I&#8217;d go to the college of communications; I would get my Ph.D. in communications theory. I always wanted to be a talk-show host, so I would be a talk-show host, and I would do my thesis as an expansion of my master&#8217;s thesis. I&#8217;d do my doctoral thesis, and the NIMH would provide me with a staff so I could do a really fantastic doctoral thesis. I had the world figured out. I was really excited about it, and applied to the graduate school. I got a call from the graduate school; I was admitted. I needed to have a teaching assistantship to be able to afford to go. It was so odd; they called and asked me what my schedule for child care would be so that they could make sure that the classes were offered at the right time, which I thought was really weird--one of the members of the committee called. Then I got the letters that were to tell you what you got, and all I got was a little grant. It wasn&#8217;t enough for me to go to school. I thought, &#8220;Oh, my lord, what has happened?&#8221; Because we had had blind references, I didn&#8217;t know who they had contacted. I had a little run-in with a professor in undergraduate school that wouldn&#8217;t keep his hands off me, and I thought, "Oh, no! They contacted him and he said something horrible.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know what was going on, so I called the chair of the committee to find out if there was a mistake because they had eleven teaching assistantships and I really needed one to be able to go. He told me I had the highest scores; they do a combined score-GRE and undergraduate grades and some other stuff. He said I had the highest scores and was the only candidate with related teaching experience, but the committee had decided that I could not be both a good mother and a good student, so they were looking after me when they chose not to give me that assistantship. I didn&#8217;t believe it. I just didn&#8217;t believe it. I didn&#8217;t know anything about the law other than what I read in the paper, but I just didn&#8217;t believe it. The Buckley Amendment had passed, which meant, as I understood it from reading the papers, that a student who applies can go look at their own file. Nobody else can, but you had access. So I went to the admissions office and asked for my file and they told me I couldn&#8217;t have it. So I went to the Affirmative Action office to find out what was going on and told them I just needed to see my file. I wanted to see why I wasn&#8217;t admitted because I didn&#8217;t believe the reason I was given. Long story short, I eventually got the file; my references were fine, so there was&#8230; JD: &#8230;Nothing? WS: I finally had to recognize that they had told me the truth. They had just decided I couldn&#8217;t be a mother and a student. So I got the yellow pages out and I started calling lawyers, [laughter] because I didn&#8217;t know anybody. Most of them would listen to that explanation and they would just say, &#8220;Well, so? They were trying to help you.&#8221; I&#8217;d hang up and call the next one and I finally got one that said, &#8220;Damn! They can&#8217;t do that!&#8221; So I made an appointment and went to see that lawyer, and he wanted a retainer that was more than the cost of my house for him to do anything. [Laughter] So that was out. You know, if I could afford that retainer, I didn&#8217;t need the teaching assistantship. So that frustrated me. This is something I did learn from NOW: go to the research department of the public library and find out who all the decision makers are. I didn&#8217;t really understand that either, but I made a list of all the board of trustees and their addresses and I made a list of all the people who had chancellor or vice-chancellor by their name. I wrote a letter and I just sent it out to everybody because I thought, &#8220;Well, they&#8217;ll deny all of this, but they ought to be uncomfortable; they ought to at least think twice before they do this to somebody else, so I&#8217;ll just make them--they&#8217;ll know they&#8217;re lying when they lie.&#8221; So, I sent the letter out, got a call that very next day from Vice-Chancellor Herndon. He said he had gotten the letter; he hadn&#8217;t talked to the department yet; he didn&#8217;t know whether anything was true in it, but he did want to meet with me. He wanted to know if I wrote the letter myself, and that insulted me because I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;What! He thinks I can&#8217;t write a paragraph.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, yes, of course I did.&#8221; Now I know he want[ed] to know if I had a lawyer, if he should be talking to the lawyer instead of to me, but I didn&#8217;t know that at the time. So I went in to see him the next day, and he said he had contacted the department and yes, indeed, they admitted they did that and they didn&#8217;t see anything wrong with it. He did, [laughter] but he had no power over them. He couldn&#8217;t direct them specifically to give me a teaching assistantship. That was not something that was possible, but what he could do was he could tell them if they didn&#8217;t find a way to give me a teaching assistantship that year, that the next year they would have none; he would take all the assistantships away. So I said, &#8220;Well, that sounds good.&#8221; So he said he would do that, and then I started thinking about what a bad idea it was to have a doctoral dissertation judged, you know, subjectively judged by a bunch of people who are really mad at me. So I wasn&#8217;t really sure [of] what I was going to do and I was still very upset that the lawyers were so inaccessible. So I saw a little notice in the paper that said the LSAT was being given on some day--I remember it was in June--and I just walked in off the street and took the LSAT. I did know some people that had gone to law school or started law school, and it always took them two or three years to get admitted, so it never dawned on me I&#8217;d get admitted because I&#8217;d already missed the deadline. The best I could hope for was to be wait-listed and I just didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d get in. At that time, the law school started on--I can&#8217;t remember--one was on semesters and one was on quarters, so the law school started before the communications classes started. The second or third day of law school, I got a call from the assistant dean or associate dean, Mary Jo Hoover, and she said, &#8220;Do you want to go to law school?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;You're kidding!&#8221; She said, &#8220;Nope, nope, we have an opening; somebody didn&#8217;t show. If you want to come, you can come.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay, where is it?&#8221; because I really had never--it never dawned on me that I&#8217;d get in. JD: How did you work out the financing so quick? WS: Well, it&#8217;s easier to get student loans for law and medicine than it is for&#8230; JD: &#8230; communication studies? WS: That was true back then, and so I wasn&#8217;t so worried about that. I could get student loans at that point. I remember going back to Chancellor Herndon and saying, &#8220;I really appreciate everything you did because, by the way, the communications college found me a scholarship--I mean a teaching assistantship.&#8221; So they were expecting me to start, and I went back to him and I said, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve been admitted to the law school. I never thought that would happen. I really don&#8217;t think I want to be judged on my dissertation by people that are angry with me.&#8221; [Laughter] JD: He probably nodded. WS: He said, &#8220;Yeah, my daughter went to law school. That&#8217;s a better place anyway." He said, &#8220;Well, do you want me to call them and tell them?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, I think I&#8217;ll go see the dean and explain to the dean why I&#8217;m declining the teaching assistantship.&#8221; So I did go to see the dean, and he could not understand why I was upset. Could not understand. They were just trying to help me. They were looking out for me. They never meant to be mean. They were just taking care of me. I tried to explain it to him nicely; he just never got it. So I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to law school.&#8221; [Laughter] So, off I went to law school. I started law school in [19]79, so that eight years in between, I had been pretty active in NOW. I&#8217;d been pretty active with the Women&#8217;s Center, serving on their board and doing events and so forth, so I&#8217;m sure that all of that probably helped me get the courage to just say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to do what I think is the right thing.&#8221; JD: You mentioned that it was your then-husband. So did you go through a divorce in the middle of all this as well? WS: Yes. [Laughter] Yes, well, actually, it happened the first year I was in law school, but it was coming for a while, so I wound up going through law school as a single parent with two kids, which was interesting. [Laughter] Challenging, but the kids were troopers. See, I started law school when my daughter started kindergarten, so she was five and my son was eight, and we made it in three years; we survived. JD: You said you were a member of the board of the Women&#8217;s Center. What programs do you remember helping them out with? WS: Well, I remember when we were in the Ely building, which is down here on Clinch Avenue. It had a wonderful mural painted on the side of it. Have you seen the pictures of it? JD: No, I need to walk down and see it. WS: Well, the mural&#8217;s not there anymore and the building has been sold, but that was during the days of the CETA grants, and the Women&#8217;s Center was a hub for training women in non-traditional occupations. So, we were training electricians and plumbers and things that paid better than traditional female occupations. That was part of the work that was done through the CETA grants, was to get women trained and placed as apprentices. There was, of course, no internet, so we collected information about all the community services and organizations and created [a rolodex] on five-by-seven cards, so that [women] could call in and say they needed whatever it was they needed [and] we could refer them to other sources. That was a really big function of the Women&#8217;s Center. We did a lot of cooperation with groups. For example, the Women&#8217;s Center had, if I remember correctly, five telephones, which was a really big deal then. So groups could come after hours and phone bank from the Women&#8217;s Center. NOW was phone-banking, I remember, specifically for the time extension on the Equal Rights Amendment, and we didn&#8217;t have the money to go lobby or to fly to Washington. So we would call people and ask them to write letters and to drop their letters by the Women&#8217;s Center, and instead of putting a stamp on it, leave the quarter. That&#8217;s what the postage was then, and then we collected them until we had enough quarters to buy a plane ticket. Then I put them all in a big briefcase and flew to Washington, D.C. and lobbied our senators and congressmen for the Equal Rights Amendment. That was a fun project, but we did a lot of phone-banking from the Women&#8217;s Center. It was used as a hub for that kind of activity. There were some programs to encourage women to work on being elected or appointed to office, getting on boards of the utilities and other boards and foundations and so forth. JD: Do you want to comment a little bit more about the struggle for the ERA? WS: Well, that was a huge one, and I really do have--I kept the literature because I was very frustrated that so much of women&#8217;s history, we just don&#8217;t save our own paper, so if you ever really need it, I&#8217;ve got a lot. JD: The Southern Historical Collection might really be interested in that. WS: Well, I&#8217;m not ready to give it away yet, but I might make some copies. [Laughter] But our local chapter was fairly small but had a big impact. JD: Was this the local chapter of NOW? WS: Yes. JD: Is Knoxville the head of state NOW too, or where is the state NOW headquarters? WS: It just moves around with whoever is elected state coordinator. But, the Knoxville chapter was relatively small. I remember we met in the Unitarian Church for a long time. We met in the Women&#8217;s Center after the Ely Building was taken over. I was never really comfortable with being confrontational; I guess that&#8217;s the Kansas upbringing coming out. JD: That&#8217;s very much a Kansas upbringing. [Laughter] WS: We found it very hard to find literature or materials. You couldn&#8217;t buy it because we didn&#8217;t have much money. I remember we found, or bought, went together and bought an old mimeograph. You know, one of those machines that you make copies with. It was in terrible shape, but we had a dental assistant in our chapter who had all those little dental tools and with those, she could keep it going most of the time. [laughter] We started writing our own literature, which was one of the most fun things, actually. Then we did some kind of action every month or some media event every month, something to try to keep the issue before everybody. One of the things we did was we took a--I&#8217;ve still got some--made cards the size of business cards that on one side had the bible verse about, you know, there&#8217;s neither male nor female; we&#8217;re all one in Christ Jesus, and on the other side had the full text of the ERA, all thirty-nine words or whatever it is. We just thought that in this community a religious base was a good contrast. I mean, it&#8217;s not all that different. So we would go on Sunday mornings to church parking lots and put those under the windshield wipers of the cars, just to make people juxtapose the two notions and realize that it wasn&#8217;t [an] anti-religious or anti-Christian point of view. I gave lectures on biblical support for NOW positions on the Equal Rights--a biblical support for the Equal Rights Amendment, the biblical support for abortion rights and things like that at churches. It was interesting because the churches, a lot of the groups in them were quite politically involved and quite opposed to women&#8217;s rights and the feminist movement, so I think they liked to have us come so they could shoot at us, so it was fun to go to the churches and use the biblical support. My background was perfect; I knew all those bible verses, so I could--I mean, I would have them look it up in their Bible and sometimes they&#8217;d say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s in my Bible!&#8221; [Laughter] So that was fun. JD: Teaching on the Bible can be used to justify many things. WS: Right. Absolutely. So that was fun. It was educational stuff. I know one Halloween we decided that it would be fun to do a set of--Martin Luther posted his objections to the Catholic Church on the door of the church on All Saint's Eve, which is Halloween or the night before Halloween--so we decided we would do the same sort of thing, so we got the original one and then we changed it to the issues that affected women in the churches in particular where, for the most part, women were supposed to be seen and not heard. We went around to the Knoxville churches; we taped them to the doors of the churches, and that resulted in a good dialogue, really, from a number of churches. I&#8217;m sure it probably annoyed some people, but it was nothing accusatory; those are the things I kept that you should see.

When there were parades, we&#8217;d get balloons and have printed on them--green balloons that, you know, &#8220;ERA NOW,&#8221; that kind, and fill them with helium and give them away to the kids, so the parents who really didn&#8217;t support the Equal Rights Amendment couldn&#8217;t say no to a free balloon for the kids, [laughter] so the streets were lined with &#8220;ERA NOW&#8221; balloons. That was funny, I thought. That was one of our favorite things to do for parades. We did as much as we could just to get the topic out there and get people talking about it. One, Congressman Duncan now, I was the ACTION chair, so I had to do some sort of media event for the Roe vs. Wade anniversary. JD: The tenth anniversary in [19]83 or one of the--? WS: I can&#8217;t remember exactly which one it was, but the Hyde Amendment was up for a vote. JD: It was either [19]77 or [19]78. WS: Yeah, and our congressman, the current John Duncan&#8217;s father, John Duncan had voted for the--. [Recorder stopped]..
