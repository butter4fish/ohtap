 VICTORIA PETERMANN: It&#8217;s July 16th, 2013. This is Victoria Petermann with Judith Fortney in her home in Durham, NC. We will be talking about her life history and her involvement with pro-choice movements and reproductive rights. Thank you very much Judith for doing this interview. JUDITH FORTNEY: You&#8217;re welcome. VP: First off tell me a little bit about your childhood. JF: Oh my goodness. Well, I was born in England before the Second World War, so I was a small child during the war. [I] lived with my mother and grandparents while my father was away, and then after the war had a very normal, ordinary childhood. VP: How did you get involved with women&#8217;s issues? JF: By accident and gradually and probably because of abortion. I used to work at an organization that was then called IFRP, International Fertility Research Program. It&#8217;s now called Family Health International (FHI), and I was hired to do abortion research, and we did studies of menstrual regulation, which is manual vacuum aspiration very early. We did studies of late term abortion, which at that time was not very safe, and we were trying to find a safer method. And we did studies of illegal abortion, women who had come into hospital for treatment of complications of illegal abortions, mostly but not entirely overseas. And I started work there in 1974. So it was after Roe versus Wade. So we did not do any of the illegal abortion studies in the U.S. But we did do some of the induced [abortions], both early and late. In my first week of work I got a data form from Thailand of a woman who had died after an illegal abortion, and in treating her, they withdrew two liters of pus from her abdomen from the infection. I forget now how it had been induced. But that was what alerted me to complications of illegal abortion and the need to get past that. VP: When you were doing this research, was it interacting a lot with women in person who had experience? JF: No, not at all. Almost never. We worked with doctors overseas, some of whom I met, most of whom I did not. I met them usually when they visited our offices to work on the analysis of their data. Sometimes I went to their hospitals. I did not meet the doctor who treated this woman who died. But anyway, I got used to having data forms from women who died. And I also worked on what was then called menstrual regulation, which is very early termination with a ( ) vacuum aspiration. And there were almost no complications from those, and what they defined as complications were really very minor. We never had a death and looking back, I don&#8217;t think we ever had a serious complication. We had some minor ones, especially at the beginning of a study, and the doctor was just learning the procedure. Some of those hospitals I visited. VP: Could you maybe describe for me what it felt like when you saw that first form of the woman in Thailand who died, just sort of like what was going through your head? JF: Oh I cried. Then I got used to it. But I went and shared it with someone and they said, &#8220;Oh yes, we get those all the time.&#8221; So I know better than most of the people on the board what illegal abortion is like. VP: So learning about those issues, you got used to seeing those forms a lot. How did that translate into you being active in safe abortion? JF: We had safe abortion in the U.S. then, and right after Roe versus Wade there were, as I recall, almost no restrictions. The problem then was to get women to come early. Sometimes they would wait until the second trimester, when it&#8217;s a more difficult procedure, and it has more complications. They were not very good methods at the time. And so the idea was to gradually bring down the gestational age at which people had the procedure. Now you have to understand there weren&#8217;t good pregnancy tests then either. And [phone ringing &#8211; break in recording] Sorry. Of Pregnancy tests. And the issues were if you do--there&#8217;s a problem with what are called false positives when the test says she&#8217;s pregnant and she isn&#8217;t pregnant. You do a procedure and it was not a necessary procedure. So even though it&#8217;s a small risk, you put a woman at risk when she didn&#8217;t need to be. If you get a false negative, then she doesn&#8217;t get the procedure when she needed it, and you end up doing it later, which also increases the risk. I remember we did a study in Bangladesh where we looked at the rate of false positives, which come down with time [of gestation], and the rate of false negatives, which go up with time. So the point at which they cross we decided was the safest time to do a procedure. Now that&#8217;s really not an issue, because you can pretty much get a pregnancy test if you just think about sex. But it was very much an issue at the time. In Bangladesh, where they often did procedures without a pregnancy test because nobody likes abortion, [and] in this way they didn&#8217;t know that they were having an abortion. Now it&#8217;s self-delusional, but since pregnancy tests weren&#8217;t very good anyway, it was decided to do it that way and then [it] became an issue of how many days late do you have to be before you&#8217;re pretty certain you&#8217;re pregnant. So menstrual regulation, that&#8217;s why it was called that for a while. I don&#8217;t remember how long it was called that. They had to be at least two weeks late before they would do a procedure. [Then] hospitals in developing countries frequently had an entire ward devoted to women with complications of illegal abortions. And I know that one hospital that I used to work with in Indonesia within a year of introducing menstrual regulation, they closed that ward. They didn&#8217;t need it anymore. VP: But that wasn&#8217;t an issue in North Carolina. JF: No, that was all in places where it was still illegal. I don&#8217;t recall that we ever did any studies--. Yes we did because we did some at UNC, some mid-trimester abortion studies we did at UNC. They tended to be very small studies, fewer than fifty cases. VP: How did you come to NARAL as a director, on the board of directors? JF: On the board of directors, well, they, in the previous iteration of NARAL in North Carolina --do I have the timing right?-- when Melissa Reed was the executive director of NARAL? VP: Early 2000s or in the [19]80s. JF: No, I can&#8217;t remember when it was and I have a feeling it was before the very first. It was the very first iteration of NARAL. VP: It was the mid-eighties to [19]90s. JF: [It] might have been, but I was asked to be on the board, and I felt I should not because of my position at Family Health International, and the second iteration I did a little bit. That was when Melissa Reed was executive director. But I didn&#8217;t want to serve on the board for the same reason. And after I retired, I felt it was okay to serve on the board. And John Stanback&#8217;s still working and he&#8217;s on the board. VP: Who is he? JF: Another board member, NARAL, and he works at Family Health International. But at the time I declined, Jesse Helms was still our senator, and I did not want to give him any reason to attack FHI since we had a lot of federal money. We were not allowed to spend any federal money after a certain point on abortion studies, not even the illegal ones. So Helms and Hatch, Orrin Hatch, shut down our abortion research, but most of the questions had been answered by that time. VP: Did your research lead-- to when researching abortion abroad, did that lead to developing solutions to the problems that you found? JF: Yes, we made menstrual regulation very widely available. Ipas produced the kits and we did these studies so we could monitor that particular operator&#8217;s safety, and we could flag. I can only remember one person who never seemed to get the hang of it and didn&#8217;t do very well, and we shut his study down. I shut his study down. VP: So tell me a little bit about Ipas. JF: Well, Ipas was started about the same time as FHI and FHI started in [19]73 and Ipas started in [19]74. It was started by USAID [United States Agency for International Development], which started FHI, because of the need for someone to make these kits. And we distributed them widely across the world. VP: They were started in Chapel Hill, right, Ipas? JF: Yes. And FHI, although now they&#8217;re in the Triangle. [FHI] used to be in the bank building in the main drag of Franklin Street when I first started there. VP: So did it grow a lot when you first started? JF: Well, I was employee number sixty something, and there were probably fewer than fifty people there when I started. Now there are at least 2,000 worldwide, and the office in Nigeria is bigger than the office here. Because any big country with a program and we have, that&#8217;s an AIDS [Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome] program. The AIDS programs take a lot of personnel. VP: Could you maybe tell me how you started working with FHI? JF: Well, soon after I finished my Ph.D. I was looking for a job, and there weren&#8217;t very many. One that I applied for in Chapel Hill with the population lab--my degree was in demography--paid me $750 a year, which would have been taxable and I had a post-doc that was $750 a year, $7,500 I&#8217;m sorry, and not taxable so I stayed where I was for a year. And then I got a job I can&#8217;t remember, the Low Income Housing Development Corporation, and it was doing a survey of housing in the rural South, and as a demographer, all the research techniques were pretty much the same. Houses have birth rates and death rates [just like people], you don&#8217;t migrate but everything else is somewhat [the same]. So we interviewed builders and bankers and realtors and consumers to see how people made housing choices with very little money. That was funded by OEO. VP: Which is? JF: The Office of [Economic] Opportunity, which Richard Nixon abolished. So I was then out of a job. OEO; I think Lyndon Johnson started it. And it was a good organization, but probably its time had [come], it had fulfilled its mission to the extent that they knew what programs worked, and so it was not a disaster that Nixon abolished it except for me personally. I needed a new job. I went to IFRP as it was then, and they offered a job at considerably less money than I had been making and I declined it. Then about a week later I thought, you know, &#8220;There are a lot of opportunities there, and I can take a lower salary for a little while.&#8221; Then, it was part of the university. IFRP was part of the university, part of the Carolina Population Center, which still exists. So I went back and said, &#8220;Having thought about it I [decided that], if it&#8217;s still available, I&#8217;ll take it&#8221;. And then about less than six months later, we left the university, and it took me about three years to get up to my previous salary but I did. So that&#8217;s how I got [there], and I was hired to do abortion research. To begin with, I did some maternity care research and eventually that became a greater percentage of what I did. I also for a while was head of the department, reproductive epidemiology. We mostly worked on the non-contraceptive risks and benefits of contraception. We were not involved in estimating how effective different kinds of pills are and different IUDs [intrauterine devices]. But we looked at the other effects, not the contraceptive effects. We did a lot of work with reproductive cancers, breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian. We did some work with sickle cell anemia. We tried to do work with rheumatic heart disease, because it&#8217;s disastrous to be pregnant if you have rheumatic heart disease. What else did we do? You get the idea. We also did some work with the impact on STDs [sexually transmitted diseases], including AIDS, and that work is still going on today. VP: Focusing in the U.S. or abroad or both? JF: It&#8217;s almost all overseas. If you&#8217;re HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus] positive, you don&#8217;t want to get pregnant, and you [do] want to know what the effects of pills or IUDs and so on are [on your] HIV. Or if [your partner] is positive and you&#8217;re negative and you don&#8217;t want to use condoms, what are the safest methods. Basically, you want to use condoms though. VP: Yeah. What has been one of the biggest challenges in working with [FHI] emotionally, personally? What was one of the hardest things about working with or working around and doing research on illegal abortion? JF: From a research perspective, probably the biggest problem is that many [women] never get to a hospital, so they never get into your research base. It&#8217;s very difficult, and I've worked in maternal mortality too, death in childbirth, and I&#8217;m much more known for that now than for the abortion research, which is old. It&#8217;s very hard to estimate how many, what percentage of people die because they don&#8217;t come to hospital, and when they do, they often don&#8217;t tell you the truth. You don&#8217;t always know what methods they used unless you find remains of the method in the uterus or in the belly. And obviously you can&#8217;t do control[led] trials. You can&#8217;t randomize. You can randomize treatment, but you can&#8217;t control the condition when you start out. It&#8217;s not like doing a randomized controlled trial of contraceptive pills when people don&#8217;t care which kind of pill they get. It&#8217;s easy to make it blind, so they don&#8217;t know which kind they&#8217;re getting. But for delivering abortion, it&#8217;s impossible to do that, so your studies are never quite as good as [randomized] clinical trials. There are quite a few scientific challenges with doing this. It occurs to me that in North Carolina now we should be trying to collect data from abortion clinics, to show just how safe it is. It&#8217;s something I want to talk to Suzanne [Buckley&#8212;NARAL&#8217;s Executive Director] about. I don&#8217;t know who we would get to fund it. VP: Considering recent legislation that might be-- JF: Hmm? VP: Considering recent legislation that might be a good idea to-- JF: If we have any clinics still left to-- VP: That is true. JF: But well, as I said I don&#8217;t remember any life threatening complications in the studies we did overseas with the early terminations. I remember very few with the late ones too, and those were very old fashioned methods. We had some interesting discussions on what to do when you had a baby born alive from an abortion, and depending on the method you used, that was possible. I remember asking an Indian doctor what they did and he said, &#8220;Listen, we can&#8217;t keep newborns alive that are born prematurely that are very much wanted babies.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely not an issue for us. If it happens we treat it like a newborn,&#8221; which Kermit Gosnell did not do. VP: Who? JF: Oh, he&#8217;s the man in Philadelphia that ran the dreadful abortion clinic and what these loonies don&#8217;t realize [is] that he was there because safe alternatives weren&#8217;t [easily accessible] VP: This is a more broad question about you, but do you consider yourself a feminist? JF: I didn&#8217;t used to. I guess I do now. Back in the days of Betty Friedan and those early feminists, I did not consider myself a feminist, but when people start legislating choice and [think they] have to make this decision for you because you might be sorry if you make the wrong decision--it&#8217;s things like that that turn me into a feminist. VP: Why didn&#8217;t you agree with Betty Friedan and feminists back in the [19]70s? JF: It didn&#8217;t seem relevant to me at the time. I was doing what I wanted to do. And I didn&#8217;t feel that [I] had [been] limited, and I still don&#8217;t think that I ever felt limited by being a woman or a girl. I was one of three sisters. It was made clear to us that we had to go university. We had to have careers, and so it didn&#8217;t really cross my mind that other people didn&#8217;t have those opportunities. VP: Had your mother gone to university? JF: No, my mother left school at fourteen. And she always said you have to be able to support yourself. I've not been able to get her to talk about this, but she may have had a friend who wanted to leave her husband but didn&#8217;t feel that she could because she couldn&#8217;t support herself. I don&#8217;t know that; I&#8217;m just guessing. My mother never had a job. Except after we all left home, she did become a magistrate. But I don&#8217;t think she was paid to do that. She also ran for political office and won, but I never asked her if she was paid for it. But her mother [my grandmother] supported herself for a long time. She owned a dress shop. She worked until she was sixty-five. So I came from a potentially feminist background, but that word didn&#8217;t exist then. VP: Have some of the same issues that you&#8217;ve seen happen in North Carolina, have you seen them happen back home at all in the UK [United Kingdom]? JF: Abortion was legalized several years earlier in the UK. But there is not in the UK anything like the right to life movement. There is one, but it&#8217;s much, much smaller, much less influential, and the members are generally regarded as nutcases. They&#8217;re nowhere near as mainstream as they are here. VP: Interesting. JF: But even when it was [illegal], when I was in college it was still illegal, but people got safe illegal abortions all the time, and you could get nearly any doctor to agree to [one]. I guess they were still illegal but medically supervised. I don&#8217;t remember it being a huge issue. I don&#8217;t know any girl in my school who got pregnant. I suspect they were there, and I just didn&#8217;t know about them. So it was a long time before I realized the need for it, never heard anybody talk about it. VP: But you were getting your Ph.D. at Duke when Roe v. Wade was going on. Is that correct? JF: Yes, I graduated in [19]71. VP: Okay. What was that like? Was it really a big issue on campus? JF: I remember going to a talk when I was a student there, and I don&#8217;t remember who gave it. I know that I was so grossed out by the techniques used that I didn&#8217;t stay and did my best to forget about it. So it really didn&#8217;t hit me what an important issue it was until I started reading the data collection forms from overseas. VP: You didn&#8217;t call yourself a feminist, and now you call yourself a feminist. Could you describe for me the moment you decided you could consider yourself a feminist? JF: No, I don&#8217;t know when that was. I remember once at work learning what a male colleague earned, [they always kept salaries very secret and still do]. And it was about $10,000 a year more than I earned, and he was a total incompetent. I don&#8217;t remember how we found out his salary. We two or three women shared information on salaries and then we went to the president and said, &#8220;We want a raise.&#8221; And his solution was much better. He fired the guy. So then of course, we didn&#8217;t have other standards to say, to demand raises. But&#8212; VP: You went with other people, other women who you worked with. JF: Yeah, I only remember one other person, but it seems to me there were a couple more people who were willing to say how much they earned. And that organization always pays MDs [medical doctor] a lot more than Ph.Ds. When I worked at WHO [World Health Organization], they paid the same. They don&#8217;t call you doctor if you&#8217;re a Ph.D., only if you&#8217;re an MD, but I&#8217;ll take the money over the title any day. So I don&#8217;t really consider myself a strong feminist. Although, as I say that I wonder. Have you seen these old ladies at the things [protest rallies] who wear [t-shirts saying], &#8220;This is what a radical feminist looks like.&#8221; VP: Like the Raging Grannies. JF: I didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what they were called. VP: Are you talking about the women who sing and have the pins? JF: Oh no. VP: That was the Raging Grannies. JF: Okay. No, the women who look extremely ordinary and say, &#8220;This is what a radical feminist looks like.&#8221; And, of course, Gloria Steinem, who is a radical feminist, is absolutely gorgeous still. She was our main speaker a few years ago [at] our fundraising event, and she is [a] very beautiful woman. VP: Yes she is. Did you get to talk to her at all? JF: Um hmm. And I think she&#8217;s my age, but she&#8217;s still very good looking. But I raised a feminist daughter and a feminist son and feminist granddaughters. I guess I was and am. VP: How do you consider your children to be feminists? JF: Well, my daughter never felt constrained by her gender and what she wanted to do, and she went to medical school and so on. My son is now the head of the department and in a university, and he pays attention to making sure there are enough women on the staff, [to their pay], and things like that. It&#8217;s hard for men to be a feminist. You call them equal opportunity people, not feminists, but the principles are the same. Now my first husband was in the physics department and-- VP: At UNC? JF: At Duke. VP: At Duke okay. JF: And there are very few women physicists. It was an issue about bathrooms, and there were four floors to the physics department, and only one of them had a women&#8217;s bathroom on it, and there was some fuss to change that. Everyone said, &#8220; [But] we haven&#8217;t got any women. Why do we have to build a bathroom?&#8221; And I remember when they had a woman candidate &#8211; this might have been my critical moment &#8211; there was a woman candidate for a tenure track position, and I remember we were socializing with another physics couple and the man, [who was] the physicist, didn&#8217;t want to hire this woman because they&#8217;d then be under some pressure to promote her, which meant she&#8217;s then there for good. And he said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to have to promote someone who&#8217;s no good because then we&#8217;ll be stuck with them.&#8221; I said, "Well, what&#8217;s the problem? You promote plenty of men who aren&#8217;t any good and you&#8217;re stuck with them.&#8221; He got very huffy at that. So that might have been my feminist moment. VP: Your awakening. JF: Well, when I realized just how much [discrimination] there was. Now, with the bathrooms, they made the same argument with handicapped bathrooms. So it wasn&#8217;t directed particularly against women. They didn&#8217;t want to spend money when there was not yet a need, a perceived need for it. They ignored the few women undergraduate majors in physics. There can&#8217;t have been more than a couple. It&#8217;s much harder for a woman to get ahead in an all male field. Are you from North Carolina? VP: Um hmm. I&#8217;m from Raleigh. JF: Well, you know about Burroughs Wellcome, that used to be a major pharmaceutical company in the Triangle that was bought out by Glaxo. VP: Yes. JF: Well, there were two people there that got the Nobel Prize, and I've forgotten for what for. But they worked together, and I can&#8217;t remember his name [George H. Hitchings]. Her name was Gertrude Elion and he always got the credit for the research they did together. So she was very gratified when the Nobel committee noticed that she made a significant contribution too. But when they were asking her to go to Stockholm to get the prize, you can take immediate family with you. And she had never married. She didn&#8217;t have a husband and she didn&#8217;t have children. She wanted her nephew to go and they said, &#8220;Well, no we don&#8217;t pay for nephews.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Okay then I won&#8217;t go.&#8221; So they did [pay for him]. That was another little bit of discrimination she encountered. So it&#8217;s all gradual and builds up, but I didn&#8217;t really have a &#8220;one big moment&#8221;. Did you? VP: No, it was gradual. I like to say that my feminist awakening was being in Women&#8217;s Studies 101 in my first semester at UNC, but it is honestly just a build up of various problems I've seen and experienced. JF: Often quite small problems. VP: Um hmm. JF: In some ways, my mother was more of a feminist, although I never noticed that when I was growing up. But one time she and I went somewhere in England, and she met somebody she knew and introduced me and he said to me, &#8220;And what does your husband do dear?&#8221; Mother blew up at him. VP: How old were you? JF: Thirty. And I had barely noticed the insult. He sort of went, &#8220;What do you do dear?&#8221; I&#8217;m curious, do you know how many women do come upon it gradually? VP: I don&#8217;t know, I'd assume most women who identify as feminists maybe. I don&#8217;t know. I would be interested to ask my friends who identify as feminists if they had a moment or if it was over time. JF: Yeah. Are you still doing classes in that? VP: Um hmm. JF: Ask them. Ask the teacher. And I wonder how it&#8217;s different for African Americans for example. Do they suddenly realize one day, &#8220;Gosh, I&#8217;m being discriminated against,&#8221; or are they told from birth that they are? I suspect it&#8217;s a different process. VP: I think it really depends on the person and their parents&#8212; JF: And where they grow up. There was a program yesterday on NPR [National Public Radio] about women bomber pilots in Russia during the World War Two, and someone has just written a book about it. It&#8217;s called The Night Witches, because that&#8217;s what the regiment was called. One woman in particular, who died last week in her nineties, flew 800 missions in a wood and canvas plane. U.S. bomber pilots, after twenty-five missions, they were given something else to do. And this was an all women&#8217;s regiment flying bombers during World War Two, sixty years before American women got the right to fly a bomber. And we don&#8217;t think of Russia as a bastion of feminism, do we? VP: Not really, interesting. You&#8217;ve been going to Moral Mondays and coming to the rallies that NARAL and Planned Parenthood. What&#8217;s been your personal take on that? What have been some things you&#8217;ve seen that have affected you? JF: Well, I don&#8217;t particularly enjoy going to them. I go to them because I ought to. I don&#8217;t deal with all this revivalism that they have there. VP: Can you tell me what you mean by that? JF: Oh, Reverend Barber gave a long emotional talk yesterday about Florida and Trayvon Martin, and I wanted to say, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, yeah I feel the same way. Let&#8217;s get on with what we&#8217;re here for.&#8221; Too much praying, but the thing I do like about them is they&#8217;re probably two-thirds women, do you think? VP: Probably. JF: There are people your age and old ladies and ordinary people and every kind of person you can imagine there&#8212;black and white, old and young, rich and poor&#8212;all with the same [tent]. Well, there are a lot of women there for other reasons than feminism, like teachers, it is women who move along these issues. Partly I think because they&#8217;re less confrontational and less threatening than men, they&#8217;re more effective or at least they&#8217;re perceived as less confrontational and less threatening. They may not really be so. VP: Do you think that&#8217;s a stereotype about women? JF: No, I think women just approach problems differently. They don&#8217;t have the urge to fight, which I think men have some of that. Usually there&#8217;s a big overlap, but some women fight. I've been in the emergency room and seen women who have been fighting. One of the things I think that&#8217;s influenced my life, and I really only just realized it, is there&#8217;s very little I&#8217;m afraid of. When I first came to this country, I was twenty-one. I was a teaching assistant at University of Wisconsin, and one of my students said to me something like, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid to leave home at your age?&#8221; I can&#8217;t remember exactly how she put it. I asked her how old she was. She was two years older than me. She was saying, &#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t possibly do that.&#8221; I&#8217;ll go nearly anywhere. This year I went to Turkey; last year I went to Mongolia. I don&#8217;t find new situations and new places to be threatening. I've done that all my life and never asked permission to do things. I did them and if I needed to apologize later I did. But I've lived in several countries and never in a threatening position. I never was a Peace Corps kind of person where the Jeep drops you off and you walk for two days to get to where you&#8217;re going to live. I like my creature comforts. But I&#8217;ll do nearly anything and more so than most people I know, much more so than my sisters for example. And so when people look at me and say-- the implication is, &#8220;You&#8217;re a woman and you did that.&#8221; That annoys me a bit. VP: Did that happen often? JF: Um, no and it&#8217;s not generally explicit. But I have friends who think I&#8217;m brave to drive to Arizona by myself, which to me is, &#8220;Duh. [laughs] Why wouldn&#8217;t I? I have a husband, but I do things without him and he does things without me too.&#8221; Anyway&#8212; VP: Is there anything we didn&#8217;t talk about that you would like to talk about? JF: I don&#8217;t think so. VP: Thank you very much for your sharing everything that you did. JF: You&#8217;re welcome. I find myself wondering what good it will do the Southern Oral History Program. VP: You never know. Somebody might be looking you up one day and want to know more about you or something. JF: Well, they can Google me. When people search those records, do you have people in slots, in silos as they would say today? I mean do you have political activists, feminists, historians? VP: We don&#8217;t label people. I mean&#8212; JF: So how do people find if they want to interview feminists--, how do you search on things? VP: If you were going to look for a feminist, you would probably go to the section on the Long Women&#8217;s Movement, which includes feminists but also non-feminist alike. It&#8217;s not categorized by identities. It&#8217;s general overarching themes. JF: How would you search on white racial activists? VP: Like civil rights activists? JF: Yeah. For example soon after we came to North Carolina, there were the sit-ins in Chapel Hill, and there were quite a few Duke people involved. How would you do a search on something like that? VP: Probably go to the search engine on the website for SOHP [Southern Oral History Program]. You could either type in and search either Greensboro sit-ins, or you could go on a different route, go through, they have a page where they have all their themes and their projects, go to the Long Civil Rights Movement. And there will probably be some categories under there that you could browse through and probably find something like you were looking for. It&#8217;s a bit difficult because there&#8217;s a lot there and there are a lot of interviews that they have. It takes a lot of sifting unless you have the specific name that you&#8217;re looking for. JF: That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking because the civil rights movement in Durham in particular was and the newspaper is, you probably don&#8217;t take the newspaper, but there have little civil rights stories from fifty years ago and so on in the paper quite often. But there were people who were very active behind the scenes, people like Mary Semans who died recently in her nineties who was always very much a civil rights person, but that&#8217;s not how she&#8217;d be identified. She&#8217;d be identified as promoting the arts kind of person. And I have no idea if she&#8217;s done an interview. She well might have. She&#8217;s very well known in the state. There were three governors there at her funeral. I&#8217;m intrigued by how your search engine would work. VP: There are also, we put tags on interviews based on particular things that come up during the interview. So if anybody talked about civil rights in their interview, you could search civil rights and they could come up. JF: Oh I see. Because that little psychological game use ten words to describe yourself, I would not put feminist first by any means. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking you that. I think of myself as a scientist first. I probably would include feminist in ten words but not the first five. VP: What would you first five be, scientist? JF: Foreigner. [laughs] I very much still feel a foreigner in the U.S., partly because of the politics. American politics is ridiculous. There are strong parties in Britain, but they talk to each other and they can discuss. In parliament they discuss serious problems. You cannot discuss a serious problem in the U.S. Congress, let alone in the state house. So I very much feel a foreigner. Anyway, I&#8217;m interested in how your search engine works. I get identified as a foreigner all the time. Somebody yesterday said, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Durham.&#8221; I've lived here most of my life, two-thirds of my life, much longer than you have. VP: Oh I have one more question. I forgot to ask you. But do you see yourself as part of a women&#8217;s movement or&#8212; JF: No, not really. I see myself as part of the reproductive rights movement more than the women&#8217;s movement. VP: That makes sense considering what you said about being a feminist. JF: I went to two of the abortion rights marches in Washington. I don&#8217;t remember the years. VP: There was one in 2004. JF: I didn&#8217;t go to that. There was one long before that. My daughter was still in college. She graduated in [19]90. So this would&#8217;ve been [19]89, was the last one, and I went to one before that. Gosh, didn&#8217;t know it was so long ago. I guess the right to lifers got moving as soon as Roe versus Wade was passed. VP: They did. What were the marches like? JF: Well, the first one, which I can&#8217;t remember when it was, we were all supposed to wear white, and you were supposed to park at the Pentagon, which has the world&#8217;s biggest parking lot and then take the Metro and get off at a particular station. Well, when I got to that station, I couldn&#8217;t get off because there was no room on the platform. There were so many women dressed in white. I had to go to the next stop and walk back. The next one was incredibly well organized. It was emphasizing universities and colleges, and so a college would send busloads of people and they would march together with a little UNC sign. And so when I arrived, I planned to march with the American Public Health Association [APHA], but I thought I would go find my daughter first and then go find the APHA. And she went to Haverford College in Pennsylvania. There were a couple hundred students in Haverford. I went and said hello, and then I realized how far away and how many thousands of people I'd have to wade through so I stayed with that group, and afterwards it was billed as &#8220;The March of Mothers and Daughters&#8221;, which we didn&#8217;t know at the time. But there was great fear at that point that young women didn&#8217;t care about it because they didn&#8217;t know what it was like before. And that was a turning point in that. There were also a bunch of people who carried a sign with a name on it. And you didn&#8217;t know if this was a relative who died from an abortion or what. It was just unexplained. And I remember an old lady being pushed in a wheelchair, and she held a sign with a name on it. So maybe it&#8217;s time for another one. VP: That&#8217;s a sentiment that I've heard echoed today that young women are not involved. JF: But I think they do. They do now because you go to those Moral Mondays and there are plenty of young women there. I also think that times are different and that if we [have to] go back to illegal abortions, they&#8217;ll be much safer. They&#8217;ll be medical ones, and much, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll go back to coat hangers and turkey basters full of Lysol. So we will manage, but NARAL might be advised to look into how to do the mechanics of that. VP: Yeah. JF: And it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m willing to go to jail for. And I've always said that, not to be arrested for protesting at the legislature, but I would illegally provide medical abortions for people and go to prison for it. But let&#8217;s hope we don&#8217;t have to. VP: Really. JF: Do you think most people your age are aware of the issue? Now you&#8217;ve been in a feminist 101 class so-- VP: It depends on who I&#8217;m around. I live with six other women who most of them are chemistry or science majors, or they don&#8217;t even have to be science majors, but they&#8217;re not very [involved], they know what&#8217;s going on but not so much. They don&#8217;t really feel compelled to do much about it. JF: They know it but don&#8217;t feel it. VP: But then on the other hand I also know plenty of people who feel really strongly about it and are willing to go to Moral Mondays or to turn up at the legislature, send them an email or call or something. So it&#8217;s half and half. Yeah. JF: Interesting. Well, it&#8217;s probably never been more than half and half. VP: That&#8217;s true. JF: I had a college roommate who wanted an abortion, and you&#8217;ll never believe this. But travel agents had package deals. You could get an airline ticket to London that included an appointment to the clinic, a hotel and theatre tickets. That was for people who could afford it. That was a bit of an eye-opener. It had not occurred to me that that might be necessary. And I know other people who have been to Canada and had much less comfortable experiences. Talk to Cynthia [Greenlee; NARAL Board member] if she&#8217;ll talk to you. She&#8217;s a busy person. But she is really interesting. VP: Okay. Well, I mean this is great talking to you. It was really inspiring. JF: Really?! VP: Yeah. You&#8217;re amazing. I mean, your stories and everything are really meaningful. JF: Good. Then I&#8217;m glad. VP: So I feel like I've learned something too. So that&#8217;s always good. But yeah, thank you very much. JF: I haven&#8217;t told you the half of it yet. VP: I could come back...
