 Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell: I wanted to go ahead and start. This is Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell. I am here in Atlanta, Georgia on August 18 interviewing Loretta Ross, national coordinator of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective. I got it all right, right? Loretta Ross: Yeah. CGD: Okay. So, I wanted to just start out and talk to you&#8212;. I know you&#8217;ve done other interviews before, but I wanted to get a sense of where you grew up and who you grew up with, kind of get a sense of who you are. So, you&#8217;re from Texas? LR: Yeah. My name&#8217;s Loretta Ross and I am originally from Temple, Texas. That&#8217;s our family seat, which now, sort of coincidentally, we have a family reunion there in two weeks. I&#8217;m from a large farming family. Actually we moved to Texas in 1867 from Alabama because we were slaves on a peanut plantation outside of Selma, and then after the Civil War and the Klan violence started my family, Mr. John Walker, our ancestor, made his way down from Selma to Mobile, caught a boat from Mobile to Nacogdoches, Texas, and then we went from Nacogdoches, Texas to Bell County, Texas, which became the family seat in 1867. We were hog farmers and we still are hog farmers. I&#8217;ve still got members of my family who raise hogs in Bell County. So I&#8217;m a Southerner through and through and we&#8217;re one of those black families that&#8217;s fortunate enough to know our ancestors back to 1844. My son&#8217;s the family genealogist so he&#8217;s actually done the work to find out, and few enslaved families can go back as far as we can and actually know for a fact who we are and where we came from and all of that. So I&#8217;ve always felt that because I have such a large intact family&#8212;I&#8217;m one of eight kids myself&#8212;. CGD: Where are you in the breakdown? LR: Number six. There were five boys and three girls and not only I&#8217;m in the middle of the pack but I&#8217;m the middle girl with an older and a younger sister. So I&#8217;m a Southerner through and through and proud to be from the South. Now my father was in the service, Alexander Ross, and he was a Caribbean immigrant. CGD: Did he come himself from&#8212;or did he come with his parents? LR: Well therein lies a story. This was in the 1910s, right after World War I, when the country was desperate for labor to replace that which had been lost in the war so they released the immigration restrictions, bringing in a lot of Caribbean immigrants, and that&#8217;s what helped create the Harlem Renaissance, you know, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, all of that. Well my [father] came over with his six siblings from Jamaica but my father was only four years old at the time, and that would have been 1922. His actual parents didn&#8217;t get a Visa but there was this couple named the Dunmoodys who did get a Visa who didn&#8217;t have kids, so they actually brought the six Ross kids over with them on their Visa, so I never knew my paternal grandparents and my father lost touch with his paternal grandparents. I&#8217;ve been back to Jamaica and found relatives but that was in the 1980s. They moved to Baltimore. My father joined the service when he was sixteen, lying about his age and spent his life in the army and retired in 1963 and moved us back to San Antonio, because we&#8217;d lived a military life, moving every six to eighteen months. So he ended up, of course, moving to San Antonio and dying in San Antonio. Both my parents are deceased now and one of my brothers is deceased. There&#8217;s still seven of us around and forty-something grandchildren, about twenty, twenty-five great-grandchildren. CGD: It keeps going. LR: It keeps going. I actually am a great-grandmother myself, so I love seeing the generations in front of me. CGD: How many great-grandchildren? LR: Two greats, one grand, one son. CGD: Wow. So it&#8217;s interesting because your father&#8217;s family that got made through immigration just kind of shows all the different forms that the black family has taken. LR: Exactly, exactly. He has one remaining sibling alive, all the rest have since passed, and she&#8217;s in a nursing home in Baltimore where they were raised. My son actually just went and saw her a couple of weeks ago, because my son is so into family. As an only child he&#8217;s put carrying the family history on his shoulders so he&#8217;s the one that goes around and visits the senior citizens in the nursing homes and connects their histories and stuff. He&#8217;s the family historian and the family connector, and he gets that directly from my mother who was that. It&#8217;s kind of like it skipped me and went straight to him, so we&#8217;re proud of him. CGD: Were you like your dad, if you didn&#8217;t get the connecting gene from your mother? LR: I got my dad&#8217;s genes. I got my dad&#8217;s gap. Actually out of all of the kids I&#8217;m the one with the gap, and I actually have his personality as well. Dad and I spent a lifetime communicating wordlessly. We could look at each other across the room and have a whole paragraph, a whole conversation [Laughs] because we had each other&#8217;s personality, and I find that my grandson has my personality and so me and my grandson have much more in common than he has with his father or I have with my son. So it&#8217;s like personalities go every other generation in our family. My son is very parochial. I could never get him to do any international travel with me growing up. My grandson is waiting for me to take him to China in a couple of years, at his suggestion. That&#8217;s the first place he wants to see. CGD: But he&#8217;s going to give you time to work on it, get it all together. LR: Oh, but this has been a plan since he was age ten, and the deal I cut with him was that as soon as he was strong enough to carry my suitcases we were going. CGD: That&#8217;s a good plan. LR: So I&#8217;ve got two more years, because every time I see him he flexes the muscle and shows me he&#8217;s ready. [Laughs] But he has a wanderlust like I do so I&#8217;m really, really proud of him. The reason I&#8217;m a great-grandmother, by the way, is not because my fourteen-year-old has had two kids, but my son married a woman with children already and so her daughter, Keisha, has had two children, and so that makes my son a step-grandfather and me a step-great-grandmother. CGD: I saw a picture of you online in the high school drill team. LR: [Laughs] Oh, that&#8217;s a story. CGD: And how you founded it, but I&#8217;m wondering if you always had the drive to found and be kind of an organizer, from that picture. LR: In looking back that&#8217;s probably true. I don&#8217;t think I was particularly smarter than anybody but I was advantaged by the fact that I was educated in military schools for the most part, which were more academically rigorous than civilian schools, so I found that every time we moved again and I ended up in a civilian school I automatically made the honors class just because of the training military schools offered, like teaching me to speed read in the sixth grade and typing and stuff that wasn&#8217;t routine in the civilian schools but were in the military schools. Then because I went to predominantly white schools there was a lack, particularly in the &#8217;60s, of concomitant activities for black students that the white kids enjoyed. For example at my predominantly white school there wasn&#8217;t a prayer of a black girl becoming a cheerleader, so when I looked around and saw that there was a men&#8217;s drill team but there wasn&#8217;t a girl&#8217;s drill team I was like, why not? This could be something that black and Latina girls could excel at, since we&#8217;re barred by custom, tradition, and racism from being on the pep squad, which the cheerleading team was called. So I went to the ROTC head and asked if I could do this, and perhaps, you know, being raised in the military probably had some impact on it as well. I asked if I could and he gave me the manual for starting a drill team and rifle stocks for practicing with and there it went. It was because, I think, of the social exclusion from the extracurricular activities that the whites had, because integration was still dicey in the &#8217;60s. CGD: So this was late &#8217;60s? LR: Yeah. I started the drill team in tenth grade, so that would have been &#8217;68. You know, &#8217;68 was a tumultuous year nationally. [Laughs] To be quite honest, and I hate to even confess to this, also it gave me a way to exclude the white girls, because when they tried out for the drill team they obviously couldn&#8217;t master the intricate dance steps and drills that I made a condition of being able to join the team, so I was able to use apparently objective criteria. [Laughs] CGD: It&#8217;s like a poll tax or a literacy test. [Laughs] LR: But we did, I mean we were a drill team, so you had to be able to do marching steps, competitive marching steps with some finesse, which wasn&#8217;t that difficult for many of the black or the Mexican American girls but was incredibly difficult for the white girls. CGD: Why was it difficult for the white girls? LR: Because they just weren&#8217;t used to the dances that we did. I mean of course the steps I designed were based on things like the Jerk and the Boogaloo [Laughs] and things that were part of our culture, and I was able to take the manual and stretch it. As long as we knew how to do all the cornering and the drills and the about faces and stuff like that in competitive drill you could actually take a lot of&#8212;. The issue was the coordinated precision, not the content of the step itself. Whatever step you did, we all had to do it like a well oiled machine, so you couldn&#8217;t allow somebody&#8212;. It was like being in the band, because I was in the band too. You just can&#8217;t allow somebody to be a half step behind, trying to catch up, so it was about proficiency, and what I&#8217;m self critical of is that at fourteen, which is when I did this, I didn&#8217;t have the consciousness to offer them additional tutoring or additional practice. It was hard enough building the drill team but I hadn&#8217;t learned enough about management or leadership at the time to say well if someone&#8217;s slow or can&#8217;t keep up then it&#8217;s my responsibility to help them. Of course you learn later on in life but at the time I was smug about the fact that there was something that all the black and Latina girls who had been excluded from every other basically&#8212;. I mean we could get into some academic extracurriculars, like I was in the honor society, I was in the science club, but anything that was based on social relations, because what they had done was&#8212;. My school had fifteen hundred kids and before desegregation had maybe fifty black kids, so we were a minority within a majority school. Then my senior year of high school they closed down Phillis Wheatley, which was the black high school, and then bused a lot of kids over, but that created the white flight and for my senior year we had two of everything because we had the black cheerleaders from Phillis Wheatley and then the all white cheerleaders at Sam Houston. We had a black band, we had a white band, and we had a lot of racial conflict in the school because of that. CGD: Which school system was this? LR: San Antonio independent school system. So, we were on the front line for the desegregation struggles, and it didn&#8217;t help that the Black Power movement was growing at the time, because &#8217;68 was also when I went to an afro and stopped the pressing of my hair, which outraged and horrified not only my mother but everybody in school. I started wearing a dashiki and everybody thought I was a representative of the Black Panthers on campus, and I didn&#8217;t know a damn thing about political struggle or the Black Panthers or anything. It was a fashion statement. I was so happy to stop pressing my hair that the rest of the look just came along with that. [Laughs] CGD: Did you have the pressing comb on the stove? LR: Yeah, we had that, but my mother also every two weeks would take us to the local beauty college or beauty school and so every Saturday we were at the beauty shop and my hair would never grow longer than an inch or so. So it was a lot of ear burning and scalp burning that took place because I never had the long flowing locks to press. My hair did not grow to waist length until I started dreading in 1980. So it really was liberating to be freed from the scabs and the burns and the pressing comb for me. It truly was. [Laughs] So no one was more happy about the Black Power movement than me but it was because of hair liberation. I was still entirely too politically unconscious to really know the significance of what was going on in terms of race relations, and a large part of that was because the military insulated us from race relations. I mean there was the question of desegregating the military in the &#8217;40s but that was before I was born. My father had to endure that but I didn&#8217;t. Because he was an E-9 master sergeant and we lived in the NCO neighborhood he outranked most of the other people in our neighborhoods, because they had officers&#8217; neighborhoods and NCO neighborhoods, and so Daddy outranked most of the people. So I remember being maybe eight or ten years old the first time I heard the word &#8220;nigger.&#8221; CGD: In Texas. LR: Huh? CGD: In Texas. LR: Yeah, it would have been&#8212;. No, it was actually in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. CGD: Okay. Because you moved. LR: That&#8217;s where we were stationed at the time, before Dad retired. That was his last post. I was playing with my best friend, Debbie, and, you know, kids fight over a doll or something. We were fighting over who&#8217;s going to swing or who was going to&#8212;I don&#8217;t even remember what the subject was, but she called me a nigger. She said, &#8220;You&#8217;re a nigger,&#8221; and I had no idea what it was, so I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re a nigger too.&#8221; Then we just laughed about it and went on and continued to play, no big deal. CGD: So Debbie was white? LR: Yeah. CGD: Okay. What did she look like? LR: Who knows? [Laughs] CGD: [Laughs] LR: She was a little white girl that I played with, right? So that night at dinner I innocently asked my mom, I said, &#8220;Mom, what&#8217;s a nigger?&#8221; My mother went ballistic. &#8220;Where did you hear that word? Who called you that?&#8221; It was as if I had said the worst curse word possible at the dinner table. Then I became afraid and I wanted to protect Debbie because I don&#8217;t want to get her in trouble. I was obviously in trouble for repeating it; I don&#8217;t want to get Debbie in trouble, so I wouldn&#8217;t tell her where I heard it. [Laughs] And that&#8217;s when I first realized that it was a dirty word. I didn&#8217;t know&#8212;and I still didn&#8217;t get no explanation from her. She still didn&#8217;t tell me what it meant. So it wasn&#8217;t until a couple years later that I figured out what the word meant, but it was like&#8212;. It was the same reaction I had from my mom when I asked her what she used a hot water bottle for, and she was using it for douching but she was not about to tell her daughter when I asked at eight or nine what that hot water bottle was doing hanging in the bathroom. [Laughs] It was that same kind of, you shouldn&#8217;t talk about this, response. CGD: Do you think that was because of the time or do you think that was your mother, or why do you think she didn&#8217;t want to talk about that? If you didn&#8217;t talk about the hot water bag I&#8217;m assuming you didn&#8217;t talk about sexuality in other ways. LR: My mother was extremely repressed sexually and I did not understand why, but what was commonly known was that my brother, her last child, was born in 1955 and she stopped having sex with my father then and they still remained married until they both died. We didn&#8217;t properly understand why and as kids you don&#8217;t actually peek into your parents&#8217; sex life, but when I got the job at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center&#8212;and therein is a story&#8212;that&#8217;s when my mother felt that I was the child to entrust her history to. I had been there a couple of years before she opened up to me, just surprisingly on one phone call. She just said, &#8220;Loretta, I&#8217;ve never told any of y&#8217;all this but I need to share this with you.&#8221; I said that we were a farming family and one of the characteristics of a farming family is that multiple generations live in the same house, and so my mother had been sexually abused&#8212;and her sisters, by the way&#8212;by an uncle, and for my mother it happened from age eight to age sixteen when she got married to leave home, and that created a lot of sexual trauma in my mother that she never had any counseling for and healing from. The uncle ended up being in prison in a mental institution until he died, and even before my mother told me the story we got this notice saying Uncle Eli has died, and all the kids said, &#8220;Who is Uncle Eli? How come we&#8217;ve never heard of Uncle Eli? We know Uncle Jim, we know Uncle Eskie, we know Booker T.; how come we don&#8217;t know about Uncle Eli? How did we miss this uncle?&#8221; My mother said, &#8220;Oh, he was one of Big Mama&#8217;s children,&#8221; and that&#8217;s all she said about Uncle Eli, and nobody went to his funeral or anything. So Uncle Eli was like the big mystery but we weren&#8217;t curious enough to try to follow it up. Well it turns out Uncle Eli was the uncle that sexually abused all the girls in the family. So Mama never had a healthy relationship around sex and sexuality, and then when I became pregnant through incest, through a cousin, my mother went ballistic. She actually beat me for being pregnant. She was not healthy around sex and sexuality. I could never under&#8212;. And she did some really predictable but what seemed to be bizarre things at the time, like every time my father would take one of his daughters out&#8212;and me and my father were particularly close so I hung out with Daddy all the time. I was Daddy&#8217;s girl. Daddy was the light of my life and I loved him to death. I know I was his favorite child and he knows he was my favorite parent, so there was no ambiguity at all about our relationship, but my mother would get so angry. I knew the minute I came home whatever I did it was not going to be right, and they believed in corporal punishment, so if I didn&#8217;t wash the dishes good enough that night I was going to get a whipping. It wasn&#8217;t until years later that I put together her fear around an adult male having a child outside of her eyes. My big sister told me, &#8220;She did the same with me.&#8221; She was just paranoid and it wasn&#8217;t until she told us her story, after we were already in our thirties [Laughs] that we were able to put all the pieces together, because what seemed to be craziness was actually PTSD. CGD: Were you able to tell your mother about the incest? LR: I had to. CGD: Was she able to hear it and process it? LR: [Pause] I&#8217;m not sure, because she got terribly re-stimulated by it. She had blamed herself for her own so she blamed me for mine. We actually agreed that I would go to a home for unwed mothers. CGD: How old were you? LR: Fourteen. CGD: Okay. So, I&#8217;m thinking about Rickie Solinger&#8217;s book about unwed mothers, of course later time period, and the argument is that basically in the &#8217;50s there are very few homes for black unwed mothers, so what was your experience? LR: It wasn&#8217;t a black home but I was the only black girl at the home. It was a home run by the Salvation Army in San Antonio, near Trinity University, over on the other side of town. The Salvation Army ran a number of these homes across America. A little bit more skirt to the story, I had already received a scholarship to Radcliffe and, trust me, having Melvin baby, was not how I planned on becoming a mama. I was not planning on being a mama. He was supposed to be babysitting me and he thought it was a better idea to have sex with me, and he was a serial abuser. That was one of the things that I really challenged within my family, how multigenerational the incest was, and yet we couldn&#8217;t talk about sex and sexuality, and I challenged that. The minute I became conscious of it I started introducing this very awkward conversation into our family. [Laughs] Whenever I see a young budding niece I go have a conversation with their mama, with my brother, whoever it was needed to have a conversation, and they would dread me coming, because I would say, &#8220;You know what happened to me, you know what happened to Mama; we got to stop this in this generation here, okay? I don&#8217;t even know how far back it goes but I know it&#8217;s going to stop in this generation, and I will kill any of you that lay a hand on anybody and I find out about it.&#8221; [Laughs] So the home for unwed mothers was traumatic because I spent two months away from my family. My mother didn&#8217;t find out until I was in my third trimester. I should also add that my sister was severely disabled, my baby sister, Toni, and so to keep her alive took Mama&#8217;s full time care, so I was able to fly under the radar. I was a good student, didn&#8217;t give her no problems, blah, blah, blah. She was horrified to find out I was pregnant. My big sister because she&#8217;s nine years older than me, but she chose not to tell my mother until I said something. So she saw it early, early on but she kept my secret. She didn&#8217;t even tell me she knew. She said, &#8220;I knew. I just didn&#8217;t want to be the one to tell your secret. You needed to deal with that. I just knew I was going to be there for you.&#8221; So there was a whole&#8212;and this may be in the other oral histories&#8212;there was a whole set of drama and trauma around being in the home. Because it was run by the Salvation Army we did a lot of praying for our sins. Every girl there was intending to give the baby up for adoption, including me, because that was not my pathway to parenthood, and I knew at risk was my college career. I was also an NMSQT [National Merit Qualifying Test] finalist, the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test finalist, and so because the elite schools needed the cr&#232;me de la cr&#232;me of the black students at the time they had hunted us early, so I started getting approached by the elite schools in the ninth grade so that by the tenth I had a letter of commitment from Radcliffe, so I knew that was where I was going to end up going, and a full scholarship. They rescinded the scholarship once I had the baby and kept him though. They could not rescind the admission but they could rescind the financial scholarship and that&#8217;s what they did and that&#8217;s how I ended up going to Howard. They offered a full scholarship on no conditions. CGD: And where was your son when you went to Howard? LR: My mother and dad kept him. Oh, hell. Okay. You&#8217;ve heard the story probably on the oral history but the morning after I gave birth, I gave birth on April 9, 1968, at 4:00 in the morning and had signed most of the&#8212;. There are some forms you sign before the baby&#8217;s born and then you&#8217;ve got these final forms to sign after the baby&#8217;s born, and, as I said, the Salvation Army handles it all. So the morning after I gave birth the nurses&#8212;. I always actually assumed that they made a mistake in bringing me my child, but I actually have had reason to question that, whether it was as big a mistake as they thought it was. They probably handled a whole lot of babies for adoption and they wanted to give me a chance. I&#8217;m beginning to think that was probably&#8212;. Like I said, I assumed it was a mistake but I&#8217;m questioning now that I&#8217;m much older, and knowing how difficult giving a baby is up for adoption, whether it was truly a mistake that I got my baby for nursing the next day, because they were just supposed to whisk him on off. I didn&#8217;t even bother to name him because I hadn&#8217;t planned on keeping him, so how did I end up with a baby at my breast, nursing him? My mother was so angry. She wouldn&#8217;t come to the hospital during the birth. That was the other thing that characterized those births, is that you were always by yourself when you did it. My big sister came because she knew Mama couldn&#8217;t handle it, so while I was screaming and losing my mind I suddenly looked up and there was my big sister at the hospital, so I wasn&#8217;t by myself totally, but Mom couldn&#8217;t handle it. Mom couldn&#8217;t handle it at all. So guess when Mom shows up at the hospital? When I had changed my mind and decided to keep my baby. I kept saying, &#8220;He&#8217;s got my face. He&#8217;s got my face,&#8221; and he literally did have my face. [Laughs] CGD: [Laughs] LR: It is hard to look at a miniature of yourself and then just casually hand him over for adoption. So it would have been okay if I&#8217;d never seen him, except that it wouldn&#8217;t have been okay because now I&#8217;m watching on Oprah&#8217;s network these &#8220;searching for&#8221; stories, and they&#8217;re all about babies given up for adoption and birth mothers going crazy looking for their children, and I absolutely would have been one of those mothers. That&#8217;s why I always think Ryan Bomberger and those who have been the adopted children don&#8217;t realize what a trauma it is to give up a child. They just say you don&#8217;t want to have an abortion; just give the baby up. Uh uh. I&#8217;ve never heard a woman honestly say she regrets her abortion. I know a lot that have regretted their adoptions. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m most concerned about. So I kept my son, which so outraged my mother. [Laughs] She came to the hospital, finally, to try to persuade me to change my mind and I was adamant, and I had the support of my dad. My dad said, &#8220;This is Loretta&#8217;s baby, this is Loretta&#8217;s choice.&#8221; CGD: Go dad. LR: [Laughs] So that&#8217;s how that worked out. Three days later you would have thought having a baby was my mama&#8217;s idea. She just acted like my son was her ninth child, because there was only&#8212;. By that time I&#8217;d turned fifteen so there was only fifteen years difference between me and my son. Well there&#8217;s seventeen years difference between me and my big brother. So my mother had parented for so long [Laughs] she just acted like my son was her ninth child, and the next thing I knew I was in power struggles with my mother over whose baby this was. I mean she just embraced my son; my dad embraced my son, definitely, because they had to raise him while I was in college. He became their favorite grandchild because the rest didn&#8217;t live with them and stuff, and my father, who as a drill sergeant and stuff had matured a lot of boys into men, did a masterful job giving my son some values that to this day I&#8217;m so proud of my son for, and I can see my daddy in him because he&#8217;s got that provider gene. He&#8217;s got that responsibility gene. I mean he&#8217;s just amazing. I see my daddy in my son all the time, because he didn&#8217;t grow up with a father, obviously, because of the incest. He didn&#8217;t have the opportunity. He got to meet his father when he turned twenty-one because I finally told him the story, but it was my father who made him a man and he spent a lot of time with my parents. CGD: So how did you get through going to college at Howard, knowing that your son is elsewhere and you&#8217;re encountering all this other new stuff? LR: Well my freshman year at Howard I was sixteen, because I graduated high school two years early. I skipped&#8212;. Remember I talked about the interface between civilian and military schools? Well one year I was in California and they tested you for placement and so I skipped the second semester of the second grade to the first semester of the fifth, so I literally skipped third and fourth grades, so that made me two years younger than all my classmates, so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m fourteen and in tenth grade. So going to Howard was my first black school experience, but it was really a bailout decision because, as I said, I had had my heart so set on going to Radcliffe, which then was still a separate school from Harvard, and I was majoring in chemistry and physics so I was very much a nerd, and was totally apolitical. I mean we had to sue my school system for the right to go back to school but that wasn&#8217;t a feminist act; that was a thou shall not deny me an education act. CGD: Because you had a baby? LR: Because I had a baby, because they had a policy of expelling girls for being pregnant, and because I did not give my son up for adoption they had proof that I had fallen from grace. Oh they kicked me out of all the things. They kicked me out of honor society. They kicked me off the drill team. They told me I could train the drill team but I couldn&#8217;t march with them in competition, the drill team I had founded. They socially punished me as well as they could after the lawsuit. They made my last year of high school miserable. I couldn&#8217;t wait to leave. CGD: How long did it take for the lawsuit to be resolved? Was it something quick? LR: It was settled out of court, because it was such an unfair, discriminatory policy, because it only affected the girls, not the boys who impregnated us, and it had a racial impact because the white women, for the most part, gave their babies up for adoption and reentered the school system as if they&#8217;d been on an extended family vacation, where the black girls who chose to keep their babies were the ones being pushed out. So whether they meant it to be racist in practice it was. I was arguing with my counselor and all these people who told me I couldn&#8217;t come back to school, who needs an education more than someone who&#8217;s already got a kid? I got another generation I&#8217;m responsible for, and you&#8217;re trying to say I need an education less than so-and-so girl? [Laughs] So we settled out of court. It didn&#8217;t actually go to court, and I don&#8217;t even know if there is any historical record around it because they really wanted to keep that policy as a practice, but I think they knew it was discriminatory both on gender and race and so by three years later they had changed the whole policy for the San Antonio Independent school system. Now girls are still pushed out of school to this day because of pregnancy but it stopped being the official policy. So, where was I? Going to Howard. CGD: Going to Howard, your freshman year; you were sixteen. LR: I was sixteen. You asked about leadership and I guess I had some because I became vice president of my freshman class. My leadership mostly came, as I recall, just by volunteering to do something. It&#8217;s not like, okay, I&#8217;m setting out to be the leader, or something like that. I find that most times I just said, okay, I&#8217;ll keep the minutes, or I&#8217;ll type them up, or I&#8217;ll do something, and the next thing I know I&#8217;m the one that&#8217;s got the information nobody else has because I&#8217;ve always been passionate about documentation. [Laughs] So I don&#8217;t think I set out to be in the leadership but I was curious enough to attend a student government meeting and people were talking about who needed to be what in the freshman class and I said, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ll keep the minutes and type them up and stuff,&#8221; and the next thing I know I&#8217;m on a slate, [Laughs] just from that simple act. Then somebody&#8212;. Howard was a cauldron of student activism at the time. The year before they&#8217;d had a student takeover of the campus. I don&#8217;t even remember who did it but I remember reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X and The Black Woman by Toni Cade in that year, and it rocked my world. I didn&#8217;t know that there was a civil rights movement going on, I didn&#8217;t know that there was a feminist movement, I didn&#8217;t know none of that before 1970 because of the isolation. We lived in a neighborhood of military, hyper-patriot families. [Laughs] They were the blacks trying to be&#8212;. Our neighborhood was all retired military people so we went to the American Legion or the VFW or the 4th of July picnics on base and stuff so it&#8217;s not in those settings where you&#8217;re going to hear discourse about the black struggle. That was our family; that was our culture. Or church. You&#8217;re also not going to hear it, not in our churches anyway. Speaking of our churches, one of the things that&#8217;s absolutely discouraging about reinvestigating churches is that the churches that Mom took us to in those days were service oriented churches. Our churches built low income housing for people or ran a free breakfast program for kids or after school programs. I mean from the time I was five years old we always had to volunteer somewhere. My mother was religious about us having to volunteer. Now that might have been a way to handle eight kids and get us out of the house. That probably was a practical reason [Laughs] for it too. But the church, I remember the church, yes, I remember, and [40:02 I don&#8217;t care what the denomination was]. My mother started out as Baptist and then she went to&#8212;. Actually she went somewhere else, she went to AMA, and then I joined a Church of Christ, so my mother joined me in the Church of Christ but then one of my brothers became a pastor of a Missionary Baptist church so she went there, so my mother basically had&#8212;. She didn&#8217;t care what church you went to as long as you went to church. As long as you were in church she wasn&#8217;t doctrinaire strict. As long as you went to church, because I even flirted with going to a Catholic church at one time because I had a boyfriend who was Catholic so I went to liturgy with him a couple of times [Laughs] just to check it out, and I liked the fact they had short sermons and you could dress casually. [Laughs] CGD: [Laughs] LR: They did not have a dress code at the Catholic church, and I liked that. But none of the churches&#8212;this is even before I became pregnant and had the scarlet A on my chest&#8212;none of them could answer my inquisitive questions. Because I did have a chance to sample so many churches I kept asking, what makes you right and them wrong? You&#8217;re going to heaven and they&#8217;re going to hell because they don&#8217;t believe the same thing? Ministers hated a twelve-year-old coming up with those kinds of questions [Laughs] and [when] I did Bible study I would ask questions about that. [41:32 Why did she turn into salt?] I mean, why did they want anybody to get turned into salt? [Laughs] I had a scientific mind so I never just took things on faith. I wanted to know the story behind the story, and they don&#8217;t like that in Bible study. [Laughs] What can I say? So I was already deeply questioning the church, and then when I got pregnant and had to stand up and publicly profess that I was a sinner though I&#8217;d been incested, I was through with that deal then. CGD: And did you go back after that? LR: I have not been to a church for service since then. I&#8217;ve been there for weddings, I&#8217;ve given speeches from the pulpit, I&#8217;ve been there for lots of funerals, but I&#8217;ve not been there as a worshiper since I was fifteen years old with a baby and I was accused of being the sinner when a twenty-seven-year-old had incested me. Oh, no, no, no, no. This deal I don&#8217;t like. And then you tell me my baby&#8217;s born in sin. My baby is a baby. [Laughs] He ain&#8217;t done nothing. So the whole deal did not make sense to me. So back to Howard. CGD: So were you able to be honest with people? Did your fellow students know you had a baby at home? LR: Yeah, they knew I had a baby at home. I mean having a child in high school changes you. You feel&#8212;. I no longer felt carefree, light, responsibility free. It changes you. It doesn&#8217;t mature you like you&#8217;re a full emancipated adult but you&#8217;re conscious that you&#8217;re responsible for another life other than your own. So I had fun at Howard. I got pregnant again; that&#8217;s a whole other story. CGD: That&#8217;s the story I wanted to ask you about. LR: Okay. But I partied and had things like that but then I also had to rush home any time my son got sick, which is not a small thing from D.C. to Texas on a Greyhound bus, because we could never afford for me to fly home. My parents also had not been to college so they didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of experience sending a child to college. I remember my mom sent me off with two hundred dollars and that was the most she could. That was the only support for college they gave me. They couldn&#8217;t help me fill out the applications. They couldn&#8217;t do a whole lot. Fortunately, like I said, being in the honors class, they offered a lot of support for that stuff, but I know for a fact they didn&#8217;t do that for the other kids. You know, scheduled us our SATs and NMSQTs and stuff like that; they did that for us, the honor students. They didn&#8217;t do that for the rest of the students. CGD: And it&#8217;s had for families to navigate that if they&#8217;ve never done it before. LR: Right, and so I only went to Howard because, like I said, my SAT scores, so I applied for Howard only a month before I started school and they gave me a full scholarship, and I was just damn lucky. The only reason I went to Howard is because my best friend had gotten a full scholarship to Howard and [44:54 Lily and Aunt Jones] said, &#8220;You should apply to Howard then,&#8221; because I&#8217;d told her about Radcliffe rescinding the scholarship. She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Howard; why don&#8217;t you apply there?&#8221; So I sent in my application and two weeks later [I got a letter saying:] You&#8217;ve been awarded a full scholarship. [Laughs] When are you coming? CGD: Gotta love it. [Laughs] LR: But I wasn&#8217;t a successful student, to be honest. First of all I was in entirely the wrong major. I had mistaken a love for science with a desire to make a career in science. To this day I still love science fiction. I have very much a left-brain approach to life. At the same time I was ineffably bored, being the only woman in the labs, living in this testosterone-dominated, competitive, isolated culture called scientific research. It was so alienating. I did not realize that I was much more of a humanities girl than a science girl, and particularly when I became a political activist I knew I was in the wrong place then. Down at Howard the science buildings were all in a valley we called Death Valley. [Laughs] So one of the things that happened that pissed me off was that my sophomore year Tony Brown started our university school of communications, which was the first black school of communications, and I wanted to transfer into that because I actually thought that I&#8217;d do good in a communications career. I was on the high school debate team. I always liked using my mouth, running my mouth. Even in junior high school I was on the debate team and I loved political analysis and stuff. [Mobile phone rings] Like I said I wasn&#8217;t conscious but I was good at fighting. CGD: And you were verbally inclined. LR: Yes, I was verbally inclined. We can ignore that phone. I&#8217;m sorry. CGD: That&#8217;s okay. LR: But Tony Brown put a restriction that he only wanted first year freshmen and if you were an upper classman you had to drop all your credits and enroll as a first year freshman. It sounded to me like a harsh requirement because when you&#8217;re a science major you&#8217;re taking a lot of five-hour courses, calculus, or pre-calculus at that time, physics, and stuff like that, so I would have lost like close to forty hours because I was taking eighteen to twenty-one hours per semester, so I would have lost like thirty to forty hours, starting all over. I thought that was so harsh, and it was. It was unnecessary, because a lot of what I had taken I would have needed anyway. But he was&#8212;. I never did&#8212;. I lost respect for Tony Brown after that. He turned out to be a black Republican. I knew there was something wrong with him, but anyway. CGD: [Laughs] LR: [Laughs] CGD: So you didn&#8217;t make it into the communications school so what did you&#8212;? LR: I stayed in chemistry and physics, but then I lost my scholarship because I only was a B/C student because I was taking these kickass courses, so I was by no means an A student, even got a D in organic chemistry one year and had to take it over because I couldn&#8217;t afford a five-hour D in my major [Laughs] so I had to take it over and squeak by with a B-minus. And the competing needs of parenting, even though I wasn&#8217;t physically there, and then self paying because I didn&#8217;t&#8212;. You had to keep a 3.0 to keep my scholarship and I lost that 3.0 after the end of my freshman year. I had maybe a 2.5 or 2.7 but I didn&#8217;t have no 3.0, so the scholarship only lasted the first year, so then I had to get work study to stay in school, and student loans, so college became increasingly more and more difficult. So by my junior year, at the end of my junior year, President Richard Nixon decided to change the student loan guidelines so that preference was given to what they called in-state students, students who stayed in their home state to go to school, which was great except that I was from Texas in a Washington, D.C. school. So I applied for a loan from Texas State Bank but I didn&#8217;t get it because Texas State Bank was giving loans to students that stayed in Texas, and I didn&#8217;t have any relationship with a D.C. bank, nor had I graduated from a D.C. high school. So, thanks, President Nixon. I even lost student loans. So then to stay in school I went from being a work study student to an employee of the university where I was allowed to take one class per semester free, courtesy of the college. That didn&#8217;t last long, going from a full time load to one grudging class per semester, and Howard at the time didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of nighttime classes, because it was meant to be a day school. In the graduate schools they had more access but not undergrad. CGD: So at some point, either while you were working and trying to take that grudging one class or before, you became pregnant again. LR: Oh, no, this was freshman year I became pregnant again. CGD: Oh, okay. LR: Because when I went off to college Howard Freedmen Hospital, which was what they used to call Howard University Hospital, offered free birth control. CGD: The pill, or what form? LR: I believe it was the pill. I think they only had the pill at the time. Well they also had IUDs because I got my IUD from them later on, which ended up sterilizing me because it was a Dalkon Shield. But you had to have parental consent, so I had written my mother and asked her to sign the permission form. CGD: Because you&#8217;re sixteen? LR: Because I was sixteen and I&#8217;m fifteen hundred miles from home, and I already got a baby. Don&#8217;t you want me on birth control? It seems so logical to me. [Laughs] My mother wasn&#8217;t having no parts of it. &#8220;You&#8217;ve already had a baby. You should learn to keep your legs closed.&#8221; This is the &#8217;70s, mom. You have no idea how hard I am partying. [Laughs] She just didn&#8217;t know the reality. Like I said she was never sane around sex and sexuality. So by December of my freshman year I was pregnant again. Now fortunately my boyfriend then&#8212;it was all voluntary sex, so that&#8217;s good&#8212;he was a freshman in law school, and having a baby was not in his plans at that time, so he was more than willing to pay for an abortion. He was falling over himself to pay for it. The other thing that was fortunate was that I was in Washington, D.C. and Washington, D.C. legalized three years before Roe, 1970. CGD: So like New York City, D.C. did the same. LR: Exactly. So I was able to go the Washington Hospital Center and have a perfectly legal saline abortion. CGD: Saline. LR: Third trimester, because between fighting with my mother&#8212;first figuring out I&#8217;m pregnant, fighting with my mother, him having to work to get the money together, I was third trimester, at the beginning of my third trimester, and I was carrying twins. I didn&#8217;t have any hesitation. I knew if I parented one kid at sixteen I was not about to parent three at sixteen. This was not on the agenda. [Laughs] I was lucky it was legal, I was lucky I was in a hospital, no back alley experience. CGD: Had you heard of people who had back alley experiences? LR: No, because&#8212;. Well, yeah, because when I was pregnant the first time and we discovered it, well, we discussed it, I was way too far along. Like I said, I was in the seventh month. But we discussed what the options were and Texas girls mostly went to Mexico and a large number of them did not come back. Yeah. And we didn&#8217;t know about California or New York. CGD: And it would have been hard to take that Greyhound to get there anyway. LR: Yeah. We didn&#8217;t even know about it. We had come up with different schemes, sending me to my aunt in Baltimore to have the baby, sending me to relatives in California, all about sending me somewhere, and I think the final decision was to go to the home for unwed mothers, but having an abortion was not on the table in &#8217;68 when we were making that decision, or &#8217;69, because he was born April of &#8217;69. So I had the abortion. It was a bit traumatic because I had some excessive bleeding and all of that happening and I actually ended up passing the two fetuses separately, and it&#8217;s like having a birth. The saline is like having induced labor. But I was relieved that was over. Then when I went back to Freedmen&#8217;s Hospital health services and they offered me the IUD, which was the Dalkon Shield, I was more&#8212;because I had been a bad contraceptive, trying to use condoms and all that stuff. That&#8217;s what they call us, bad contraceptives, people who try to do it but we don&#8217;t do it perfectly well. So they offered me the IUD and I said, hell yes. The problem I had with the IUD was that my body adapted to it too well. I didn&#8217;t have the excessive cramping, the excessive bleeding that they warned could happen. My body took to that IUD, probably because I&#8217;d already had a child, like it was designed for it, and then three years later I got acute PID and my fallopian tubes ruptured. The design flaw in the Dalkon Shield was the string that was there simply for doctors to remove it and it ended up wicking bacteria up into the uterus. CGD: So you get infection. LR: Right, exactly. I&#8217;m one of seven hundred thousand women across the world that had that PID infection from the Dalkon Shield, which caused it to be removed from the U.S. market, but it&#8217;s still distributed internationally. CGD: So you ended up suing, correct? LR: A.H. Robins. CGD: Okay, and was that a class suit of women? LR: No. We were individuals. We paved the ground for the class action lawsuit. This was an individual. First I ended up&#8212;. I was working at the time and I remember I was in an HMO and so my doctor was at George Washington University Hospital, and my doctor was head of OB-GYN at George Washington, and he kept diagnosing me as having some kind of bizarre, exotic venereal disease. I remember what he called it: Lymphogranuloma venereum, something like that, and he kept, absurdly, for almost six months, treating me for VD until my tubes exploded. Meanwhile my stomach was getting more and more distended, I&#8217;ve got this raging fever of a hundred and three that I&#8217;m carrying around for months, and he never removed the damn IUD. Even though every time he did a pelvic exam he saw it he never removed it, so, [58:13 needless to say], he became party to that lawsuit too. Actually I was dating a med student at the time, Eric [58:22], and I literally passed out one night with Eric there and he rushed me to the hospital because he said, this ain&#8217;t right. I woke up to a subtotal hysterectomy and the doctor said, &#8220;We had to do it to save your life. You were so infected.&#8221; [58:41 And all at] George Washington Hospital, right, so we&#8217;re not talking about some terrible hospital, right? He said, &#8220;I had to do it to save your life. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; He was so apologetic to me. So when my primary care physician came back, I saw him the next day, he was like, &#8220;Well aren&#8217;t you lucky that you&#8217;ve already got a kid,&#8221; you know, you didn&#8217;t need anymore kids anyway. I literally had a WTF moment. I was okay until he said that. You don&#8217;t know what I had planned on doing with my life. You&#8217;re the man that got it wrong for the last six months, and then you&#8217;re going to say well, it&#8217;s okay? He said, &#8220;Well you&#8217;re just that one-out-of-ten case that we don&#8217;t catch.&#8221; He literally said those kinds of things to me while I&#8217;m in recovery. So I&#8217;d had an OB-GYN left over from my Howard days that I started seeing when I was a student at Howard, so I requested, and you could actually get your hospital records back then, and took my records to my old OB-GYN. He said, &#8220;This guy did everything wrong.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading the research on IUDs and the Dalkon Shield in particular.&#8221; He said, &#8220;First of all, we should have never put it in you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I pulled it out of Howard&#8217;s medical services from the minute we first had the problem.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If he&#8217;d kept up on his research he should have pulled it from you the minute you presented and said you had one.&#8221; He said, &#8220;The fact that he kept it in another six months is that he meant for you to be sterilized. That&#8217;s the only outcome possible from that situation.&#8221; So he was the one that encouraged me to do a lawsuit. He said, &#8220;This is wrong. This is called medical malpractice. I&#8217;ve got some attorneys you need to call.&#8221; CGD: Wow. LR: This was another doctor. [Laughs] CGD: Well when one doctor does that it makes it worse for everybody. LR: Exactly. So they settled out of court with me but a year later the class action&#8212;. And I also think that my attorneys, as good as they were, they kind of sold me down the river too because we settled for like a hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars, of which they got a third, and the next year the lawsuits were for 1.4 million, 1.2 million, to white women. CGD: Do you know how many black women sued? LR: I don&#8217;t [know], but we were like one of the earliest ones, and so the settlements I saw&#8212;. These were settlements; these were not court awards. So I felt that&#8212;. And my attorney had told me again racism and classicism and sexism takes over. &#8220;Well you&#8217;re not going to present that well to the jury because you&#8217;ve already had a baby out of wedlock,&#8221; was their read, so hurry up and settle, hurry up and settle. CGD: Kind of the Claudette Colvin school of thought about who&#8217;s appropriate, who&#8217;s not. LR: Exactly, and this was the advice from my attorneys. [Laughs] Again, that stereotypical reading of: Single black mother, what do you deserve in terms of your right to reproduce? At the time it seemed like an unholy amount of money but&#8212;and my mother also urged me to settle so I can&#8217;t just hold them blameless. But when I saw the awards and the settlements that were happening for white women, only the next year, because of course once this happens you read everything you can on the Dalkon Shield and what was happening to it, and my sterilization story is why I became an activist, but that pissed me off. That was how I became a feminist. That sterilization, more than the abortion, raised my feminist consciousness because for that man to stand at the foot of my bed and tell me it was alright not to have more kids, and didn&#8217;t that turn out perfectly for me, pissed me off to the heights of [1:03:13 pissability]. That sparked the feminist fire. CGD: And what did you do? LR: I began reading everything I could find on reproductive rights and sterilization. This was 1973, and that was when the lawsuits were beginning to happen around sterilization abuse. Connie Uri and others were&#8212;. There was the Committee Against Sterilization Abuse, CASA, that Helen Rodriguez-Trias and others had founded. I was lucky to be in Washington, D.C. that had a growing feminist movement. The D.C. Area Feminist Alliance was getting off the ground. The D.C. Rape Crisis Center was the first rape crisis center in the country and it was founded in 1972. So there was a feminist bubbling in the atmosphere in Washington, D.C. in those times so it wasn&#8217;t&#8212;I mean we didn&#8217;t have Google to do our searches for us [Laughs] but if you paid attention and were conscious you could find stuff. CGD: And was that D.C. feminist movement&#8212;? Did it reflect the racial diversity of D.C.? LR: No, because D.C. at the time was eighty percent black and there were those of us who&#8217;d go to the DCAFA meetings&#8212;like I said, the D.C. Area Feminist Alliance, we called it DCAFA&#8212;but we were never more than one, two, or three voices at a meeting out of say fifteen, twenty people. But at the same time I really admired the working class consciousness that the white women had. I mean the way we all got jobs at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center was that it was a group of six white women that founded it, out of a hotline basically, but they made a commitment that whenever they got their first grants to pay salaries they were going to hire women from the community, which meant black women, and even though they were working class white women themselves who needed jobs&#8212;. I mean they were not wealthy women. One was a carpenter, one was a telephone operator. They could have easily done what most cities did and reserved the jobs for themselves but they made a political and philosophical commitment to hire black women with their first grants, so Michelle Hudson became the first executive director of the Rape Crisis Center, then [Akinje 1:05:46] became the second, and I became the third. So the D.C. Rape Crisis Center just became a hotbed of black feminism because of that, so I&#8217;ve always felt that books should be written about those six white women, because they did something that no other group of white women in any other part of America did, which was grandmother and foment the leadership of black feminism as an intentional project. We were so lucky to be in Washington, absolute lucky. CGD: So it was Rosa Carpenter, and who else were some of the other women? LR: Rosa Carpenter? CGD: I thought you just said Rosa Carpenter. LR: No, I said one was a carpenter. CGD: Oh, okay. LR: She was a carpenter. Deborah Freeman was a carpenter. CGD: Oh, okay. Are some of those women still alive? LR: Mary Alice [1:06:36]. I don&#8217;t know if they are or not. I&#8217;m sure Deb Freeman is because I think I saw something from her on Facebook. [1:06:45 Akinje] would know because she stays in more frequent contact because she&#8217;s still in D.C. and I&#8217;m not, so she would know. She stayed at the Rape Crisis Center for fourteen years&#8212;I stayed for three&#8212;because even after she stepped down as ED she stayed on as program director under me and then under two more executive directors, so she would know more about it than I. CGD: So did working with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center help move you to later, like your work with NOW? LR: Yeah. Well that was my first formal job in the women&#8217;s movement. I mean I&#8217;d had one other social justice job before then and that was working for the NFL Players Association, their union, so that was my very first social justice job. CGD: Wow. The NFL Players Union, like National Football League. LR: Yeah, NFLPA, and we worked through a strike and all of that. That was &#8217;75/&#8217;76. Then I worked for a PIRG, a public interest research group. So I guess I was always drawn to social justice work. I&#8217;ve never worked for corporate America except at a temp job. I&#8217;ve never worked for the government [Laughs] except at a temp job. I&#8217;ve always kind of been&#8212;. And again I attribute that to my mom, that social justice, social service bent that she inculcated in all her kids. Amazingly I look at where her kids ended up. I have one brother who&#8217;s on his city council and finally retired from that, another one who owns a nursing home, one who&#8217;s a pharmacist, a sister who&#8217;s a nurse, one brother who&#8217;s a minister. In some way all her kids ended up in service, all her kids ended up in service one way or another. CGD: So at what point did you move to Atlanta? LR: I moved to Atlanta in 1989. CGD: Okay. LR: I came to Washington in 1970 so I ended up spending twenty years in Washington and then I moved to Atlanta in 1989. CGD: And what prompted that move? LR: The National Black Women&#8217;s Health Project was founded here in the early 1980s so Byllye Avery hired me, from NOW, to come here to be her program director, in this house. This is the original&#8212;. CGD: Because there&#8217;s a sign over there. LR: Yeah. CGD: That&#8217;s an original sign? LR: Yeah, that&#8217;s the original sign of the National Black Women&#8217;s Health Project. They owned the building years ago when they first got founded. It was in an un-renovated state, we had rats and roaches and stuff rolling around here. We had the money to get the building; we did not have the money to renovate it. This building was built in 1900, so it was quite dilapidated when the Project owned it. So she&#8212;. I had always been around talking about abortion rights, because by that time I&#8217;d really, particularly at NOW, got into working for abortion rights and black women, so I had come to the Project&#8212;we called the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project the Project. Whenever you hear black women say, &#8220;the Project&#8221; it means&#8212; CGD: The Project. [Laughs] LR: &#8212;the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project. [Laughs] CGD: And now the Black Women&#8217;s Health Imperative. LR: Health Imperative, right. But I had come to the founding conference of the Project [and] every time they had a conference I&#8217;d be there doing a workshop on black women and abortion. Abortion rights and black women just became my passion. I started writing [1:10:31 about black] abortion in the early &#8217;90s. CGD: Were people receptive to you talking about that in the beginning? LR: I think so. First of all there wasn&#8217;t a black anti-abortion movement when I first started. That&#8217;s a later creation, a later development. I mean the last&#8212;as you know from your own research&#8212;the last time there was a formal anti-abortion movement was a small wing of the Black Power movement, so with the collapse of the Black Power movement and the Black&#8212;. [1:11:12 I don&#8217;t know if I should say] the Black Panthers as a whole, because the Black Panthers were split. Now they weren&#8217;t&#8212;it was more, as Byllye used to say, the conspiracy of silence&#8212;that&#8217;s her phrase&#8212;more so than active opposition. It wasn&#8217;t that they were opposed to abortion but they weren&#8217;t necessarily ready to talk about it front and center, and most black women used to say, &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t know about that abortion thing,&#8221; because they&#8217;re listening to their churches, or whatever, but more than eighty, eighty-five percent say, &#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to tell no woman what to do with her body.&#8221; [Laughs] That is a sentiment that we&#8217;ve held intact for four hundred years. CGD: So if you moved here in &#8217;89, so you got here right after the siege of Atlanta. LR: Exactly, right, Operation Rescue, but see in &#8217;87 one of my last things, or one of my mid-range things I did at NOW, not only did I organize women of color for the &#8217;86 and the &#8217;89 marches that NOW did, which was about&#8212;. They were marches for abortion rights so I had traveled the country talking about abortion rights with women of color, but in &#8217;87 I organized the first National Conference on Women of Color and Reproductive Rights, that&#8217;s what we called it, and so I had a chance to truly meet people like Dazon and Byllye&#8212;well I met Byllye early on&#8212;but just so many women who were beginning their reproductive rights activism as women of color, plus a lot of white women that I know nowadays. I met them through the three or four hundred women that came to that conference, and I made NOW put up the forty thousand dollars for it, kicking and screaming, and then wouldn&#8217;t let the white women speak, so they were mad but, you know, it is what it is. CGD: And where was that conference? LR: At Howard. CGD: At Howard? Okay. LR: At Howard University, and the antis protested. It was so funny. CGD: Really? LR: Yes. They were [1:13:14]&#8212;. Well I guess I wasn&#8217;t right to say that there wasn&#8217;t an anti, because they&#8212;. CGD: So they were African American antis? LR: Yes. I&#8217;ve forgotten exactly who but I think it was Joe Scheidler, because we had the NOW v. [Joseph] Scheidler lawsuit going on at the time, and so they flew in these four to five black women to stand outside of the law school where we were having the conference, trying to picket the conference. So the campus police came to us and asked us what did we want done, because it&#8217;s actually illegal to picket on private property, which Howard University is, so it was really dumb of them. We could have had them arrested with no problem, right, but I don&#8217;t want to make martyrs of their asses, so I said, no, let us handle this. So I went outside and started talking to them and invited them to come inside. Four of the five came inside. Girl, within an hour and a half we had their asses. Only one left; the rest of them stayed at our conference, participating, found prolife sisters in the audience to talk to and relate to. I said, yeah, black women got more sense. They have never sent another set of pickets to a conference Loretta Ross has ever done [Laughs] because I&#8217;m going to suck them in, in a heartbeat. They have never shown up at anything else I&#8217;ve done. I hope they got their lesson, because we won their people. We won their people over just with frank talk to them. Like I said, I don&#8217;t know whether Catherine Davis is crazy or not. Catherine Davis is a political opportunist, but she ain&#8217;t lost her fucking mind. She&#8217;s just an opportunist, and you will find those. [1:15:07] sister-sister conversation with people, because that&#8217;s the other thing that they don&#8217;t realize about my work, is that sisters are both prolife and prochoice. We include everybody. There&#8217;s no litmus test on abortion. But what we are mostly is pro-woman, for women to make their own minds up, so we&#8217;ve got a little prolife subgroup within SisterSong and we&#8217;re all right with that. Our very first newsletter, we got an article in there about surviving as a prolifer in the prochoice movement. [Laughs] We got an article in our very first newsletter, announcing to the world that&#8217;s who we are and that&#8217;s what we do. So&#8212;. CGD: So&#8212;. LR: I&#8217;m sorry, what was your question? CGD: So what did you find when you came to Atlanta, when you moved here? LR: A disorganized, un-centralized black feminist community, as a matter of fact, white feminist community even. [Laughs] I had grown used to taking for granted in the Mid-Atlantic region, like the National Black Feminist, NBFO, out of New York, Combahee [1:16:22 77] out of Boston and New York, DCAFA in D.C. I mean I had taken kind of like conversations and formations around feminism in general and black feminism in particular for granted. A woman in D.C. had started Up Front, Linda Leaks, was a National Black Feminist newspaper you can get out of Jim Dankey&#8217;s archives at the University of Wisconsin. CGD: Love him. LR: I do love him, and what he&#8212;. CGD: Love him. LR: Right, exactly. [1:16:52] CGD: [Laughs] The Wisconsin Historical Society is a temple to history. LR: I know it is. CGD: It&#8217;s fabulous. LR: I know it is, and I worked with Jim to make sure he got all the Up Front copies that were available into the archives. They published like three years of it. Linda got tired of carrying it on her back, and I still have email contact with Linda. CGD: Where is she now? LR: She&#8217;s still in D.C. working for a Washington housing organizing organization. CGD: So you had taken for granted what you had seen in other places that really are not so far. LR: I mean Texas was one place and then I was in D.C., and when I came to Atlanta I was actually pleasantly surprised by some things because Washington by then so much embodied the chocolate city concept with vanilla suburbs and so I was pleasantly surprised at the high proportion of African Americans in the city of Atlanta, even more so that at the time Atlanta proper, inside the perimeter, was fifty-nine percent African American female. So I didn&#8217;t long for chocolate city because I was in another chocolate city, so I liked that. But as I tried to find that feminist impulse the only force I found was Charis Bookstore up the street, which is the feminist bookstore. CGD: In Little Five Points. LR: In Little Five Points, and just other feminist formations that I took for granted in Washington were impossible in Atlanta. As a matter of fact, I remember when I first came here and I tried to organize a feminist rap&#8212;rap meaning discussion group, not song rapping&#8212;group. CGD: [Laughs] LR: I teamed up with this white woman, whose name I cannot remember right now, and when we sent out the invitation I wasn&#8217;t smart enough to realize the racial divide, and so&#8212;Michelle&#8212;so when Michelle signed the letter all white women would show up at Charis. When Loretta signed the letter only black women would show up. Now they&#8217;re both two groups of feminists but the whole politics of who invited. So then we started jointly signing a letter and that was the only way we could get a mixed group. I was like, ooh, I&#8217;m not used to this kind of real primitive racial divide that the Deep South is still operating under, the plantation thinking, both in terms of slave-master and enslaved and stuff. I was told by a number of women that I could not talk about abortion here in the South, that I could not do this in the South. We couldn&#8217;t talk about LBGT rights in the South. Oh, it was so funny, like one of the craziest things that happened to me in my life was that when Byllye Avery hired me as program director for the project the Black Gay and Lesbian Conference came to Atlanta and Byllye asked me if I would go over and present the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project at this conference, and I had no problem. I was program director; I had no problem going to a conference. What I didn&#8217;t understand was that the two leaders of the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project, Byllye Avery and Lillie Allen, were both lesbians and weren&#8217;t out enough to go to the damn conference, so they&#8217;re sending the straight woman to the LGBT conference. [Laughs] CGD: [Laughs] LR: That confused me because I was used to lesbians being out, very particularly lesbian leaders being out. [Laughs] I&#8217;m like, how many ironies are caught up in the Project sending the straight woman girl to the LGBT conference when both of our leaders are lesbians? CGD: That&#8217;s a very deep closet. LR: Exactly. So those were things that just befuddled me. CGD: So was there, when you got here&#8212;? Okay, so there was the siege of Atlanta. Do we know if there was any black participation in the siege of Atlanta? LR: You know who you need to interview on that is Dazon Dixon because she worked at the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center at the time. CGD: I knew she had that history, okay. LR: So she saw it. I didn&#8217;t come until the year after Operation Rescue, but she lived through it. She started working at the Center in &#8217;85, no &#8217;86 or &#8217;87, so she was there and had to cross the picket line and see people carried over the bodies and stuff like that. CGD: I&#8217;m talking to her tomorrow. LR: She has a first person history of it. CGD: But when you got here in &#8217;89 was there an indigenous Atlanta, white, prolife movement to speak of? LR: There probably was but not so that I noticed, because there was a struggle within the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project, not to be prochoice because Byllye Avery had started both an abortion clinic and a birthing center, but&#8212;. CGD: In Tallahassee? LR: Gainesville. CGD: Okay. LR: But there was a lot of debate within the Project about how publicly prochoice we became, and so I spent my early years organizing within the Project about just saying, you know, we got to stand up. We got to take a position on this stuff. So I think we might have been flying beneath the radar of the white right-to-life movement, so we never got any hate mail. I mean I didn&#8217;t start getting the hate mail and the bloody fetuses until much later. CGD: You just said &#8220;bloody fetuses.&#8221; LR: Pictures of bloody fetuses, not the actual fetuses. CGD: All right. LR: But they know my home address and they send those things to me occasionally. CGD: You still get them? LR: Yeah, even more so now since the billboards and the publicity around that, even more so, the hate mail, bloody fetuses, and stuff like that. So it didn&#8217;t happen while I was at the Project. CGD: Did the Project facilitate women getting abortions or make referrals or provide them? What was the&#8212;? LR: We&#8217;ve always had that kind of informal&#8212;. It wasn&#8217;t a full developed program but it&#8217;s something we always did. We still do it here at SisterSong because Atlanta is a twenty-four weeks facility and so we accept and provide abortion [1:24:04] services for women coming from other states where it&#8217;s limited to twenty or twenty-two weeks, so we do about half a dozen of those a year here at SisterSong. We did it routinely at the Project too. So it&#8217;s not a full fledged&#8212;. It&#8217;s not like the [1:24:22 clergy?] consultation service where people were actually, it was a formal program of accessing abortion for women, but we&#8217;re used to funds, abortion funds from around the country, calling us and saying, okay, we got to send a woman to Atlanta, we&#8217;ve raised the money for her, can you all do the escorting, because the escorting means you&#8217;re picking her up from the airport or wherever she got here, taking her to the clinic. Abortion is a two-day process so then you got to take her to the hotel, or one time I ended up taking a woman home with me&#8212;did I just write on my dress?&#8212;taking a woman home with me. CGD: Just a little bit. LR: The dress is like fifteen years old so it&#8217;s no big deal. Then taking her back for the second procedure and either taking her back to the hotel for one night or taking her to the airport or whatever, and they have to be there ungodly early times in the morning. The last woman I escorted not only had to be there at 6:30 in the morning but then she got trapped here by the Atlanta ice storm and was here for ten days with her four kids left with her mother in Ohio. CGD: Oh. Did her mother in Ohio know what she was coming here for? LR: Yeah, but her mother had stayed off work because she thought she was only going to be gone for two or three days, not for ten. Ended up giving her a frequent flier ticket to get home because she had come down here on a bus but she couldn&#8217;t afford to take a two-day bus ride back home so I ended up giving her a frequent flier ticket to get back home on the same day. When the airport first opened she needed to get out of here. CGD: So when did you notice a visible anti-abortion presence in Atlanta? LR: With the billboards. I mean we&#8217;ve always had the stuff that the rest of the country is dealing with. If I did more policy work at the capitol, because I&#8217;ve been a national person that happens to live in Atlanta [rather] than an Atlanta person, meaning I&#8217;m not doing lobbying at the state capitol. I mean there&#8217;s always been anti-abortion bills at the state capitol, that&#8217;s why we have so many restrictions for [1:26:43] and what have you, so I can&#8217;t say that when I noticed them is the first time they appeared. That would not be right at all. When did they first have an impact on my organizing was with the billboards last February. CGD: Okay, all right. LR: And I can give you one of the reports from [that.] CGD: I have&#8212;. LR: [1:27:02 Is it a purple one?] CGD: Yes, I got it. Serena gave me one. LR: Okay, yeah. That was when they first made a difference in our lives here at SisterSong and the hate mail upped, we had to become more serious about security, and being more paranoid, but also being more prepared, being more aggressive, organizing Trust Black Women to develop a long term national response to them. Just had to re-up and re-gear, and it&#8217;s really kind of interesting because here we are who created the RJ framework as a way of contextualizing the struggle for abortion rights now have to focus on abortion, [Laughs] the same thing we&#8217;re critiquing the prochoice movement for doing. CGD: Right. LR: We&#8217;re having to do a response to this black anti-abortion movement, but we still are contextualizing it within the human rights framework so we&#8217;re not straying far from our philosophy, but at the same time it&#8217;s ironic [Laughs] that we&#8217;re at this historical moment. CGD: Yeah, and it&#8217;s hard not to get sucked in to the way the debate is being framed. LR: Exactly, prochoice versus prolife, when we&#8217;re saying we&#8217;re both prochoice and prolife and y&#8217;all are just pro-birth. [Laughs] That&#8217;s the way we see it. CGD: So is there a silver lining to the billboards&#8212;and we know that there was just another one unveiled this week&#8212;? LR: &#8220;Betrayed,&#8221; the &#8220;Betrayed&#8221; billboard. CGD: Is there a silver lining for SisterSong? LR: Oh absolutely, well not only for SisterSong but I think for black women nationally, because the last time black women organized explicitly in defense of abortion rights was Webster in 1989, when we did the &#8220;We Remember&#8221; campaign. Are you familiar with that? CGD: I am, but tell me more. LR: Okay. Well it all started with a phone call by Donna Brazile. I don&#8217;t know who else she called before she called me but she called me, and I was at NOW at the time. She said, &#8220;Loretta, the Webster decision just came down that gave states the power to re-regulate abortions, so all hell is going to break loose because we know some states that just ain&#8217;t going to be good.&#8221; She said it&#8217;s going to be like desegregation: If you leave it as a states&#8217; rights issue a lot of black women going to be screwed. So she said, &#8220;What do you think we need to do about it?&#8221; because Donna knew that I worked on abortion times. At the time she was head of the National Political Congress of Black Women, Shirley Chisholm&#8217;s organization, and I had spoken at their conference, Shirley had spoken at our conference, and Donna had been my roommate when we were in Africa together so we had gone back awhile. Anyway&#8212;in &#8217;85&#8212;so she said, &#8220;What do you think needs to be done?&#8221; I said well why don&#8217;t we put together a conference call of black women leaders and ask their advice, so we pulled together this conference call. We identified and we got Dorothy Height, Byllye Avery, Jewel Jackson McCabe, Marcia Gillespie, who was then heading up Essence, I think, just got a number of black women who were signatures on the brochure, one of the original ones. Byllye is the one that actually clarified for us. She said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to break this conspiracy of silence. We&#8217;ve got to give black women permission to talk about abortion.&#8221; So Marcia Gillespie wrote the &#8220;We Remember&#8221; language, and then Faye Wattleton was head of Planned Parenthood at the time and so they agreed to finance the production of a quarter million copies of the brochure but without putting their logo on it, the Planned Parenthood logo, because we argued we wanted this to be representing the voice of black women, not the voice of black parenthood, and Faye had no problems with that, so much so that she got the award from the Congressional Black Caucus that same fall for the work she did. Every other president of Planned Parenthood trying to get back to the level of respect Faye got from the black leadership around the country. They actually got jealous of her, but that&#8217;s a whole other conversation. But then after &#8220;We Remember&#8221; the impulse died, after Webster, and then we came together again around Casey, which was, I think, 1992, but then it died again. Then there were all these attempts to organize national women of color coalitions. We did one after the &#8217;87 conference and then the ACLU had a conference called &#8220;In Defense of Roe&#8221; where we tried another formation, and then around the world conferences. There were four or five efforts before SisterSong was formed. CGD: So why did those things not really work, or were they just building to something else? LR: Well I think lack of funding. What was so ironic about the funding community is that domestically they actually thought that our job was to bring women of color to white formations, not to establish autonomous women of color formations ourselves, because they saw that as an anti-white woman segregation move, self-segregation move, so they really weren&#8217;t willing to invest in that. While I was organizing women of color within NOW I could get money but women of color outside of NOW, it&#8217;s the hardest sell to white funders. Also it was interesting, where there was funding for us to go to international conferences like Beijing and ICPD in Cairo there was never any money to do any work once we got home. Then I think fundamentally the third reason was internal to us. We did not have a process for handling conflict and division, which is why SisterSong was founded with the concept of self help because we needed a way that&#8212;. We knew things were going to be tough but we needed to put in place a process for handling the tough times, which the previous four formations had not done. So I would say&#8212;. We wrote about it in Undivided Rights. [Laughs] I would say that would be my analysis. CGD: So why is Georgia&#8212;? I mean I know you&#8217;re a national coordinator, but why has Georgia been kind of determined as a frontline for both abortion and reproductive justice issues on a broader level? LR: I think it has something to do with the peculiar history of Atlanta. If you go back to the 1950s and imagine Atlanta and Birmingham, Alabama being parallel cities with a large industrial and transportation base, both of them were like steel and industrial manufacturing towns of the South. In Birmingham the economic leaders, the city council people, the chamber of commerce people decided to resist integration. In Atlanta they decided that segregation was bad for business and they coined the phrase &#8220;a city too busy to hate,&#8221; which wasn&#8217;t quite true but it made good PR, right? That is why the civil rights movement was housed in Atlanta as opposed to Birmingham, Selma, Montgomery, Macon, any other place it could have gone, was because of the pragmatism of the white business leaders. So Atlanta since that kind of prophetic decision has been, in my mind, where the civil rights movement found a home and in my mind it&#8217;s where the new human rights movement has found a home. So it&#8217;s not a coincidence that the U.S. human rights network is here, that SisterSong is here, that you find this whole new human rights focused set of organizing, that Somos Georgia is happening here, fighting the immigration stuff. I mean it&#8217;s almost like the new human rights struggles of the South are emanating out of Atlanta again, like the civil rights struggles of the South. So there&#8217;s something in the water. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know what it is, but it&#8217;s hard for me to define it all as just coincidence. There&#8217;s something about this being a home capable of holding the emergence of new movement and stuff like that. So I don&#8217;t see those as unrelated kind of things. I mean I came to Atlanta because of the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project. When I decided that I was going to create infrastructure for SisterSong and create a national office I wasn&#8217;t leaving Atlanta to do that, so Atlanta became our home, but I came because Byllye Avery chose Atlanta, the woman who was a generation before me. So, there is something special about Atlanta. I mean and as you go back to the &#8217;60s, the Institute on Black Thought or the Institute of the Black World was here. Carter G. Woodson did work here. DuBois did work here. Atlanta&#8217;s got a spirit and a history that&#8217;s unique in the annals of history. I don&#8217;t know what else to say. CGD: One thing that is unique about Atlanta is that it&#8217;s had a core of relatively affluent and well educated black people, and so I wonder about&#8212;. LR: But so does Washington, D.C. CGD: Yeah, D.C., so how do you, as a reproductive justice movement, interact with that core of elite, very educated black people, like for instance the organizations that we think of in the traditional civil rights movement, like the SCLC? Do you have relationships with them? LR: No. Where we&#8217;ve built the most bridges with what we call the old guard is around our HIV/AIDS work, interestingly enough. I&#8217;ve been in conversation with [1:38:24] and their women&#8217;s committee and the NAACP. The bridges are mostly built around another reproductive justice issue but it&#8217;s mostly HIV/AIDS. But, the Georgia NAACP supported us, eventually, last year and certainly the Georgia Rainbow PUSH came out and supported us in the campaign last year, so women within those formations know what time it is, even if the men don&#8217;t. But you asked about&#8212;. There is still a strong cultural divide between the indigenous Atlanta people and those of us who are transplants and there is something about not being a Grady baby, which most of them say that they are, that is always there. But I experienced that when I lived in Washington. We were all transplants to D.C. versus the D.C.-born people. I guess that&#8217;s&#8212;. And I&#8217;m from Texas so we probably got it in Texas too, just as a Texan I don&#8217;t notice it. There&#8217;s always that that&#8217;s a little bit separate. Then Atlanta does have high society, black high society. I wasn&#8217;t even eligible in my own hometown high society. My girlfriend was a [1:39:55 Guild]; I wasn&#8217;t. [Laughs] Her daddy was a doctor; mine was a truck driver. When he retired he started driving a truck for the post office, like a lot of men do. So I&#8217;ve never had entr&#233;e to high society anywhere I&#8217;ve lived and never actually aspired to it, because I was too dark and too colored and too crude, [Laughs] and intentionally crude. CGD: And you talk about abortion and incest. LR: You know, I keep it&#8212;. Well even before I started talking about abortion and incest I was talking about sterilization abuse, which is acceptable, but I started talking about rape, which was not, in the black community. CGD: Why do you think that was not acceptable? LR: Because ninety-five percent of rapes are intra-racial. If I wanted to talk about rape as something white men did to black women I could have had the Ida B. Wells story, but talking about rape as something that black men do to black women, it&#8217;s airing dirty laundry. So long before I started publicly talking about abortion I was committing the social faux pas of talking about rape and incest in the black community as something black people did to ourselves. I mean I&#8217;ve gotten booed off black stages and stuff, I mean stages at black conferences and conventions. They always used to accuse us of selling out to the white women, and one guy called me&#8212;he and his wife, [1:41:36], I&#8217;ll never forget them&#8212;they accused me of being a representative of COINTELPRO because I was talking about this stuff and it wasn&#8217;t helping the black community, and so I had to be a plant by the FBI to destabilize the black movement. [Sighs; laughs] That was a pretty heavy charge, to accuse somebody of being COINTELPRO back in that day, because that set you up for somebody just taking you out of here, only because I was talking about gender oppression and they didn&#8217;t want to talk about it. CGD: So I noticed you said in answering the question about Atlanta&#8217;s mainstream black leadership, you said the NAACP eventually supported the campaign, so that seems to suggest that they didn&#8217;t support it in the beginning wholeheartedly. LR: Well what happened was that Catherine Davis got hold of the president of the Georgia NAACP and filled his head with this black conspiracy theory, so without even reading the legislation or talking to any of his women members this boy, and I can only call him a boy on purpose, endorsed Catherine Davis&#8217;s campaign. Honey, when we found out about that and then the black women within the NAACP found out about that, and the fact that he was going against national, who endorsed us, honey, he published a public retraction in the newspaper. CGD: In the AJC? LR: Yes, of his endorsement of Catherine Davis. CGD: And what&#8217;s his name? LR: Oh, I forgot his name. Oh, don&#8217;t ask me something specific like that. [1:43:25] CGD: I can find it. LR: So when I say at first, he hadn&#8217;t read the legislation, he hadn&#8217;t talked to anybody; he just sat up there and believed Catherine Davis, and I was like, what would make you ever do that? She&#8217;s a Republican. [Laughs] Why? Just because she&#8217;s black?]] CGD: Now when she ran for public office before, did she&#8212;? LR: She ran twice against Cynthia McKinney. CGD: Okay. Did she include anti-choice things in her platform? LR: I don&#8217;t know. Most likely she did because that&#8217;s the standard Republican fare, but she didn&#8217;t come to my attention then. Again, my knowledge of local Georgia politics is extremely limited. I have staff that I hire to work on that. [Laughs] I&#8217;m not the one. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so good you talked to Charity, and unfortunately you missed Heidi but you saw Heidi at the conference. She now works in Washington. I mean I have to admit to an extremely shallow knowledge of Georgia politics. CGD: Do you think that Georgia, since you do national politics and think about the bigger picture, do you think Georgia is indicative or representative or do you think Georgia&#8217;s unique? LR: I think Atlanta is unique because when you step outside of the perimeter you&#8217;re back in rural South for the most part, and so I would think that some parts of Georgia resemble closer to rural Mississippi whereas Atlanta more resembles Washington, D.C. in terms of the black political structure and sophistication of the people and stuff like that. So I don&#8217;t know if Georgia the state is unique. Atlanta the city is unique. Georgia the state is probably more cosmopolitan though than most Southern states with the exception of Florida, which is just so international, and that&#8217;s only southern Florida, because when you go to northern Florida it&#8217;s like southern Georgia, very rural, very conservative, very redneck. [Laughs] I&#8217;ve really enjoyed watching the growing feminist consciousness in this center in the twenty years I&#8217;ve been here, twenty-two years now I&#8217;ve been here, like Georgia State really working on its women&#8217;s history archives now. When I went back to school I finished up at Agnes Scott and it was a joy to go to a women&#8217;s college and becoming immersed in its history as one of the first women&#8217;s colleges in the South and watching the huge empowerment of women through their program and the impact they&#8217;ve had. They started out as a Presbyterian college, in case you didn&#8217;t know. So I&#8217;ve seen a lot of feminist growth and development in this city that wasn&#8217;t here when I first came here in the late &#8217;80s, so much so that&#8212;. Like there&#8217;s this group here called ZAMI, which is a black lesbian collective. CGD: After Audre Lorde&#8217;s Zami. LR: Exactly. I went to one of their&#8212;. They have a scholarship program where they raise money for queer kids who need to go to college. I went to one of their programs because I was a donor. Honey, there were four hundred black lesbians up in this room. I was stunned to see ninety percent of the women I knew. Okay, now they all can&#8217;t be coming out, most of them have to be there with me in solidarity, but just seeing this huge aggregation of black feminists in Atlanta. I&#8217;m talking about three to four hundred black lesbians up in this room, or black women. I ain&#8217;t going to say they were all lesbians. CGD: But a good portion probably were. LR: Yeah, but still. I was grinning all over myself. I was like, okay, this is different. This could not have happened when I first came to Atlanta. Mary Anne Adams is someone you should interview because she&#8217;s the founder of ZAMI. CGD: So who else besides Mary Anne Adams? Like when you came here who could you go to other than Byllye? Were there people who you were like, okay, I want to talk to a black woman about some of these issues, or a woman of color. Were there women you could go to? LR: Well the Project was the&#8212;. CGD: Was it. LR: Was it, in terms of the black feminist consciousness of the city at the time, and the women who were involved in that. Lillie Allen&#8217;s the one that gave us the self help process, but good luck doing an interview with her. But no, it was mostly women with the Project. Dazon, of course, who was working at the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center, and there were a number of black women that came through their revolving door. There were black women&#8212;. There used to be a NARAL chapter here so they had&#8212;. All the prochoice organizations had what I call a revolving door of black women, black women that come and stay a year or two and leave because they can&#8217;t figure out the racism and stuff of those institutions. CGD: I&#8217;m glad you said that because I was trying to figure out the history of Georgian&#8217;s for Choice. LR: Can we stop this&#8212; CGD: Yes. LR: &#8212;and go get some water? [Break in recording] CGD: Okay. We are back on after a short break, and we left off talking and I was getting ready to ask you a question about working interracially, particularly with white feminists, and I was thinking about Georgians for Choice and how that organization&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know if you know very much about that organization, but how have your experiences, either in Georgia or nationally been, working with white mainstream feminist groups, like NOW, obviously, where you served as the director of women of color programs for some time? Is that even a position anymore? LR: No. They&#8217;ve re-changed it. They reorganized it to something less in-your-face, something like the diversity staff position or something, because when I was asked to take the job it was called the minority rights staff person and I resisted the concept of women of color being called a minority. CGD: Did that minority include sexual? LR: No, it was just racial, because there was a separate LGBT staff person. So I remember when I was offered the job they said we&#8217;d like you to help NOW recruit women of color, and I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t recruit. The Marines recruit. I can find out why women of color don&#8217;t stay, because it&#8217;s not like you have problems attracting them but you have problems keeping them.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll serve like an ombudsman, to find out what&#8217;s going on internally that makes you be your worst enemy, because I see women of color coming to NOW all the time, I just don&#8217;t see them staying, so recruiting ain&#8217;t your problem.&#8221; [Laughs] But your larger question, because I worked first in the anti-rape movement and then the anti-sterilization abuse movement, then the prochoice movement, and now in the women&#8217;s human rights movement, I&#8217;ve always had to deal with what I call the impact of white supremacy on the feminist movement because the feminist movement likes to think that because they work against gender oppression that they work against racial oppression automatically, and that&#8217;s not a given. They are intensely uncomfortable, for the most part, with how black women claim and redefine feminism for ourselves, and we intersect it. From Sojourner Truth&#8217;s statement, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t I a Woman?&#8221; we&#8217;ve had an intersectional approach that they find bewildering and the more strident of them would call diluting. So I&#8217;ve always been the bridge. Actually Cherr&#237;e Moraga and others wrote this book called This Bridge Called My Back that I&#8217;ve kind of used as my metaphor because one of the things I read in their book back in the &#8217;80s was that a bridge connects two things and as people walk across that bridge they don&#8217;t necessarily look down and look at what they&#8217;re walking across because their eyes are on their goal of getting to the other side. So for me working in the women&#8217;s movement and making the conscious decision to be that bridge is that I have to pay less attention to what my needs are for being seen and noticed and more attention to the goals that other people are walking across me to achieve. I mean I like being that bridge. I actually found I like being the bridge. CGD: Your back is not tired? LR: Not at all, not at all, because I chose it consciously, and I learned that lesson at NOW because what I find is that at the upper echelons of the women&#8217;s movement you have women who are fairly adept at playing power politics. At NOW I had to learn to separate the normal brutality with which white women treat each other from the racism that they can direct towards women of color, because everything that was brutal that was directed towards women of color was not because of racism. It was treating us like we were white girls, which then can we complain about that? [Laughs] If we asked for equality we were getting equal brutalization. So that was one of the things that&#8212;. Fortunately again I did my growing in a black feminist community so I wasn&#8217;t alone, trying to process this for myself. Whenever I&#8217;d get really pissed off at NOW I had a community of women I could go talk about this, and we could look at it historically, we could look at it in contemporary. There were enough of us working in white feminist organizations that we started this women of color leadership council where we could just talk to each other about what it was like being the token or the only one in these organizations. That&#8217;s what Washington offered that I sought in vain for in other cities and other locations. We had that built in. We built a support system for ourselves in order to survive working in the women&#8217;s movement. But at NOW I learned that the mainstream white organizations coexist and cooperate but then they are actually in deep competition with each other for prestige, for funders, for supporters, for media attention, all of that, and so they can be quite cutthroat with each other. One of the critiques I offer to women of color is that we don&#8217;t take our time to understand the dynamics among white women and so when we think that we&#8217;re not being invited to the table we think it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re women of color, and that&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s just that we don&#8217;t have a power chip to throw on the table, and that&#8217;s why I like building SisterSong as a power player. Yeah. I like building SisterSong as a power player. By massing the organized voice of women of color we got a chip to put on the table. When they wanted me to be the co-director of the March for Women&#8217;s Lives they had to put up a hundred thousand dollars towards women of color organizations&#8212;I&#8217;m sorry, a quarter million dollars, because I got a hundred thousand, not me but my organization, a quarter million dollars to make that happen. That&#8217;s a power. For the first time in organizing a march instead of one little organization at the table putting money up, we made the cash flow fall outward towards women of color. That ain&#8217;t never happened before and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s hubris to say that I could do that with them at any time. Every year I get a hundred thousand dollars out of the mainstream organizations to support SisterSong. I learned power politics at NOW, and I wish I was more invested into working them because I probably could get more, but never has it been&#8212;. My agenda has never been about healing and working with white women; my agenda has been about working with women of color who have to intersect with white women. CGD: So thinking about SisterSong as a power broker who brings something unique and important to the table, what was SisterSong&#8217;s involvement with discussion&#8212;and I&#8217;m going to go back to abortion again&#8212;discussions about abortion and national healthcare reform? LR: Well that was actually a perfect example and a perfect question. We had always been engaged. Even before Obama got elected he called many of us to Washington and in December of 2008 we started meeting with his administration about what we wanted in the women&#8217;s agenda. It&#8217;s been very disappointing, by the way, but that&#8217;s a whole other conversation. But the fact that we were in conversation we saw as tremendously promising. But when we started getting past the Capps Amendment, the Capps compromise, I guess that&#8217;s the best way to put it, and then the right wing started reneging on that and taking abortion on front and center when through their compromise they had said they wouldn&#8217;t, we were very offended by that. So the bottom line is that when it was time to fight the Stupak Amendment it turned out that the prochoice movement, and I&#8217;m talking about Planned Parenthood, NARAL, NOW, Feminist Majority, they had disinvested in the Deep South. CGD: And what do you mean by that? LR: Georgia NARAL no longer exists, right? They shut down their branch, and Spark is replacement but it&#8217;s no longer that. You had tremendous consolidation of Planned Parenthood clinics so Planned Parenthood of Arkansas is actually based in Oklahoma. Planned Parenthood of Georgia is now Planned Parenthood of the Southeast Region, covering several states again. I don&#8217;t know if they were unable to sustain it but the reality is that they disinvested and lost a lot of their base. I mean the whole prochoice strategy came out of Lily&#8212;what&#8217;s her name?&#8212;Lily Ledbetter. Her last name is Ledbetter; I&#8217;m trying to think of her first name. Oh, &#8220;Brownie&#8221; Ledbetter, out of Arkansas, where in the &#8217;70s they were trying to figure out&#8212;. You need to read William [1:59:48] book to get this history, if you haven&#8217;t already. Brownie Ledbetter; Lily Ledbetter was the legal suit. But anyway, around how to get Southern segregationists on board supporting abortion rights through a states rights argument, and so that&#8217;s where the whole prochoice language came from. So we moved from women&#8217;s rights to prochoice and that was an Arkansas strategy that Brownie Ledbetter originated and led and then became the national NARAL strategy. It branded the entire movement and now I think it has damaged us because people see the dichotomy between prochoice and prolife without really focusing on where we started as a feminist movement which was pro-woman. So back to our story, we decided to first of all put the SisterSong national conference in 2009 in Washington to take advantage of the fact that we were in conversation with the Obama administration and then the lobbying that we needed to do around healthcare reform and Stupak, and we did that and it was very, very successful. We had three hundred women of color&#8212;you can read about it in our newsletter&#8212;make office visits in a kind of stunning way. We had seventy visits that were scheduled and then we had two hundred and thirty that were not where we just invaded people&#8217;s offices and scared the bejesus out of them because it looked like&#8212;. They acted like it was the invasion of the Crips and the Bloods on Capitol Hill. [Laughs] [2:01:33 They said] we&#8217;ve never seen women of color like this lobbying us on abortion rights, ever. We&#8217;ve only seen Planned Parenthood and NARAL. So it made an impact. But then a month after our conference we had to take a bus from Atlanta, and the bus went from Mississippi, Alabama, Atlanta, stopped in North Carolina, went on up, carrying women of color up there, and then we flew everybody from Arkansas and Louisiana up there, because when it came to sending delegations to visit with Blanche Lincoln and&#8212;what&#8217;s the woman&#8217;s name from Louisiana?&#8212;Mary Landrieu, the white girls didn&#8217;t have nobody to send. So here we are&#8212;Planned Parenthood paid for the bus, by the way, because they knew they needed that Southern representation that SisterSong was uniquely positioned to provide. So we filled a bus with fifty women of color from all these states and flew some others up there and went and lobbied again against Stupak and then we did it again in January, the following January, but we didn&#8217;t send a bus this time. We said, okay, we&#8217;re through with buses. If you want us up there again you&#8217;re going to fly us all this time, because bus organizing is laborious, and the bus ride for the people from Mississippi was a sixteen-, eighteen-hour bus ride. CGD: Not to mention gas right now. LR: Well I mean they paid for it, but still they got there too tired, and then they had to go to the Hill after three or four hours sleep, so that was too much of a thing to ask women to do over and over and over again, so we insisted they fly the delegation the next time so it ended up being a delegation of about twenty women instead of the fifty or sixty we&#8217;d mobilized before, including Fannie Lou Hamer&#8217;s family. CGD: Really? LR: We got them on our delegation, yeah. We were so proud of that. CGD: What family members does she have that are&#8212;? LR: Nieces and nephews. They started the Fannie Lou Hamer Center down in Mississippi so they came on our bus and they&#8212;. They [2:04:01], so we&#8217;re really proud of that, to have them as part of our base that we&#8217;re able to mobilize. CGD: What&#8217;s their angle? LR: Fighting poverty, fighting racism in Mississippi, the same things that Fannie was fighting. Now they&#8217;ve added fighting for women&#8217;s rights more explicitly. So they&#8217;re really cool kids. I mean they&#8217;re not kids; they&#8217;re my age or a little less. It was so great to have them on the delegation. CGD: So was there a point in the discussions about Stupak and abortion where SisterSong was excluded from the table? LR: [Pause] Not in particular because the whole prochoice movement got excluded from the table. They didn&#8217;t single us out. I mean I thought that they were na&#239;ve to think that the compromise with the Democrats over the Capps Amendment was going to keep abortion off the table. As a matter of fact that&#8217;s where we got excluded because if we had been asked our opinion about whether or not abortion was going to be kept off the table by the Republicans I would have said, hell no. There&#8217;s nothing in their history to make us think that they&#8217;re going to live up to this agreement and it&#8217;s na&#239;ve of you to think so, and they didn&#8217;t. So Obama kept getting pushed further and further to the right and frankly abandoning the prochoice community, but the fight we had was after the blueprint. We were part of a coalition that put together what&#8217;s called the One Hundred Days Blueprint for Women&#8217;s Rights for Obama, and it was things that we wanted him to do in the first hundred days, like repeal the global gag rule, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So our fight with the mainstream organizations is they didn&#8217;t want to put the Hyde Amendment in the first hundred days. No they didn&#8217;t. CGD: Because they&#8212;? LR: Because it&#8217;s conventional wisdom on their part that taxpayers don&#8217;t want to pay for abortion. Just because you think so don&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t fight for it. That&#8217;s been the position of women of color since 1976. White girls are weak on Hyde and we have to lead that struggle. So we had that fight with all the prochoice organizations. Not all of them, because some of them are more pro-Hyde than others. CGD: Who&#8217;s more pro-Hyde? LR: Like the National Network of Abortion Funds, because they have to pay for the abortions that the government should be paying for, or National Abortion Federation. Planned Parenthood was tepid at best and unsupportive at some times, and NARAL. Everybody gives lip service to Hyde but I have a tendency to judge their commitment by how much of their budgets and staff they put up because I know white girls. They put their money where their mouth is. For what they want to do they find the money; for what they don&#8217;t want to do they&#8217;re broke. I&#8217;ve been watching that for thirty-five years. I&#8217;m not confused. So we got to our first face to face meeting with the Obama administration as a divided coalition because you had the women of color being we want Hyde in and the prochoice movement saying we don&#8217;t, and I tell you, the Obama administration drove a Mack truck through that split. The first thing they said: Well y&#8217;all aren&#8217;t in agreement on this so how can we support this if as advocates you are not united? They&#8217;ve been backtracking down Hyde ever since. So you end up with the larger prochoice organizations who have the lobbyists and the daily presence on the Hill really creating the space for the Obama administration to grow weaker and weaker for [women&#8217;s rights]. I love President Obama. He would have to stand in my living room and throw some hot grits on my face for me not to vote for him, and he&#8217;d have to do it on purpose because if it was an accident he&#8217;d still get my vote. [Laughs] That&#8217;s how much I love him. At the same time, he doesn&#8217;t get a pass from me because I feel like I represent part of the millions of black women that got him into office, so he owes me as much as he owes anybody on Wall Street, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, and I&#8217;m not going to fight for access to him if the access is not producing anything. [Mobile phone rings] Excuse me a minute. [Break in recording] CGD: Okay, un-pausing. LR: So I think that&#8212;. Are you double recording it? CGD: Yeah, backup method. LR: That&#8217;s so smart. So I think that there still is a schism between what women of color want from the Obama administration and how we would tactically go about it and what the mainstream wants and how they tactically go about it. As I keep saying to them every time I go to Washington, it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re winning. I mean what do you have to lose by trying another strategy, because it&#8217;s not like yours has been wildly successful, not even partially successful. As a matter of fact every time you sit down with them we lose something. [Laughs] But there is that we-know-better kind of thing that happens, and I admit I&#8217;m not the best versed person in policy, but one of the things that I do know a little bit about it mobilizing and using grassroots power and I just don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re handling the administration right. I really don&#8217;t, particularly for a prochoice administration. We are not up against anybody who&#8217;s anti-choice but when Obama says show me the votes they mean it. They mean it. You just can&#8217;t show up there with [2:10:52]. They mean show me the votes. So if he needs three votes from Ohio then you need to be out there busting your ass getting him three votes from Ohio. You just can&#8217;t be in Washington saying, well, you know, it&#8217;s the right thing to do. [Laughs] It&#8217;s almost like they forget their own game of power politics. I don&#8217;t know why they think because the President is a black man he&#8217;s going to deal with them or do for them more than they could get out of a similarly positioned white politician. What is that about? So I think that they&#8217;ve squandered the opportunities offered during his first administration around abortion politics domestically and I&#8217;m not so sure we&#8217;ve better positioned ourselves to get more out of him in the second administration. Now one thing we know about the lame duck administration is that they usually can get more because there&#8217;s no other office they can run for after that, [Laughs] so like Clinton and others they tend to be much more liberal the second time around than the first. But I really think that what concerns me is how women of color in general and black women in particular are going to amass our power to have an impact because we no longer need&#8212;. I don&#8217;t think it works for us to be under the umbrella of a mainstream organization in terms of policy work. CGD: So that&#8217;s why we need Trust Black Women? LR: For example, yes, absolutely. Now Trust Black Women is not necessarily seeking to be a political force but we are going to fight anti-black legislation across the country. I mean we&#8217;re going further than the administration because the administration has not done any particularly pro-black anything either. [Laughs] But TBW, and I started talking about that earlier, is the first and most permanently intentionally organized formation of black women to fight for abortion rights, because I talked about the temporary ad hoc nature of both our Webster and our Casey efforts and this is the time to do that differently. As a matter of fact many of us who formed TBW were involved in defense of Anita Hill where we formed African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, and many of us said, damn, we should have kept that one together because we need to be in defense of ourselves again. [Laughs] CGD: I thought Trust Black Women might have originally been named Black Women in Defense of Ourselves. LR: That was one of the early names that was suggested, actually. How did you know that? CGD: Because I know things like that. LR: And you read. [Laughs] That&#8217;s actually one of the early&#8212;that we should just pick up that name and do African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, or Black Women in Defense of Ourselves, but we had a branding consultant work with us that Byllye Avery had located for us, and this smart, smart white man walked us through our origin, our values, our competitors, what we&#8217;re up against, and we ended up with Trust Black Women. He said it&#8217;s an affirmative statement of what you want people to do as well as what you stand for, so we loved it and every time we see it a black woman smiles, which is who we speak to. [Laughs] It&#8217;s interesting, because the white audience, the white feminist community has a more ambivalent reaction to the concept of trusting black women, and there are black men who are unalterably opposed to the concept. [Interruption from 2:15:08 to 2:15:25] CGD: So there are black men who are just absolutely opposed to the concept of trusting black women. LR: Yeah, because we&#8217;ve done focus groups in four cities&#8212;three cities&#8212;Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas, of black people. The other thing we&#8217;ve done is launched a regional research delving deeply into attitudes toward abortion in the African American community, which has never been done before, and we&#8217;ll be releasing that data this fall. We&#8217;ve done a lot of opinion research that was initiated with six focus groups of educated men and women, because we had a very specific demographic that we were going after as TBW&#8217;s potential base. The male focus group literally said: I respect black women, maybe, but I don&#8217;t know if I trust them. And of course when you&#8217;re behind the glass watching a focus group you want to just bust through the glass: [2:16:40] You trust your mama? You trust your sister? I mean this gets to some really deeply seeded misogyny here that is seen as acceptable as homophobia in the black community that we need to address head on, unearth, and challenge. I mean you&#8217;re a married man to a black woman saying you don&#8217;t trust black women? What does that say about your marriage? What does that say about the community in which you live? Is that why they&#8217;re all marrying white women? What does that say? It says we&#8217;re still deeply dysfunctional in gender relations. So the name has been a challenge. Like I said, totally embraced by our base, the ones we named ourselves for, black women, and building around white women because some white women love it and then some white women think they&#8217;ve been left out. They want to be mammied and of course we&#8217;re not going for that. We actually had one consultant who was trying to get a job with us, saying that she felt our name left her out. I said you obviously ain&#8217;t the right one for the job if you think this is about you. [Laughs] You&#8217;re hired to serve us, not the other way around, girlfriend, and you&#8217;re a consultant and you lost sight of that relationship? [Laughs] She didn&#8217;t like the name because she feels like it leaves out white women. CGD: Well there are ways for white women to be allies. LR: Of course, but she was too busy being hurt because she wasn&#8217;t in the name. We didn&#8217;t go to the Trust Women people and say well you left out black women. CGD: Did you have any official kind of organizational responses from other organizations about the name? LR: No. No, nothing that they would at least put on record. Generally speaking the response has been positive, and I want to say it was not universal for all black men; it was just notable that in the focus groups of black men&#8212;because we did not do co-ed focus groups, we did gender-specific focus groups&#8212;there was a significant number of black men who had problems with the phrase &#8220;trust black women.&#8221; That identifies work we need to do, not just on abortion but that&#8217;s on everything. And then they said, &#8220;Well we respect them,&#8221; and that was halfheartedly offered. To my knowledge I don&#8217;t think there was a man in that focus group married to a white woman, because we asked about marital status and stuff like that, college education, whether Democrat or Republican, religiosity, how frequently they went to church, and all kinds of stuff. So, a lot more work to be done. CGD: So we&#8217;ll be hearing about your survey data. LR: Yeah. We&#8217;re going to be releasing that in the fall. Needless to say it is complicated by the fact that every prochoice organization wants our data but they didn&#8217;t help pay for us to get it done. Hell no, it&#8217;s ours, and you don&#8217;t get something for nothing, because that ain&#8217;t how SisterSong rolls and that ain&#8217;t how TBW rolls. That&#8217;s a whole other conversation. CGD: For real. LR: And they&#8217;re not used to that. They really are learning, and I&#8217;m not mad at them because I know them all. I&#8217;m not mad at them but as I understand it they&#8217;ve never had to respect the mass power of women of color like they have to do now, in my mind, through SisterSong, and I&#8217;m not saying that there aren&#8217;t other women of color organizations that they work with well, National Latina Reproductive Health, [2:21:14], others, but those are ethnic based, and over the years they&#8217;ve worked with the National Council of Negro Women. But to me that&#8217;s a classic example where they respected Dorothy Height, but Dorothy Height shouldn&#8217;t have had to work her way to death, because if they really, really respected her they&#8217;d have given her the million and a half dollars like they gave Gloria Steinem when it was time for Gloria to step down from Ms. Magazine, give her an exit strategy with money. They didn&#8217;t give that to Dorothy Height. So I do get mad about that, when they claim to be all that about racism and supporting black women&#8217;s leadership, but like I said I look to where the checkbook goes to see if they really mean it, so all the tributes to Dorothy Height don&#8217;t mean nothing when you&#8217;re head of a five hundred million dollar foundation and you can&#8217;t give a sister, who&#8217;s in her nineties, a way to gracefully retire without having to go to work every day, and the service she&#8217;s been to the movement. That really pisses me off, because I saw them do it for&#8212;. Every time they want to take care of one of their senior white women they do. CGD: I have two more questions. Since you&#8217;re in your sixties&#8212;. LR: Well actually technically I&#8217;m fifty-eight. CGD: Okay. LR: I live a sixties life. I so desire sixties so much. I want to inch closer to social security as fast as I can. Technically I&#8217;m fifty-eight though. CGD: Okay. So closing in on your sixties, are you concerned about there not being enough young activists to carry on the work you and others have done? Is that a concern? LR: No, no. I don&#8217;t think we were an unusual generation. I think we just fell into the chain of leadership that our ancestors set out for us. I was lucky enough in my twenties to be appointed to the D.C. Commission for Women by Marion Barry when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, and there were blue-haired black women who knew Mary Church Terrell and Mary McLeod Bethune who took me under their wings and showed me a lot about women&#8217;s power and feminist consciousness through a black lens. One of them, I&#8217;ll never forget her, her name was Ruth Sikes, she was the aid to Dorothy Height, who was on the commission with me, and I used to be so&#8212;. I was more mouthy then than I am now, because I had the brashness and the bad judgment and the impatience of youth. So the D.C. government was doing a RIF, a reduction in force, because of a budgetary crisis, so they had adopted a last hired, first fired policy, and I was saying we should challenge that because a lot of the last hired are women, single women, so we need to demand an assessment of the impact of this policy, a gender assessment of the impact of this policy, and I was all for marching down to Barry&#8217;s office and kicking over stools and whatever. I said just because we are appointed by the mayor don&#8217;t mean we necessarily totally serve at the pleasure of the mayor, and it ain&#8217;t our job to cover his ass when he makes a decision that harms the interests of women. It&#8217;s our job to call it to his attention that he&#8217;s making a decision&#8212;that&#8217;s the way you really cover his butt, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, not just grin and bear it, because this is the D.C. Commission for Women. Most of the commissions for women at the time were governors&#8217; wives and dah, dah, dah, you know, political pay-off appointees, not people actually taking feminism and gender issues seriously. This was D.C. [Laughs] Like I said, we had a big black feminist consciousness going on and I personally took our charge very seriously. So Ruth Sikes pulled me to the sides after I&#8217;d finished talking this boo coo trash. I almost called them everything but Uncle Toms at this meeting. She took me to the side. She said, &#8220;Loretta, our job was to get our foot into the door. That&#8217;s what we did in the &#8217;50s and the &#8217;60s and now the &#8217;70s.&#8221; She said, &#8220;So I guess your job must be to turn the table over [Laughs] [2:26:16 once you got into the door.]&#8221; She said, &#8220;But you can&#8217;t disrespect the ones who got you into the door while we respect the ones that are turning the table over. Are we agreed?&#8221; And that little blue-haired woman rocked my world and I felt connected to the chain of black women, because she knew Mary Church Terrell. She knew Mary McLeod Bethune. She worked for Dorothy Height. So I have no doubt about the generation following me because of that. They are turning the table over more than I did, but it&#8217;s also a result of being twenty-something and thinking you know everything [Laughs] and we&#8217;re all too conservative for you and you have the answer and you don&#8217;t think anybody else has figured this out. I mean it&#8217;s all the hubris of youth. I have no doubt. As a matter of fact I think they&#8217;re going to be even more successful than previous generations because they live in a naturally intersectional world. They live with fewer boundaries and fewer restrictions and fewer boxes than any generation before them. So I think that&#8217;s going to be the generation that finally&#8212;. The generations that follow me, and particularly the ones in their thirties, like you, they&#8217;re the ones that are going to actually build a united human rights movement where there&#8217;s a women&#8217;s rights wing and a youth wing and an environmental wing, but they&#8217;re not going to meekly accept being separated into the women&#8217;s movement versus the environmental movement versus the civil rights movement. They&#8217;re going to ask [2:28:12] where&#8217;s the movement where we all join? CGD: So my last question was thinking about movements and thinking about Atlanta and the civil rights mantle that has been in this city, and thinking about how different groups use it and appropriate the civil rights mantle, so I&#8217;m wondering what you think about the idea that the coming civil rights fight is a fight for the rights of the fetus? LR: Well as I said somewhere else, you can&#8217;t steal civil rights, and you can&#8217;t appropriate it and misuse it. To me that&#8217;s akin to a charge of reverse discrimination and it&#8217;s born of the same origin and by the same people, so that&#8217;s more than a coincidence. But you can&#8217;t steal civil rights. You cannot call yourself fighting for the rights of the fetus by oppressing black women. Why would you think we&#8217;re going to stand for that? After we&#8217;ve fought, bled and died for these rights you&#8217;re suddenly going to say, oh no, you are now just the wombs for the next black generation. I mean that is so Nazi-esque. Why do they think we&#8217;re going to go for that? It&#8217;s like, are you the black Aryans now, telling us that we&#8217;re breeders? [Laughs] What are you saying, and why do you think we&#8217;re going to go for it? It&#8217;s so in violation of human rights because not only does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights say in its opening chapter, opening article, every human being is born equal in rights and dignity, and in 1948 they weren&#8217;t thinking about the prolife abortion fight. They just made the commonsense analysis that you have to be born to claim the rights. You can&#8217;t just be a thought, an egg united to a sperm. You can&#8217;t be a wish. You actually have to be here to claim human rights. [Laughs] Common sense approach. So for the anti-abortion movement to try to appropriate not only civil rights but human rights to its cause is the same kind of opportunism that white people who claim that they&#8217;re damaged by affirmative action try to appropriate civil rights to their cause. It&#8217;s the same people for the same motives doing the same thing, in my opinion. But you can&#8217;t steal civil rights. You can&#8217;t steal human rights. You can&#8217;t steal justice. So I see them making their attempts. They take advantage of confusion but their whole politics is one of confusion, so that&#8217;s nothing unique or original about them. There&#8217;s always people trying to manipulate the African American community for the benefit of white supremacy and this is another example of it. Again it&#8217;s not unique, it&#8217;s not original. It&#8217;s nothing that we want to ignore, because we don&#8217;t need a confused community, but at the same time, as many have said before, we need to keep our eyes on the prize too and not let these attempted red herrings or diversions keep us from seeking true liberation in human rights. They&#8217;re crazy. So I see it, I expose it, I call people out on it, but also I think that I tend to distinguish between the true believers, like a Ryan Bomberger, and the opportunists, like a Catherine Davis, because I&#8217;ve done anti-Klan work. We didn&#8217;t even talk about my history doing anti-Klan work. CGD: We will have to do another interview on that alone. LR: [Laughs] Exactly, because I did that after I left the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project. I monitored hate groups and the Ku Klux Klan, being the only black person going to many, many Klan rallies. So I don&#8217;t think a person being on the Right by definition makes them my opponent. My father was fairly right-wing conservative, and I have family members in the ministry and all that. There&#8217;s a lot we disagree on, so that&#8217;s okay. By definition that doesn&#8217;t make you my opponent, but hypocrisy does, and I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s left-wing hypocrisy or right-wing hypocrisy. But I sharply disagree with people who&#8217;ve had abortions themselves, availed themselves of legal opportunities they want to deny others. That pisses me off. Just like white people do not give black people economic opportunities that they took advantage themselves of. Pisses me off, because that&#8217;s the ultimate in hypocrisy. I think this whole racist immigration movement, by a group of people who ain&#8217;t nothing but immigrants themselves, pisses me off. [Laughs] It is the ultimate in hypocrisy. So I don&#8217;t care that much&#8212;. So true believers like Ryan Bomberger, he has a point of view, he has a legitimate history he&#8217;s passionate about; I&#8217;m not mad at Ryan. I mean I&#8217;d maybe ask the question if he cares so much about black babies why come you ain&#8217;t having them with a black woman, but that&#8217;s a whole other&#8212;. That&#8217;s a personal choice. Actually I would never say that though in a public setting because I wouldn&#8217;t want to attack his dignity that way. But in terms of the opportunists like a Randall Terry or a Catherine Davis or a Joe Scheidler, those people, who see fighting abortion as a path to political power, are all these suddenly late-come switchers, like Mitt Romney and others, who are prochoice when it was popular to be prochoice and now they&#8217;re anti-abortion because they think it&#8217;s going to win them more votes; I have no use for those fools in terms of respecting their political position because it&#8217;s obvious that their 76 Yes MP3 WAV 2:50:44 No No No No Unknown 16 44 2 Sound Text Interview with Loretta Ross by Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell, 18 August 2011 U-1044, in the Southern Oral History Program Collection #4007, Southern Historical Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
