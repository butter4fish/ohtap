 Jessica Wilkerson: This is Jessie Wilkerson, and I am with Marian Colette in Williamsburg, Kentucky, and the date is August 13, 2010. So Marian, do you want to start by telling me where you come from and how you ended up in eastern Kentucky? Marian Colette: Okay. I really don&#8217;t want to bore you with my whole life history, but the pertinent parts I think I can highlight. Yeah, I was born in Chicago, Illinois, but basically grew up in Wisconsin, across the Illinois-Wisconsin line. Went to school in Milwaukee, Alverno College, which is a great all-women&#8217;s school, very much fostering women&#8217;s leadership. When I graduated from Alverno, I taught some in an inner-city school in Milwaukee that was basically low-income white and Latino. Milwaukee is a very divided city. Maybe not now, I don't know, I haven&#8217;t been there for a while. But there are like, viaducts over the central valley, and the north side was like the African American community. On the south side, it was all white. But the nearer to the viaducts you came, it was a low-income area. It was an inner-city community, but a white inner city. Anyway. Alverno College contacted me to--. They had gotten some money, I think it was, I&#8217;m not sure what title, but under the Higher Education Act. They had just begun a women&#8217;s center at the college and had gotten a grant to do women&#8217;s leadership development for inner-city women. And asked me, although I don't know what qualified me to do this. I was twenty-three years old, and I was to develop week-long live-in workshops for inner-city women, Latino women, and then African American women. Women and their children at the college. So I did that project, and one of the schools, Sisters of Saint Francis, that was working here in Williamsburg, is a good friend of mine. I was also at the time a member of the school, Sisters of Saint Francis, so. Sister Noelle asked me to, she said, you know, &#8220;Rural women need leadership development too. Why don&#8217;t you come down and work in this area?&#8221; And so I committed to come for a year. In the meantime, I met my husband-to-be, so I told Noelle, &#8220;I&#8217;ll still come, but the situation has changed a little. I&#8217;ll be bringing somebody with me.&#8221; And that was fine with her; she just wanted me to come. So I came with the idea that I was going to work at Rural Women&#8217;s Leadership. But when I arrived, it wasn&#8217;t clear what that opportunity was going to be like. And so I wound up helping at the friendship center, which was basically sorting and hanging used clothes for sale. And I quickly realized this isn&#8217;t what I want to do. Noelle suggested we spend an evening with Marie Cirillo, so we went on up the mountain and spend an evening with Marie. She had just come back from D.C., where there was the organizing meeting of a group called Rural American Women. So she was talking about Rural American Women, and you know, what all their aspirations were for that organization. And it occurred to me, maybe we could start an organization here for rural women in this area. We&#8217;ve already got a number of women involved in these little community centers, like where you called Brenda yesterday, the Crazy Quilt. We&#8217;ve got a friendship center here, we had a craft center in Mulberry. And up on the mountain with Marie, there used to be a mountain crafts project, and other--. There&#8217;s a community land trust, and other projects up there. Which all involved women. In fact, women are usually the mainstay of these community projects. If there are men, it&#8217;s usually the husbands of the women, called in to do some maintenance work or whatever. But the real leadership comes from the women. So the concept was evolved that, you know, we could network these women in an organization, and basically for the purpose of helping them develop leadership skills. Originally, the concept was to have a quarterly session where we&#8217;d do--. We&#8217;d have like a workshop, a gathering, both for networking for the women to get to know one another, develop a sense of kind of pride in what they were doing, and then develop some skills that would help them in their work and push their work further out into the community. So we began like that. And of course everything evolves. So we had an opportunity to apply for some--. One of our members, Tilda Kemplan, found out by going to Berea for some meeting, that there was the opportunity to apply for CETA funds. The old CETA, I think it might&#8217;ve been Jimmy Carter&#8217;s presidency. Concentrated Employment Training Act. So we applied for some money, and this was to have women become a house--. Homebuilder, house building crew, do home repair and homebuilding in the area. So we called it the Homemakers. And hired four women, four or five women, and then we did get a man to be like the construction supervisor and trainer with the women. So I don't know how many years that project lasted, but they did an awful lot of home repair and building. And because they were an all-women crew, after the project ended they got a couple contracts through government sources to do some home repair because they qualified as minority builders. JW: So when you were talking about women&#8217;s leadership development, can you say a little more about what that means, really? What that entailed? MC: Well, I think leadership begins with a person acknowledging their own skills and ability to interact with other people and encourage other people to get involved. So part of it is kind of a self confidence building activity, and the other thing is kind of a community organizing aspect, where you take a look at your community and you discuss what are, you know--. What are the major issues that are facing people in our community? And then try to decide, you know, what the biggest needs and issues are, and what steps could possibly be taken to begin to address those issues? Then developing strategies and plans to do that. JW: So when you got here, what were those really pressing issues that you saw in the community that needed to be addressed? MC: This was quite a while ago. It was--. JW: Now what year did you come here? MC: It was &#8217;78. I don't know what year the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange started. Did you get that from anyone? JW: I did, somewhere. MC: Like, early eighties. JW: Yeah. MC: Real pressing issues. [pause] Well, housing has always been in terrible shape. We worked with the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises for years to try to make a difference there. Maternal [and] infant health. Very high rate of premature births. Babies and then more mundane things like the roads, you know. I&#8217;d say on the health side, the isolation that a lot of the women suffered. And an ever-pressing issue in this area, which is very true today, is no jobs. Which leads to a lot of problems in terms of alcoholism, domestic violence. Yeah, domestic violence. Huge issue. And then on the environmental side--. Well, back then in the late seventies, it was strip mining. And I forget the year the strip mine legislation passed, but when I first moved down here there was all kinds of efforts being organized around trying to get federal strip mine legislation passed. And now of course, it&#8217;s mountaintop removal. JW: Mmm-hmm. So can you say a little bit more about your motivations to work on women's leadership development, and work on women's issues? What were the influences for you earlier on that led you to move very far away? MC: I think [pause] because of my religious upbringing I had always had this huge motivation to be of service in the community. JW: You came from a Catholic background? MC: Mmm-hmm. So that kind of kept me involved. Of course, I was in college in the sixties, so I got deeply involved, not so much in the antiwar but in the civil rights activities and the farm workers&#8217; organizing. I was always going to meetings or working on some aspect, or going to a march, or whatever. So I was very involved in that way, and I think that was a motivation. Then when I did graduate from college, I was motivated to teach in the inner-city, even though I didn&#8217;t want to. I felt like the African American kids needed African American teachers, and I felt like I wanted to work kind of in my own community for my own people, and then I made the decision that I could identify with low-income women; that was my community. That there I--. It wouldn&#8217;t be like, it would be like being one of the people I was working with, not so much like going in as some kind of a savior individual, but more working with people on my own on some of the things that were of concern to me and to them. JW: Can you tell me a little more about your upbringing and about your family? MC: Like I said, I&#8217;m from an Italian Catholic family. Well really, my dad was Italian. My mother was Norwegian. But Italians are more dominant than Norwegians I guess, [Laughter] so I know very little about Norwegian. We were really raised with an Italian culture. In an extended family kind of situation in Chicago, you know, where Grandma and Grandpa, my mom and dad, [and] my aunt and uncle all lived in the same house. So and Tuesday night was always spaghetti night, so Grandma always cooked for everybody on Tuesday. I went to Catholic schools in Chicago. Saint William&#8217;s, from grade school on. Then in high school I went to Milwaukee to the Saint Joseph&#8217;s Convent High School. [pause] I have three sisters and a brother. I think we had a real fun childhood because we lived on a lake home in Wisconsin, so always swimming, fishing, waterskiing, boating. And then in the winter it was ice skating, ice fishing. My dad even built a big slide that went from the house down the hill to the lake, so we could take the toboggan down and go out on the ice. Like I said, we had a great time growing up. Had bicycles and always rode our bikes. No video games or anything like that then. It was all kinds of outdoor stuff, which was great for kids. JW: What did your parents do? MC: My dad was a plumber. He worked for twenty-eight years as a plumber. A union plumber in Chicago, and then bought his own plumbing business, or developed it in Chicago and later in Niles, Illinois. Developed into a really huge business; he had a hundred plumbers working for him. They did a lot of the plumbing in the subdivisions around Chicago, so. At the time when it was all booming and building. So he did that and my mom was a housekeeper, homemaker or whatever you call it. Never worked outside the home, was very typical of your housewife of the fifties. Our life revolved around family, friends in the neighborhood, playing outside, and church stuff. JW: Were your parents very political? MC: Nope. My dad was somewhat involved through the union stuff. I remember him going out campaigning door-to-door but that was an internal union thing. They weren&#8217;t in democratic or republican politics. JW: How did they respond when you were getting more involved in civil rights--? MC: My dad was always very--I know how you&#8217;d say it--very non-prejudiced. He was in World War Two and had several African American friends, and always thought it was a crime that when he and they would go driving someplace, they weren&#8217;t allowed to eat in the restaurant together. They were told that his friend had to go eat in the kitchen. And according to him, he went into the kitchen to eat with his friend, so in that sense he was very understanding of that. If I had gotten involved very much in antiwar, probably not. And in their later years, my dad--I mean, they&#8217;re deceased now for about ten years--but in their later years, he got real conservative, very, very conservative. So we didn&#8217;t discuss politics because it would always be a big argument. I think in term of family, you don&#8217;t argue politics or religion. Family is more important and was to my father too. He preached that constantly, that family is the most important thing. So to this day I don&#8217;t--. I have very conservative siblings, but we just don&#8217;t argue about it. If they want to vent I just listen to them and let it go. They know that I don&#8217;t think that way. JW: Was there a point when you became aware of the women&#8217;s movement? MC: Yeah. Well, I think early on, when Betty Friedan published The Feminine Mystique. I read that book and I know I gave it to my sister, who&#8217;s a year younger than I am. Who never went to college. She was highly incensed, because it was like, you know, &#8220;This is an insult to the way I want to live my life. I just want to be a wife and a mother, and stay at home, take care of my kids. That&#8217;s the right way to do things. I don&#8217;t buy into any of this.&#8221; So I guess I--. Through reading--. I&#8217;m an avid reader. Through reading, like I said, read The Feminine Mystique early on. Then I wasn&#8217;t really a member, an active member on a local level with NOW or anything, but I think basically because there really wasn&#8217;t a chapter where I was. I&#8217;m sure in Milwaukee there was, but--. I wasn&#8217;t officially involved in that sense. But going to Alverno, I mean--. Being at an all-women&#8217;s college, it just pervaded the atmosphere there. JW: Did you read The Feminine Mystique when you were in college, or had you read it before going? MC: Before going. JW: So you were young. MC: Mmm-hmm. Because I gave it to my sister and at the time, she was working in my dad&#8217;s office as like, secretary or phone-answerer. So that was before I went to college. JW: Were there any other campus organizations that you were getting involved in, or consciousness-raising? MC: I was the chairperson of the, like the campus political action committee. What do I know, what do I remember about that? Not much. The only thing is that when Paul Newman was campaigning for Senator McGovern, he came to the campus and I got to meet him. [Laughter] That was neat. Just to shake his hand and look into those blue eyes. Also, Robert Kennedy came to our campus. Got to meet him and shake his hand. But outside of any local political action, not much. I did get involved during college with a civil rights suit in Milwaukee. I&#8217;m trying to think, it was the Milwaukee school integration suit. Lloyd Barbee was this African American attorney that was like, I don't know what you call it, putting forth the suit. What do you call that? Promulgating is not the word. He was sponsoring. [Laughter] I don't think that&#8217;s the word either. He was doing the suit. JW: [Laughter] We know what you mean. MC: I volunteered to help with the research aspects of it. So many nights I&#8217;d go down to Lloyd&#8217;s office. There were some Vista volunteers that also worked on it. And some of my college classmates. And we would do research. I remember one aspect of research was to try to prove that African American kids were suspended or expelled at a greater rate than white kids in Milwaukee schools. We had to research who was suspended or expelled, and then how do you know they were African American? We had to go through sometimes there were little indications on the suspension card. But we mostly had to go through school yearbooks and try to match a face with a name. For a year. So it wasn&#8217;t like real high-level work, kind of scout work, but at least it put me in touch with people of similar, like minds. I remember the night of the Democratic Convention in 19--. What was the big one, when they had the riots? Sixty--what? JW: Oh, in Chicago? MC: In Chicago, yeah. JW: Was it &#8217;68? MC: &#8217;68, yeah. &#8217;68 Democratic Convention. We were all in attorney Barbee&#8217;s office, and he had a TV there. We spent the whole night watching the TV, got some breakfast in the morning, and made a whole night of it. That&#8217;s going back quite a bit. JW: Yeah. Were people--. Were you angry at what you saw going on? MC: Sure. JW: So what was a--. MC: I regret that I never got to--. You know, I never went, like with freedom riders down South to Mississippi, Alabama, anything like that. I was late for that; I was just involved, like in Milwaukee there was a Catholic priest, Father Groppi, who led a lot of civil rights marches in Milwaukee. Got involved with him, and whatever. I mean he&#8217;s dead now. But. And then the United Farm Workers with C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, there was a big Farm Worker support in Milwaukee that I got involved with and helped with, like boycotting lettuce at various grocery stores. It seems so long ago and far away. I mean, down here, activism doesn&#8217;t so much mean marching and protesting. Only did a little bit of that down here, with a--. My husband and I were very active in a movement to stop a landfill from coming into Kenzie Holler here in the county. And so organized a group of people down there, pretty good-sized group, and educated ourselves about the dangers of this landfill, et cetera, et cetera. And we did have one little protest march around the courthouse here in town. We all wore garbage bags and pinned garbage to them. Taped garbage to these black plastic bags. JW: And did you stop the land--? MC: We stopped it, yeah. We stopped it. And it was wonderful to meet some of those folks, even today. We reminisce about our garbage days. JW: So what was it like to be--. MC: Back to Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, maybe. So I said we had that Homemakers program. But we did continue to have our quarterly in-service meetings. None really stand out in my mind. But at one point, I found an opportunity to apply for a grant to the Title One Higher Education Act, the thing that had funded the leadership program that got me started. But it was for women underserved by higher education in their community. So that&#8217;s where we connect with Susan Ambler. I wrote a grant to get a college grant going in Jellico, Tennessee, through Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange that would provide opportunities for women to get a college degree but do it in a context of like, community development. That their subjects should reflect a knowledge of and concern about the local community. Which, Susan really understood that very much. I&#8217;m not saying the other teachers all did, but--. And I can&#8217;t remember how many years that operated. Four or five years, I think. We were first partnered with Roane State Community College, and then later with Carson-Newman [College]. Teachers from Carson-Newman would come up, and I don't know how many women got their degree. I think Wanda Perkins might have been one of them. Phyllis Miller, who just passed away a couple weeks ago, was one. And I think Glenna Angel, her sister. Did you talk to Glenna-- JW: I haven&#8217;t talked to Glenna yet, no. MC: She might be a little reticent to speak because of Phyllis&#8217; death. I don't know, I haven&#8217;t seen her since. But she would know. I think her daughter Tish got her degree there. So there&#8217;s a number of women that are, that have been able to have jobs and be active in the community because of going through the college program. Which I&#8217;m really proud of. Was a wonderful thing. JW: Was there support in the community for doing that? Like, did people get support from their families to pursue an education? MC: The ones that managed to do it did, yeah. I&#8217;m sure there was some--. You know. They were not supported and maybe didn&#8217;t come. Brenda Lay, at one point, coordinated that program. You might talk to Brenda about it because I left Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange. I was the first director of it, for about four or five years. And I worked with Phyllis Miller. Phyllis and I used to joke that she was the in-house director because she was in the office a lot, and I was the out-house director because I&#8217;d be out networking with other organizations and bringing the message of Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange and seeing how we could link together in some work. So at the time, we connected with a lot of different regional organizations. I left the Exchange because a friend of mine at Vanderbilt&#8217;s Center for Health Services, Dick Couto, had connected with the Ford Foundation. The Ford Foundation was interested in women&#8217;s health issues, maternal/child health issues, so he brought down a bunch of doctors and people from Ford, and he called me and asked if I would host a meeting with them and take them out to meet some community women. Which we did, and then they were really I guess impressed in a bad way. Impressed with how bad things were, health-wise, for women in these communities. Especially for pregnant women and children. So because of that, Vanderbilt got the grant--a large, large grant from Ford to begin maternal/infant health outreach programs in a number of communities. And Dick called me back and said, &#8220;Since you helped us, we&#8217;d like to give one of the grants to Whitley County. Would you like to begin the program there?&#8221; And I said &#8220;Well, I don't know anything about health,&#8221; and he said &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to know about health. You just have to know about organizing a program, and you can do it.&#8221; So I took the job, partly because--. Mostly because I had worked for Mountain Women's Exchange, and other nonprofits, you work kind of year-by-year, not knowing if you&#8217;re going to have a salary or how much or whatever. Mostly like being a Vista volunteer and making five hundred dollars a month. But this one offered--. It sounds like peanuts these days, but $18,000 a year. So, whoopee. And I&#8217;m trying to think what year that was. My Sarah was born in &#8217;81, so. Yeah, I had her in my Mountain Women's Exchange Momemaker days. Because I was with--. Remember I told you there was a man who was supervising the women's crew, and we had gotten some contracts from the government to do some home repairs where we would be paid from some kind of a government program. So I was with--Ross was his name--I was with Ross, on Kentucky Hill, looking at some of these homes, looking at the repair jobs, what it would be. And we&#8217;re going down the hill and my water broke. I said, &#8220;Hey Ross, we&#8217;ve got to get back to the office. My water just broke. I gotta get back home and go to the hospital.&#8221; So we did, so that was &#8217;81. Anyway, I&#8217;m losing my train here. JW: So you became the director for the--. MC: Maternal health, yeah. So that had to be, that was after &#8217;81, because Sarah was already born. But I took the job because it was a little more income, well really to be honest, a lot more income than what I had. Not that we couldn&#8217;t have--. My husband and I managed on very, very little. We amaze ourselves today when we look back and say, &#8220;How did we ever do it?&#8221; But we did. Living on a Vista salary and what little he could make. We cleaned buildings and stuff in the evenings. Did janitor work to make a little extra money. But anyway I took the job and began a maternal and infant health program here in the county, which was a heck of a--. It was a great program. I would go out in the community. First of all, I contacted an elderly woman I knew and I said, &#8220;Hazel, I&#8217;ve got a new job. I&#8217;ve got to find pregnant women to work with.&#8221; &#8220;No problem. I&#8217;ll meet you tomorrow.&#8221; So old Hazel drives me around, she&#8217;d take me to a house, she&#8217;d say, &#8220;This here is Marian. She&#8217;s a really good lady. Listen to whatever she has to say.&#8221; And then she&#8217;d leave me. So I got talking to the women and I&#8217;d tell them about the program, say, &#8220;It's entirely voluntary, you know. if you want me to come back, I&#8217;ll come back.&#8221; So I began home-visiting these pregnant women, first of all making sure that they were seeing doctors. Which many of them weren&#8217;t, because they didn&#8217;t have the means to do it. So helping them get a medical card or get to a doctor that would see them, even if they didn&#8217;t have the money. So I guess in some ways, then and now isn&#8217;t so different. Because we still got so many people uninsured, uncovered by medical insurance, and then working with them on health and nutrition issues during pregnancy. Prenatal, fetal development, understanding of that. Preparation for childbirth, classes and stuff. That whole thing. And then as I worked, I found the home situations to be so appalling, like how could anybody live like this? One lady&#8217;s trailer--. I went to visit her and there was a bag on her table, and it was her food. And it was a head of a pig. Yuck. She was going to cook that. Another one lived in a basement. The house wasn&#8217;t built; it was just the basement. And she was pregnant with twins, and water was just coming in all over the place. She had little buckets around and no electricity. So I&#8217;m like, saying to my husband, &#8220;I can&#8217;t--. This is just too hard to handle. We need, let&#8217;s see if we can get her a utility pole, see if we can get somebody to donate electricity and get it hooked up for her.&#8221; And it went on and on and on, all kinds of stuff. Then I said, &#8220;Well heck, I&#8217;m not supposed to be like, social worker of the world. This is not going to work.&#8221; So I called my boss at Vanderbilt and I said, &#8220;I don't know, I&#8217;m having a real hard time with the project, because the needs of these women are so great I just get overwhelmed by them.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s time to move on to Phase Two. Identify other women to work with you, and if you work as a team, then--. So I identified four community women who became--who were natural helpers. They didn&#8217;t have educational backgrounds to prepare them for this. But they had community backgrounds that naturally qualified them to help their friends and neighbors. There were people that had the eye out for other people, women say--. One of the women I remember, she said, like, &#8220;So-and-so came over last week; her husband was beating her up, and she came over here to stay with me.&#8221; That kind of a thing, where you&#8217;re kind of known--&#8220;Yeah, go by her, she&#8217;ll help you.&#8221; So I got the group of us together and they began doing home visits also and then I forget what year--I think maybe &#8217;85, the five of us incorporated an organization called Whitley County Communities for Children to provide an organizational base for maternal and infant health outreach here. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t a project with the Exchange; it grew out of work with the Exchange, but it wasn&#8217;t--. That wasn&#8217;t our organizational base. So we founded Whitley County Communities for Children. That lasted for--let&#8217;s see. &#8217;85 to--. At least fifteen years. And grew into a large organization where we had everything from maternal infant health, adult education. We even had a small farms project and a day care center. We had a half a million dollar a year budget and employed twenty eight women, full and part-time. It was a great program. We had a lot of support from the Save the Children Federation, regionally. And then when the regional director for Save the Children went--. He was going to retire. And I said, &#8220;Oh Charles, how are we ever going to replace you? We&#8217;re not.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Marian, why don&#8217;t you apply for the job?&#8221; Stupidly, I did. And got it. So for I don't know how many years, six years, I worked for Save the Children on the regional level. I officed in Berea. And then in &#8217;89, I had a massive stroke. At a meeting for Save the Children. I was in Connecticut and either--. Like I say, had a massive stroke, which set me back. Serious, serious setback. You know they say, &#8220;a stroke of bad luck," well that's certainly what it was for me. I not only suffered some physical paralysis, but I had some--. I know it affected my mental abilities to a certain extent. I wasn&#8217;t able to do what I had been able to do before. Certainly wasn&#8217;t able to--. In the beginning, I wasn&#8217;t able to drive. So I worked for Save the Children I think one more year. Well, I was on disability for a year. And then I worked for one more year out of my home and then that was it. So [that] kind of put the end to a lot of things. But I have stayed, in terms of Mountain Women's Exchange, I have stayed involved with Marie Cirillo and at the Clearfork Community Institute, whose mission is to provide community development education in the local community, we have an all-women&#8217;s board. So I keep very involved there. And I have worked with--. I worked with public housing for three or four years, and now four years, it's my fifth year with adult education. And I&#8217;m going to retire in May. I figure, I started when I was twenty-three. I&#8217;m sixty-three and that&#8217;s forty years. That&#8217;s enough time. I&#8217;m not going to just fold over though, and sit in a rocking chair. My husband and I belong to an organization called the Williamsburg Action Team. And we own the historic Lane Theater here in town. And my job is to raise the money to see if we can get the theater restored and opened up as a community arts and cultural center. It&#8217;s a very exciting project. The problem is we need about three million dollars, so--. JW: [Laughter] That&#8217;s all? MC: That&#8217;s all, yeah. I&#8217;m trying to figure out how we can do it for less. We&#8217;ve done little bits and pieces of restoration and in fact, when we&#8217;re finished here I&#8217;m going to get back on the horn to the people at the Kentucky Heritage Council. Talk to Mark Denman about some funding possibilities. I mean, we&#8217;re not going to get through three million dollars, but we&#8217;re going to try to figure out how we can do it cheaper, where we can get money. Anyway, so that&#8217;s my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it. [Laughter] JW: So the--it was called the Whitley County Children--? MC: Whitley County Community for Children. [phone rings] Oh boy, I&#8217;m beeping. JW: Oh, you need to get that. MC: [phone continues ringing] This always happens; I can&#8217;t find the darn thing. [recorder shuts off and then back on] MC: Look, the senior citizens are gathering for lunch over there. It&#8217;s the senior citizens&#8217; center. JW: Oh, I wondered what that was. MC: Mmm-hmm. JW: So I was about to ask you a question about the Communities for Children. You said it lasted fifteen years? MC: Mmm-hmm. JW: What led to its closing? MC: I made this mistake of going to save the children, thinking I could be supportive of Whitley County Communities for Children from that level. But the person they hired to replace me--. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say this, you know, liability. But I do think she was dishonest. And misused some--. See, we had a grant. Before I left, I got a planning grant of twenty thousand dollars to plan for a Early Head Start program. And if we had gotten the Early Head Start program, as I had written the proposal to do so, it would&#8217;ve been enough money, around a half a million dollars, we could&#8217;ve funded the whole organization for the next, say, three years. But she misused that first twenty thousand dollars. And other staff members would call me and say, &#8220;Marian, she&#8217;s got a credit card for WCCC and she&#8217;s blowing a lot of money on lunches and stuff like that.&#8221; Anyway, we wound up--. The feds asked, or told her that she either give back the grant or they were just going to pull it. Not the planning part, that was already wasted, but the actual grants. So basically, WCCC went belly-up because of her, and she bankrupted it. They didn&#8217;t have money to pay the bills, and--. Eventually, I think they did get another director who--. Nobody else could pull it out. It was too far gone. So anyway, that&#8217;s what happened. Sadly. Because it could've been ongoing, and I kind of regret going to Berea. I mean, even though that was a good experience, after the stroke it was impossible for me to continue that work. Maybe, had I stayed home, but you can&#8217;t say what if, what if. Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have had the stroke. But anyway, it went bankrupt is what happened to it. And the buildings were sold. JW: Did you see your work with the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange and then with the WCCC--. Did you see that as part of women&#8217;s rights movement? Or as a part of the--? MC: No, I don&#8217;t really. Not women's rights in the sense of a radical women&#8217;s rights. I think low-income women maybe all across the country, but in this part of the country for sure didn&#8217;t see themselves, and still don&#8217;t see themselves, as part of a women&#8217;s movement. They see themselves as engaged in community development and maybe making some progress individually, you know, for themselves. Like making advancements for themselves personally. Getting freed of, getting out of abusive situations, et cetera. But not as part of some big movement. The only movement we&#8217;ve stayed connected to was the National Congress of Neighborhood Women. And that&#8217;s something that maybe you could talk to Marie Cirillo about if you&#8217;re curious about what NCNW does. [phone ringing again] Oh dear. This is hopeless. [recorder shuts off and then back on] JW: Okay. So you were talking about--. MC: Not being connected to the--. JW: Right. MC: There was a group in the region called In Praise of Mountain Women. Have you talked to anybody from In Praise, or--? JW: I&#8217;ve read about it, but I haven&#8217;t talked to anyone yet. MC: Well (49:11) and again, Marie Cirillo, would be--. I keep throwing you back to Marie, but. In Praise of Mountain Women are probably your most, what do you call it, women&#8217;s rights-aware people that you would have in the region. JW: So did that ever come up in Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange? Ideas of gender consciousness, or women&#8217;s issues? MC: Oh yeah. Mmm-hmm. JW: How so? MC: Just--. I think a feeling of pride in what we were able to accomplish. Especially when the school came in, you know, that local women were going ahead and getting their college, and were making advancements like that. Also with the Homemakers. What the women were able to accomplish there in kind of a man&#8217;s world. You know who&#8217;d be a lot better than me on this, is Barb Greene. JW: Oh, I&#8217;ve been in touch with her. But we haven&#8217;t been able to talk yet. MC: Oh yeah, she said she&#8217;s on a retreat or something. JW: Yeah. MC: Yeah. Barb&#8217;s a good friend of mine, and I got her involved in Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange when we were doing some work about--. In the strip mining thing, there was a proposal to build housing on strip-mined--you know, the benches, and we didn&#8217;t think that was a good idea. So I got Barb involved to see if she could do some organizing, learn more about it, and do some organizing in the community against building housing on strip bench sites. Because that kind of like today, they look at mountaintop removal as, &#8220;It&#8217;s great because it&#8217;s creating all this flat land so that you can have elk run, and you know. Make golf courses and stuff like that.&#8221; It justifies the crime of tearing apart the mountain. So this was another way of justifying the crime of tearing apart the mountain by saying &#8220;Well, now we&#8217;ve got good spaces to put homes.&#8221; So I talked to Barb about that, and then she became involved and became director after I left. But I&#8217;d say she&#8217;d be much better to talk to than me about the women&#8217;s rights issues. JW: Well, what about in a personal sense? Do you consider yourself a feminist? MC: In a personal sense, yes I do. But again, not a--. I guess back then, they would say &#8220;not a bra-burning feminist.&#8221; I mean I&#8217;m not going to go marching and marching. I&#8217;m going to keep doing what I can to help women develop more secure and fulfilling lives in their community, and get them involved in community activities, but I don't see us marching around the courthouse or--. JW: So what kind of feminist would you say you are? MC: A practical one. [Laughter] One in actual doing of things, rather than spouting off about things. JW: What have been the biggest challenges you&#8217;ve faced in your work in this community? MC: The narrow-mindedness of local politicians, again, who are mostly men, who deal within their little circle of influence and are not open to, you know, more democratic input from the community. They go ahead and do what they want to do and spend money as they like to spend it. Irregardless of what the community might want. [pause] So I have not been really very favorably looked upon, in terms of local politicians. In fact, the former mayor got in a lot of trouble, was charged with embezzlement and all kinds of stuff. He--. If he saw me come into City Hall, he&#8217;d go out the back door and out. Yeah, he really--. And at the last city council meeting I attended where he was presiding, he made the statement which shocked our local reporter, by saying that as long as he had anything to say about it, that I would--me, and we, our organization--would not get one dime to support the Lane Theater Project, as long as he had anything to say about it. And then I think he influenced the current mayor, although our current mayor is, again, I don't know how far this--. JW: Oh, it&#8217;s--. MC: He&#8217;s not going to hear this. As far as the current mayor goes, he&#8217;s a very, you know [pause] good ol&#8217; boy, friendly guy. You know, very jolly and to your face real happy-go-lucky and whatever, but he&#8217;d stab you in the back. You know. so anyway, I&#8217;d say our local politicians have been our biggest obstacle. Saying that, and then on that--. I intend to, also this morning, go over to the courthouse and talk to our county judge executive. I don't give up on him. I keep trying to push him a little bit and a little bit. JW: Mmm-hmm. So why do you think they lose sight of things that could be good for the community? What's in it for them to ignore these projects? MC: They think that, in a way, they do things that they think are good for the community, not that&#8217;s not good for the community, but. It&#8217;s just that they don&#8217;t consult. For instance, our city borrowed eight million dollars and built a water park outside of Williamsburg here. Which, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a bad thing, all I&#8217;m saying is it sucked up the greater part of our tourism dollars for twenty-five years, paying off that debt. When I wonder if the mayor had asked the people, if we want to do something for recreation in the community, you know, what do you want? I doubt they would&#8217;ve said an eight million dollar--. With eight million dollars, we could&#8217;ve put a lot of wonderful things together. But nobody&#8217;s ever consulted about what would be a good, you know, a good thing to do. We get this idea, it&#8217;s good, we're going to do it--boom, it&#8217;s done. JW: Well, what have been the proudest moments in your work? MC: Good questions. I think at Whitley County Communities for Children, I was extremely proud of the whole program, I&#8217;m trying to think of an occasion. We had our tenth anniversary celebration out at the Civic Center, and I was very proud of the staff and the families involved. We had about five hundred families involved. We had a great celebration there of what we had accomplished in ten years. JW: Can you say a little bit about what you had accomplished? MC: Getting a lot of women to reconnect with other women and--. I don&#8217;t want to say get out of their homes, but a lot of women just had no contact with other women outside of their family. So we got people together, and they got involved in programs for their children. We had a small farms program, so a small farms program, adult education, they got involved in the community and many of them have stayed involved. In fact, the lady who's our office manager right now at adult ed[ucation] began at Whitley County Communities for Children as a daycare worker. And one day I asked her, &#8220;Would you be willing to try teaching adults?&#8221; and she said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got no training but I&#8217;ll try.&#8221; So I got her started at that, and it&#8217;s been like fifteen years later. She&#8217;s done a great service to a great many people. I&#8217;ll meet people--I don&#8217;t want to say daily, but maybe weekly, or every other week, we&#8217;ll be--&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; or &#8220;You helped me in this or that way.&#8221; And I&#8217;ll meet, like I met the mother of one of the girls I work with in maternal and infant health last week at the dollar store, and to find out that her daughter is doing fantastic and that the grandkids that were born in the program are now graduating from high school, looking to go toward college. It&#8217;s a great feeling to see that there&#8217;s some positive outcomes. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s negative ones, too. Not everybody made a great success. Not all those kids turned out fantastic, but some of them did, which is great. JW: How has this community changed over the years? MC: Well, it's a little more--I don&#8217;t want to say affluent, because it&#8217;s not, but the way the housing and the roads definitely have improved. Some of the roads were almost impassible when I first moved down here thirty years ago. But the roads have improved, housing has improved. It&#8217;s hard to say that--. I think education, a greater number of people have understood that if they wanted to get halfway decent jobs, they had to go further than a high school education if they wanted to do so. So you see more and more, not just young people, but older people realizing that they have to go back to college. Which I guess people could argue with that, but to me, education is definitely a way out of poverty. I think college can be the most, or education can be the single most way of creating change in a person&#8217;s life. Change-producing. I&#8217;m stumbling around here, but. JW: No, it's great. MC: It is. Not just specific training for a job like being a nurse, although that is, and that changes your life greatly. But just mind-opening connections and classes that you would have in a college situation that would create, open your eyes to different things that are possible. JW: How has living in the South shaped your understanding of social justice issues? MC: You&#8217;re talking to a blue person in a red state. JW: [Laughter] MC: It&#8217;s been--. It&#8217;s difficult. Well, I don't know if you call this the South, but being here in southeastern Kentucky, social justice issues regarding the environment. And my awareness has continued to expand because that&#8217;s an area you do find people involved and engaged in. Racial justice, we really--. I mean, not a huge issue. I can see the whole immigration thing becoming a major issue. In fact, I was listening to some old guys this morning at McDonald&#8217;s when I got my coffee, talking about how we really need to repeal the Fourteenth Amendment. We shouldn't allow these people to come here and have babies, and then their kids are automatically U.S. citizens. That&#8217;s been proposed by a couple of senators, I don't know. I doubt they&#8217;re going to go through the whole process of repealing an amendment, because that&#8217;s a major, long thing. But just the opposition. And then I wonder about people in the community who are of Mexican or Hispanic descent, which we have a number of them and maybe more. This isn&#8217;t a big agricultural community so we don&#8217;t have farm workers, but. You have a few people of Latino descent that it should be interesting what the community does, and the response. Like there&#8217;s already in small kinds of ways, resentments, evidence toward the number of Indian and Pakistani people who run the hotels and gas stations. In fact, there was a sign by one of our gas stations in town, let me see how they put it: &#8220;American owned and operated.&#8221; That inspired me to write a letter to the editor saying, you know, who&#8217;s to say that the Pakistani or the Indian guy who owns the gas station across the way is not an American? Pointing out that that&#8217;s a very prejudiced thing to say. And I for one am not going to be shopping over there. I don&#8217;t remember what I said, but anyway. Just little stuff like that. JW: Well is there anything else that you would like to add? Or any topic that we didn&#8217;t cover that you would like to talk about? MC: I know I said this three or four times, but to get a full picture you need--. I mean not about WCCC or maternal child health, but about Mountain Women's Exchange and In Praise of Mountain Women. Barb Greene and Marie Cirillo are your key people there. JW: Okay. MC: Marie kind of set me on the path to what I did here in the community because I--. Spending that evening with her and learning about rural American women. So I&#8217;m always grateful to her. I don't know, did you get what you wanted--. Because I was going to say--. JW: Mmm-hmm. That was great. Thank you. MC: Pretty much ran the gamut there. [Laughter]..
