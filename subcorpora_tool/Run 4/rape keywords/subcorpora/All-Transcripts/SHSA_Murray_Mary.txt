 Jane Klickman: [0:00] This is Jane Klickman interviewing Dr. Mary Murray-Griffin-Jones for the Stanford Historical Society on May 19, 2010. Klickman: [0:23] Please tell me how your name came about. Griffin-Jones: [0:29] Well, I was born Mary Lindley Murray. When I was in medical school, I married a fellow student whose name was Martin Griffin, and so I became Mary Murray-Griffin. Now, I have another husband whose name is Jones, so I am Mary Murray-Griffin-Jones. [laughs] Klickman: [1:04] Very good. I see now why you have so many names. [1:13] What was your major, and where did you live on campus when you were at Stanford? Griffin-Jones: [1:19] Well, I lived first at Roble, which was where all the girls went as freshmen. And then, I took the rest of the time at Lagunita, which was a dormitory for women--a big clutch of dormitories, really. [laughter] Klickman: [1:53] What were you studying as an undergraduate? Griffin-Jones: [1:57] I was studying biology mostly, and other sciences. Klickman: [2:12] And those led to your decision to go to medical school? 10 Griffin-Jones: [2:15] I made the decision long before that. I made the decision to be a doctor when I was about 10 years old. [laughs] Klickman: [2:27] Can you tell us about that. Griffin-Jones: [2:35] I had a mentor, really. Dr. Esther Clark was a doctor at the Palo Alto Medical Center, the only woman at the medical center. She was a wonderful inspiration to me because I never knew that women could be doctors before that. Klickman: [3:14] That is a revelation. Griffin-Jones: [3:17] Yes. Dr. Clark, I'm sure she's no longer living, was a wonderful, wonderful pediatrician. Klickman: [3:31] You lived in Palo Alto as a child? Griffin-Jones: [3:39] Partly. I was living in Massachusetts until my father died. He died very young, leaving my mom with three children. I was the eldest, and I was only six, but we had an enormous list of protectors. We had grandparents on both sides that were extremely helpful. The grandparents on one side had quite a lot of money, too, so that helped a lot. [4:33] My father had been a teacher at Phillips Andover [Academy], Massachusetts, so we lived in Andover. After several years there as a widow, my mother said she was tired of shoveling snow. She thought it would be better if we went to California where our other grandparents were. And that's exactly what happened. Klickman: [5:11] I see. Were those grandparents the part of your family that had connections with Stanford? Griffin-Jones: [5:20] Very much so. My grandfather had been a professor hired by David Starr Jordan, I think, to come to Stanford for the second year of the university. He taught Latin and Greek. It was called classics. He was the 11 classics professor, and he lived in Palo Alto with his family, who were all my cousins. We had a very good relationship with this wonderful man. Klickman: [6:21] Was it his association with Stanford that led you to attend school here? Griffin-Jones: [6:27] Of course. Yes, his association, and my father and my uncles and aunts all went to Stanford. We were a real Stanford family. So there was no question but that I would go to Palo Alto and come to Stanford. Klickman: [6:51] I see. Can you talk a bit about what the student body was like when you were here? Griffin-Jones: [7:08] I graduated from high school in 1939, so it was in the 40s. In the student body, there were more men than women. There still were by the time I got to medical school later. It was a lot simpler. It was a simpler life because...well, obviously, we did have sororities, but we didn't have as much of the academic stuff in science. There were no shuttles to Mars or shuttles to a space station or that kind of thing, and Stanford was a much smaller school. Klickman: [8:50] I see. Griffin-Jones: [8:54] But it was a wonderful school, very compatible for me. Klickman: [9:02] Were there many people from other countries or other states? Griffin-Jones: [9:08] Hardly any. There were no black people ever at that time. There were a few Japanese maybe or Chinese but that is about it. It was a very different time before the war. Klickman: [9:36] I suppose, when the war started, there were a lot of changes that the war brought about in the student population. Griffin-Jones: [9:45] I was into medical school by then and they did speed us all up in medical school. We had no vacations. We went right through fall, winter, spring and summer.... 12 Klickman: [10:14] Summer school, too? Griffin-Jones: [10:16] Summer school, too, with very short intervals between quarters. I don't know if Stanford is still on the quarter system. Are they? Klickman: [10:30] Yes. Griffin-Jones: [10:31] Well, between quarters we had an occasional week or weekend, but otherwise, it was pretty much just all the time. Klickman: [10:47] Was this a special situation? Griffin-Jones: [10:50] Oh, yes, because of the war. They were trying to get these doctors going so that they could be out healing the wounded, I guess, is about the way I'd put it. Klickman: [11:08] So, it was particularly medical students who were put on this so-called fast track? Griffin-Jones: [11:15] That's right. Klickman: [11:19] Did you find it stressful? Griffin-Jones: [11:22] Well, yes, but I managed to push through. As I say, I had a lot of good help at home and I had a lot of good friends in Palo Alto. Klickman: [11:37] Did that include friends on campus? Griffin-Jones: [11:40] Yes, of course. Klickman: [11:42] Could you talk about some of them, like an unusual character? Griffin-Jones: [11:52] I can talk about the teachers better than I can the students. Klickman: [11:56] Ok. Griffin-Jones: [12:00] A lot of teachers were real characters. [laughs] 13 One doctor was Arthur Bloomfield who was my professor of internal medicine at Stanford. By now....let me backtrack a little, if I may. Klickman: [12:29] Go ahead. Griffin-Jones: [12:34] We stayed in Palo Alto for five quarters, and then the whole class moved to San Francisco. So we were up there in the city. Klickman: [12:48] I see. Griffin-Jones: [12:49] We had to find boarding houses and apartments to stay in there. Klickman: [13:10] I see. Griffin-Jones: [13:15] The old brick building is gone now. I do have a brick which I keep as a doorstop. Klickman: [13:25] Really? [laughs] Griffin-Jones: [laughs] [13:27] I have one brick. Klickman: [13:29] That's a great memento. Griffin-Jones: [13:33] That was from Lane Hospital. Klickman: [13:35] Wonderful. Griffin-Jones: [13:37] And so this Dr. Bloomfield was a little bit scary, [laughs] but he was good. He had one thing he said. I did marry a fellow student while I was in medical school. My husband asked Dr. Bloomfield if we could take a vacation. I think it was after the war was over, I don't remember. Dr. Bloomfield said, "When I was at Hopkins, we lived like monks for nine years." Klickman: [14:50] So, what happened? Griffin-Jones: [14:55] He let us go, finally. [laughs] We were good friends with his daughter. [laughter] 14 Klickman: [15:04] Well, I'm glad for that. [laughter] Griffin-Jones: [15:08] Ok, that's one anecdote. [laughs] Klickman: [15:13] Any others that you have in mind? Griffin-Jones: [15:19] Well, I've been trying to go through them. The Stanford and Cal student bodies were both in the hospitals at the same time. Klickman: [15:33] I see. Griffin-Jones: [15:35] There was what they called the service; there was the Stanford service and the California service. They took turns being on emergency and doing whatever. So some of these doctors I really didn't know very well, but one that was dearly beloved at Cal was Dr. Barnett, Dr. George Barnett. I think that was it. And he was well known to everybody at San Francisco General Hospital, which is the place where we all gathered together. [16:37] I do have one thing I want to say about the first day that I was in the medical ward at San Francisco General. Klickman: [16:54] I'd like to hear it. Griffin-Jones: [16:57] There was a young girl who had been brought in overnight. We all had little boxes with our blood tubes and things in them, and we carried them around like real doctors. [laughs] Klickman: [17:20] Good practice. Griffin-Jones: [17:21] This was good practice, but they weren't quite as big as what the doctor usually carries. [17:33] This girl had been brought in overnight, and she was diagnosed as having sub-acute bacterial endocarditis, which is--and I don't know if it still is--it was a fatal disease. While I was trying to get a history from her, she 15 rolled over and rolled her eyes and said, "I die," and she did. My first patient died in front of me in the room. Klickman: [18:18] What a shock. Griffin-Jones: [18:20] So that was difficult. Klickman: [18:21] Yes. Griffin-Jones: [18:24] Of course, the nurses brought the curtains around right away, but there wasn't anything anybody could do. She died. That is a very significant memory. Yes. Klickman: [18:48] What about the other students that were doctors? Do some of them stand out in your memory? Griffin-Jones: [19:02] One of them was my friend, Lloyd âBudâ Smith. He was my lab partner, and he invited me, actually, to be his lab partner for dissections. I don't know if I can describe the anatomy ward where we did the dissections. It was a very long building, and it was right behind where the museum is now. I'm sure it's gone now, but a lot of our classes were held there. [20:08] One room was filled with cots with dead bodies on them, and that is where we did our dissections. So, that was very handy that Bud invited me to be his lab partner so I didn't have to go and find another woman. We became close friends. [20:47] And then, there was Emerson Hiler, who was the tallest and biggest guy in the class. He was a discus thrower. He made a lot of that fact. [laughter] [21:15] He was sort of a braggadocio kind of guy, quite good looking. At one point, somebody played a terrible trick on him. He would ride his bicycle down behind the anatomy buildings when he was coming back from lunch or something. And somebody took a rope or some kind of thing [laughs], some thing that was fairly tough, and put it across his pathway. And so when he 16 came around this corner--and everybody was waiting to see what happened-he hit this thing and, of course, he went up in the air. Then he grabbed the rope and threw it off. We all laughed, but it wasn't really very funny. [laughs] Klickman: [22:30] I think students tend to play pranks. Griffin-Jones: [22:34] That's right, it was a prank. [22:39] And then our friend Fred Gilbert did a lot of things with my husband, Marty Griffin. He later moved to Hawaii. He was a wonderful man, Fred Gilbert. [23:06] The professors were various. [laughs] I'm thinking of one whose name I'm having trouble remembering, Victor Richards. He was, I think, a general orthopedist. Griffin-Jones: [23:37] He was teaching bones and joints. [laughs] And he had been a person who had been a âwhiz kid.â [Brief Intermission] Griffin-Jones: [24:02] There was a doctor who took children that were supposed to be brilliant and raised and studied them. And Dr. Victor Richards was one of those children. [24:26] He was an excellent, excellent teacher, so not a lot of fun, but excellent. Klickman: [24:36] Sometimes you have to have a trade-off. Griffin-Jones: [24:38] Yes. Klickman: [24:41] Were there many other women in your class? Griffin-Jones: [24:50] In my medical class there were only two other women, and actually, one of them had been held back for some reason, and she joined us later. So 17 when we started, we were only two, and apparently two was the limit at that time, two women in a class of 62. Klickman: [25:24] Oh, my goodness. It was a regulation at Stanford Medical School? Griffin-Jones: [25:29] Yes, I believe so. But three women graduated in my class. Klickman: [25:35] Did you find that being a minority of women was particularly difficult? Griffin-Jones: [25:43] No, I didn't. I always considered it to be a privilege. Klickman: [25:49] I see. Griffin-Jones: [25:51] The guys were, in general, pretty good. When we started our first classes, it was before the war. After Pearl Harbor, they got into uniform and became Army and Navy and so forth. A few others besides us women didn't enlist, but mostly there was a big division at that time. Klickman: [26:41] A division of soldiers versus students? Griffin-Jones: [26:44] Well, the soldiers wore their uniforms, but they still wore their white coats most of the time. [laughs] I have pictures of the whole class standing on the steps at Lane Hospital, and everybody's in white coat, except there are some people over on one side in brown uniforms. [27:15] They were privates in the Army. [laughs] Klickman: [27:17] I see. [laughter] Griffin-Jones: [27:20] I have a story about Pearl Harbor. I used to sing in the choir at Memorial Church. My roommate didn't have any interest in going to church, so she stayed home back in our room. When I came back from choir one Sunday, the first thing she said was, "The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor." 18 [28:24] We had had little Japanese women as our housekeepers in the dormitory for many months. It was very sad, very sad. They got to crying, and it was terrible. But that was the beginning of the war. Then the medical students were all brought together to discuss how we would progress. Some of the fellows dropped out and joined the Army and Navy without continuing medical school. But most of them stayed. Klickman: [29:25] With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, did you experience any of the Japanese being taken to any of the internment camps? Griffin-Jones: [29:36] Didn't experience it until later. Klickman: [29:39] I see. Griffin-Jones: [29:40] And later....well, I'm going back again. My parents were Quakers. And my grandfather, the one who started at Stanford, was a Quaker minister. They're not really ministers. They're called spiritual advisors. But he was one of those. When Herbert Hoover went to Washington to be President, my grandfather was his spiritual advisor in Washington. Klickman: [30:35] Oh, my. Griffin-Jones: [30:37] The Hoovers came from Palo Alto and were very much friends with our family. They call it the Society of Friends. [31:04] Somehow through the Friendsâ Service Committee, we had a couple of Japanese boys who stayed with my family in Palo Alto during the war. By then I was at Stanford. I think my brother is still in touch with one of them. Klickman: [31:39] That is a good experience; very unusual. Griffin-Jones: [31:43] It was. Klickman: [31:53] You had mentioned that you were a member of the choir at Stanford. I'm sure that was very enjoyable. Did you belong to any other clubs or associations? 19 Griffin-Jones: [32:07] Not really, because I was so busy getting through med school. Klickman: [32:15] Right. That is a big job. [laughter] Griffin-Jones: [32:20] Yes, but the choir leads me to tell you about the Spring Sing. Have I told you about that? Klickman: [32:32] No, you haven't. Please do. Griffin-Jones: [32:34] The Spring Sing was something they had every spring at Stanford. The medical students would wear their white coats, stand in a great, long line of several deep and sing. I mean, they're not the only ones who sang, but they would always win the prize. Klickman: [laughs] [33:17] Is that right? Griffin-Jones: [33:19] And they gave me a chance to sing tenor. [laughs] [laughter] Klickman: [33:28] You must have had a deep voice! Griffin-Jones: [33:29] It was all male, except for me. Klickman: [33:32] Oh, I see. Griffin-Jones: [33:45] I sang tenor, and we sang the Stanford hymn, and we sang "Aura Lee," which is an old-fashioned song. I can' t remember what else we sang, but we had more in the repertory. It was all a cappella, so it was fun. Klickman: [34:07] Talented medical students, then. [34:25] Could you tell us some general lessons that you learned because you came to Stanford? Griffin-Jones: [34:35] I know one for sure, and I've been meaning to get this onto the interview. When I first came to Stanford as a freshman, we had a class called 20 the History of Western Civilization. It was absolutely the most wonderful class I have ever had. We had it all year long, I don't remember how many days a week, maybe only one day a week. But it was the best class, a mass class. The whole freshman body was there. History of Western Civ. was the best thing that happened to me as a freshman. Klickman: [35:39] Could you say why? Griffin-Jones: [35:43] Because I learned so much. I had been quite a little prissy person who didn't know much about the world around. I can't put it into words what exactly it was, but it was history of western civilization. I think there must have been a little bit of Arabic and some of those other things in there. Klickman: [36:28] Would it be like a world view? Griffin-Jones: [36:34] Oh, sure, yes, but many of the things that you thought of as stories turned out to be true. Klickman: [37:07] Let's talk about current day. When you come back to Stanford--I know you visit frequently for the Founding Grant Society's meeting and so forth--what do you enjoy most about coming back to Stanford? Griffin-Jones: [37:28] That's so hard to say because it is so beautiful. It is a beautiful, beautiful campus, except when it's all dug up. [laughter] Griffin-Jones: [37:47] But the oak trees, the foothills, the kids on bikes and just the general ambience. It's fun to be here. Klickman: [38:12] Would you say, with all the new buildings, that Stanford has grown and changed a lot since you were going to school here? Griffin-Jones: [38:20] Oh, my gosh! Has it ever! [laughter] 21 Griffin-Jones: [38:27] I don't really know much about the changes, except for some of the sculptures, the Rodin collection, and things. I have been in the museum more than once. Klickman: [38:52] It's beautiful. Griffin-Jones: [38:53] I'm very interested in art. My cousin Lorraine Murray Thackeray, who is my Uncle Feg's [Feg Murray] daughter, another Murray, lived in Palo Alto for quite a while. She lived up at the Sequoias, I think it's called, as an elder. She was 88, my age exactly when she died. We had the best party at her memorial. Klickman: [39:50] Really? Griffin-Jones: [39:51] It was all done at the museum, the Cantor Center. It was orchestrated by Lorraine [Lorraine Murray Thackeray] I'm certain. [sentences deleted] Many of her watercolors were being given away. They have a nice auditorium there. I think the Cantor Center's great. Klickman: [40:26] That has changed a lot over the years, hasn't it? Griffin-Jones: [40:29] Really? Has it? [laughs] Klickman: [40:32] I think the earthquake may have had some effect on it. But the collection is probably the same. Griffin-Jones: [40:39] That may be. Klickman: [40:46] Could you say something about how you continue to stay connected to Stanford? Particularly, I am thinking of the Founding Grant Society that you're a member of. Griffin-Jones: [40:57] Well, the Founding Grant Society is one way, but it's getting harder for me, with very little vision, to get here. So I have to rely on somebody to bring me. I live across the Golden Gate Bridge. [laughs] And it's hard to get here, so that's difficult. 22 [41:42] Of course, the "Stanford Magazine" comes, but I can't read it, so somebody has to read it to me. So those kinds of connections are sort of difficult and now that some of the family is gone--Lorraine's gone. There's still some of the family aroundâ¦there's my daughter Linda [Linda Griffin]. I almost forgot Linda. Klickman: [42:18] Linda graduated from Stanford. Griffin-Jones: [42:20] Yes, Linda graduated from Stanford. Klickman: [42:24] What about your brother Doug? Griffin-Jones: [42:26] Oh, my brother Doug. I almost forgot about him. He is an orthopedic surgeon in Fort Collins, Colorado, now retired. He graduated from Stanford and was a very good student in orthopedics. With other people, he founded a very prestigious center for orthopedics in Fort Collins. [43:04] He has enormous numbers of children who are all now growing up. There are relatives and sub-relatives, boyfriends and girlfriends, and every summer they have a big reunion. There are 30 or 40 people there. Klickman: [43:50] Shall we talk about some of these photos that you brought? 23 President Donald Tresidder escorting Mary Murray to the altar at Stanford Chapel on her wedding to Dr. L. Martin Griffin Griffin-Jones: [43:53] Ok. This is me, getting married to Marty [image 1]. This is, you can tell, at the Stanford Memorial Church. This is Don Tresidder, who is my 24 godfather. He gave me away because my father had died. But he and my father were best friends when they were both at Stanford. Klickman: [44:48] Is this when he was president [of the university]? Griffin-Jones: [44:51] Yes. And it's so sad that he didn't get to be president very long. He wasn't cut out for doing business. He thought he would be dealing with young people when he took the job. He got into a mess of having to deal with money. [laughs] Klickman: [45:20] The bureaucracy. Griffin-Jones: [45:21] Yes. And then, it made him sick, and he died. Klickman: [45:30] Oh, dear. Griffin-Jones: [45:35] Our wedding was December--no, I'm sorry, January. Klickman: [45:39] January 2nd, 1944. Griffin-Jones: [45:43] Yes. That's me. [laughs] Klickman: [45:46] It's beautiful. I see the resemblance. [laughter] 25 President Donald Tresidder escorting Mary Murray, Jan. 2, 1944 Griffin-Jones: [45:51] I think that that was a good picture, because it has Dr. Tresidder looking at me [image 2]. There's only one other picture. 26 [46:16] This is Augustus Taber Murray, A.T. Murray, my grandfather, who is the one whom I started talking about, the Quaker family, who...I just thought of something. Augustus Taber Murray, Stanford Professor Emeritus of Classics and grandfather of Mary Lindley Murray Klickman: [46:43] Fine. Griffin-Jones: [46:44] My grandfather was spiritual advisor to Herbert Hoover. When the Murrays were in Washington, when Hoover was President, they lived in an 27 apartment. At Easter time, my sister and I were allowed to go down to Washington to be with them. It was really wonderful to hear them calling, "Has thee got any butter?" [laughter] Griffin-Jones: [47:49] Down the dumbwaiter. [laughter] Klickman: [whispers] [48:00] That's funny. Griffin-Jones: [48:02] They talked what we called "thee and thou language" to each other, but not in general. Klickman: [48:11] That's a good story. Thank you. Were there many Quakers on campus at Stanford? And did you join them? Griffin-Jones: [48:22] Actually, there was another important Quaker, and it was the Stanford chaplain. His name was Elton Trueblood. [sentence deleted] Griffin-Jones: [49:23] He was Dean of Religion or something.2 Anyway, my husband Marty and I were married by Dr. Trueblood in a Quaker vow. Klickman: [49:44] Oh, I see. How interesting. Griffin-Jones: [49:45] So, that's very much a part of the family thing. [49:53] How much more time do we have? [laughs] Klickman: [49:56] We have all the time you want. Griffin-Jones: [49:59] I was just thinking about the origin of the Mary Lindley Murray event. Mary Lindley Murray was my maiden name. My family named me that because I was descended from this woman. She was a patriot and a Quaker during the American Revolution. [50:39] At one time, the British were Dr. Elton Trueblood served as chaplain at Stanford from 1936 to 1946. (Harvey, Van. Religious Studies at Stanford: An Historical Sketch. Sandstone & Tile, Vol. 22, No. 2/3, spring/summer 1998.) 2 28 landing on Manhattan Island and were about to conquer it. And my...what do I call her? [laughs] Klickman: [51:02] Predecessor. Griffin-Jones: [51:02] Grandma, my ancestor. Klickman: [51:05] Your great, great, great, great, great grandmother. [laughter] Griffin-Jones: [51:10] She said that she must do something. So she prepared what they called a tea party. [laughs] The books call it a tea party, but we think it was cocktails-[laughter] Griffin-Jones: [51:29] --to delay the progress of the British attack. So, it's called in the history books, "Mary Lindley Murray Delays the British Officers." Klickman: [51:42] I see. Griffin-Jones: [52:25] Anyway, she was a heroine. Klickman: [52:27] Murray Hill in New York City is named for.... Griffin-Jones: [52:31] Murray Hill is named after her, and there's a Mary Lindley Murray School right in Manhattan Island to this day. Klickman: [52:42] That's very significant. You have a very great name. I think you've lived up to it as well. Griffin-Jones: [laughs] [52:48] Thank you. Thank you. Klickman: [52:53] Just one more question. Are you feeling....? Griffin-Jones: [52:56] I'm feeling ok. I'm feeling better [laughs] as time goes by. 29 Klickman: [53:12] Do you have any thoughts or feelings about Stanford's place in the world, about what it meant to be a student here, how it directed your life or your choices? I know it's highly related with your family and that affected your decisions. Griffin-Jones: [53:33] It did. It certainly did. And beyond that, I can't really say. What was the other thing you said, you directed... Klickman: [53:52] If Stanford has had an impact on you, or you find its place in the world is significant. Griffin-Jones: [54:01] Oh, it certainly is. Look at all those engineers. [laughs] Klickman: [54:10] And doctors. Griffin-Jones: [54:12] And they're all in the "Wall Street Journal" every day. So no, Stanford has certainly been exceedingly...Stanford is really in the news daily, just about. I'm sorry I can't read it all. Klickman: [54:39] Yes, that's true. In the medical school, in the research and the strides that they're making. Griffin-Jones: [54:46] Oh very much, Yes. [54:49] I do have a cousin, John Murray, who is Uncle Feg's son, who is a very prominent pulmonary physician at UCSF. He's certainly of the family and I was telling you about Lorraine, his sister. Klickman: [55:24] Lorraine is his sister? I see. Griffin-Jones: [55:26] His sister, yes. So that's another member of the family. Klickman: [55:37] When you were going to school here, were there any famous people that came through? You've mentioned Herbert Hoover. Griffin-Jones: [55:53] Dr. Spock. [laughs] Klickman: [55:55] Really? 30 Griffin-Jones: [laughs] [55:57] I'm not sure that happened when I was there, but being in pediatrics, I thought, had something about Dr. Spock. [56:11] I had someone else in mind. Well...gone. Klickman: [56:28] Was Eleanor Roosevelt here during your time? Griffin-Jones: [56:32] Not that I remember, not that I remember. If she had been, I think I would know about it. I think I would have known about it because she was certainly someone to be admired, really. [56:58] Give me another name. [laughs] Klickman: [57:03] Any professors? I know you've mentioned a few. Any others? Griffin-Jones: [57:09] Well, did I mention Dr. Twitty [Victor Chandler Twitty]? Klickman: [57:13] No, I don't think so. Griffin-Jones: [57:15] He was a friend of ours, but he also was a biology professor, and he had two sets of twins. Klickman: [57:25] Oh, my. Griffin-Jones: [laughs] [57:25] Klickman: [57:26] Very prolific. Griffin-Jones: [57:28] Everyone thought being the biology professor... Klickman: [laughs] [57:30] Griffin-Jones: [57:32] So everyone thought it must be something to do with that. [laughter] Griffin-Jones: [57:41] But, anyway, they were very good friends. And then, the other one who comes to mind because he was also in their family, was Corky's father [Corky is Pauline Kirkpatrick]. 31 [Paul Harmon] Kirkpatrick. He was a physics professor. And it was just in the very beginning of the atomic age, but he was a wonderful teacher of physics. Klickman: [58:20] A lot of new information. Griffin-Jones: [58:22] Yes, oh, Yes. The class was called atomic physics. [laughs] Yes. Klickman: [58:37] Is there any outstanding memory either good or bad that you'd like to put on the record from your time here at Stanford? Griffin-Jones: [58:56] There's so many. I don't know how to pick out one. [laughs] Klickman: [laughs] [59:30] You mentioned the bonfires before the football games. Griffin-Jones: [59:33] Oh, yes, well, I'm not sure they still do that, and probably it's polluting or something now. [59:43] But they used to, where Lake Lagunita is. Is there still a Lake Lagunita? Klickman: [59:49] During the winter when it rains heavily. Griffin-Jones: [59:52] Well, it's the basin where they used to pile up a lot of wood and trash somehow and make a bonfire before the Big Game. Klickman: [60:10] Wow. Griffin-Jones: [60:13] So they had these great, big, huge bonfires. I think I'm in a picture in one of the yearbooks in front of the flames. [laughs] Klickman: [60:49] Well, that's wonderful. I appreciate all of your memories and your time, and sharing your life from the past. Griffin-Jones: [60:59] Oh, well, I'm sorry to be so hesitant about my memories because I can't remember them. [laughs] Klickman: [61:11] I think you did very well. 32 [61:17] Ok. This is Jane Klickman interviewing Dr. Mary Griffin-Jones for the Stanford Historical Society on May 19th, 2010...
