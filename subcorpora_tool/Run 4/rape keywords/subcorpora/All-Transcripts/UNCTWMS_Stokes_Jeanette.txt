 Jeanette Stokes: One of the things that&#8217;s hard for people weren&#8217;t alive then to realize is that abortion was not a hot button issue people like Ronald Regan people who later became famous conservative politicians weren&#8217;t against safe legal abortion. They weren&#8217;t against abortion rights. The Catholic Church and conservative religious groups were but you know my family was fairly conservative they were republicans in Oklahoma but they weren&#8217;t nervous about people having safe legal abortions. My mother had been married to a doctor I don&#8217;t think my step father had a strong opinion about it. It wasn&#8217;t until after Roe v Wade that some smart political strategists figured out that they could make a coalition and make it a big issue and organize Catholics and conservative Protestants. So there was not a campaign that I know of I mean Roe V wade was not even a thing until the decision was actually handed down. Victoria Petermann: That&#8217;s really interesting. JS: I know, when I was working on this memoir I had a visit with some of my friend that had worked in NARAL with me and read some stuff on the internet and we had to kind of piece together this history of it was just not this huge issue until after it was legal and then it was the organized backlash that capitalized on it and that&#8217;s been going for forty years now; this backlash. It&#8217;s been legal in this country and the anti-choice groups have figured out ways to nibble away women&#8217;s right to choose all every possible way in this country. VP: So you went to Smith and then you came to&#8230; JS: I became a feminist while I was in college. I spent a year at Amherst because there were so many single gender institutions that, this is what some of them did before they went co-ed, there were 12 or fifteen colleges in New England that you could just put your name in the hat and go and spend a year at one of the different colleges. A lot of my friends went to Princeton; some of them went to Dartmouth; some of them went to Yale. I went to Amherst for my senior year and in the context of twelve hundred men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two living with them for a year made me a feminist. I was walking across the am quad, it&#8217;s a quaint campus with a quad like duke&#8217;s east campus with big trees on that quad and I was walking across one fall day kicking the leaves with my feet and thinking &#8220;this is so cool I&#8217;m one of twenty-four women living with twelve-hundred men.&#8221; VP: Wow JS: &#8220;It&#8217;s as though we have them all to ourselves.&#8221; And I stopped dead in my tracks and said to myself, &#8220;What are you saying? Who have been your friends, your supporters, who have been the reliable people in your life, all your life?&#8221; And for me it had been my mother, her mother, my best friend Sally, Professors at Smith and I had had boyfriends who came and went and I had had this dad who had sort of gone away, not completely away, but we were not very close at that point. And I thought &#8220;wait a minute&#8221; and I had been in a class where we were studying about some gender issues and I thought, &#8220;This is crazy&#8221; and it was as though I took my head in my hands and turned it in the direction of women and said &#8220;I&#8217;m going to pay attention to women, I&#8217;m going to stop thinking that what men say is more important&#8221; I mean I had been reading literature so I had backup on this, I&#8217;d had three years at a women&#8217;s college, and I just said to myself &#8220;I&#8217;m going to pay attention to women as though they are as important as men&#8221; and so I say it&#8217;s the only conversion experience I&#8217;ve ever had to anything. And I paid a little more attention to women&#8217;s issues in my classes my senior year and then when I moved to North Carolina and entered the Divinity School at Duke I spent three years raising my hand class after class and saying &#8220;what about the women?&#8221; Studying the bible, studying about the history of the church and ethics, same question, it didn&#8217;t matter, &#8220;What about the women?&#8221; END OF EXCERPT: 20:00 START OF EXCERPT: 35:30 V: So how did you get involved with NARAL? JS: So I was living in Greensboro and I had a friend named Mary Margaret Wade, I developed a friendship with a woman named Mary Margaret Wade who was an artist and an actress and who was on the board of NARAL. At that point it was an entirely volunteer based organization so the people who were on the board of directors were the people running the organization; no staff. I remember that I had told her about my dad and she knew that I was a progressive feminist and so she sort of corralled me into going to a board meeting and thinking about being on the board. We were among the younger people on the NARAL board at that point. There was a doctor named Mary Jane Gray I believe is her last name, there was an abortion clinic owner I believe, there were some activists who were connected to planned parenthood but these were people who mostly 20 or 30 years older than I was. V: How old were you then? JS: Oh when I graduated from seminary I was twenty-six, so this was probably, I was twenty-eight or twenty-nine. I was chair of the board from eighty-two to eighty-six so I was twenty-nine or thirty when I first got involved in NARAL. V: Had you been involved in any abortion rights or pro-choice activism beforehand or was this&#8212; JS: No, I had been involved with rape crisis a little bit when I was in Durham. I mean, I had been watching the development of feminist activist organizations; rape crisis, domestic violence. And I certainly knew about Planned Parenthood but I don&#8217;t think I had a familiarity with NARAL until Mary Margaret said &#8220;C&#8217;mon let&#8217;s go.&#8221; So, I did. And it was [pause] shall I go on with this part? V: Oh yeah, yeah. JS: Yeah, it was an interesting moment in time for NARAL nationally and locally because [pause] I&#8217;m not sure I will get the history right, but there was a fight or a disagreement on the national board. And one camp wanted to do electoral politics: design NARAL so that it would train people to be involved in electoral politics to get people elected who would be supportive of the right to choose. I don&#8217;t any longer remember what the other side wanted because they didn&#8217;t win. I don&#8217;t know if they wanted to do a wider array of activities or what it was. But the camp that wanted for to NARAL to turn its attention towards training people in electoral politics, not to as an organization be active in electoral politics, that wasn&#8217;t it, but to do all the stuff that would train their volunteers so that they could go a be involved in campaigns...
