 Coco Wilder: My name is Coco Wilder and I&#8217;m here talking with police chief Carolyn Hutchison on June 5, 2013, and we are in her office at the Carrboro Police Department. Thank you for&#8211; Carolyn Hutchison: Well thank you for being interested in history. CW: &#8211;talking with me. I might take notes that prompt. If there&#8217;s something that you say and I want to get back to it I might jot down a word but otherwise it will all be this. CH: Okay. CW: So I was wondering first off if you could tell me about your childhood. CH: It was great. It was different from other peoples&#8217; childhoods, I suppose, but I didn&#8217;t really realize it at the time. My father was in the Army so we moved every year or two of my life as I was growing up, but of course I lived with kids whose fathers did the same thing so I wasn&#8217;t really aware that that was different from the norm until I was in junior high school and I went to a school off post and learned that there was a divide between &#8220;post toasties&#8221; and &#8220;townies&#8221; and I really started to understand, wow, other people don&#8217;t move like we did. Why I hadn&#8217;t thought that before I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you, but I was probably twelve before it even entered my mind that my childhood was different from others. CW: You said &#8220;host&#8221;&#8211;what was the word you used? CH: When your dad&#8217;s in the Army you live on posts, Army posts. CW: Okay. CH: So they often called us &#8220;post toasties.&#8221; I have a speech disorder, which makes it difficult to say some words, so that&#8217;s why you heard it with an h sound. CW: Okay. Once you interacted with the people off the base, what differences did you start to pick up on that made your childhood unique? CH: Well, I was always the new kid on the block, so I had to learn how to put myself out there and make friends and learn to be accepted by people that maybe really weren&#8217;t that used to meeting new kids. And then I think too it affected the way that I made friends because I knew in a year or two years I&#8217;d be gone and that would be it, so it certainly affected me there. CW: Did you get any sense, being in the Army, the type of family structure that the Army encouraged, or the dynamics between&#8211;? Were your parents married? CH: Oh yes. CW: So was your mother like an Army wife? What was their relationship like? CH: Well, so I was born in 1959, so let&#8217;s say that I really grew up in the &#8217;60s to the mid &#8217;70s, and my mother played the traditional Army wife role in that she supported my father. My father&#8217;s assignments took us to, I want to say a dozen different states and foreign countries, and she went with him and did what wives were supposed to do. They took care of children, they had children, and they supported their husband. They would have dinner parties and that sort of thing, so there were social expectations of the women there. And in terms of the family, families were supposed to be strong, kids were supposed to be good, and I think some of the lessons I learned&#8211;. I knew that because we moved so much that my security was with my family. My security was not with my friends. So that&#8217;s one thing that made my upbringing different from others. If I messed up in my family, that was a huge deal. So we were taught to do the right thing, to always do the right thing, and certainly to never bring shame to the family. CW: Did you see&#8211;? What did you envision growing up, as a teenager or a child, your future family? Did you see yourself following in the footsteps of an Army family? CH: No. [Laughs] CW: No? [Laughs] CH: No, I&#8211;. Well, you know, that was&#8211;. Women were changing, so my generation was learning from the previous generation, and women were being empowered differently. I felt&#8211;. I was engaged at the end of college and I remember my father saying once that he didn&#8217;t really need to worry about me because my husband would take care of me, and when I heard my dad say that I bristled. CW: [Laughs] CH: Really? Because I always thought I&#8217;d have to take care of him. So that was a mindbender. But at that time, you know, I think parents were&#8211;. That is what they thought of their daughters, you know, if they were going to be married they didn&#8217;t need to worry about them. Of course that&#8217;s not the path that I ended up taking, so I think in some way I knew that my path was not going to be traditional, was not going to be my mom&#8217;s or my dad&#8217;s, but that my traditional Army brat upbringing had prepared me very well to be independent. CW: Did you have or recognize in the examples maybe in the military, with leaders or things going on in the country, women who weren&#8217;t taking the traditional path, that were doing alternatives that you saw yourself as possibly doing? How did you think the women&#8217;s movement of your time influenced you and how did you interact with it? CH: I certainly watched the news. I read magazines. I watched my mother&#8217;s sisters, because she has five sisters and they were all younger than her, so all of them were in varying degrees of change and acceptance. There was a bad sheep in the family, my aunt, and I watched my aunt and I thought, hmm. Well I don&#8217;t want to go quite that far, but my path is probably going to look more like hers than the others. I certainly recognized I wasn&#8217;t&#8211;. I didn&#8217;t feel cut out for the extroverted Army social atmosphere and fulfilling those roles, and even in the civilian world I don&#8217;t fill those roles, so that probably says something about my personality. CW: Can you talk a little bit more about your black sheep aunt? Why was she different? CH: Well, she was I guess in her teen years probably in the mid [19]&#8217;60s, and she&#8217;s a very sensitive person, very creative, very gifted, very thoughtful, but her peer group was doing things very differently from others. They were considered hippies, they traveled a lot, they did drugs, they got in trouble with the law, and I don&#8217;t know specific details but I know that my grandparents didn&#8217;t approve of her lifestyle. They didn&#8217;t approve of the choices that she made. She didn&#8217;t approve of their lifestyle and the choices that they had made, so she took a different path, and I think for the family it was very painful. It was painful for everybody because I don&#8217;t think they could really communicate with each other. And my mother, you know, she was probably more allied with her parents as the oldest child. Her sister was I guess the fifth child, so there were lots of years in between them and lots of different experiences, and of course at the time that my aunt was taking the road less traveled my mother was on a very traditional path, supporting an Army man. But in the end people come around to understand that everybody&#8217;s experience has value. You don&#8217;t have to understand their experience, you don&#8217;t even really have to accept it, but there&#8217;s a certain level of tolerance and a certain love that you should not deny people, especially family. CW: [Pause] I&#8217;ve read in other articles that have been written about you some jarring experiences you had early on with male police officers. How do you think that those experiences, like how did they impact you? CH: Well you know as a teenager I didn&#8217;t really think too much about what I would end up doing. I didn&#8217;t know early that I would be a police officer. But I guess in a way I was drawn to some of the TV shows at the time that were related to law enforcement, like people nowadays are drawn to TV shows that are related to law enforcement, so I would watch those. But when I was sixteen, seventeen I lived on Fort Bragg. That&#8217;s in Fayetteville. I looked like a little hippie, I had hair down to my waist, I wore just what I&#8217;m wearing today, jeans and flip-flops and t-shirts. I was walking on the post and I was going to pick up a friend of mine who was visiting, and he had come in on the bus so he had a backpack. I met him at the bus station, which was right on the post, and we were walking back to my house and a military policeman stopped, put his lights on, told us to get in the car, and I looked at him and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not getting in your car,&#8221; and he was like, &#8220;Get in my car.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No. You can talk to my father,&#8221; and I never really tried to use his name, but that day I did. I said, &#8220;He&#8217;s Col. Hutchison. He&#8217;s the commander of the 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division. Come to my house and talk to my dad.&#8221; So we walked away, because we had done nothing wrong. He watched us walk to the house, go in, and then he sped away. That had an impact on me, and I was probably seventeen, and I remember thinking that if police officers want people to trust them then they need to be decent to people in their dealings with them, and professional, and I felt that that guy had not been, so that&#8217;s what I took from the experience. This would have been in &#8217;76, so in years before there were&#8211;. And I&#8217;d seen, as a child, demonstrations involving the Vietnam War and the police response and I&#8217;m certain that had an impact on me although I can&#8217;t really tell you exactly what it was except maybe like, &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t believe people are beating each other, fighting like that, being violent.&#8221; And then the other one that was really pivotal for me was my senior year of high school a Fayetteville city police officer came and spoke to my civics class, or American government or something. He was talking about the work that he did and everything he said, I loved. I thought, &#8220;Boy. That sounds great. That sounds fun, that sounds exciting, and it sounds important.&#8221; So I waited until the very end of the class and I asked him, &#8220;How do you feel about women in law enforcement?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no place for them,&#8221; and I thought, &#8220;Okay. It&#8217;s on now.&#8221;[Laughs] CW: [Laughs] CH: It&#8217;s on, because I couldn&#8217;t believe that. I couldn&#8217;t believe in 1977 that&#8211;and women had been in policing for years&#8211;that this man was standing there saying to a young woman, &#8220;There&#8217;s no place for you in law enforcement.&#8221; But over the years I&#8217;ve turned that around and I see that that experience is a gift to me because he really challenged me to think about what I wanted to do and to think about what I could do. I don&#8217;t know his name. If I did I&#8217;d send him a thank-you card. But I appreciate&#8211;. He was honest and I certainly appreciated his honesty, but I wanted to prove him wrong. CW: Gosh, there&#8217;s a lot&#8211;. I want to talk more [Laughs] about both those examples. Backtracking to Fort Bragg and Vietnam, what were your reactions or what did you think about Vietnam, as a young person but also as the child of a military family? CH: Yeah. You know, I think in retrospect I probably didn&#8217;t think a lot about it. It was just reality. My family&#8217;s reality was my father was a soldier and none of us really, my brothers and I, we never knew exactly what he did, because he would go to work, he&#8217;d wear his fatigues, he&#8217;d look like an Army man, he&#8217;d be in uniform, he was fit, a handsome, respectful, decent person. He&#8217;d go off and go to work, came back. For two years of my life he was in Vietnam, once when I was in second grade and the second time when I was in seventh grade, so for a year at a time. In second grade the only thing I really remember is before he left the entire family was sad, and I didn&#8217;t understand why, in second grade. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know what war was. I didn&#8217;t know where Vietnam was. I didn&#8217;t know what my father did. I didn&#8217;t know that we were different from everybody else. So I remember that everybody was sad. I remember that my father was gone. We would make him eight-track tapes, I think they were, where my mother would record us and she would send tapes to my father and he would send tapes back so we would hear his voice. I remember when he came back nobody told us he was coming back, so&#8211;. And I would say that a year in the life of children that are, say, ages four to ten&#8211;no. How old would I have been? In second grade, maybe eight? That&#8217;s a long time not to see your father, so when he walked in we didn&#8217;t know him, and that was hurtful to him, so I remember confusion around that. So, seventh grade was different. I certainly had a better understanding of what he did. I felt the animosity of the community for the work that my father did, for the fact that he was a soldier. I went to school with kids that called my father a baby killer. Even when I went to college, even though the war was long over, people still made comments to me about my father, his service to the country. Looking back I think my father would probably say that it&#8217;s very unfortunate that we were even involved in that war, but at the time I don&#8217;t think he felt that. It&#8217;s duty, honor, country. Your kids are raised duty, honor, country. We&#8217;re raised to be public servants and it&#8217;s like a calling, so I feel like the whole family did what we were supposed to do and what we were expected to do. But again, I think if you look at it in hindsight, I think there are many, many people that think we shouldn&#8217;t even have been there, so imagine what it must feel like to have been the soldier that went there for your country, that watched his friends die, and then to come back and be treated like you&#8217;re pond scum. Very disheartening and disillusioning, I guess, and I think the kids felt that to an extent. I felt it to an extent. The other thing though about Army men, they don&#8217;t talk about what they do, like police chiefs don&#8217;t talk much about what they do. So I remember when I was either in late high school or early college watching TV with my family and there was a war scene. I don&#8217;t remember what show we were watching. I asked my father&#8211;. In the scene there were guys that were dressed in the same kind of uniforms my father was always in. It was a war scene, it was very difficult, there were injured people, there was a helicopter, somebody got out of the helicopter, rushed over to an injured soldier, dragged him back to the helicopter, and I looked at my father and I said, &#8220;Dad, is that what it was like for you?&#8221; and he got up out of his seat and he sort of yelled, &#8220;What do you want me to say, Carolyn?&#8221; and I knew that I&#8217;d struck a nerve and I knew that that&#8217;s exactly what it was like for him, that he couldn&#8217;t talk about it, and in fact took himself from the room. So we&#8217;ve never talked about exactly what happened to him in the war, you know? Difficult. CW: Yeah. I think you may have partially answered this, but in the second interaction with a police officer you talk about you were really into everything that he was saying and his presentation until he told you that women didn&#8217;t have a place. What was he talking about in the job description and why did it attract you? CH: You know, I don&#8217;t know that I could tell you that specifically, but my sense of it is that he was talking about the sort of things that he did as a police officer, the routine service, and my sense again is that he was accurate in his description because when I started doing it, it felt like what he talked about. So responding to crisis situations, helping people with domestic issues and violence, investigating all manner of crimes, taking care of kids who were victimized, and I think he probably talked about some of the mundane things too, the traffic direction and investigating traffic accidents, probably writing citations, who knows. But he was just talking about what is the job like. CW: And your response, like, &#8220;Oh. Women can&#8217;t do this? I want to do this,&#8221; where do you think your knowledge that, &#8220;I think I can do it anyway,&#8221; where did that come from? What influenced that thought? CH: I think in a way my upbringing, my mom and dad. I&#8217;m the oldest of five and I have four brothers, and I think that being the only girl was probably fortunate for me. Being the oldest was fortunate. I think my experience as the only girl would have been different had I been the youngest. But they treated me like they treated their boys, and I was every bit as athletic as those boys were and they supported me in my athletic endeavors. They didn&#8217;t treat us differently and even though they might have thought I would get married and follow a traditional path and they wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about me, they didn&#8217;t really raise me to do that. They raised me to know who I am, to speak my mind, and to get what I want, so I thank them for that. CW: Do you think you had any sense or awareness of a greater feminist movement or women&#8217;s movement when you were growing up that influenced your understanding of yourself as a woman? CH: Well, yeah. I mean I can remember seeing Gloria Steinem on TV. I probably heard conversations that my mom would have with her friends, and certainly in school there would have been some discussion probably in civics classes. But I think TV informed a lot of us so that&#8217;s where I would have seen most of it, women pushing the envelope and having an aunt that pushed the envelope, and even though I didn&#8217;t really get to witness that up close and personal there was discussion of it and I could hear about it. I guess that informed me too, that there were changes coming. And there were other&#8211;. Phyllis Schlafly was, you know, people were laughing at her, and I remember when I was in college I bought a button that said, &#8220;He&#8217;s pretty, but can he type?&#8221; CW: [Laughs] CH: And I would wear that. Oh, and the bumper sticker on my car was, &#8220;Lily Tomlin for President.&#8221; So the movement was leaking in. It was working its way in, in a variety of ways. CW: You overheard your mom having conversations with her friends. What sort of conversations? What were they talking about? CH: Well I think initially they were resistant to some of what women were beginning to say, because it was not&#8211;. It didn&#8217;t reflect their own experience at the time, but&#8211;and I&#8217;m going to fail you here because I&#8217;m not remembering specifically&#8211;I think that over time even&#8211;. Certainly my mother was empowered by the skirmishes that the other women were involved in, and everything that I&#8217;m saying, I don&#8217;t mean to describe my mother as a weak person. She wasn&#8217;t. She was very strong and she was the boss. My father, he was the boss of some things but she was the boss of that family in a way. In some ways I feel like they had a very equal partnership. My mother shouldered more of the burden though, but my father relinquished some control to my mother that I think other Army guys did not relinquish to their wives, so in that sense to me it was more of an equal partnership as they raised children and figured out how to survive the military life. CW: Was your dad&#8211;? You mentioned the years he was in Vietnam but was he often deployed? CH: No, not really. There were training exercises like within the states that he would participate in but most of the jobs that he had, when he wasn&#8217;t deployed to the war, most of the jobs were local. So he didn&#8217;t go away much but he would be gone during the day, like left really early in the morning and would get back 6:00, 7:00 at night, so he had very long days. But again we didn&#8217;t know that other people&#8217;s dads didn&#8217;t do that. It took us awhile to figure that out. CW: I&#8217;ll try to move forward in time a little bit. You said you struggled to get hired in the police force for a while, in Durham. What was that experience like? How did you decide you were going to persist through this period of rejection by the Durham Police? CH: Well I really thought that I had to prove myself to them so I did what I thought was necessary to do that, and somebody had suggested to me that if I apply again that that would demonstrate my commitment and my genuine interest. So, I applied again, and I went through the process again, and then it happened a third time. It was very demoralizing because I felt that I had interviewed well. Durham at the time was public safety, which meant that they did both police and fire. I was not thrilled about the fire part but I was willing to do it so that I could be a police officer, but you had to pass some pretty stringent physical tests to be accepted. Durham was advertising on TV that they needed minorities, they needed women, and that they would work with them to get them to pass the physical agility test. Well I passed the physical agility test the first time out. I didn&#8217;t need the course to prepare. I felt that if they really needed women, if women were considered minorities and if they really needed smart minorities who were physically fit, I fit that bill and I didn&#8217;t understand why I wasn&#8217;t hired. So I was very demoralized and actually very close to giving up on North Carolina and moving to Massachusetts, where my family lived, because I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be a police officer here so I thought maybe I&#8217;d try it somewhere else. I spoke to a recruitment coordinator in Durham who swore me to secrecy, but since she&#8217;s no longer on the planet I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be betraying anything. She said to me, &#8220;They are not going to hire you because you went to school at Duke.&#8221; I looked at her and I was like, &#8220;But why?&#8221; [and she said,] &#8220;Well they think you&#8217;re too smart.&#8221; [I said,] &#8220;But why?&#8221; [and she said,] &#8220;Well they hired another girl who went to Duke. She stayed with them for a year and she went to law school, and they&#8217;re worried you&#8217;ll do the same thing,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I have no interest in law school,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to hire you.&#8221; So, you know, and she told me at the time, &#8220;If you tell anybody that I&#8217;ve said that I&#8217;ll deny it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t betray your confidence. Thank you for being honest with me,&#8221; and I realized, boy. I&#8217;m going to have to look somewhere else. I had gone to school in Durham and I lived in Durham. That&#8217;s why I thought, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll work in Durham.&#8221; But then I realized I have to look elsewhere. So I saw the ad for Carrboro and didn&#8217;t even know where it was at the time. I had to ask them, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m in Durham.&#8221; [They said,] &#8220;You&#8217;re in Durham and you don&#8217;t know where Carrboro is?&#8221; CW: [Laughs] CH: &#8220;Well I&#8217;m very limited.&#8221; So, anyway. CW: So this woman you&#8217;re describing, was she in the Durham police force, or who&#8211;? CH: She was not. She was a civilian associated with the department and I believe her position was recruitment coordinator. CW: Okay. And did you get the sense, with your interactions with the Durham Police Department, that there were men who had similar degrees, or do you think that your gender in combination with your degree, did that interact in a way? CH: I think it&#8217;s the second. I think really the experience that they had with the young woman who preceded me had everything to do with why they didn&#8217;t hire me, but even when I was hired here the police chief at the time said to me, &#8220;You&#8217;re too smart for this job.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll get bored with the job.&#8221; [I said,] &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think I will,&#8221; [and he said,] &#8220;Oh, you will. Somebody as smart as you are, you&#8217;re going to get bored.&#8221; And he said to me, once he&#8217;d hired me, he said, &#8220;The guys don&#8217;t like you,&#8221; and I remember looking at him and thinking, wow. I said, &#8220;But, Chief, I don&#8217;t know any of these guys. They don&#8217;t know me. How can they not like me?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You went to school at Duke. You&#8217;re college educated, a lot of them aren&#8217;t. You&#8217;re a woman. They don&#8217;t like you.&#8221; So that&#8217;s what it was like to start here. The chief was very supportive. He had spent twenty years with the New York City Police Department and retired and come here, so he was not part of the good ol&#8217; boy Southern network. He was very forward thinking. I would say he was a feminist and he was willing to help me fulfill a dream and to give me a chance, and I don&#8217;t think&#8211;. I don&#8217;t know if I would have been given this chance any other place at that time, I don&#8217;t know, because law enforcement was very different twenty-nine years ago here. The face of it was very different. CW: When he would describe the general sentiment of the men, did you find that indeed there was some hostility toward you when you started out, or how did that actually play out? CH: Well, I was scared to death. My first day was the&#8211;. Well we called it the Christmas Parade back then. Now it&#8217;s called the Holiday Parade. CW: [Laughs] CH: That was my first day, so I reported for duty in 1984 in December for that parade, and I&#8217;d never met any of the guys and I walked into the patrol room and one of them looked at me and he said, &#8220;Are you on birth control?&#8221; and I went, &#8220;What?&#8221; He goes, &#8220;Are you on birth control? You better be, because this town is going to &#8220;f&#8221; you over,&#8221; and he said the f-word. So I was scared. I didn&#8217;t know&#8211;. I mean Chief Fergie had said, &#8220;They don&#8217;t like you,&#8221; and that&#8217;s the first thing that I heard when I walked into that patrol room. I learned later that that officer was having a very bad day, month, year, and that he really didn&#8217;t mean it as an evil thing to say to me, but because I didn&#8217;t have any frame of reference for this place I didn&#8217;t really know how to take it. Anyway, I didn&#8217;t answer his question. I just looked at him. Then the next thing somebody said was that my hair was too long and I&#8217;d better go find a bobby pin and put it up. Well, I didn&#8217;t have any bobby pins. I wasn&#8217;t a bobby pin kind of girl. I&#8217;m thinking, whew. I&#8217;m batting a thousand here. So it wasn&#8217;t the friendliest of environments. If you were female you had to have a very thick skin to survive. CW: How did you deal with those comments and then also do your job starting out? How did you cope? CH: Well, you know I&#8217;ve never been an extremely social person but I&#8217;ve had a very small group of like core friends, so I would leave work and talk to my friends. I actually kept a journal, so I would journal, and I would talk to my mother on the phone a lot about what was going on, what kind of calls there were. But over time I think I got more used to the police culture and I think having grown up in a family of boys and men had prepared me pretty well to deal with the male environment, male dominated environment, because I could understand them. I decided that I had to show them that I could do the work, that I would do that work, and I wanted them to see me first as a police officer and then as a woman. I didn&#8217;t want to lead with being a woman, because I didn&#8217;t think that was necessary, so I went out and did it, you know, stiff upper lip kind of thing. CW: Were there any other women in the Carrboro police force at the time? CH: Yeah, there were. I want to say there were two others at the time. I think there were only two, and then shortly after I arrived there were more, but the two that were there when I got there didn&#8217;t stay much longer. I didn&#8217;t find them to be much help to me, you know. I never had a female role model. I never felt like we were competing with each other, we worked on different shifts, but I didn&#8217;t get to know them well. So really you do bond with the guys that you work with as you depend on each other to get through the days and the nights, and sometimes there are some pretty dangerous and frightening calls and you depend on them, so you do form very tight and I would say meaningful relationships with the people you work with directly. CW: Talking about dangerous calls, what cases or groups of people did your initial police work put you in contact with, in Carrboro? CH: Well initially I was in the patrol division so I just answered 911 calls, so whatever. They were anything from a squirrel trapped in somebody&#8217;s house and they&#8217;d call the police,&#8211; CW: [Laughs] CH: &#8211;to a reported rape, to murder. Carrboro was very different in the mid &#8217;80s. In my mind in some ways it was more dangerous. I don&#8217;t know that the town was any more diverse, I wouldn&#8217;t say that it was really, but there were some areas of town that were very vulnerable to drugs and crimes associated with substance abuse, whether it was drugs and alcohol. There were weapons. So, you know, fight calls, there were a lot of fight calls, and when you&#8217;re a small woman and you&#8217;re responding often alone to a fight call with guys that are a lot bigger than you are, it was&#8211;. There were moments of, &#8220;What am I doing this for?&#8221; you know. You have people look at you and say, &#8220;You see that wall? I&#8217;ll pick you up and bash your head into that wall,&#8221; or, &#8220;I&#8217;ll pick you up and kick you from here to Chapel Hill before you can say whatever,&#8221; and I would look at them and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;No, you won&#8217;t.&#8221; [They would say,] &#8220;Oh no? Why?&#8221; and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Do you see this stick?&#8221; and I&#8217;d show my police baton, which was, I don&#8217;t know, two and a half feet long at the time, and I would say, &#8220;You see that stick? If you come at me doing that stuff I&#8217;ll break both your knees before you can say whatever,&#8221; and even if I didn&#8217;t believe I could do it I had to sound like I believed I would do it, and then often they would say, &#8220;You would do that, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Yes, I would. I mean it&#8217;s me or you. Yeah. So, there was everything happening in Carrboro at the time, and anything that you can imagine happening in a big city, it happened here. It just didn&#8217;t happen in the volume that it happened in other places. But there were nights that we didn&#8217;t stop. We were like running, running, running. CW: How have the challenges that you and the police department have had to address in Carrboro changed since you first started? CH: Well, wow, since I first started. Well, as I said, there were some neighborhoods in town that were very vulnerable to drug trafficking, to the crimes associated with that, a lot of break-ins, people loitering for the purpose of drug trade which itself is very debilitating for a neighborhood. In these neighborhoods there were often older people that lived there, people who owned their homes and deserved a quiet life, and their lives were interrupted by people who had no business being there, who had taken over the streets. So we were dealing with issues like that. We don&#8217;t really have that anymore, so on one level that&#8217;s a good thing. But in some of these neighborhoods that I&#8217;m talking about, now they&#8217;re populated by students, primarily white students, probably of some solid economic means, so that means that a lot of other people have been displaced and that&#8217;s not necessarily of great benefit to a community when the community wants to be inclusive. So now we deal often with people that have a political agenda, you know, like say the Yates Building in Chapel Hill, if you&#8217;re familiar with that, and the anarchist takeover of the CVS here. We deal with situations like that now. They&#8217;re no-win situations. You&#8217;re damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t. If you try to work with them the business community is upset because you&#8217;re working with the anarchists and from their perspective the anarchists are breaking the law, and they are. They&#8217;re breaking the law, and you&#8217;re not doing anything about it? But then if as the police you do something about it, then the community is upset that you&#8217;ve done something about it, so it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay. What do you want from us? What are we supposed to do here?&#8221; And it&#8217;s difficult. It&#8217;s in some ways very sad that some members of the community will tell us the best way to do our job when they&#8217;ve got no training in policing. Back in the day people didn&#8217;t tell us how to do our job, not so much, and today we probably don&#8217;t get through a week without somebody telling us that they could do it better and that we&#8217;re a bunch of idiots. But I would say that&#8211;I&#8217;d knock on wood but I&#8217;d mess up your microphone&#8211;I think that there is less violent crime now than there used to be but there&#8217;s the threat of violence associated with firearms to a greater extent than maybe there used to be, because there are more firearms out there and more readily available. Back in the day people would beat each other up with fists or they&#8217;d knife each other and today all the thugs carry guns, so there&#8217;s that threat. Back in the day in terms of drugs we were really talking about powder cocaine and heroin, marijuana&#8211;weren&#8217;t so concerned about the marijuana&#8211;and today it&#8217;s crack cocaine, meth, some of the psychedelics that kids are interested in, but there&#8217;s less street level in-your-face dealing. Back in the day there was a lot of in-your-face, open air drug market type stuff going on, and that doesn&#8217;t happen so much anymore. So I would say that those&#8211;. You know, we&#8217;ve always been beset by property crime, and I think that that&#8217;s a function of probably&#8211;well, several things. One, poverty, two, drug and alcohol abuse, and three, that I think Carrboro is still the most densely populated town in the state, so where there are a lot of people and a lot of wealth there is a lot to be stolen, so it&#8217;s an easy place to find something, and people feel fairly safe here so they don&#8217;t lock their cars, they don&#8217;t lock their houses, and they make it easy. CW: Yeah. We have students too, so. [Laughs] And we&#8217;re trying to figure out how living in houses works. CH: That&#8217;s right. CW: So that must be an adventure to deal with. When you assumed the position of chief, what was it like being the authority in a traditionally male dominated department? CH: Well, I was very proud. I was very concerned that I would do it right, get it right and not hurt people and not violate people&#8217;s rights. So again it&#8217;s a situation where I didn&#8217;t lead with: I&#8217;m female. I let&#8211;. People knew that. They could see that. So I didn&#8217;t seek to highlight that, and I always tried to help the officers understand that what brought me into this business is the same thing that brought them into the business, one level of which is a desire to help people. It&#8217;s as simple as that. So I think I was able to show them through the years that I&#8217;ve never forgotten what it is that they do and that I really appreciate what they do, and that I need them. I had to set my expectations. I had to make them clear. When people didn&#8217;t live up to my expectations, I had to deal with that directly in a way that was respectful of their&#8211;. What&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for? I always wanted to be aware that I was dealing with a human being who had feelings and I didn&#8217;t want to disrespect them, but if they weren&#8217;t doing what they were supposed to do I would have to deal with that effectively, and others in the organization would have to know. While they might not know the details for confidentiality reasons they would know that there are repercussions for not doing the right thing. So there was a period of adjustment where I think some officers thought about whether they wanted to continue to work here under a woman, and others tested me to see what they could get away with, and over time we all worked it out. We started off with a good policy and procedure manual and we tweaked that when it was necessary and made sure officers understood what the changes were. But early in my career as chief I got a nickname of &#8220;Chief Hatchetson,&#8221; as opposed to Hutchison, and it was not because I fired a lot of officers, really, although maybe people thought that&#8217;s what was happening. But I think some decided, this isn&#8217;t really the kind of law enforcement I want to do, so they moved on, and then others, you know I did have to help them see that this was not going to be the place for them to work and then give them an opportunity to resign. So what we&#8217;ve built&#8211;and I have a very strong administrative staff so there&#8217;s that as well. You have to develop a trusting relationship with your core group, instill your values and trust that they&#8217;re going to pass those along down the chain. So, you know, that&#8217;s how it works. CW: Isn&#8217;t that&#8211;? I&#8217;m thinking about One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#8217;s Nest, like Nurse&#8211;. Isn&#8217;t her name&#8211;? CH: Ratched. CW: Ratched, okay. CH: Nurse Ratched. CW: That&#8217;s the first thing, and I was like, is that where maybe that&#8217;s from? CH: Yeah, Nurse Ratched. She was great. [Laughs] CW: Yeah. She ran the place. [Laughs] That&#8217;s for sure. CH: No, I think that was, you know, give them the ax. You know the phrase, &#8220;You give them the ax,&#8221; Chief Hatchetson. But again there wasn&#8217;t a lot&#8211;. I wasn&#8217;t doing a lot of firing, you know, but people were firing themselves. People were saying, okay. Maybe I&#8217;d like to go police somewhere else. CW: What changes were you consciously making to the department when you became chief? CH: Well I wanted everybody to&#8211;. I wanted to create an environment where we were always learning, where mistakes were tolerated, they were welcomed, as long as they weren&#8217;t willful. We&#8217;re human, and I think I had acknowledged up front, we&#8217;re all human. Everyone makes mistakes. We don&#8217;t do things right all the time. But if we mess something up and we don&#8217;t learn from it and we do it again that&#8217;s not going to work. So I think the first thing was to acknowledge that&#8211;. I think I acknowledged with my staff that I didn&#8217;t have all the answers, that I never would have all the answers, that I would welcome their expertise regardless of the rank that they had or didn&#8217;t have, that I saw the value that each person brought to the organization, that if they had a skill that I didn&#8217;t know about that they wanted to share to let me know about that, to let their supervisors know. So I think that&#8217;s what we did initially, was really issue an invitation to everybody in the department to participate fully, to be&#8211;to borrow [from] the Army&#8211;all you can be, reach your potential, and I think that has really worked for this department because&#8211;knock on wood&#8211;we are rarely in the news for anything negative. I think we&#8217;re highly skilled, so there was always an emphasis on training. Most of it&#8217;s police training, but if there are officers here who are interested in higher education then we certainly support them in that, encourage that, but it&#8217;s not a requirement. One of the things I wanted to share with officers initially was that I did not think when I came here that I was better than they were because I had a college degree. The truth is that college degree probably&#8211;. Except that it helped me think, and maybe I learned some problem solving skills, and maybe I learned how to complete a project, it didn&#8217;t really teach me how to deal with people. It didn&#8217;t teach me how to deal with somebody who doesn&#8217;t speak my language. It didn&#8217;t teach me to deal with a drunk. It didn&#8217;t teach me to deal with someone who was mentally ill. So I let officers know up front that the experience that they had on the street was probably more valuable than the experience that I got in the classroom. So while I think education benefits most people and I would encourage it I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s absolutely necessary to do this job. I think maybe if you want to be an administrator, if you want to rise through the ranks then yes, you probably should get a college degree. But if you want to be a line officer, if you want to be an investigator, if you want to deal with people directly and help them with their crises and situations, it&#8217;s not absolutely necessary to have that college degree. CW: I think the Army has a really like solid family focus. Did you find the police force had a similar focus, and how did you&#8211;and I know you have a family&#8211;how did that interact with the police force? CH: Well when I was a young officer and I was the same rank as others then we would get together socially, but I was never the kind of person that would socialize exclusively with police, and in fact we tell officers not to do that because it&#8217;s probably not the healthiest choice to make to socialize only with people who see the world the way you see it at work. CW: [Laughs] CH: But as I was promoted through the ranks I was less inclined to socialize. It&#8217;s like my family view shrunk as I went through the ranks, and that&#8217;s by necessity. If you are supervising people you can&#8217;t be their best friend, so I think with each promotion I became a little more isolated in some ways. I love the people I work with, but I don&#8217;t share my personal business with them too much; whereas when I was at the same rank we might have conversations about personal things as well as professional things. So it&#8217;s almost like if you think of a funnel and you&#8217;re reversing the funnel, when you&#8217;re a police officer at the bottom everybody is fair game. You can be friends with everybody. You can share what you want to share. You get promoted and the funnel&#8217;s getting a little smaller and then when you&#8217;re up at the top, when you&#8217;re responsible for everybody, you are different and you have to protect yourself. I tell them. I say, hey. It&#8217;s lonely. That phrase, &#8220;It&#8217;s lonely at the top,&#8221; it is. Usually I think probably most police chiefs will have somebody in their administrative staff, or some buddies, that they can confide in and that they can get personal with, but I&#8217;ve learned through very tough experiences that you have to be really careful who you trust because in this business, like in any other business, people will use information that you have shared to their advantage if they think that they can, and I&#8217;ve had a couple experiences where things that I said in confidence have been shared or embellished by the person that I shared it with, and that&#8217;s tough. That&#8217;s a tough lesson. I had to learn that one. CW: Is there anything that you thought I would ask about that I didn&#8217;t, or anything that you want to share? CH: Well I thought you&#8217;d ask me something about being gay. CW: I know. [Laughs] CH: Did you not want to ask that, or did you? CW: I mean, I did, and I&#8217;m gay, so I&#8217;m personally interested, [Laughs] which is weird, but I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t know if I can ask her. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s probably too much information too, but&#8211;. I don&#8217;t know. CH: No. I appreciate you telling me that. No, I guess I in some ways feel a responsibility to speak about it, and again&#8211;. How old are you? CW: I&#8217;m nineteen, almost twenty. [Laughs] CH: Okay. Wow. So I became a police officer when I was twenty-five, and when I was twenty-five and joined this department I did not tell anybody that I&#8217;m gay. The world was not particularly accepting. I didn&#8217;t tell the police chief who hired me that I was gay. Today I have a gay woman working with me, or working with the department, and in the interview she openly talked about it and I&#8217;m thinking, wow. CW: [Laughs] CH: This is a real time warp, but how wonderful is that? I mean how wonderful is that? But I still recognize that for her it takes a lot of courage to sit in an interview situation with four scary police men, and a police chief sitting in the back, and disclose like that. Even though the world is different it&#8217;s still not perfect, so I recognize the courage that she demonstrated. Anyway, and I&#8217;ve, you know, people have asked me through my career. I never made my sexuality an issue either, like I didn&#8217;t make being female an issue. So when people started to figure it out I decided on a case by case basis whether I would confirm it or not, but there were years that I was fearful that if I disclosed that I would face repercussions, including being fired, because I didn&#8217;t know, I just didn&#8217;t know what the chief would do. And we&#8217;ve got a code of ethics and there&#8217;s a term, &#8220;moral turpitude,&#8221; and I didn&#8217;t know at the time, mid &#8217;80s, is being gay moral&#8211;? [Stumbles over word] CW: Moral turpi&#8211;. [Laughs] CH: Whatever that word is. CW: I&#8217;ve never heard that word before. CH: Is it immoral? So I didn&#8217;t know, so I didn&#8217;t talk about it. And even when I bought a house and lived with my partner, we didn&#8217;t&#8211;. If people figured it out it was like, okay, but again I didn&#8217;t wear it on my sleeve. And then it would have been&#8211;. [Referring to a document] It&#8217;s over here, but in&#8211;. Well there&#8217;s no date there. But&#8211;. Oh, I guess the biggest issue for me around that was when I thought I wanted to have a baby and I wanted to do that in a nontraditional way in a police department, and I was a captain at the time. So it took me a long time to make that decision and in making it I spoke with the police chief at the time. I asked him, &#8220;What would you think if I got pregnant, because I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;d like to be a mom,&#8221; and his response to me was, &#8220;Well, being a single mother is very difficult,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I know this because my mother was a single mother,&#8221; and even though he knew I was living with a woman his frame of reference was that I&#8217;m single, and on one very basic level I agree with that, to this day, because that relationship didn&#8217;t work out. So what I&#8217;ve said to women, people I know who are interested in being mothers: Great. You want to be a mom, be a mom. But you have to know that you alone can take care of those kids or that child, because at some point you might be alone. So I appreciated the way the chief framed that, but he didn&#8217;t shut me down. He didn&#8217;t say&#8211;. And I asked him point blank, &#8220;Would that get me fired?&#8221; and he said no. So then I went to, I call them very lovingly my &#8220;redneck boys&#8221; in the department, the ones that I&#8217;d worked with along the way and even though I was their superior officer at the time I reached out to them more as a friend and as a&#8211;. I wanted to know what they thought. I said, &#8220;I really need you to be honest with me. What would you think of me if I got pregnant?&#8221; These were the two most white, male, redneck people, and one of them said, &#8220;Well I think it would be great. I wouldn&#8217;t think anything of it. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d be a great mom,&#8221; and the other one said something similar, so I thought, okay. I can do this here and make it okay. So then I had to tell my mom and dad, so that was scarier. But even after having my daughter, and then after my partner had her son, our son, I wasn&#8217;t like in-your-face with it. We lived our lives and we went out. We weren&#8217;t hiding but we weren&#8217;t advertising. If people couldn&#8217;t figure it out by looking at us they were pretty sheltered, just unaware. But then there was this guy, Jack Daly, years ago who sued the town of Chapel Hill for providing domestic partnership benefits, and Carrboro also did that, so that&#8217;s when I chose to be very open and honest and in-your-face and the community&#8217;s face about my family and how it wasn&#8217;t different from others and how my kids needed insurance and my partner needed insurance. That would have been like in probably &#8217;99 because my son was born in &#8217;98 and I think he was pretty young when we were doing that. I think my daughter was only about three or four. And there was mostly acceptance but it still wasn&#8217;t total. People weren&#8217;t absolutely thrilled by the lesbo police chief. CW: [Laughs] CH: Not thrilled, but it is what it is. CW: How did your family react to all of that? [Phone buzzes; transcription continues at 1:20:42] CH: How did my family react? I did not disclose who I was totally to all members of my family until&#8211;. I&#8217;m not even sure if I did it before my daughter was born, but if it wasn&#8217;t right before it was immediately after. See, we live in lots of different places so we don&#8217;t get together that much, and we got together, I don&#8217;t even remember what the occasion would be, but I remember my brothers and I went out to dinner, all of us at the same time. It was the first time in years that we had been together. I knew that two of my brothers knew, the two youngest, and I sort of raised them. I say that I raised them, but they were the ones that were closest to me and they knew, because I had told them before and they were fine. We just didn&#8217;t discuss it in my family. But my other brothers, the ones that were right underneath me, they didn&#8217;t know and they were more conservative and traditional and judgmental and there were many reasons that I never disclosed. So I said to them, I think it must have been after Riley was born, and I said, &#8220;As she gets older she&#8217;s going to understand that her family is different and looks different and I need my extended family to recognize that we are the same as you are, we&#8217;ve got all the same issues, the same desires, the same dreams, and I want you to be on board with supporting Riley and her family,&#8221; and that&#8217;s when I disclosed that I&#8217;m gay. One of my brothers was really angry that I had not told him before, but even at that dinner he had made some joke about fags or queers or whatever, and I thought, &#8220;Boy. This is going to go over real well.&#8221; CW: [Laughs] CH: But he was embarrassed because he had done that and he was angry that&#8211;. I think he was more angry with himself than he was with me. But I said to him, &#8220;What would you have done if I had told you all those years ago?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I would have shut you out.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yeah, and I wasn&#8217;t willing for that to happen, so I didn&#8217;t disclose to you. And here we are now, and you&#8217;ve come a long way, and we&#8217;re going to be okay and you&#8217;re not going to shut me out.&#8221; So, my mom and dad&#8211;. My mother found out in 1984, right about the time that I got the job in Carrboro, because, as I had said to you before, I was thinking about leaving this area and going to Massachusetts, and when I was doing that it was at the end of a relationship that I had been in so I was very personally devastated and then professionally I wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. So I got in touch with one of my brothers and said, &#8220;Can you come? If I fly you down will you help me drive a truck with my stuff? I&#8217;m giving up on this place,&#8221; and he said yeah, and my mother asked him point blank, &#8220;Is Carolyn having a relationship with&#8211;?&#8221; and I won&#8217;t disclose the name, and Brian said, &#8220;She was, she&#8217;s not anymore, and that&#8217;s part of what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221; So that&#8217;s how my mother found out, but she knew, sort of, and then that prompted lots of telephone calls and my mother said something like, &#8220;Well what do you think your father&#8217;s going to think about this?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know Mom. What is he going to think?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Dad&#8217;s going to be all right because he was certainly around it in the Army.&#8221; [She said,] &#8220;No he wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; [and I said,] &#8220;Oh yes, he was. I can tell you he was.&#8221; But she said, &#8220;The sun rises and sets on you in your father&#8217;s eyes. You can&#8217;t tell him anything,&#8221; so I didn&#8217;t, and over time, again, living my life and just being who I am, he saw it, and I think the sun still rises and sets on me. CW: [Laughs] CH: But it was hard. The world was very different. Do your parents know? CW: Yeah. CH: And are they totally thrilled to the bone? CW: I mean it was the same sort of, &#8220;Are you in a relationship with so-and-so?&#8221; and a lot of realignment of expectations for me and who they thought I was for a long time, and then not&#8211;. I assume , but I still was, I still am the same person. CH: Yeah, exactly. I said those words. CW: But the expectation of a husband, etcetera, it was difficult for them, but they&#8217;re on board, so. CH: Well good. I mean in the end parents, if they truly love you, want you to be happy and fulfilled, personally, professionally. They want you to be safe. And they raise us to figure out who we are, so I gently reminded my mother that she has some responsibility for who I am today. CW: [Laughs] CH: And when I do things that push her buttons I just look at her and say, &#8220;You made me this way, Mom. You made me the way that I am.&#8221; But I guess&#8211;.[T]here was a gay mayor here at the time, Mike Nelson, who really wanted me to be more out than I was, and I probably never lived up to his expectations because, as he once said, he&#8217;s the queen of Carrboro. CW: [Laughs] CH: But, yeah, I think that I&#8217;ve&#8211;. [S]traight people don&#8217;t run around saying, &#8220;Hey! I&#8217;m straight and I&#8217;m the police chief,&#8221; so why would a gay person do that? But if people ask I acknowledge it, and I say that I was very fortunate to work in a place that was affirming of me and affirming of my family, so that was a gift. That was lucky. So what else do you want to know? CW: Gosh. CH: [Laughs] CW: I had a lot of questions but I feel like a lot of them came up naturally, which is probably a good sign. So, I mean I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s anything else you want to bring up or share? CH: Well I&#8217;ll throw in &#8211;. I will say that now at the end of my career I am disappointed that I have not watched another woman in this department succeed. That bothers me. I always try to recognize what role do I play in all experiences, especially those here at the police department, but what I&#8217;ve come to realize, at least with the women with whom I&#8217;ve worked, it really is dependent on what they bring to the table. [Y]our success is going to depend on what you bring, and you might have a role model someday, you might have a great boss someday that sets out a path for you, that advises you, takes you under the wing, but if you don&#8217;t bring it, if you don&#8217;t bring your A game, it&#8217;s not going to happen. So I&#8217;ve been disappointed that the women that I&#8217;ve worked with through the years haven&#8217;t decided to stay in law enforcement, and if they did decide to stay they&#8217;ve not demonstrated their excellence. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m really saying that well, but I think that now&#8211;. I think I have some now, at the very end of my career. There are three women here who I think can write their tickets, but it all depends on what they bring, and I guess that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve been frustrated is I&#8217;ve wanted the women with whom I&#8217;ve worked to bring more and they didn&#8217;t do it. It&#8217;s like, wow. Why didn&#8217;t you do that? This is such a great profession and this profession needs you. But I guess in the end you really do have to be a very special person to do this kind of work. It&#8217;s not suited for everybody. Everybody is not suited for it. So I acknowledge that, but I hope in terms of some form of legacy, I hope I&#8217;m looking at some women now that will stick it out, if they feel good about what they&#8217;re doing, will stick it out and make a name for themselves, because it&#8217;s very gratifying to do that. I imagine it would be in any business that you&#8217;re in. But for me, for my legacy in general, it&#8217;s very simple. I want to be remembered here for not necessarily being the first female police chief, not necessarily for being the first gay female police chief, but for just being a good police chief that cared about this community, cared about the officers, did the right thing, and ensured that the officers did the right thing, and for me that&#8217;s very basic. That&#8217;s what I hope people would say: &#8220;She was a good chief. She had a great department full of great officers.&#8221; So, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping for. CW: Well it looks like the articles that I found, after you announced your retirement, it seems like that&#8217;s the general sentiment, so. CH: Yeah. I&#8217;m fortunate...
