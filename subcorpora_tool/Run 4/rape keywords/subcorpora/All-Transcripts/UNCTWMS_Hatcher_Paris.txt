 Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell: All right, this is Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell. It is August 18, 2011 and I am here talking to Paris Hatcher. She is, I believe, the executive director&#8212; Paris Hatcher: Mm hmm. CGD: &#8212;of Spark for Reproductive Justice in Atlanta, Georgia. So basically I wanted to start out and ask you&#8212;there&#8217;s the microphone&#8212;I wanted to start out and ask you to give me who you are, where you grew up. I know we talked about this already a little bit, but what your background is. PH: Okay. I&#8217;m Paris and I grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina. I lived in North Carolina and I&#8217;ve lived in the South my entire life, so I was in North Carolina for twenty-three years, then I moved to Georgia in 2003. I entered this work as I feel like is a really big part of my&#8212;. For me it feels like there&#8217;s a birthright around activism and really wanting to center the lives and stories of black women and really being involved and being raised in a family who really believed that education and power was a way that we could advance a world for justice. So I started this work really being firmly grounded in politics for justice but as I got older I really realized that focusing on gender was where I really wanted to put my effort behind the work because I think that there is something very unique and powerful around the intersections of race, gender, class, and sexuality, and a movement that centers those intersections has so much potential. CGD: So could you tell me a little bit about your family? You said education was important. How was that emphasized, and was activism emphasized? PH: Yeah. So I was raised by educators, so my grandma and my parents and my sister, they&#8217;re all teachers, so that has always been like the thing, right; go to school. You&#8217;re going to go to college, you&#8217;re going to do something for this world. I think really growing up in Greensboro, being like the center of civil rights, and being raised by folks who were really actively involved, and my parents necessarily weren&#8217;t super political, but it was really important for them to impart with us that there was like a struggle to get where we are and that by being like at least civically engaged, by voting, talking about important issues, and really being clear that there&#8217;s a system of&#8212; I would say that they would maybe say like there&#8217;s a racist system more than other systems of oppression that tries to restrict what we can do in this world. So I know that my parents really were actively involved. They always took us when it was time to vote. It was like a thing that they wanted us to be a part of, so no matter what they&#8217;d come pick us up so we could see them vote. It&#8217;s something that was really, really important. I can remember really young, 1990, was the thirtieth anniversary of the sit-ins and I wrote this essay because I knew that there was something very special that I wanted to honor. I felt really connected to this legacy. I won first place in writing this essay and for me it was really the first time, at nine years old, that I realized that I was connecting my life to this larger struggle and I wanted&#8212;it was like a seed had been planted. CGD: What was the essay contest? PH: It was around the Greensboro Four and honoring them and their contributions, like how do you feel about what they had done. CGD: Was it affiliated with the Vance Chavis Library in Greensboro? PH: I think so. CGD: Okay, I&#8217;m asking because I won a contest very similar to that in Greensboro. I bet you it was the same contest. PH: Yeah, it was different age levels too, so I don&#8217;t know what&#8212;. Yeah, I remember it was 1990 and it was this&#8212;. Yeah, I won this contest, but it was like for my grade level. CGD: I bet you it&#8217;s the same contest. I think probably almost every school child, you know, a lot of school children in Greensboro entered the same contest. Now were your parents elementary school teachers or higher education, or what type of teaching did they do? PH: So, my father taught high&#8212;. Both my parents taught high school but my father only taught high school for a little chunk of time and then went to just be self employed, but my mom has been a high school teacher and my grandma was an elementary school teacher, so those were the people who really&#8212;. Education was always a really big piece of our life and a way to move through the systems that were in place to restrict our movement. CGD: And so at what point did you become interested in reproductive or sexual issues and how did that link to the education piece? PH: You know, I think that&#8212;. So I ask myself a lot, and actually a part of my master&#8217;s research was around where did my desire for activism come from, like why have I felt so, from the beginning, extremely charged, like really motivated. A part of me feels like there&#8217;s this rebel consciousness that is just a part of the way that I&#8217;ve been oriented in this life. I don&#8217;t know where it came from but I feel like I was born ready and passionate and fired up. I think there&#8217;s a couple things. One, my parents raised me, and I don&#8217;t think with like intention really, in a feminist household, whether they&#8212;. And I asked them, do you identify as a feminist. My mom will be more reluctant. But I think a couple things; the absence of&#8212;. I think oftentimes in the absence of these restrictions around what girls can do it creates so many possibilities, so I learned how to cut the grass and wash dishes at the same time. I played football for a team. I was never told: Girls do this; I have never in my life, by my parents, nor have my siblings. So there&#8217;s three of us, I have a younger brother and an older sister. There was never emphasis around getting married and having children. It was around what&#8217;s your career. So I feel like there were no strict gender roles. I saw my mom talk about money, make money, and with my dad in a way that&#8217;s a really big deal for people, especially like you know men and women in relationships. It can be a power struggle. So I felt like that was a huge piece of my development because I knew that girls could do anything so that was the environment. With that it was very jarring to be in the world where it was very clear that the absence of these strict roles&#8212;. I was growing and developing and exploring and having these adventures and in the world I was being confronted with these obstacles around, actually girls have to do this and certain type of girls get treated&#8212;. If you talk about pleasure or desire you&#8217;re this type of woman or if you want to be assertive or speak your voice you&#8217;re this type of woman, that it really meant that living in this environment and really living my full self, there was pushback in the greater society. So I think for me, I go to college and there was not necessarily a word for the way that I felt. I always have cared deeply about women&#8217;s issues. For me I don&#8217;t recall the moment when I ever had any confusion around being a prochoice person, always adamant as a young person. I never had these conflicts about them, and I think it has a lot to do with in the absence of my parents&#8212;there weren&#8217;t these strict like, you know, this is bad, this is wrong; it was like create your own opinions. This is actually a really freeing space so I got to create my own conclusions and decisions. So I think going to school, really being able to identify as a feminist&#8212;. CGD: Where did you go to school? PH: I went to East Carolina. So taking my freshman women&#8217;s studies class, being like, oh my God, there&#8217;s this whole world of awesomeness. I have a name for myself, what I am, what I believe. I developed the political framework for what I&#8217;d always felt my entire life. So, it was just really amazing, and from there I feel like the heart of this work is really around liberation and autonomy and gender and sexuality really are so important. There are so much restrictions, from policies, cultures, norms, and practices that really limit the way that we interact and think about gender and sexuality in particular. CGD: So how did you translate those feelings into work, in things you were doing in the community? PH: So I think&#8212;. So even now I&#8217;m very excited that reproductive justice exists as a framework and we&#8217;re in this intersectional movement building time. What&#8217;s interesting is that pre the RJ [reproductive justice] movement I think many of us who started to get our chops in activism and organizing start from anti-violence work, especially domestic violence and rape, because it&#8217;s really one of the only politicized spaces where you can really center women&#8217;s voices. But we&#8217;re also centered in the victim role, right, so it&#8217;s not really how we&#8217;re organizing and mobilizing proactively. However, I feel like the domestic violence and anti-rape work, there was always a part of, like not always responding to the immediate crisis but thinking, what are the things we need in our communities to end rape, and so I think a lot of us&#8212;. So I entered the world through domestic violence and anti-violence, especially domestic violence and ending rape work, and that&#8217;s still a really big piece of my passion [that] I think really connects to RJ like all the way, just a big connection. I also did a lot of organizing around LGBTQ issues, and that was really the two places where I entered the work, where I felt like I was able to really put my politics on the ground, but still not as holistically as I am able to do in the RJ movement. CGD: And so what was it like for you to put your self out there with LGBTQ issues? PH: What do you mean? CGD: Particularly in the African American community, what did you do and what type of responses did you get? PH: Hmm. Well I think&#8212;. CGD: And I ask that because there seems to be these ideas that African American communities are so&#8212;. PH: More homophobic than anyone else. CGD: Exactly. PH: Right, which I don&#8217;t believe that. So, I don&#8217;t believe that, I came out at twenty to my family, so my organizing was really based&#8212;. Again the long tradition, so I really say that I&#8217;m not&#8212;. This is so old and so new, the work that we&#8217;re doing, so there are new ways that we&#8217;re doing it but some of these struggles, these are old conversations that our elders have been dealing with for a very long time. So I think what has been the issue is that the narrative around queerness and communities of color, especially black folks, has been around it should look like what white gay folks have, and coming out should look a particular way, and the way that we see it is around how white folks come out. So it&#8217;s around wave our flags and around parades, which is important, but it&#8217;s not the only way. Visibility is super important. I think being out is important too. I also know that black folks absolutely are aware of and love and take care of the queer people in their family, and I think it looks differently. It&#8217;s not all about tragedy. I mean I know of many friends who have lived with their families, with their parents, with their partners, right? These are not the stories that get on the news, right? So I think that if we have a willingness to not make our story match white culture around what it&#8217;s supposed to look like, what our coming out is supposed to look like, what our community is supposed to look like, then it shifts everything. There&#8217;s a lot of things that are happening, and community must&#8212;. I mean we have to work within our own communities to deal with the homophobia that is real, that is entrenched in systems that are killing people. So it&#8217;s the both-and, like black folks are not incredibly, overwhelmingly homophobic; that&#8217;s not it. At the same time we have things that we have to work on, and that&#8217;s a commitment that I have. CGD: How did you come out to your parents? PH: I told my brother, my sister, my mom and then my dad, kind of in that order, and I just called them. I was in college and I just called them on the phone. I think it was a great process because parents have to come out too so they have to have their own coming out, so being I guess twelve years in now we&#8217;re just in a really awesome place, yeah. CGD: And was there a strategic reason to do it on the phone and not in person? PH: Well it was more or less that I just wanted to share with them and I was at school, so I was three hours away and I, it was just kind of like it really seemed like I just want to let you know, you know? CGD: And so if you got your start working in domestic violence and anti-violence, so where have you moved to, because the RJ framework is incredibly broad. How did you broaden? PH: So, from getting started there I went and I did an internship working on private prisons and organizing against private prisons. I then moved from there to doing some more anti-violence like anti-rape work. Then I just kind of showed up and moved to Atlanta. So I knew that I wanted to do something like women-centric work, and I felt from there I&#8217;ve been able to move out. I think what has caused me to broaden has been really thinking about&#8212;. At the core of the work and how Spark really thinks about reproductive justice is really justice, liberation, around how we think about our bodies, genders, sexualities, and families. Those four pieces have so much contention, right? I mean the number one thing is that no one&#8217;s family&#8212;. I don&#8217;t really know anyone&#8217;s family looks like this norm, this really &#8220;American&#8221; norm, whatever. People have so many beautiful, different family structures, whether people are taking care of other people&#8217;s children or people with no kids, lots of friends living together; it&#8217;s so broad. So I think it became a conversation of not just being solely around women&#8212;which it is. For me women are the center, but it&#8217;s broader. It&#8217;s around how women interact and how women in particular are having conversations around the complexity of gender and sexuality and family, not only around pregnancy prevention and disease prevention, which is oftentimes the only way that women are allowed to enter space around really our liberation. It&#8217;s around how&#8212;. And I feel like that&#8217;s why the reproductive rights movement was so popular around this choice because it seemed like those were the only choices. Women are making tons of choices every day, right? This is not the only choice. So I feel like allowing ourselves, the movement, to be broader has really allowed for there to be more partners to be able to work with, people to intersect with, to see the way that we are redefining these limited notions that we&#8217;re limited from the beginning, like choice. So, I think we couldn&#8217;t help but to broaden out. We couldn&#8217;t help but to be a part of and build an expansive movement because our lives were expansive. It was that the frameworks that we were working in were not expansive enough for us. So I think many black women who were organizing, or women of color organizing around racial justice not having issues around gender coming up, or it being really specifically around motherhood as being like the only piece that gender is. So I think we&#8217;re in this time that people really want to bring their full selves and not be silenced or asked only to participate in a certain way, so we only want your working class voice in this space, but in reality this movement is allowing for every&#8212;you can bring in all of it and it&#8217;s a part of the work. CGD: So I&#8217;m curious about your work with prisons and how that is informing your work with Spark. Could you talk about your early experience and then talk about Spark&#8217;s work with shackling and other things? PH: Yeah. So, when I graduated from college I started working with this organization, Grassroots Leadership, in Charlotte, and they still are working on the role that private prisons play within the larger conversation, really that private prisons are this really unique beast because they basically come and say, hey, we&#8217;ll take this issue off your hands, and then are creating even more intense inhumane conditions for people who are in prison and are imprisoned by the&#8212;. There&#8217;s this exploding population of people who are in prison, right, so basically the idea is that if you build a prison we can fill it, and if you can fill it you&#8217;ll do anything to fill it, so it&#8217;s just a dirty business. Through the internship I learned a lot around how the state of Mississippi was spending more on prisons than education and projecting their prison beds on the achievement of third grade black boys, on the future of how many prison beds they would need. It really helped, for me, to make it more concrete, that what we see is not a conspiracy; it&#8217;s real. People, governors, state folks, are projecting and criminalizing behavior, criminalizing third grade black boys at that age to determine&#8212;. Your future&#8217;s already mapped out. For some of us in this country, for women of color, those of us who are marginalized, no decision, no choice that we make is ever going to be okay, right, and I think it&#8217;s so interesting around prison work because you can really see how it relates to the world of reproductive justice because you see how women of color are asked to make this choice, but both of the choices are incredibly criminalized. You&#8217;re a villain and there&#8217;s punishment, there&#8217;s some level of punishment. CGD: What type of choices could you choose? What would be the two choices? PH: So I think about for like a black woman in particular--. So say you&#8217;re like a working class black woman and you&#8217;re pregnant. If you choose to have an abortion there&#8217;s a billboard campaign saying that you are committing self genocide, right, so there&#8217;s that piece. So abortion is horrible because you&#8217;re self genocidal. If you opt to have a child you are a welfare queen and you&#8217;re just trying to rob the state of all of its money whether or not you are going to use the state&#8217;s resources, like if you&#8217;re going to do this anyway, whether or not the biggest folks who benefit from state support are corporations. It doesn&#8217;t make a difference, right? The choices that are allotted are very&#8212;you&#8217;re damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t, which we know is just very&#8212;. It&#8217;s a catch, right, so I think there&#8217;s this idea of punishment. Sexuality should be a punishment, that if you have sex you should be punished. There&#8217;s all this punishment that&#8217;s not even rigged into people&#8217;s behaviors, and the idea that some people are just inherently super sexual or inherently bad really gets to say what their lived experience should be. So it should be limited because you are inherently&#8212;. You are inherently bad, third grade boy, so we are going to build a prison for you in the future, so these structures are set up to reinforce the oppression, the real lived, like the real oppression. So as we&#8217;ve seen in the last twenty years the condition of this country and the economics have not made it easier for low income and working poor people, and people do what they have to to survive. So you&#8217;ve seen an explosion of women who have gone to prison, and women who go to prison&#8212;I think people forget this&#8212;the majority are parents and twenty-five percent are pregnant when they enter the system. Beyond that, prisons were built for men in consideration. It was not thought of like, oh, women have different needs. For example they need a specific type of care, or we can&#8217;t just give them one pad a day for their cycle. Those things are still in place so women who are pregnant are treated, even when they are not in prison, are seen as it&#8217;s like a disease, pathologized, and really we&#8217;re in this ridiculous medicalization of birth. If you take a system that has already created this thing like you&#8217;re in prison because you&#8217;re bad and whatever happens to you should just happen to you, plus you&#8217;re pregnant and pregnancy is already treated as this other condition, it&#8217;s just a nightmare what can happen. There&#8217;s nothing good that can come out of it. Spark really wanted to talk around that it&#8217;s really important to talk about the gender implications of prisons, what happens to women in prisons is very different, and that the mass incarceration of people in general is a humongous issue that must be taken seriously. But women are experiencing unique oppression and unique situations behind prisons that have not been talked about. CGD: And shackling is one of them. PH: Shackling, exactly. CGD: During labor. So how prevalent is that in Georgia or nationwide? Do you know, because it&#8217;s one of those things that I can imagine prison systems probably don&#8217;t want to talk about. PH: Right, so what we know is that there&#8217;s between fifty to a hundred women who are currently pregnant within a year&#8217;s span within Georgia prisons, so we&#8217;ve been working with nurses who have seen women come in, in their care, shackled and not knowing what to do. So we work with them to create a script, like, this is what you can say to interrupt the process. So while we&#8217;re working on a state level to put a policy in place we&#8217;ve been working with nurses to interrupt the practice when they see it, saying like, the national body of obstetrics and gynecology have said that this is a dangerous, harmful practice. We&#8217;re going to ask you to please remove it. For us one is too many. Two of our members who are part of our work experienced this, and it was a traumatizing, shaming experience, and our opting to tell their story, to not be shamed by this experience, that this is not the experience that&#8212;. They were wanting to reclaim it. One of our members was shackled and made to have a C-section early, so she wasn&#8217;t even in labor. She was given a C-section to fit a doctor&#8217;s schedule while she was incarcerated, and how it was incredibly intense, horrible, because when your body&#8217;s not ready&#8212;. I mean labor&#8217;s one of those things; you need to be ready to do it. So for her body to have not gone through the changes, it impacts everything, from your mental, postpartum. Also being separated twenty-four hours after the delivery for a child, of not being able to have your breasts make milk because your body doesn&#8217;t know how to&#8212;. It was against her will because it wasn&#8217;t time, and she&#8217;s healing that through telling her story and really being vocal and really working to push for this policy to end this inhumane practice. CGD: So what type of progress can you make on the political front, because I think that a lot of people would hear those stories and think that&#8217;s just so extreme? I think a lot of people wouldn&#8217;t think that would be possible. PH: Right. I think several things become interesting around women&#8217;s bodies in general, is that people don&#8217;t understand what happens from, you know, dangerous contraceptives that are the choices people take in order to decide like how they&#8217;re going to protect themselves, to living in a rape culture where what we wear becomes the blame for what happens to us, to thinking that&#8212;the idea that we&#8217;ve been socialized [to] all our lives, that prisons are here for a reason and bad people go to prison. I think because black folks in particular have been really hit with the explosion of the prison industrial complex and the over-imprisonment of our people, we know that that&#8217;s not the truth, that people are being locked up for social problems. Instead of social problems being fixed, prisons have become a solution to fix social ills when the fact is that when you have poverty and these systems of oppression of place and not the willingness to really deconstruct and smash them prisons will only be places to hold people, and it doesn&#8217;t work. I think it&#8217;s hard because it&#8217;s ingrained that prisons are for bad people. It does make it a hard story to have people understand, that no matter what people&#8217;s situations, no matter what they&#8217;ve done, people don&#8217;t deserve inhumane treatment. That we have to agree that a pregnant woman having a belly chain at nine months around her belly and around her ankles and wrists is too much. Women, when we&#8217;re telling our stories, you need to believe us, that, &#8220;It hurts, it&#8217;s inhumane, it shouldn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; should be enough. We are in the fifth year of this campaign to pass our bill. We finally got our bill introduced earlier this year. It&#8217;s HB653. We&#8217;re going to be pushing hard on it in the 2012 session to really get it passed and make Georgia one of the first Southern states to ban the practice. It&#8217;s super important that it happens because whether it&#8217;s a thousand or one it&#8217;s too many, and it&#8217;s so vitally important that women say no, that this is not okay. That should be enough, but unfortunately that&#8217;s not where we live. That&#8217;s not where we are. CGD: Who sponsored the bill? PH: The sponsors of the bill are Rep. Simone Bell and Rep. Stephanie Stuckey Benfield. CGD: Are they women of color themselves? PH: Simone is a woman of color, but just known for their progressive politics. And we know that we have to work with the Republican women on this bill, which, you know, leads ourselves to, we&#8217;ll see what happens. We really want to push this bill and I&#8217;m excited about really leading on this charge, especially around a policy for reproductive justice that&#8217;s not centered on pregnancy prevention and disease prevention, that there are lots of other issues from midwifery to infant mortality to thinking around&#8212;. I think there&#8217;s just so much other exciting work that we can do because these ridiculous abortion wars are just tired and, [Pause] they&#8217;re going to be here, you know? People are going to obsess around abortion forever, and there&#8217;s so many other things we can work on. CGD: Okay, so you opened the door so I do have to ask you about abortion. So, what was Spark&#8217;s role in the campaign several years ago to defeat SB529, which I know had another life way before that, and also the billboards, the first round of the billboards? PH: So we were the lead organizers for the campaign to bring the billboards down. We started an email campaign targeting CBS Outdoor, we had several rallies, we rallied at the King Center, so we took the role as doing the groundwork in mobilizing and community education. We did several community forums around the billboards and how people can get really actively involved. That work was really great work. We also worked really hard at the capitol, getting folks ready to testify, testimony, lobbying our elected officials around the bill as well, so we did a tremendous amount of work around the defeat of SB529 as well as bringing the billboards down. Central to that work is around how our history would not be co-opted and how the legacy and power of black women was at the center of it and that we won&#8217;t be shamed and blamed. We refuse to be shamed and blamed. What I think was really great is that as these billboards continue to come they are a distraction and most people are not getting up in arms, like, oh, my God, I just can&#8217;t believe. They&#8217;re just a waste of time and energy and resources by a group who is so distracted and misguided and shows their hatred and contempt of black women at every turn, at every turn you can see it. So the billboards have created a really great opportunity to talk with black women around these important issues around our agency, our power, and how we want to talk about the decisions we make in our lives and in our families. CGD: And when you say an organization that has contempt for black women are you referring to Radiance Foundation and/or Georgia&#8212;? PH: I feel like Georgia Right to Life, they don&#8217;t understand black folks, even if they hired Catherine Davis. It&#8217;s not them. I think Ryan Bomberger is just really misguided and is this biracial guy who has his story. I feel like you can see his contempt for black women, in particular black women, like saying comments that if black women closed their legs then abortion wouldn&#8217;t be an issue. I think a person who only has contempt for black women would say that. So while he may feel like he&#8217;s doing a service to black folks I feel like there are so many other issues that he could be focusing on in service of the black community. This is a distraction and he&#8217;s wasting thousands of dollars on a ridiculous campaign that really, when asking people, just ordinary folks on the street are just like, this is ridiculous. It&#8217;s offensive and ridiculous. CGD: So did you find that people in the local state house, African American politicians, were supportive of your efforts to defeat SB529? PH: I think by and large yes. They needed support and talking points on how to talk about the issue. They weren&#8217;t necessarily leaders on the issue, and I think they were maybe confused because the bill didn&#8217;t&#8212;. Well, Catherine Davis was working at that time. I think it may have been their first time when they were dealing with black folks on both sides, but there was only one of her and like a white sea and it would be all of us women of color at the capitol, like [saying] no to this bill. So I think they knew that they needed to stand on our side, and historically black folks stand with us with this issue, but not leading the issue, so very different. They needed a lot of support. CGD: Let me understand. So Spark evolved somehow from Georgians for Choice. Can you tell me what that relationship and history is? PH: Sure. So Georgians for Choice was started in 1986 as a prochoice coalition where Planned Parenthood and ACLU of Georgia and the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center and NARAL Georgia came to do like their political organizing and strategies, so it was focused on lobbying and watching what was happening at the capitol. [Coughs] Excuse me. From there we&#8212;. So since 1986, different manifestations, from no staff to one staff in 2001 they invested in getting one staff person from 2001 to 2005. I entered the organization in 2005 then in 2006 the ED [executive director] was always thinking really broadly around what the coalition should look like, so by the time I joined the organization in 2005 we had a really broad range of members who worked on economic justice, HIV/AIDS, racial justice, LGBTQ issues and beyond, who were part of the coalition, so we were already forming&#8212;the RJ politics were already there, we really are all equally vested in advancing a movement around a broader politic. So in 2006 I became co-director of Georgians for Choice but we knew that the framework&#8212;and this work had been already starting to happen. The framework needed to be changed. We knew that RJ was where we wanted to frame the work, it was already there; we just wanted to just come out and be like this is how we&#8217;re holding it, and that Georgians for Choice as a name wasn&#8217;t really serving what we were doing. So we knew that we just needed to shift frames and also brand ourselves, rename and brand ourselves to speak more accurately to the work that we were doing. We went from being a coalition to being an autonomous organization that collaborates with organizations and really went to an RJ organization that used the strategies of grassroots organizing, resource and analysis development, and leadership development as the way that we were forwarding our work. So really thinking of our organization as an organizing organization which would do policy work but not in the advocacy model, that we&#8217;re really doing policy work in an organizing model which was around not just the when but developing leadership and building a base to support the work. You&#8217;ll see organizations who do policy work but will do it with their members or activists like ten or fifteen steps behind, but our members are actively a part of designing and pushing our campaign work, [they] are leading the lobbying, talking to elected officials, [they] are the leaders of the work, and they are able to go to their communities and tell more people and it spreads out in that way instead of it being one person who&#8217;s holding all the work. So we made those shifts into Spark. CGD: And how many people do you employ now? PH: There&#8217;s five of us now. CGD: Is your staff all women of color? PH: No. We have one man of color. CGD: Oh, people&#8212; PH: But we&#8217;re all of color. CGD: &#8212;of color. PH: Yeah, we&#8217;re people of color. CGD: Was that a big shift from the demographics of Georgians for Choice and its policies? PH: Yeah, it was a shift. I mean we saw a lot of shifts happen when the decision was made that&#8212;. Yeah, I mean white women, for example Planned Parenthood of Georgia and ACLU of Georgia pulled out of the coalition&#8212;we were still a coalition&#8212;because of some of the decisions that we were making, because the leadership had typically been a white woman and it was no longer a white woman because we wanted to focus more on RJ. These decisions were not what the white-led reproductive rights and health organizations had envisioned for their coalition. CGD: What type of decisions were controversial? PH: The leadership, being that the organization was going to be led by two women of color and that the focus was going to be reproductive justice. Those were the decisions. CGD: So how did their mission differ from reproductive justice in their eyes and your eyes? PH: I really don&#8217;t know. I feel like it&#8217;s just, white women were not in control so they didn&#8217;t&#8212;. They weren&#8217;t controlling it. The coalition had been their playground, their space, they had had a white woman that had already worked in a couple of their organizations before that they felt confident with, and so it was going to be a new, different set of rules and a different set of engagement and, yes, that was what happened. CGD: Did that affect you and this new organization? How did it affect you and Spark in its early&#8212;? PH: I think it was wonderful. They just needed to leave. I mean Feminist, Planned Parenthood, and ACLU of Georgia pulled out of the coalition and we knew that the coalition model wasn&#8217;t what we wanted to do anyway because we were doing our own autonomous program and we needed to be an autonomous organization. We knew that we also didn&#8217;t need to be validated by their work in that we are doing awesome RJ work that must be reckoned with, and you do your reproductive rights and reproductive health work. We are all necessary to do this work and this fight together. I think, I mean white women who&#8217;ve been doing this work&#8212;. The ED of Planned Parenthood has been ED for the span of my life, thirty-one years. People are into this, they feel like they know what they&#8217;re doing, and it may work, right? It may be working over there, but what we were wanting to do, and change things posed a threat. CGD: So how do you work with those organizations that pulled out now? Can you be effective partners on particular issues? PH: We do. We just understand our roles. So we know that those organizations&#8212;. Our relationship with the ACLU is much better and awesome. We actually have a really great partnership with ACLU. We have a working relationship with Feminist and Planned Parenthood that&#8217;s based on the roles that we play. So they are at the capitol more so they provide us with intel when we need it, and our work is so awesome that they have to reckon with us, so there&#8217;s no way&#8212;. I think in the beginning there were doubts around whether the organization was going to survive or whether it was relevant because it didn&#8217;t have the stamp of approval from these organizations but we&#8217;ve absolutely done more than survive and we&#8217;re thriving in really important ways, so we work in ways that [are] mutually beneficial. That&#8217;s the only way it can work. CGD: Did not having those partners and not having the coalition model, did that make a difference to your fundraising or your financial health as an organization? PH: Not really, yeah. It just&#8212;. Yeah, things just continued moving on. I think some of the donors that funded us, who had also funded Planned Parenthood, we didn&#8217;t get their funding, but it hasn&#8217;t been horrible. I mean it&#8217;s been fine. CGD: Is Planned Parenthood supporting the anti-shackling legislation or bill? PH: No. Actually we have distance from Planned Parenthood. It&#8217;s not like a public relationship that we have. More or less I feel like they&#8217;re not the best people to partner with in general, and I think you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find a state group who has a really good relationship with Planned Parenthood in general because they don&#8217;t want to play fair. CGD: In what way? PH: They have a lot of resources, they want to advance their type of agenda, and their agenda is not necessarily as inclusive or as broad as it needs to be. CGD: So what do you think is not on people&#8217;s radar as an RJ issue that you see as an emerging concern? PH: Hmm, emerging concern. [Pause] I think&#8212;. [Pause] I think something that&#8217;s an emerging concern is that as we advance in this world and as opportunities become more available to people and to women and people of color, [like this idea of] gay marriage, that with policy change that everything is all right and wonderful, right? The thing is that it becomes much more veiled and the attacks are veiled and insidious in really interesting ways. So I think something that we have to deal with is that sometimes you&#8217;ll talk to young women who think that sexism doesn&#8217;t exist because I can go to college, right, like, you know, based on&#8212;or someone opened the door for me. This is real feedback that people have said: This is why sexism as a system doesn&#8217;t exist, like the election of Obama means that we&#8217;re in a post-racial time. I think to believe that the state is not obsessed with fertility or bodies of women of color because of opportunities, like you can get a job, you can go to college; these things are not really the indicators of where we are and what we&#8217;re going to have to fight up against. That&#8217;s what I can only really put out there, that I think that we&#8217;re going to see some really crazy, crazy attacks from defining life&#8212;. Personhood is going to be really interesting, the level of restrictions that are going to develop, I mean just more and more restrictions. Birthright citizenship I think is really interesting around something that could happen, like if you have a child in the U.S. it&#8217;s a citizen automatically, like we&#8217;re going to change that in some type of way. Again, insidious, just really interesting, nuanced ways of trying to define, brand, claim, and shame bodies in ways that we probably never thought of. CGD: These are national battles, and really international battles too, but why do you think Georgia has become one of the frontline states on all of these issues? PH: Well I think the South is battleground in general and I think it has everything to do with our legacy. We are the ground zero around body, labor, and reproduction. I mean this is it. The context of how the U.S. understands it was really set here, and I think from genocide of indigenous people to slavery it just happened here, so of course we&#8217;re living that. We&#8217;re living it currently. So I think that&#8217;s the number one reason. I think why there are fights and not wins is because there&#8217;s more organizations that are poised to fight and push back, and that&#8217;s exciting because we&#8217;ve become the test but the last four years nothing&#8217;s been passed, so we&#8217;ve been doing great work. But, yeah, I think it&#8217;s&#8212;. [Pause] The conditions where we are absolutely were set centuries before. CGD: Has there been something in terms of political change in addition to those centuries of history that has really happened? I mean for instance why did Georgians for Choice start in &#8217;86? PH: Right. I mean we&#8217;re at this really&#8212;. That&#8217;s thirteen years out from Roe at really the height of some intense anti-choice. This is when the anti-choice movement is using all of their tactics, like violence. They&#8217;re going for it. So I think we absolutely see these pockets of&#8212;. You can really map it out. Their movement is very&#8212;. They have a violent wing, incredibly violent, off the chain, they have people who protest at clinics who are kind of like the silent, Bound4LIFE people, and then you have the people in the middle who are doing the policy work and are kind of behaving. They&#8217;re behaving because they&#8217;re not bombing a clinic but they&#8217;re still ridiculous. In general I think we are seeing this southernization, like we&#8217;re seeing this politically nationally where policies only happen in the South because people have these ideas about what happens in the South, only these negative things that get exported out are happening everywhere, so you see Arizona passing things that&#8212;. Georgia didn&#8217;t pass the recent sex selection bill, but Arizona did. You see the hundreds of anti-choice legislation and just ridiculous stuff happening all over the country this past year. So we just see the conditions slipping in that the advances made in the twentieth century are being attacked right now. So this is a win, we&#8217;re going to try to take back the erosion of&#8212;just basic dignity is being eroded right now. CGD: Do you think there&#8217;s enough public outrage to build on to mobilize? PH: You know I think&#8212;. [Pause] I think there&#8217;s enough outrage. I think that the outrage gets easily diluted and overwhelmed with the amount of outrage that there is, so&#8212;. CGD: Outrage from the other side? PH: There&#8217;s a constant attack, right, and with media you are&#8212;it&#8217;s every day. Some time of the day you hear about some incredible thing so it&#8217;s kind of really hard to hone in, and I think that&#8217;s why we must really build cross movements with each other so that people are entering movement spaces and are entering, like I&#8217;m going to work on this campaign because I am an RJ activist and I see why someone who&#8217;s being detained unjustly is an issue that I should care about. So that&#8217;s the type of leaders that we want to train, people who are able to respond to a wide variety of issues grounded in RJ politics, and I think that&#8217;s what people need to do instead of saying we&#8217;re only training people to, or building the skills and leadership of people to respond to our movement. I envision Spark training and developing leadership and really turning out activists who know to respond to whatever&#8217;s happening, because of there experience with RJ. CGD: And so who inspires you? PH: I think&#8212;. CGD: Because this is hard work. PH: Yeah, so I feel like there&#8217;s three women who inspire&#8212;I mean there&#8217;s many. [58:19] ____inspires me, Harriet Tubman inspires, [58:23] ____ inspires me, the women who birthed me and gave me life, my mom, and all those bad-ass women inspire me. Black women inspire me every day, and women of color. So many people inspire me to wake up and do my best and try harder, try more, be innovative. My people inspire me. That&#8217;s the motivation, so it&#8217;s easy to do when we are building community and loving each other and advancing this awesome work, so I&#8217;m inspired by so many things. I&#8217;m inspired by the earth, by being outside and seeing that there are these trees and birds and animals and life is happening and we&#8217;ve got to make this place for everyone to be able to really fully engage and do it. So I&#8217;m inspired by a lot of things. CGD: Well that&#8217;s a prolife position. PH: What do you mean? CGD: That&#8217;s a prolife position. PH: Oh, yeah. CGD: Yeah, that if you&#8217;re inspired by the universe and have people be their best self. PH: Yeah, that&#8217;s just&#8212;exactly. That&#8217;s why the prochoice/prolife thing doesn&#8217;t really work. I&#8217;ve never met anyone who&#8217;s not into life generally. I mean everyone&#8217;s into it. [Laughs] Yeah, people are into life. But I feel so fortunate to be in service to this organization. It is not an everyday thing, it doesn&#8217;t happen every day to people like me, and it&#8217;s an honor, it&#8217;s a really big honor, so I&#8217;m lucky. CGD: Well I guess we should wrap it up. Is there&#8217;s anything that we haven&#8217;t covered that you want to add or make sure that we include? PH: No. CGD: Okay, all right. Thank you, Paris. PH: Thank you...
