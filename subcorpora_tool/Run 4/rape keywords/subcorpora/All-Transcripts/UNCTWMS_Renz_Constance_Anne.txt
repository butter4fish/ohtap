 Wendy Tapia: Alright, so we are here today with Ms. Connie Renz at the Outpatient Treatment Site for the UNC Horizons Program, and this interview is conducted by Wendy Tapia and we will be discussing Connie Renz&#8217;s involvement with the UNC Horizons Program. Alright, Ms. Renz, can you give me a little bit of background of where you&#8217;re from? Connie Renz: I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and grew up there and went to Duke for undergraduate, political science, and then to UNC for my Master&#8217;s in Social Work. WT: Can you tell us about your parents? CR: My parents were--my father was an engineer, and he worked for Westinghouse, and he was very involved in his work, and my mother was, though she had a Master&#8217;s from Chatham College, there in Pittsburgh, she, like most women, middle class women of that time she stayed home as a homemaker. And they had three children. I&#8217;m the youngest of three girls and my mother was probably my primary person in terms of who I looked to in the family. And she was a very creative woman. She was not interested in being a--so much as a socialite person that may have been required with my father&#8217;s job in the corporation. So, she did volunteer work, some, but primarily what she did was garden and paint, and she loved doing that. Some of my greatest memories of her are listening to symphonies and painting in one of the bedrooms. She was a very talented and strong person. WT: So that&#8217;s interesting that your mom has this, like, very educated background, but yet she was a homemaker. How did she influence your perception of women&#8217;s roles? CR: Well, you know, I think probably that she, she did what--she did the things that she really wanted to do, which was to paint and to garden, and that she put her foot down about doing other things that were expected of her that she really didn&#8217;t want to be involved in. So I think this just the sense of knowing who you are and what you love doing and saying, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to do it,&#8217; even though the expectations may be different, I think was how she influenced me. She was not a very political person. My family was a very conservative Republican family. I never was. I was considered sort of different in the family and a concern to them, actually, because I of course grew up during the fifties and sixties, and I was very involved in political issues and things that they didn&#8217;t--didn&#8217;t necessarily understand. And in fact they sent me to Duke--it was my last choice as it turns out, and I&#8217;d gotten my other choices--but they wanted me to go south because they thought that I&#8217;d be safer there and that I&#8217;d get into less trouble. And my mother&#8217;s family was from the South, from Virginia, so they felt that Duke would be--help me be a lady. So I don&#8217;t think in the political sense she was ever into the Women&#8217;s Liberation Movement so much, though she did, I think, pretty much what she wanted to do. But she had that strength of, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to do what I enjoy.&#8217; WT: Mm-hm. Can you tell me about the movements you were involved in, in the 50s and 60s? CR: Well, before I left for college I was very much into the anti-war, though not doing anything. I was in school and studying a lot, but I was very much interested in that, and I did volunteer work and worked with some of the poorer families in parts of Pittsburgh. And I don&#8217;t know how I got involved in that. I know the family wasn&#8217;t totally happy with it, but I did do that. But it&#8217;s when I went to Duke that I really got interested, and in the Women&#8217;s Liberation Movement and other political issues, particularly the anti-war issues, and got involved in activities at Duke. You know, Duke is very different place than it was when I went. When I went there was a lot of change and interest in the world, and we were very involved in that. I was involved with the Y there, which was one of the more activist of the organizations, and there was--there were a lot of movements going on then: Civil Rights, as well as the anti-war and then Women&#8217;s Liberation. And I was real interested in all of those, and, you know, participated in various demonstrations and such, you know, went to D.C. and--for the anti-war Vietnam march--and did things on campus at, at the college. WT: Can you tell me why you decided to major in political science? CR: I was so interested in politics and change, social change, and I, and back then, that was actually an area of study. For example, when I went on to get my Master&#8217;s in Social Work, I was real interested in community organizing, and they actually--that was actually a concentration that they offered. That&#8217;s no longer the case, of course, but back then, there was much interest in social change and what that was about, so political science was--fit well for me. WT: Mm-hm. So did you go straight into the School of Social Work? CR: I did. WT: Right after your--. CR: I did. WT: --undergraduate? How was it different? Like how was the ambient different at UNC in comparison to Duke? CR: I can&#8217;t say it was that different. You know, in graduate school I was not much involved with the undergraduates, and I was very involved with my field placements, and one was in Raleigh working with a social change organization, and then the other was at the YWCA in Durham, where I lived. And that was working on women&#8217;s issues, and it was all about develop--we developed a town hall for women, and we had, like, 150 women come to this. You know, looking at women&#8217;s health issues, women&#8217;s sexuality, women in work, domestic violence. It was a very exciting placement, and so I was really focused on that. WT: So, in 1978 you became the director of the Durham-Orange Coalition for Battered Women? Can you tell me about the experiences that led up to that job? CR: Yeah, yeah. Well, I, after I got my M.S.W., I got my first job in Greensboro. That was not a happy experience. WT: Where, where was that? CR: At the Department of Social Services, and then I came back to Durham, Department of Social Services and Child Protective Services, and though I really enjoyed that job, most of my energy and interest was going to volunteer work after work hours, where we were continuing to organize around domestic violence. And by that time that was the issue that was of most interest to me. And I was on the board of the YWCA in Durham, and we really worked to begin organizing in the community about this. Well, at the same time that we were doing that in Durham--this was in 1977, &#8217;76, &#8216;77--folks over here at UNC, and they were predominantly mental health folks--Dr. Elaine Carmen, Kit&#8230; um, this will come to me [laughter], it will come to me--but anyway, therapists from here had organized for Erin Pizzey to come over from England, and Erin Pizzey was sort of the mother of the domestic violence movement in England, and somehow they had her coming over here to speak. And I think they had also invited Murray Straus down, who was a sociologist, who at that time was beginning his interest in domestic violence, and they had a meeting with the town council and other folks to somehow talk about this issue. Well, all of us who were organizing in Durham came to this, and then we invited those people to come because we had organized at the same time to have this workshop in April of 1977 called the Battered Women Y--to have this workshop in Durham. And we I now had issues--workshops under the dynamics and legal issues and organizing where do we go from here. And so, some of those folks came over to our workshop. And then we all began meeting together because we realized of course that there were only, like, maybe eight women on each, in each, community that were really interested in this, and we decided to start meeting together, and we called ourselves the YWCA--because some of us were on the board there, and we wanted to have the--particularly if we were going to apply for grants we needed a non-profit that could be who we could be--Coalition, which meant, actually, the Coalition of Durham and Orange--at that time--for Battered Women. And so, that was the first name that we had and it was really a group of probably about ten women who were--came from different backgrounds: one, Kit Munson, who was a therapist; one was a lawyer, Sandra Johnson, who helped draft the first 1979 domestic violence law that required the police to respond to domestic violence calls, where, they had, apparently in their heads, the discretion not to. They didn&#8217;t want to back then. So, we had a lawyer. We had other people just from--just who were interested in women&#8217;s issues. And we began meeting to decide what were the services that we needed, what was the direction we would take, where--what should we focus on. And it was--I&#8217;ll tell you what was very exciting about it, and probably the most powerful thing in my life, was that here is a group of women who didn&#8217;t get anybody&#8217;s permission to develop something to say, &#8216;There is a need. There is an injustice here happening. There has to be a change. There have to be services delivered,&#8217; and we made it happen, you know? And it, and it started out with committed people, and that&#8217;s--and I know that&#8217;s how social change does begin in many, many instances. So, it was a very powerful experience. So, we both started out then with educational things to make this an issue in the community, get more people involved, and then decide where we were going to go with things. And at that time some funding did become available through the North Carolina Council for Women to fund some domestic violence projects in the state, and so we applied under the YWCA, and I applied to be the director. And I took the job. And it was very exciting. WT: So why in particular did domestic violence appeal to you? CR: Um, [pause] you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s--I don&#8217;t know exactly why. It&#8217;s not that I came from a family of where my father hit my mother. That didn&#8217;t, that never happened as far as I know. I had a sister who bullied me. I&#8217;m certainly aware about that, but I don&#8217;t know why that, that became such an important issue to me, but it did. And I think partly, I did see, for example, women in my child protective services caseload who were being battered, so, and I was very aware of the position that they were in, that they were being held accountable for the man&#8217;s violence. And they were losing a lot. They were losing not only their safety, but their children, because they supposedly couldn&#8217;t control this man&#8217;s violence. And, and that&#8217;s a terrible injustice. And, so I guess I was aware of that on a professional level, too. And of course that movement was beginning to grow, and it was one of the, you know, first movements coming out of the Women&#8217;s Movement. There was rape crisis of course, but I was not as involved with that, and then there was domestic violence. And it really mattered to me. WT: So can you describe your role as the first Executive Director? CR: Well, well, it was working with the board, the Y Board. It involved training volunteers because our first effort was to develop a twenty-four-hour crisis line. And so, we needed to train volunteers, and I&#8217;ve always loved training, so that, that appealed to me a lot. So, we trained volunteers who--and developed, actually it was something like a thirty- or forty-hour training, pretty extensive--to [knock at door] have women. Yeah? [Recorder is turned off and then back on] WT: Okay. CR: To train women to be volunteers on the crisis line. And we hooked ourselves up with Hassle House, which was--had also developed a lot by the same types of people from Duke--and it was a 24-hour crisis line. It was called Hassle House. And they agreed to be our answering service, and then call--&#8216;cause we didn&#8217;t have enough people over the phone lines to, to, to deal with that at that point, and so, we did that in Durham, and then over here in Orange County we worked with--it was, it was, there was another crisis line that was over here that we worked with. And so, we worked on developing those first services, and continuing to do a lot of public speaking and outreach to people to get more and more people involved. WT: So can you tell me what the most pressing issues at the agency were at the beginning? CR: I think at the beginning it was mainly organization building and that was, you know, getting the policies and procedures in place so that we could, one, answer to the granting organization about what we were doing and document that we were successful. It was developing the training piece for the volunteers. It was developing who was the policy making board. And I do remember there was a struggle as there certainly was early on in the Women&#8217;s Movement, around women&#8217;s leadership and hierarchy versus everybody having a vote that was equal. And so there was, there was a lot of discussion and issues around that. But it was organization building. You know, developing who we were, how it was run, regular meetings, who was the board, how were we going to deal with various issues that came up as we grew. And we did grow pretty fast. WT: Where was the first agency located? Did it have its own center or did it operate off of other agencies? CR: We were out of the YWCA, so that was our primary place, was the Y. And we did also have a space over here because as it turned out, we moved pretty quickly to get some kind of shelter going. And we did one in Durham that was pretty much a, a disaster and a good learning experience, which is we had friends in the City Council because we soon applied for city and county money, too, so--and United Way money, in both counties. And we rented--we got to know someone in the City Council, and was somehow able to rent some city apartments, apartments for one dollar for a year, and we didn&#8217;t have the staffing to staff it, but we let women stay there. And of course, things happened as you can imagine do happen when there&#8217;s no staff. And, but then we moved to over here, to a shelter over here, and this was--talk about strange bedfellows--this was on, Roberson, actually, in Chapel Hill, where the Interfaith Council had a shelter for homeless men. So we, for some reason they were--part of it was going out of business so they gave it to us, but we had to still house homeless men in the back. So if you can imagine we had a shelter for battered women in the front, and then, and then there was a door, and in the back there were like six bunk-beds for homeless men who came there at night. So we of course worked with a lot of other agencies to help us survive, you know, and really build. And so you have strange bedfellows sometimes when that happens. And then of course later we got the shelter that&#8217;s still over in Durham. WT: Mm-hm. CR: And this was one closed down. WT: The one in Orange County. Can you tell me about the community&#8217;s response to the agency? CR: Well, I think the Y was really supportive. They were energized by all these young activist women coming in, also probably a little bit, &#8216;Yikes, who are these folks?&#8217; But some of them were on our board, and actually were wonderful resources for us in terms of funding applications because they knew how to do things that we didn&#8217;t know how to do. We had mixed responses from the police. We, we certainly approached the police and worked with them. Eventually it got to the point where we, we were training new police officers coming in, but, we had some difficult interactions with the police at different times, who would, we would have to ask--when they refused to go out to help somebody--if we could talk to their supervisor, and explained, &#8216;Are you aware about the new law that says that you really do need to respond?&#8217; And so, we were irritating to some people. We did a lot of advocacy in the courts, and I think there were mixed reactions to that. I remember one judge, who fortunately retired fairly soon after we got there, who was, um, dealing with one of our cases, and the woman had been assaulted in her living room by her boyfriend. And at the end, he found the man guilty, but he said to her, &#8220;You must be one of those woman who like a little violence with your sex.&#8221; I mean, the whole room was totally silent, you know, it was--but he was--that was the attitude of a lot of people, you know, and there a very--blaming of women. There were still billboards up that said, and this was supposed to be a joke, of course, &#8220;On Friday nights&#8221;--it was a bowling lane on Highway 70, &#8220;On Friday nights come beat your wife at bowling.&#8221; And the whole, it was supposed to be funny, you know, but that kind of thing was typical. So we would see--we would respond to those things, write to the newspapers. We went to the county for funding, and I remember Howard Easley was on the--he was this sort of crotchety person, he was the County Commissioner, and he, he really, gave it to us when we gave our report, um, and reason for asking for money. And he was incredibly rude and off-base. And I remember writing a letter to the editor in response to him, and then getting a check from his wife who was a OB at the Durham Women&#8217;s Clinic, you know, as a contribution to the Coalition for Battered Women [laughter]. So, but he was known for being crotchety. But we had, we, we had mixed, you know, really mixed responses from people, but that&#8217;s how we learn how to really advocate, and to stand up for ourselves, you know, and actually do better by the women, of course. So, for example, we would know which, which magistrates at the different places were sympathetic to the women, and which would give them a hard time and probably not help them. You know, so we&#8217;d know individual people, and, and were really clear about who we had difficulty with. WT: Can you tell me about the agency&#8217;s initial plans? Like how did you build a rapport, to where women could come in and feel comfortable to use your services? And maybe an estimate of how many women came in the first year. CR: Gosh, I don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s hard for me to know--remember. Well, I think women felt comfortable calling. We certainly got a lot of calls, but I, you know, I can&#8217;t, I really can&#8217;t give you accurate figures. Um, and I think that people felt comfortable because we were extremely welcoming, and we went out of our way, obviously, to help women. We put them up in motels, too, as a matter of fact, and got some motel owners to let us do that, and we would go meet them at motels, and, you know, work with them, and help them with stuff. I think people came to know about us because we had--we were involved in all the various systems that battered women use. WT: Okay. CR: So that people began to know about us. WT: Systems like what? CR: The police, the hospitals, the courts, attorneys--all people that at some point might see a woman--the churches. We would talk to people in the churches. We did a lot of fund-raiding efforts to get support. Ands as I said, we also went to all the United Ways and all the city councils and the county commissioners. And those are a lot of people who know a lot of other people. And so, it would be--there would be articles in the paper we&#8217;d get in, things like that. We opened a new shelter. That was a big thing. We started a men&#8217;s program. That was a big thing. Where we could use that for publicity purposes and get, you know, people to know what we were about. WT: Can you tell me about the men&#8217;s program? CR: Well, the men&#8217;s program started, it was called the Change Program. I think it was in 1982, maybe, that we had a graduate student from the School of Social Work. I had gone to the school, and so I was a field instructor. And it&#8217;s a great way to get students to come and, and, work with you. And we had a student, Fred Stang, who came and worked with us on helping look at that issue. And then we hired him. We got money to hire him to develop the Change Program, which was very court-based. It--so that if a man was facing assault charges, he could be ordered to go to the Change Program. WT: Can you tell me about your job experiences after the Orange-Durham--? CR: I was the director of the Orange-Durham Coalition for six years. And by the way, we incorporated and separated from the Y at some point. And, you know, the Y eventually stopped in Durham. Which was very sad. But, I left in I guess it was &#8217;86. And I had had my first child that last year, and this work was the love of my life. And, I, I did it all the time, you know. Day and night. You know, I&#8217;d get home from work, and I&#8217;d--volunteers would call, and I&#8217;d, and we&#8217;d be consulting on cases that came in. You know, it was just a--it was a very demanding job, and I worked all the time. And when my first son was born I--it, it came to a point where I, I--it was too much for me. So I became--worked in the Field Education Office at the UNC School of Social Work, and, part-time, and I got to teach two courses in institutional discrimination and their first course on family violence, which I absolutely loved because it was a chance to make sure that content is in, in the School of Social Work. Because anybody who&#8217;s coming out as a social worker, theoretically they&#8217;re supposed to be going out and working with public populations, but it doesn&#8217;t matter public or private; they&#8217;re going to meet families where there&#8217;s domestic violence, and they need to know what that&#8217;s about and how to respond. And, so it was great, and I taught that for fifteen years, even after I went on to other jobs because I really loved it, and it was a great course to teach. It was fun. So, I did that for three years, I think, and then I worked part-time. I was the first director of Welcome Baby. And Welcome Baby is, was a primary prevention project. Basically it was set up out of the Mental Health Center in Durham to work with first-time moms, and provide services and support--and volunteer-based. And because of my volunteer experience and training and using volunteers and beginning organizations. I, I think that&#8217;s why I was hired. So, for two years I developed Welcome Baby. And that also was part-time. And continued to teach at the school. And then, I had my second child during that time, too, so then I left there after two years, and worked on the Duke Child Protection Team, and that was doing sex abuse evaluation for young children. And I did that for three years. And that was also part time, thirty hours. And that worked well with, with my family and my interests in child protection and in women&#8217;s issues. And then I--someone talked to me about this job. And this was with Horizons, and it was a grant that was first offered with state and federal money by the state office to work with pregnant women who use drugs and alcohol. Now, that developed out of the fact that we knew that a lot of infant mortality--which in 1989, North Carolina had the highest infant mortality in the nation. And they knew one of the reasons was prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol. So, the state wanted to look at that issue, and brought down a researcher who studied it some down here and, in fact, showed, yes, indeed, a lot of the women, you know, are using drugs during pregnancy, and also showed that most of the treatment centers won&#8217;t accept women who are pregnant. And, so that even if a woman wanted to get treatment, she wouldn&#8217;t be able to. So, the state said, alright, we&#8217;re going set up some special programming. We&#8217;re not going to--heretofore, all substance abuse money went through the area mental health centers. There were forty in the state. This time, they said we&#8217;re going open it up to people who apply for this special population of pregnant women because they knew pregnant women did not go to the mental health centers for treatment. But we did know that they would go, usually at least one time, to see an OB before delivery. And that the, the pre-natal clinic might be a safer place for a woman to talk about certain issues. So, different people organized. There was a planning grant for the community to organize around it, and most of the grants that came in were really strong in the, in the medical side, that the pre-natal people were very interested in getting some services for this population. So, UNC here, OBGYN applied, then the Health Department in Raleigh. I mean most of them had a health base to them. And those people got the, the grants that begin. So, we were one of the four who got it. And when they got the grant, then they, they wanted to get a director. And someone asked me to apply, and I did, and they hired me. And I think they hired me--I mean, I know they hired me because I had started organizations before. And I knew about building organizations. And, so--and I was also interested in women&#8217;s issues, but I hadn&#8217;t had as much background in the substance abuse as in violence and in children protection. So, I, there was some learning to do there. But it has been fabulous. WT: And so you&#8217;ve been here since 1993? CR: Mm-hm. WT: Can you tell me about your role here? CR: Well, as director, I mean, of course, it&#8217;s changed over the years &#8216;cause we went from, like, two people, to now we have like, you know, like thirty-five people. And we have two residential programs, and we have another site up in Burlington. So we&#8217;ve obviously grown from a grant of, like, four hundred thousand, to almost three million. So we&#8217;ve grown and we&#8217;ve built a program that we really believe makes a difference. And so it works with pregnant women and also now mothers. So, you don&#8217;t have to be pregnant to, to get help here. You can be a mother. Or in fact you can be a woman who is not pregnant or a mother. But, we really focus on generally the mom, and, and the children together. And so, that&#8217;s been a great thing to watch that piece develop because that was a critical piece. It was very much like, when I talk to people about this. When we were first developing, here we were, all these young feminists, all single women. You know, we make this shelter happen, and these women come in, and, lo and behold, [knock at door]. I can&#8217;t talk right now. Unidentified associate: Okay. CR: We were all these single feminist women, and so we started these shelters. And then these women would come in, and, lo and behold, their children came with them, and we&#8217;d look at them like, &#8216;Oh my god, what do we do with you?&#8217; [Laughter] We had no, our, our whole focus had been on working with this woman. And we didn&#8217;t have a really good idea of what the needs of the children would be, or how important that relationship would be in her recovery. And it was sort of like that in some ways with the substance abuse treatment for women, is the lack of understanding of her need for the children and that relationship. So, there was a learning curve there. And I&#8217;ll give you an example. When we first started, we would send women to some treatment programs, residential programs, before we had a residence. And they would, with their infants, and they would say, &#8220;Well, she&#8217;s going to be in treatment from seven in the morning to eleven at night. You know, we have something for her because a busy addict is a happy addict.&#8221; These are direct quotes. And, and we&#8217;d say, well, but, you know, she&#8217;s nursing, and she&#8217;s going to be up at night with the baby, and we really want her to have time with the infant. Well, it was like they didn&#8217;t know what the heck we were going to do with these children. And it&#8217;s really one of our goals that we have to help nurture that relationship. And yes, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. As it turns out, that&#8217;s key to her recovery, and to making it work for her. So, it&#8217;s been beautiful to watch the, the child component grow. We have five-star licensed childcare center here. All the children receive a tremendous amount of services. And we focus very heavily on the mom&#8217;s relationship with her child, and feeling comfortable and competent in that role. And dealing with whatever guilt they have about how they were not as good parents as they need to be when they were in the act of addiction. So that's, that&#8217;s been beautiful to see. WT: Sounds like it. Part of UNC Horizons&#8217; mission states that, quote, &#8220;The agency strives to improve community response and service collaboration for pregnant women and mothers with substance use issues.&#8221; End quote. Can you tell me about this stigma you&#8217;re trying to change? CR: Mm-kay. I think, probably--you know I certainly was very aware of stigma with battered women. The tremendous blame that they received just because they were battered women. Well, the stigma and the discrimination against women who use substances is, is terrible. As bad, or worse, where there is this great condemnation of her, and how she&#8217;s hurting her child, how she&#8217;s deserving of the bad things that happen to her because she shouldn&#8217;t be drinking. I mean, and there&#8217;s a long history, of course, showing, you know--when you see a woman drinking on the street, and, you know not in control of herself--of saying, you know, &#8216;She deserves what she gets,&#8217; or &#8216;She must be a prostitute,&#8217; or whatever it is. And then, of course when it involves an infant or a fetus, there&#8217;s this even greater condemnation, because motherhood is to be this sacred thing that only the worst women would, you know, not do as they should. So, I think that is the stigma that is really, really one we continue to fight again, and again, and again. So, part of our role was, has been, to outreach to all the people who might provide to her, and talk with them about what addiction is about what addiction is about for women. I mean, how they get involved in it, what keeps them in it, what are the things that prevent them from recovering, so that they have a much more empathetic understanding of what this is about. So that they&#8217;re not, they&#8217;re more willing to, give her a hand like they would someone else with a major problem, and--as opposed to judging her. And I can give you an example. We used to go to nurseries up in the hospitals, unnamed hospitals, and ask, you know, nurses, let&#8217;s say in the NICUs that--you know how did they feel about our patients, and women who had used and their babies were now in the NICU. Even if the mom&#8217;s use had nothing to do with why the baby was in the NICU. Well, I mean, they could say, you know, very clearly how angry they were at these women, and that it would translate into behaviors, like not welcoming her home when she came in. You know, like another woman, she might say, &#8216;Oh, Mary, come over and see what Frankie&#8217;s doing today. And I want to show you this.&#8217; They wouldn&#8217;t necessarily do that, because they would assume she didn&#8217;t care, she shouldn&#8217;t have done what she did. It was a very punitive response, which we all understand because we all have some of those feelings, but when we&#8217;re professionals, you need to be aware of those feelings, and then make sure that you&#8217;re doing what your role is, which is to help this woman take a different road. Or they wouldn&#8217;t give her information, or necessarily share things with her that they would with a woman who was not using and a mother of her infant in the NICU. So, we know that people really need to look at some of their attitudes. And, and when you ask anyone, &#8216;How do you feel about let&#8217;s say a eight-month-old pregnant woman, you know, smoking? You know, how do you feel?&#8217; We want people to talk about how they feel and what are their--what are they thinking when they see that. And, and, they become more aware of, &#8216;Wow, they say she&#8217;s stupid, where she&#8217;s been, how ignorant can you be?&#8217; Or, you know, &#8216;I can&#8217;t have a baby and here she gets to have a baby, and she can&#8217;t even, you know, take care of this baby.&#8217; That, that those are normal things that, in our culture, brought up in our culture, that we&#8217;re going to feel and think. But then we have to go beyond that if we&#8217;re going to be helpers for someone who&#8217;s making some changes in this area, to how we can be helpful to her, and to understand what&#8217;s going on with her that that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s doing. Now of course, as it turns out, and this is how the circle goes around, one of the primary issues for women in substance addictions is trauma. You know, they have been child sexual abuse survivors, rape victims, battering victims, and that&#8217;s a major way that women cope with trauma, and learn how to manage, PTSD symptoms is to, to zone out, you know, to numb out. And that&#8217;s a major piece of what&#8217;s going on for many of the women that we work with. So, I mean it was like really, for me, a circle coming around. WT: So, why, why do the substance abuse issues happen? What in society creates these problems, and why is it so difficult for women to come out of them? CR: Well, why they create them is of course, one - a lot of it&#8217;s learned behavior. If they see their parents or people in their community deal with life and life&#8217;s problems by drinking, then, you know, like other behaviors, you know, that&#8217;s what they may decide to do, too. And, in fact, see it as normal, fine, okay, as long as you don&#8217;t do certain things. And then, though, if they become hooked, then really addicted to it, then they&#8217;ve got major problems. So it may be the learned behavior. And we can see that everywhere. When someone dies, someone says, &#8216;Oh, give her a Valium, you know, so she can sleep tonight.&#8217; Or, &#8216;she needs a stiff drink,&#8217; so she can manage those feelings. I mean, it&#8217;s a very common thing for us to do is to take a pill or a drug or alcohol as a way of dealing with an emotion that&#8217;s uncomfortable or painful. And, so there&#8217;s that culturally going on, and then if it&#8217;s happening in your homes, behaviorally, you see it and you have access to it, then you&#8217;re likely to use that as a way. Now, and you&#8217;ll see this with our women who have been sexually abused as children, when you ask them at what age they started taking alcohol or a drug, and you know, six, eight, ten. You know, what&#8217;s going on that a child would be doing that at that age? What&#8217;s happening in that family that they have, one, access to it, but that that is seen as something&#8217;s going on that they need that. So, a large part of it is that it&#8217;s how our society tends to cope with things, is through taking pills. And you know pills, now, is the major addiction we&#8217;re dealing with. Opiate addiction, now, is number one here. And it&#8217;s pills prescribed by doctors, you know, for pain, or for anxiety. So, that was the answer to the one question, and then how is it hard to get out of. Well, the unfortunate thing that happens is that it is, it is a process. You know, you don&#8217;t become an addict just like that. It takes time. But over time, if she&#8217;s beginning to rely more and more on this drug to help her make it through the day, or it&#8217;s part, by now, probably most of the people in her life are people who are using, and she avoids people who don&#8217;t use. So, she&#8217;s becoming more and more part of that world. And when she does that, what she&#8217;s doing is eventually neglecting her responsibilities. So, because you have to think of the time it takes for her to find the drug. Okay, so most women don&#8217;t go to dealers. They go to other people they know. So you&#8217;ve got to see if Tommy, you know, is home, and if he has the stuff. And now you might have to wait for him to call back, and, or whatever it is. Or you have to go over to Uncle Joe&#8217;s, but you don&#8217;t have a car, so you&#8217;ve got to find a way to get over there, right. Or, you need the money to buy it from Uncle Joe, so you have to steal. So you have to go to a place and figure out, is this a safe place to steal from, so I can get, you know, some money in order to pay someone for that. Or do they sell themselves for sex to get the money, or the drug itself, to, to pay for it, at some point. So, to find the drug, in itself, takes time for somebody. Then, you got to get prepared to use it. You got to figure out where your children are going to be. And the children are an important issue to the moms because they want--don&#8217;t want the kids to see them high, or be around them high, so they have to find someone who will watch them or take care of them. So, they&#8217;re trying to do their roles right, but of course, you know, it never really works out in the end, but they try. And so, they have to get a place for the kids. They&#8217;ve got to make sure that it&#8217;s a safe place, &#8216;cause they know that if they&#8217;re out there using, they&#8217;re going to be more likely to be assaulted, or robbed, or whatever. So, women bring their stuff home, and use at home alone. This is not, by this time, a happy event, you know, where you&#8217;re--get all--everybody&#8217;s getting drunk. This is bringing stuff home and using it at home alone. Because it&#8217;s not safe to do it out there, or you need to be with your kids. So, she is spending time, then using. And then she has to recover from using, and anybody&#8217;s who&#8217;s ever had a hangover knows that, you know, the next day, sometimes, is a waste. There&#8217;s a lost day. You can&#8217;t do the things you planned on doing because you feel terrible. So, the same for them, it&#8217;s a lost day. And then after that, you have to repair all the obligations that you screwed up on the day that you lost, you know, by calling your friend at church, and saying, &#8220;I know I said I was going meet you there. I&#8217;m sorry, but&#8230;&#8217; you know, and then you make up some reason why you couldn&#8217;t be there. Or you didn&#8217;t go to Sunday lunch at your mom&#8217;s because you were throwing up in the bathroom, and so you had to tell mom where you were and why you weren&#8217;t there. And so, really it&#8217;s a huge amount of time when it really has become something that you need in order to feel you can make it through life. And so, when you look at it all, we really base recovery on looking at women&#8217;s psychological development coming out of the Stone Center: that women develop in, in relationship with others. And that they feel their high self-esteem and a sense of power if they&#8217;re doing their relationships the way they think they should. So, how you might imagine it is to be a daughter, a good daughter, may be different than for me. For you, it might be telephoning home every day. For me, it might be once a month. It would, you know, it depends on the family you&#8217;re in and how you were brought up. So, all these relationships women have that they judge themselves by. When they&#8217;re in the act of addiction--and we do this with the women in the groups. What happens? Well, you violate all those relationships. You do things that you wouldn&#8217;t do if you were sober. You steal from your parents. You lie to your boyfriend. You stop seeing your friends who don&#8217;t use. You put your children to bed early, so you can use. You, you know, you don&#8217;t go--you go into work late. So, all these violations are happening, and that&#8217;s the source of all this guilt and shame, which is really a barrier to recovery. Now, guilt&#8217;s important, just like anger, in a way, because it tells you, &#8216;You know there&#8217;s something wrong here. Something&#8217;s going on that&#8217;s wrong, and you got to figure it out.&#8217; The shame, though, that sense of, &#8216;I&#8217;m a bad person, and I really deserve nothing because I do these bad things,&#8217; is where a lot of the women end up. And a lot of that&#8217;s reinforced of course by everybody else around her, who at this time are very sick of her and very angry with her. And so, there&#8217;s a lot of shame being sent her way, so that we&#8217;ll have women actually say, you know, this one woman who was eight months pregnant, her boyfriend beat her up, and she said, &#8220;Well, everybody knows that using crack cocaine is a bad thing to do when you&#8217;re pregnant, so I really deserved it.&#8221; So, I mean, the thinking is now, &#8216;I am a piece of dirt. You know, I shouldn&#8217;t expect more. I should expect people to hate me. I shouldn&#8217;t expect that I could ever trust them, or that they&#8217;d ever help me.&#8217; And so that is one of the major barriers to someone getting out. That, and the fact, if they can&#8217;t be in a safe environment. You can&#8217;t recover if you aren&#8217;t safe. And by safe I mean safe not only from people beating you up or being emotionally abusive, but safe from people offering you drugs, or, you go home and there are drugs all over the house. So that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to have residential programs for women who have really lost many things, and their child relationships are in jeopardy, to have a really safe place where they can go, where they know no one&#8217;s going to beat them up, emotionally abuse them, or offer them drugs or alcohol. And they, they can begin recovery at that point. And then, what we&#8217;re working on is rebuilding some of those relationships, starting with themselves and their children, so that they can have a sense of &#8216;I can do this.&#8217; WT: So when they&#8217;re taking part in the residential program are their kids there with them? CR: Mm-hm. WT: And what does the residential program? Is it, like, a shelter type? Or is it--? CR: They have their own apartment. WT: Mm-kay. CR: Which is fabulous because that, of course, means they&#8217;re being given back a fair amount of responsibility. Because they have not been in the driver&#8217;s seat with their kids. And we want to move them from the kids, from them bargaining with the kids, promising the kids, bribing the kids, ignoring the kids, neglecting the kids, yelling at the kids, to a mom who is in the driver&#8217;s seat, who says, &#8216;My role is to create an environment that my child can grow in.&#8217; And that means he has to know what the limits are in this environment, and what, and what mommy will allow and what mommy won&#8217;t allow. And, &#8216;I&#8217;m in control.&#8217; That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working with, with the mom during the year she&#8217;s here. So, they&#8217;re here a year, and it&#8217;s a very structured environment, so we have--and by that I mean there&#8217;s supervision twenty-four-seven. So, there&#8217;s a lot of, there are a lot of people helping her stay safe. And, you know, in early recovery she might be craving a great deal, and does not need to be tempted by anything, so it&#8217;s very important to keep her in a supervised situation, so that--until she can trust herself. You know, that she can manage it. And then working with her during that time. Now, so, she has her own apartment, with her children. She, for the first six months, the children either go to our licensed childcare center, which is on-site, or to the local public schools, and then, she comes up to this site here, the treatment site, and is here most of the day, in different kinds of classes, learning about different kinds of materials. And, in the evening she goes home, Sunday through Thursday, for sure, and she learns how to do a routine at home. Which is, you know: kids get home, getting them dinner, baths, reading, and to bed at a regular time. And that is scary to most of them. By this time, they&#8217;d rather go to an NA meeting at night than have to be home with their children and managing them because they feel kind of like they&#8217;re not good at it. And the children are pretty--can be difficult in some ways. So, um--but that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s working on, and we&#8217;re helping her work on. So she goes to NA AA meetings that are taught Friday and Saturday nights, or during the week, but not, not at, in the evenings when we really want her to establish a routine so that these kids go to bed on time, she goes to bed on time. She learns to have a regular life. &#8216;Cause you understand before this, she gets here, and the people who are getting here are referred primarily by courts and child protective services. There have been lots of losses. There have been arrests. There have been CPS taking their kids. They&#8217;ve been fired from jobs. They&#8217;ve been put out on the street. You know, they&#8217;ve had health problems that they haven&#8217;t dealt with in years. So, I mean there&#8217;s a lot of business that needs to be tended to. And, and, learning how to be back on a routine that&#8217;s regular, safe. So that&#8217;s what we work on for that year. WT: So, what about the services that the children receive? CR: All the children have--we have private providers come in about a month after they get here. And the reason we do that--we did it initially at the beginning--and they were pretty much un-testable, &#8216;cause they don&#8217;t sit down and follow directions, and, you know, these kids had been from here and there--you know, had some issues. So after a month of routine, they&#8217;re in much better shape to be screened for different things. So, we screen for speech and language, OT, PT. They have developmentals and psychiatric interviews, and of course medical. And we find that the majority have speech and language issues, delays of some sort, and we really think that has a lot to do with them not being talked to very much. You know, or they being with different people. They may not have been with the mom for the first six months before she got in here. They may have been in foster care, or they may have been with another family member. But we really work with the women on talking to infants. A lot of them were not parented well, and they, they don&#8217;t know about goo-goo-ing and talking to infants, you know. And that is a way that the infant learns how to communicate and coo back and, and talk. And so, we suspect that&#8217;s one of, one of the factors. And then there may be other problems that they&#8217;re having. Some of them may have problems with muscle tone, with sucking responses. Some, the very little ones, newborns, particularly if their moms had been on Suboxone, which is like methadone, have to detox, and so there is withdrawal. And other ones who are not on the opiates may have, still have, some of the effects of being really startled by bright lights or large noises. So we work with them on learning how to swaddle the babies, keep them in calm environments, not a lot of loud noises. Don&#8217;t expect them to be able to look you in the eyes for very long, and that when they turn away, that&#8217;s their way of saying, &#8216;That&#8217;s enough for now.&#8217; Don&#8217;t take it personally. You know, that&#8217;s a baby&#8217;s way of stopping a conversation for a little while and regrouping. And it&#8217;s sort of regulating their emotions. So we have those therapist language, OTPT, come here on-site and do their work with the children. We also got a grant so that they could come into the group and talk with the moms about what they&#8217;re doing with the children because we really want the moms to be able to know what&#8217;s happening with their children in therapy, and have a good sense of it, and also learn how to do some of those things themselves. And to see this person as a partner with their child instead of an enemy. Of course one of their first responses, often when they come is to feel defensive with the schoolteachers, I mean the nursery teachers. You know like, &#8216;You think you know my kid better,&#8217; or, &#8216;You think I&#8217;m a bad mom.&#8217; And so they&#8217;re hesitant to talk with them. We really want to change that over the period of the year, so that they see those folks as partners and not people who are going judge them or be critical of their children. And so, that&#8217;s part of what we do. The--some of the children have medical issue of course that we have to work on, or behavioral issues. The older ones that we have to work on. You know, PTSD is an issue for the children, too, because they&#8217;ve seen a lot in their, in their short time, and have some reactions to that, so some of them have individual therapy. We also have a psychotherapist who works with the mom and the child together around attachment issues, and really training the mom about infant language and development. WT: So staying on the topic of children, given your experiences, how have you raised your children to believe in women&#8217;s roles? CR: Well, that&#8217;s changing it a little, isn&#8217;t it? Well, I think both my sons are strong feminists. They look for strong women. They have had lots of conversations [laughter] about women&#8217;s issues, and listened to it for a long time. And I mean, I&#8217;ll give an example. Once I was driving them and a friend of theirs from a soccer game or something, and they whistled at this young girl out the car, out of the car. You know, and I stopped the car. And, we, we then sat and had a conversation about, you know, whistling at women, and how that person might feel. And, and what did they think about that? Of course, they got an idea of what I thought about it, but [laughter], you know, but we&#8217;ve always talked women&#8217;s issues. It&#8217;s always been a topic of conversation. WT: Do you consciously consider your work experience as part of the Women&#8217;s Movement? CR: Yes. WT: So, you, do you believe yourself a feminist? CR: I am a feminist. WT: And do you think that all of your future professional endeavors will center on women&#8217;s organizations? CR: Yeah, I do. I do. I mean, I think that&#8217;s been my passion my whole life. And I&#8217;ve been very lucky to be in the social work profession because that has allowed me to be in many different positions. You know, I&#8217;ve done, private individual work, you know, with counseling. And I&#8217;ve been able to do community organizing, teaching, I&#8217;ve been able to be an administrator. You know it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s been a--I&#8217;ve moved from, you know, hospital settings, or working with children in hospital settings, children in DSS custody, and then to children here, you know? Or women here, women in the shelter, so I think I&#8217;ve been lucky in that way. That I&#8217;ve been able to--that my work&#8217;s been my passion and I&#8217;ve been able to do it. I mean, some people don&#8217;t have that, and I just feel very lucky that I have, so&#8230; WT: Well, that about wraps it up. CR: Okay. WT: Thank you so much Ms. Renz for a fabulous interview. CR: You&#8217;re welcome...
