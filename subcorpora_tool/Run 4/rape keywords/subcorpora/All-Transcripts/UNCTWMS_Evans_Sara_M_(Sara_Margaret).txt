 Jennifer Dixon: Dr. Evans for the record and to test the machine, would you please state your full name and our location? Sara Evans: My name is Sara and we are at the Inn in Columbia, South Carolina on the University of South Carolina Campus. JD: Thank you. Ok I am interviewing Dr. Sara Evans and we&#8217;re in Columbia, South Carolina and I am Jennifer Dixon. And today is June 5th, 2009. Thank you very much Dr. Evans for taking the time to sit with me. SE: You&#8217;re welcome! JD: I want to talk to you a bit about your personal background. I read an interview you did with Kerry Taylor and I wanted to talk to you more about, you mentioned your father was a minister. SE: Yes. JD: And from what I gather, the sense that I get about your parents is that they were kind of progressive people even in the early 40s and 50s. SE: Yes. Yes. JD: And I wanted to talk to you about how their political action, their progressive attitude, how did that inform the kind of work that you do now and the kind of work that you&#8217;ve been doing all of these years? SE: Right. Well I don&#8217;t think I would have done any of that work if they hadn&#8217;t been. They did not think of themselves as political. They were addressing a moral issue. And my father--I probably told this story in the other interview--it was 1942, just a couple of blocks from here, Washington Street Methodist Church. And he was twenty-five years old. He grew up in Henderson, Southern Carolina. He was a student at Duke Divinity School and he had graduated from Duke Divinity School. And, you know, he just had this epiphany. He was reading Paul and Paul says, &#8220;God has made all men of one blood to dwell on the Earth in one peace.&#8221; And, &#8220;That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s it! That&#8217;s the answer! Here&#8217;s what we have to do!&#8221; And so the preacher&#8217;s out of town and he&#8217;s the associate pastor and he just preaches the Sunday sermon on the issue of race and he challenged the biological view on race. And he ended up with a challenge to the white primary because right over in Fort Jackson were black men who were going to go to Europe right then in World War II and give their lives for democracy when they couldn&#8217;t even vote. He was very na&#239;ve. He just thought, If people just get this, you know, read the Bible, think about reality, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s right. Well the sky fell in on him of course and they banned him from the pulpit and they sent him away to an itty-bitty town, McCormick. And so I was born in the parsonage in McCormick and I feel marked by this in a really good way. So, and you know when I was growing up this story was circulating around but I never put all the pieces together really until I was way into adulthood in 1994 when they invited him back, the first time he put foot in that pulpit again, for a service of reconciliation. And he preached that same sermon again. JD: Wow. SE: So I felt marked by that my whole life. Daddy was not a radical. He thought of himself as a moderate. His goal was to bring people together. He was able to listen to people say horrible things and try to listen in to what they were saying and reason them back out of it. My mother was a gut radical. She couldn&#8217;t be in that conversation because she would lose her cool and get very upset and she was trying hard to be a preacher&#8217;s wife, which was a bad fit for somebody with that kind of passion. And also more of an introvert. So I wouldn&#8217;t call my mother politically active but her commitments were deep about fairness. And so I remember in second grade in Clemson where daddy was the preacher at that point, I remember saying to my mother, &#8220;Well what do we think about segregation?&#8221; Because we&#8217;re talking--. All right maybe it was--no I think it was second grade. I think it would have been close to the time of Brown versus the Board. Maybe even fourth or fifth grade. But I remember saying, &#8220;What do we think?&#8221; And I do think it was before Brown versus the Board because when I heard about it, I knew what we thought. And she said, &#8220;We think it&#8217;s wrong.&#8221; Well, so from then on I thought it was wrong but I lived in a world of segregation, you know. I went to my [5:00] music lesson in downtown Columbia. We moved back here from &#8217;52 to &#8217;57. I remember getting on the bus and knowing that I was supposed to sit in the front and watching black people go to the back and knowing it was wrong. So sometimes I think I grew up knowing something deep about sin because people that I knew and loved, all my relatives, thought segregation was the way the world had to be. So that&#8217;s one piece of it. And when my father went to SMU as the campus chaplain, he was liberated. JD: SMU? SE: Sothern Methodist University in Dallas. I mean suddenly he had academic freedom and he talked about everything and he moved on issues gradually with the Vietnam War. We argued about that a lot. He moved on abortion. He became a part of the Clergy Consultation on Abortion doing abortion counseling in Texas before Roe v. Wade. And on gay rights, because he had a lesbian sister and when he really thought about it, he thought his way through on that issue. And once he thought his way through, he preached it. So I had that. And then I had this angry mother who had a deep commitment to fairness who was trying hard to be a preacher&#8217;s wife and it wasn&#8217;t good, who should have been a scientist but never thought that was an option. So she went to North Carolina State and got a degree in landscape architecture in 1940 and we had beautiful yards [laughs]. JD: Right, right. SE: But she was always studying plants and studying birds. Always, always. And not until she inherited a small amount of money did she ever feel free to go on the Sierra trips and the Audubon trips and count the hooping cranes and, you know, go out on her own, because she felt that it wasn&#8217;t her money; she had to have permission to spend it. So having a pot of her own money was really really liberating for her. So I also grew up knowing I didn&#8217;t want to be angry like that. And she wasn&#8217;t, she would later call herself a feminist. But she embodied that anger that I later wrote about in the fifties of women that had tremendous potential and knew it and felt that they didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to make those choices. So that was two sides and boy was I set up [laughs]. JD: Which leads me to my next question. How did you figure out where you fell, what your path was going to be having, you know, mom was a little more extreme and dad was kind of in the middle? How did you come to the place where you are? SE: Just step by step. I think I don&#8217;t know that my story is particularly unusual. Opportunities presented themselves. I got to Duke in 1962. The civil rights movement was going on all around us and I tiptoed in, to be real honest. I didn&#8217;t just jump in, but it was enormously liberating that it was there. I was very active in the Methodist student movement, which had a building on campus. It was the most intellectually alive place on campus and a lot of the Duke activists in the Civil Rights Movement were there. So when we would have a Sunday evening worship service in Joys and Concerns, they lifted up the specifics of what were going on. And we were reading Paul Tillich and, you know, sort of existential theology and what is the meaning of your life. What is it you&#8217;re going to do to make a meaning of your life? So I tiptoed in, you know. I started passing petitions in the dorm. I was active in the Y. I tutored over in the AMA church. And by the end of my freshman year, I was ready to go to the big demonstrations right during exam time and of course they had ended right at the moment I had made my big decision. And, you know, I was in the path of my parents but I knew my parents would be scared to death. They weren&#8217;t radicals. They weren&#8217;t demonstrators. And I had a grandmother in North Carolina who read the state paper every day and I had this feeling that once I did this publicly, my picture would be in the paper, she&#8217;d pick it up on her doorstep, have a heart attack and die and it&#8217;d be my fault. You know it was that kind of, what that step [10:00] meant to me. But it was through the Y and the Methodist Student Movement that I got more and more involved. Summer after my sophomore year I went to Africa. That was life changing. JD: What part? SE: Malawi. I was in a work program called Operation Crossroads Africa and it was my first true experience of integration. I was in a group half black half white and our leader was black. We were all college students; we laid bricks. My black friends a couple of them were very drawn to Malcolm X and so we had arguments about nonviolence. And then the Harlem riot occurred and they were jubilant and I had to get my mind around that. Why is this such a release and relief? Like finally finally someone&#8217;s fighting back. And I saw imperialism. I was there when Malawi got its independence from Britain. We sat in the stadium and walk the British flag come down and the Malawi flag go up. We worked in the young pioneers training camp, which was the youth wing of the Malawi Congress Party. And we sang all the songs and wore cloth with the picture of Engwazi Dr. H. Kamuzu Banga. He became a horrible dictator but that moment we didn&#8217;t know that. And I really got into African studies as a result of that. I came back, was an officer in the Y, and, you know, the civil rights the sit in stuff had died down in Durham. JD: And this was about what time? SE: This is, I went in the summer of &#8217;64 so &#8217;64, &#8217;65. My best friend was Charlotte Bunch. JD: I&#8217;ve heard that name. SE: You have heard that name. JD: Mm-hm, mm-hm [yes]. SE: She&#8217;s a very well known national leader and lesbian feminist. At the time she didn&#8217;t know she was lesbian but that&#8217;s fine. She and I were active in the Y, wanted to push it in a social justice--. She had spent the same summer in Asia and came back. We both had this sense of, and it suddenly--. The Vietnam War had been invisible to us. Suddenly we knew about it and understood that it was an imperialist war. And so she decided, and we were also moving into--. At Duke the YW was a big campus organization, parallel to student government and the judicial committee in terms of status. So we had these debates about, you know, so how do we act on what we believe and realized that we want to be student leaders and we want respect and we don&#8217;t want that to make us held back. So the first anti-war demonstration in Durham, which was in front of the Durham Post Office, we rode our bicycles down there and I realize now we were--. For the people there who weren&#8217;t people that thought of themselves as movement people. Their roots go back into counter-culture beatnik stuff and coffee houses and sit-ins or whatever. So here are these two women with their Duke blazers on biking up and hopping off and walking in the picket line [laughs]. JD: Wow. SE: And the next month, I saw, I knew Charlotte was down in Montgomery doing advance work for the Selma Montgomery march through her connections in the Methodist student movement, and I saw a little poster that said, &#8220;Some of us are going down to march in Montgomery, you know, show up here.&#8221; I showed up. Two cars, nine guys and me. And we drove to Montgomery. And I call home and I said to daddy, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Montgomery.&#8221; You know, period. This is not a discussion. And he said, &#8220;Good! I&#8217;ll meet you there!&#8221; [Laughs] He came with a whole busload of SMU students. JD: Wow. SE: So you know my big, you know, I&#8217;m-going-to-do-this-no-matter-what-you-think was kind of poof [laughs]. So I marched in Montgomery and that was my first big civil rights march and Dr. King spoke. And we drove back through the night. I was not aware of the violence that happened after that. I wasn&#8217;t exposed to that. I do remember feeling like we need to get out of [15:00] here and, you know, back across the state line as soon as we can. And from that moment, I was a movement person. That was our identity. Charlotte and I were co-presidents of the Y my senior year. We decided not to run against each other but to run together and I got very involved in the unionizing. What the civil rights movement had morphed into in Durham was Local 66, the effort to organize the non-academic employees at Duke. JD: And Local 66 was affiliated with whom? SE: Eventually with AFSCME. JD: Ok, what&#8217;s that? SE: American Federation of State County Municipal Employees. JD: Ok. SE: So, you know, I spent my senior year and then the year after that I got my master&#8217;s degree in African studies. I wrote my senior thesis on a Kenya politician named Tom Mboya and his concept of African Socialism. And I took that into an MA in political science with a focus on African studies because I wanted to do contemporary history and at the time I didn&#8217;t--. I majored in history, but I thought if you wanted to do something that recent you had to be in political science. So I did a little time in political science [laughs]. And that whole year I was very very involved in Local 66, leafleting dorms, doing demonstrations, whatever. And I had planned to get a Ph.D. in African studies. I was then married to, I married right after my undergraduate. And he was a civil rights activist and we went off to Chicago and I didn&#8217;t want to keep staying in school for a little while. JD: Was your husband a student at Duke as well? SE: Yeah. We met at the Montgomery march. JD: Oh wow. So was he one of the nine guys you were talking about? SE: Yes, he was. He was. And he was the head of the corps chapter there. I&#8217;m going to tell you a little connection that&#8217;s going to blow your mind. His name was Harry Boyd. His father was the only white man on the executive committee of SCLC. And his father&#8217;s best man at his wedding was Bill Workman. JD: [draws it out] Wow! SE: So, just so you understand. JD: Wow. SE: How linked the world is. JD: That&#8217;s amazing. SE: Yeah. When I found that out I was stunned because I had known how reactionary Workman was. Anyhow, so we went to Chicago. It was 1967 and I was very aware of where the movement was going in the south. And frankly I wasn&#8217;t sure whether I should get a Ph.D. in African studies because who would give credence to me as a white female teacher to me in the classroom? I mean black power is now where the movement&#8217;s going and I understood why. And it wasn&#8217;t clear to me that I could have because my politics and my academics were so much the same thing that I wasn&#8217;t sure what role I could have that would make sense if I went on in African studies. I wasn&#8217;t the one in the classroom that needed to be teaching that credibly. JD: Right. SE: So for all those reasons, I was enrolled at Northwestern and I just wrote them and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not coming.&#8221; So I had to have a job in Chicago and I had a master&#8217;s degree and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a highly skilled person! Somebody wants to hire me to do interesting stuff!&#8221; Well the only skill that interested them was my typing speed. JD: Mm, and this was in the late 60s? SE: This was in 1967. Fall of &#8217;67. That was a wake up call because I had read Betty Friedan in &#8217;63 because Anne Scott told me to. And from that moment on I wouldn&#8217;t have labeled myself a feminist because that wasn&#8217;t a word. I wouldn&#8217;t have not used it; it just wasn&#8217;t a [20:00] word that I knew. But I was going to be superwoman and it was going to be easy. I was going to have a career and have a family and, you know, build my life around making the world a better place and fine! That&#8217;s what I was going to do. Well suddenly they only wanted to know my typing speed and I landed a job as a secretary at the University of Chicago for two campus ministers, Methodist and Presbyterian. And so I&#8217;d type their letters and I&#8217;d put out a little newsletter every week. And in that building, in the basement, was a press that was a radical press. And all these movement people were coming in and out, you know, passing my little desk as I&#8217;m typing away and chatting with me, mostly women. And when they had discovered that I had been the North Carolina coordinator for Vietnam Summer in &#8217;67. So I was connected to national networks. I had driven all over the state trying to get people to hold a vigil, write some letters to your congress, all those basic. It was one of my basic educations in organizing. So I had done that and I was married to Harry who had been active in civil rights way back and so I had credentials. And so Heather Booth and Susan Moniker, and they say to me, &#8220;There&#8217;s this group of women meeting. Would you like to come?&#8221; And that&#8217;s how I fell into the Westside Group, which is often seen as the very first consciousness-raising women&#8217;s liberation group in Chicago. I just said, &#8220;Sure!&#8221; And I showed up and there were all these women who had been to Mississippi in &#8217;64. It wasn&#8217;t on my radar. I think I went to Africa. That was my way of going to Mississippi because they weren&#8217;t recruiting students from Durham to go to Mississippi; they were recruiting up north. So I was not aware of Freedom Summer until I went to Chicago and there were all these people whose lives had been completely changed by it. And who talked about being organizers very knowledgeably and who were very familiar with left theory and so forth. And so I fell into the Women&#8217;s Movement in &#8217;67 and &#8217;68. And I came back to North Carolina in the summer of &#8217;68. Both Harry and I felt like we belonged back in the south. Our work should be in the south. And I came back and my primary goal was to start the women&#8217;s movement in North Carolina. So Paula Goldsmith who was also in one of those groups in Chicago was taking a job in Chapel Hill and she and I started a women&#8217;s group that summer immediately. And it grew over time into many many wonderful things. And I needed work. Harry was working through the Office of Economic Opportunity, OEO, and community organizing in the poor white community in Durham. So I did some of that, and the whole idea was to make it possible to build, it&#8217;s kind of an IRAT notion, interracial coalitions of the poor. Then I got a paying job on the side part-time with AFSCME and that&#8217;s when I was organizing non-academic workers at Duke because I had huge connections with that community to start with. So that&#8217;s what I did in &#8217;68 and &#8217;69. JD: Amazing. SE: When my baby was born in March of &#8217;69. And I applied to graduate school because I was in the women&#8217;s movement. I wanted to know what was our history. I mean the civil rights movement was really clear: that black people had been taught lies. And I knew that. My mother told me that they&#8217;re going to tell you that slavery was because of the Civil War and they&#8217;re wrong. So I knew that and I knew how disempowering that was. And then I realized, well, women are never there either! And how are we going to make history if we don&#8217;t know the history that we&#8217;re standing on, the shoulders we&#8217;re standing on. So I went back and I wanted to study the southern white working class women. That&#8217;s why I did a project with Jacquelyn Hall. We did research on Elizabeth in Tennessee that she later wrote about. And I wrote an article on bread riots in the civil war. I mean I wrote not articles but papers in graduate school, you know research papers. And I did work on [25:00] women in the socialist party. I was kind of looking for four sisters, you know [laugh]. And I landed on the personal politics as my dissertation. JD: Right, which is one of my favorites. SE: Great. Thank you. JD: It&#8217;s one of my favorites. I wanted to ask you, I wanted to go back a couple steps. You said that you understood why the civil rights movement was headed in the direction of black power. I wanted to talk more about that. What&#8217;s your sense of why or how? SE: Well what made it--. For me, it was very sad. JD: The transition? SE: The transition. And I think it was hard for lots of whites who identified with the movement to realize that they weren&#8217;t welcome anymore or that they would be viewed with suspicion. But maybe it was my experience in Africa with those friends that were drawn to Malcolm X. I had some degree of empathy with the anger that was, you know, particularly I think for young people who want change to happen right now who don&#8217;t have any sense that the world doesn&#8217;t usually change immediately overnight. And the suffering that had gone on all those years, the people who were beaten and killed, and nonviolence you didn&#8217;t hit back. And they wanted to hit back. And it was hard to be on the receiving end of all that violence and not want to pull together. You know, the whole black power was also about black pride and the beloved community was this ideal of an interracial community in which race didn&#8217;t really, people were human with each other regardless of race. And it was a beautiful ideal. People were willing to die for it. But the degree to which southern rural black people had been so beaten down until they didn&#8217;t believe in themselves, to witness that up close, which the foot soldiers in the civil rights movement did, you could understand why it was important to say, &#8220;Wait a minute. We are valuable as black people. We have a culture that is unique and should be honored instead of denigrated. We are not trying to become white. We want to stay black and be equal.&#8221; And so all those things got mixed together and it wasn&#8217;t hard to understand even if it was very painful. JD: Mm-hm [yes]. Yeah that&#8217;s something that I found in my reading and in my research that I found really interesting. I was trying to wrap my brain around what that felt like in that moment where you, you know, it&#8217;s definitely a situation where as a white woman in the movement, you have a different position, obviously. SE: Mm-hm [yes] absolutely. JD: But at the same time, and I think that I hadn&#8217;t thought about it as much until I read Joan Browning&#8217;s essay and the sacrifices in terms of her family. SE: Right, right. Yeah. JD: And losing the support of her community. And just thinking about those sacrifices, even though they&#8217;re different, they&#8217;re still sacrifices. And just I can only imagine what that must have been like. SE: Well I think for people like Joan it was much more powerful because SNCC had become her world, her life. And that was very very very hard. JD: Because even though your parents were obviously afraid for you--. SE: Right, but they supported me. JD: Invested. SE: We shared values. I did not get exiled from my family. I did not get to pay that price. And, you know, I had all these relatives but I didn&#8217;t, I would go to my grandmother&#8217;s for Thanksgiving and I had uncles who would bait me and we&#8217;d get in arguments. And then it came back through the family circle that I was causing trouble. So I just stopped going [30:00] and my mother said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go.&#8221; But there that I disagreed with them so deeply was I had always disagreed with them: my whole life, my troubles as a kid talking to my cousin about how God loves everybody the same. And then the word gets back to my mother, &#8220;Peachy&#8217;s making trouble&#8221; [laughs]. JD: You know what and I wanted to ask you because obviously your husband was involved in the civil rights in terms of support systems. But whenever you became involved in the feminist movement--is it fair to call it a feminist movement? SE: Yes. JD: When you became involved, how did he react? SE: How did he react? Um [pause], someone should go talk to him I guess. But we were as a couple, politics was part of the glue of our relationship. We had agreed before I got into the women&#8217;s movement that we wanted an equal relationship. And so we&#8217;d already been struggling with that, just the daily stuff: who cooks, who cleans, the dirt that I could see and he couldn&#8217;t see. So we had that commitment and the women&#8217;s movement was a direct extension of me being in the movement. I was in the movement with, you know, I was in the movement now with Heather Booth and Harry and I knew Heather and Paul Booth. And Paul had been a major leader in SDS. So it was kind of what all the couples that we were closest to, where they were going. And it just put it a little more on the table that we had to work at this. I think what was probably hard for him, though he never argued about it ever to give him his credit, was that I started going to meetings every night. You couldn&#8217;t find a women&#8217;s group that I didn&#8217;t want to go to. So I was helping to start, you know, I went to the Westside group and there was a Hyde Park group and there was a University of Chicago group. I was going to meetings all the time because it was explosive. It was just explosive. And people were coming through town who were part of this national network saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re doing it in Toronto.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re doing it in New York.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re doing it in San Francisco.&#8221; &#8220;Here&#8217;s what our groups are like. What&#8217;s happening in your groups?&#8221; This national movement was going on. So I can only say that he was--I don&#8217;t remember any tension around it. And, you know, that became my life and there was no argument over whether that should be the case. Because he was such a movement person; he was going to meetings all the time too. It&#8217;s kind of what we did. I know there were, when we were back in Chapel Hill, there was a time when a bunch of the men who were related to the women in these groups formed a men&#8217;s group and they spent a lot of time talking about being men. And Peter Filene edited essays from those men. JD: Do you remember the title of it? SE: No, but--. JD: Peter Filene? SE: Look for Peter Filene and edited book. And it was sparked by that, and they talked about what they learned in that group. And then, you know, when our son was born, we were totally committed to doing it equally and I think we actually did a pretty good job. JD: Of balancing the family? SE: Of balancing. Yeah I think later on we were both working so hard that--. But you know our son as a baby went to meetings. He could sleep anywhere. I lucked out [laughs]. He was at women&#8217;s meetings all the time, you know. Just put him to sleep. Bring the folding crib and put him to sleep in the back room. JD: Mm-hm [yes]. And how did during this time is this the same group that you went to in like the start? Is this the same that you&#8217;re involved in now? SE: Yes. Right, because I started the group in &#8217;68 with Paula. It sputtered. You know at first there were all these women that came with movement connections but saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if we need a [35:00] women&#8217;s group. Come on! This is self-indulgent.&#8221; Some of them didn&#8217;t stick around. Some of them did and then we started picking up other people. And pretty soon the women who had children or were about to, because I&#8217;m pregnant by then, are really trying to figure out childhood socialization. How do we get, how do you become a girl and a boy in terms of socialization and how can we do it differently? And then there were a group of women who weren&#8217;t even married yet or thinking about it and their issues were very different. So they broke off and created a different group. But the group of us who were mostly married and either had or were about to have children, three of us formed a daycare cooperative. We were all pregnant together in this group. Our babies were born December, March and May. The next fall, we&#8217;re all in school here in Chapel Hill and the three families took care of our babies together. JD: Oh wow. SE: And the men as well. I took two mornings with three babies. Harry took two mornings with three babies. One of the men had a regular nine to five job and he was able to get one afternoon off a week, and then we filled in the week that way. All the rest of us were students which is, you don&#8217;t realize it at the time, but it&#8217;s a pretty privileged life in terms of you being able to devote any time, saying, &#8220;Here&#8217;s when I&#8217;m going to do this and here&#8217;s when I&#8217;m going to do that.&#8221; JD: True. SE: So we had a childcare cooperative. That group evolved into Lollipop Power, which published children&#8217;s books for fifteen years. JD: Wow. SE: It also initiated a campaign to have the University of North Carolina have a daycare center, which it refused to do. But we had a baby-in at the president&#8217;s office. We had babies and little toddlers crawling all over the place. And then we founded a daycare center, which may still exist. JD: There is a daycare center on campus. SE: Well ours was called the Community School for People Under Six. JD: Oh! SE: Which is such a 70s name. And we started it in 1970, I guess. Yeah fall of &#8217;70. And my son went there. JD: I&#8217;d be interested to know that what is on campus now is at least some derivative of what you all--. SE: Right. JD: I&#8217;d be interested in finding that out about that. SE: Good! Do it. But I know Lorna Chafe, after I left Chapel Hill in 1976 after I was gone, she became the director of the community school for a while. And it was housed in the basement of a black church. It was not on campus. JD: Ok. Because what I&#8217;m thinking about now is on campus if I&#8217;m not mistaken. Interesting. SE: So, anyway. JD: I also wanted to ask you in terms of feminism, because we read several books that were focused on feminism and feminist activist. I, and I still don&#8217;t have--it seems to me, or it seemed to me, in these readings that depending on who you were talking to--you know, varying by culture, you know, political attitudes and region, you know, and the list goes on--the definition of feminism changes. SE: Changes. Ok. I&#8217;ll do my best but the fact is it&#8217;s messy. So don&#8217;t try to get some type of scientific clarity on this term. I don&#8217;t think it exists; it&#8217;s too potent a symbol. And because it has I think that symbolic resonance, it incorporates meanings that people need to have there pro and con. But as I remember it and have written some about it in the beginning that was not a label we used. It was old fashioned. Like I said, it wasn&#8217;t a word that I had heard. Now I know many people who grew up in the north who did hear that word and it was positive. But I had never heard such a thing. And when I got involved in the Women&#8217;s Movement, we were very clear that we were radical women. We were in the movement. Our roots were in civil rights, anti-war, and student new left. [40:00] And we came out of that and we had big arguments of whether we were still part of that and how much we had to totally break away. And, you know, people used the model of black power there in a different way. But we were women&#8217;s liberation, and that had overtones of, you know, the National Liberation Front in Vietnam, Third World Liberation. Liberation was a powerful word, and so we were women&#8217;s liberation. We didn&#8217;t want just equal laws. We wanted to transform the whole way our culture understood male and female. We wanted to open up everything, redefine relationships, which is why lesbian feminism comes straight out of that. Because even if some groups were not willing to follow the logic of their own positions--you know, had tensions around it--basically that movement offered lesbians a language to use to talk about themselves and to experience being in the closet as more and more a contradiction that couldn&#8217;t be born. So we were the radicals. Right alongside us and at the same time, there was a liberal women&#8217;s movement coming into being. NOW was formed in 1966 and that movement, I think, was more integrated racially because it was established by professional women. They were just a generation ahead of us. And professional black women who knew they had a stake in this fight, and even if it was not always comfortable, they wanted to stay at the table. And so you have people like Aileen Hernandez and just a whole amazing array who were involved in that movement. The radicals needed to say, &#8220;We are not liberals. We are not collaborating with the system. It is not enough for us to have an Equal Rights Amendment or equal laws or so forth as part of our movement identity.&#8221; But what happens over a period of just a few years, and I argued it was a tidal wave because I felt it happen, that the boundaries between those two movements blurred almost from the get-go because you&#8217;re recruiting thousands of people who don&#8217;t walk in with identities: liberal, radical, movement person. You know, they don&#8217;t walk in with any baggage that they have to support. They just come. And they come whatever&#8217;s in front of them. So if the radical movement&#8217;s organizing, that&#8217;s where they land, and if there&#8217;s a NOW chapter that&#8217;s where they land. But feminists became the word that we could all use. That became the word that could define the whole of this explosion that&#8217;s going on. JD: So that&#8217;s when you get the different labels. SE: In the late 60s early 70s. Within that explosion you get radical feminist, and that pops up really early on, saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re feminist but we&#8217;re really radical about it.&#8221; You know, &#8220;We&#8217;re not like those liberal feminists.&#8221; And then you get socialist feminists: people who want to own that left tradition and talk about economic justice in a broad way but also to argue that whole left tradition has left women out most of the time, and we&#8217;re not going to do that. Many labels within that, but feminist became the word that we could all own. And the press was making fun of Women&#8217;s Liberation with words like &#8220;Women&#8217;s Lib&#8221; and &#8220;libers.&#8221; So very, I would say by 1970 feminism is a term that lots of people own, even if they want to try to draw a boundary around their niche or their version of it. And as soon as that happens, it becomes really important for lots and lots of people to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a feminist,&#8221; because it&#8217;s getting a huge amount of press, huge amount of press. Everybody&#8217;s talking about it [45:00]. And it makes a lot of people nervous. I think it especially made a lot of men nervous and the women in their lives needed to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a feminist! I&#8217;m not a feminist! Don&#8217;t be scared! I&#8217;m ok! I&#8217;m ok! I do think women should be paid equally. I do think voting is a good thing for us to do. If we want to run for office, we could run. If we want to have a career, we can have a career. But I&#8217;m not a feminist!&#8221; And that &#8216;but I&#8217;m not a feminist&#8217; thing has been there ever since, ever since. And let me add one more piece of this, which is in those early years, while there were a number of racial minority women who were active in the liberal wing because they understood the stakes in terms of employment law and stuff like that and the ERA. In the movement, you know--this is the height of black power--and all of those things that we&#8217;re not going to get to talk about, about the tension between black and white women in the civil rights movement were still raw. And so a substantial number of black women who were well known were quick to distance themselves from Women&#8217;s Liberation. There were also black women in SNCC; Florence Frances Beal formed a Women&#8217;s Liberation Committee inside of SNCC. But it was a lonely lonely place to be because very quickly you could be told, &#8220;You&#8217;re betraying the people, the race. How could you split us up? How could you publicly criticize the behavior of black men in a racist world? You&#8217;re just giving them weapons.&#8221; And the way a lot of those thousands of women who flooded into the movement articulated their issues rankled really really rankled, because you have people who have adopted a vicarious identity as housewives. They&#8217;re married to an ex. They don&#8217;t own themselves and they&#8217;re angry about that and they want to not just define themselves as woman and wife. Well, to the ears of black women whose mothers cleaned the homes of those women who were supposedly full-time housewives, whose mothers never had the choice to stay at home and be a full-time mother, but had two career families or two job families were the norm of necessity. So they sometimes sort of spat nails about these women who can&#8217;t even clean their own houses bawling about, you know, &#8220;What&#8217;s their problem? Get over it.&#8221; And so there was that reaction and I think feminism became a word that many of them didn&#8217;t want and Alice Walker gave them a word: womanism. So then you have that other piece. JD: And then I was going to ask, I have so many questions out of that what you were just saying. But one of the things that I was thinking about: the divisions within the movement across gender lines and thinking about that in addition to the connections that we&#8217;re making between the civil rights movement and other movements: the feminist women&#8217;s movement, gay rights movement, all these. SE: Right, right. JD: And I wonder, you know, you just spoke about how black women are shying away from the idea of feminism. And I&#8217;m just wondering if, because for the white women who are coming out of the movement and their movement person, is that a lot of what women, are a lot of women coming from this kind of movement background and pushing toward feminism? And the gender divisions, how does that influence their feminist path, or does is influence their feminist path? SE: The gender divisions--. JD: Within the civil rights movement. SE: Within the civil rights movement. JD: Are all the women coming away from that experience thinking about the gender divisions? SE: Well I, yes. Within the movement, which now you have to think in &#8217;67, &#8217;68 is this enormous blob. I mean it encompasses activists who are working on the war who have been involved with [50:00] southern civil rights, who have been organizing on campuses. And because it&#8217;s been going on for a while, some are still undergraduates and some are long out of college. It&#8217;s a network. That&#8217;s what it is. It&#8217;s a network of personal connections, shared experiences. And even if you don&#8217;t, like I could go to Chicago and suddenly I&#8217;m one of us because of what I had done other places and people we knew in common. Within that network, Women&#8217;s Liberation and what later--it evolved to become feminism--but in the beginning, Women&#8217;s Liberation among whites spread like wildfire, wildfire. But some different things are happening in different parts of the movement too. So if you look at what&#8217;s happening in the white new left, it&#8217;s taking a turn toward sectarianism and violence. Some imitation really of the black power movement those parts of the black power movement, some I think out of a real despair. The war didn&#8217;t end; it kept not ending. And the movement kept declaring it was going to shut the Pentagon down and boom. There&#8217;s a gender piece of this, which is a generation of men who were being groomed to be the elites. You know they were going to the best schools. They could have become corporate CEOs and big time lawyers and big time politicians. And they were choosing not to take that path into successful manhood. So what do you do? How do you be a man? What&#8217;s your grown up self going to be? I knew people who were kind of pulled into a sectarian Marxism. Suddenly everybody is grabbing onto Marxism. You&#8217;ve got a truth in a very doctrinaire way, being drawn to fantasies of revolution. And the movement has grown so gigantic that partly it feels like it. In 1968, there were massive student uprisings all over the world. And I just did a piece in the American Historical Review on gender in the international in 1968, so you&#8217;ll see where some of this is coming from. I think men wanted to find another way to prove their manhood. Women didn&#8217;t want to find another way to prove their womanhood. They wanted to break it down; you know, they were breaking the rules in a different way than men were. And so there&#8217;s this divergence after &#8217;68 and the Women&#8217;s Movement in that period in the white new left, it&#8217;s the most exciting coherent thing that&#8217;s happening for the next eight years, while the new left eats itself alive. It breaks apart. Different groups proclaim they have absolute truth. Some of them turn to violence. Some of them give up the rest of their lives and go and work in factories and try to organize there. People go all different ways. And I think it wasn&#8217;t easy for some of those men to see the thrill women still had in the movement. They still had that thrilling sense of making history that the early civil rights movement gave you, while people are floundering around about how to have a coherent message. You know the civil rights laws got passed. We don&#8217;t have segregation. We have all these labor struggles but the odds are stacked against them. What is our vision? Beloved community&#8217;s not enough. And anyway, black power&#8217;s kind of surpassed that. So a lot of people are trying to say, &#8220;If you were active in SDS and you&#8217;re a grown up what do you do?&#8221; So the new American movement is formed and a bunch of new organizations they try to articulate a democratic kind of socialism, figure out how to work on it. But the women&#8217;s movement, now that&#8217;s where stuff is happening. You don&#8217;t have to be a brilliant theoretician. You just go do stuff. You start daycare centers. You set up presses. You publish books. You set up coffee houses [55:00]. You do health care clinics. You do abortion counseling. You know, there was stuff there to do and you just did it. And the other thing that&#8217;s thriving is the counter-culture. But the activist, I think the white activist men were having a hard time. I think for African-American women and women, you know you have La Raza. You have an Asian-American student movement. Identity politics is always underway and what you do see is women in all those groups beginning to lift up issues in the same way they did in the white new left. It really does happen. And this is a line that is just so important to me that we hang on to. Women of color were there in the beginning. Some of them were lifting up these issues all along and the Women&#8217;s Movement was awfully white. It periodically made valiant efforts not to be. But people&#8217;s sensibilities were very raw and they didn&#8217;t understand each other; they talked past each other. They hurt each other when they said things. I think for women of color there were class issues as well that meant white women, white middle class women, college educated women would say things that just they felt like obliterated their lives. They just, you know, they weren&#8217;t in that sentence. They said, &#8220;What are you talking about? What does woman mean?&#8221; And for white women who were deeply opposed to racism, the fear that they&#8217;re going to be labeled racist if they stepped wrong, you know, made them be not as open and honest I think as they should have been. So those conversations were just really tangled up and difficult. And so these separate paths are being pursued. But, you know, a few years later, some of the most powerful--I think writing novels turned out to be an important piece of the feminist movement--and lo and behold you have these black voices: Toni Morrison and Alice Walker; the list goes on and on, Maxine Hong Kingston. And those were some of the most powerful voices in the 70s of this feminist sensibility. So for women a decade or two later to start saying that movement was all white and they got it all wrong and, you know, so let&#8217;s cut that off at its knees and go do something else is not the case. And I think we need to kind of keep trying to get a handle on that complexity, not make the women of color invisible in telling that story. And at the same time, notice that there was so much white domination that there was great discomfort; there was racism in that movement. I&#8217;m hoping our last plenary is going to explore some of those things. JD: Right. Right. Yeah one of the, we got into a sort of heated discussion in class trying to flesh out the, because a lot of what we read in terms of the feminist movement black women tend to kind of fade into the background or kind of exist on the margins right? SE: Mm-hm [yes]. JD: And Dr. Chafe posed the question of what makes a social movement a social movement. And then the question came up about what trumps: race, class or gender? SE: Right, right. JD: And just the interesting position that black women found themselves in during this period and especially whenever they&#8217;re trying to figure out what&#8217;s more important in terms of their civil rights or their rights as a woman. SE: Right! It was impossible. I think it was genuinely impossible. And I don&#8217;t think there were only a few white women who could really grasp that, and probably a high proportion of them had been women who had been very active in the civil rights movement. But that sense of in the divided loyalties of identities that are in your body and the easy way that [60:00] other people had of saying, &#8220;How can you say that? You&#8217;re betraying X,&#8221; when you&#8217;re speaking from Y. But Y is also who you are. So wait a minute! JD: Right. What are you to do? SE: It was impossible. JD: I thought that was really fascinating. SE: Yeah. JD: And you mentioned something a moment ago about white women having a fear of being labeled as racists, which kind of brings me back to the point I was talking about earlier about these relationships within the civil rights movement between black men and white women. SE: Right. JD: Reading your book because Dr. Chafe paired personal politics with Alice Walker&#8217;s Meridian. SE: Ah yes! JD: Which was a wonderful, wonderful companion reading. But just thinking, and again I hadn&#8217;t thought about this as an issue as a part of the civil rights movement. But both of your works talk about the tensions and how white women found themselves in kind of a precarious situation in trying to contribute and not be labeled as racists but also not be subjected to harassment or, you know, any kind of sexual coercion or things of that nature. What is your sense of that? Did you know people that experienced that personally or were you just writing? SE: I learned mostly about it in doing the interviews for personal politics. JD: Ok. SE: It was not something I had personally experienced and I didn&#8217;t know it was there because my civil rights experience was really on the fringes. I was not a SNCC worker in a southern town who lived and breathed it, you know. I think I would have had some sense of it if I had done that. So it just came up. It just came up. And I think the situation for white women was ok we&#8217;re here. I&#8217;ve defied my parents. I&#8217;ve come here to this really alternate reality; not like anything I&#8217;ve ever known. And I&#8217;m risking my life. I believe in this so deeply. I don&#8217;t think it should make such a difference, black or white. And in some cases there was coercion and in some cases it was, you know, if you don&#8217;t sleep with me you must not want to sleep with me because I&#8217;m black, and that was pretty powerful. In many cases, they are extremely drawn to these charismatic men who are really different than anybody they&#8217;ve ever known. And that&#8217;s the biggest taboo. That&#8217;s the biggest biggest taboo. In the name of those relationships, thousands of people have been lynched. So are we going to break this rule or not? JD: Right. SE: Are we going to let that racist thing stand in our way? No! So it felt like this big rule busting in your face thing to do. And then lo and behold, black women are pissed off at them. Well, from black women&#8217;s point of view, this is not hard to understand. Here come these privileged white women into the south, not always behaving respectfully, you know, doing stuff without waiting for people to do for themselves, taking over sometimes. And hopping in bed with our guys. And the fact that for black men, this was again the great taboo; this is what you couldn&#8217;t do. And so it&#8217;s real, that kind of eroticizes the whole thing. And for black women who have grown up in a culture that offered standards of beauty that is all white, same culture that the black men grew up in, so they get that about why those women are so attractive. It feels like rejection. It really hurts. And also they know that relationships between black men and white women because it&#8217;s the big taboo that endangers everybody else, totally, really, seriously. And the northern white women are just fairly oblivious to that. If you&#8217;re a southern black woman, you know it in your bones and it scares you to death [65:00] and you&#8217;re really angry at the black men for endangering you and you&#8217;re furious with the white women. And you&#8217;re feeling rejected, like, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What am I? JD: Yeah, so many layers. SE: So many layers. It&#8217;s all going on at once. And these are young kids. That&#8217;s the other thing; think eighteen, nineteen, twenty. It was sort of inevitable and all those feelings make sense, but it&#8217;s an explosive mix also in multiple ways. JD: I want to move away from that and ask you, because you mentioned earlier that the inclination to kind of shy away from the feminist being labeled as a feminist, people still have that inclination. SE: Yeah. JD: With that in mind, what is the state of feminism today? SE: Mm. JD: Because we had a conversation about this in class as well after reading your book and, you know, people were just kind of declaring themselves, &#8220;I&#8217;m a feminist. I&#8217;ve decided after reading this book. I&#8217;m a feminist.&#8221; SE: Yes! Wonderful [laughs]! JD: And, you know, we were just talking in class: &#8220;Well you know I believe x, y, and z and these are the things that I, you know, would like to see in the world, so yeah! I think I&#8217;m a feminist. And you know, I might actually be a radical feminist,&#8221; which I thought was really really fascinating. But given that, what is your sense of feminism today? SE: That is such a hard question. I think we are, the world is so different than the world that gave birth to this feminist movement. It has really changed. And at the same time, there&#8217;s still a huge amount left to be done. I had a conversation last night with a young professor about, you know, how her students think everything&#8217;s fine; we&#8217;re all equal now. But they seek her out and say, &#8220;How do you put family and work together?&#8221; JD: Right. SE: And I said, &#8220;Did you ever ask them whether the men in their lives are worried about that?&#8221; JD: Right. SE: Because they&#8217;re not. JD: Right. SE: For the most part. Some stuff has changed and some hasn&#8217;t and it&#8217;s, you know, we still have a lot of stuff to untangle. There are legacies of that movement that are still alive. And so, you know, I think we&#8217;re going to have to in the long term think of the Long Women&#8217;s Rights Movement in its various waves. And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a technical term so I don&#8217;t care whether you want to use first, second, third, fifth, whatever. I do think it&#8217;s still there. It&#8217;s there institutionally and a whole lot of organizations that are ongoing and are working very hard. It&#8217;s there in a bunch of ideas that are still afloat and incompletely realized. And I think every few years there&#8217;s another little upsurge among young women who say, &#8220;Wait a minute. This is not fixed! And we have to do something.&#8221; And it&#8217;s beautiful. It&#8217;s beautiful when that starts to happen because you can marshal tons of statistics. It&#8217;s also international, and I think that is one of the most powerful facts about this movement. After 1968, feminism of a very similar sort that emerged in women&#8217;s liberation emerged in Mexico, France, Germany, Japan, other parts of Latin America. I mean all over the world. There was this kind of second wave of feminism that wasn&#8217;t only focused on legality but also was focused on cultural transformation and on the body. And there are legacies of that everywhere but what has happened since, I would say--well starting in the 70s and you could see it really in the 80s and 90s--is the emergence of women&#8217;s movements all over the third world. And they may or may not label themselves feminism, but they do, they have been a powerful presence in the UN conferences. I went to the one in Nairobi in 1985. I didn&#8217;t get to go to Beijing in &#8217;93, but that was incredible. The whole issue of women&#8217;s education, women&#8217;s right to work, women&#8217;s sexual oppression, I mean there really is sexual slavery going on around the world. And those issues are really alive and there are women working on them all over the world and providing a lot of leadership. So I would say the US women&#8217;s movement is part of something much bigger, and globally a lot of leadership is coming from the third world if you pay attention. Everything has globalized and so have we. JD: Mm, absolutely. Well I thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today. SE: You&#8217;re welcome! You&#8217;re welcome...
