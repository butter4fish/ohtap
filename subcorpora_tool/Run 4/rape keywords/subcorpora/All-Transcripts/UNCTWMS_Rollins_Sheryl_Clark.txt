 Joey Fink: It&#8217;s August 12th, 2010. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee with Sheryl Rollins. Mrs. Rollins, if you&#8217;d like to start just by telling me a little bit about your childhood, where you&#8217;re from. Sheryl Rollins: I was born November 11, in 1949, in Knoxville, Tennessee. And it was a time of a lot of segregation in Knoxville. I can remember the water fountains that said &#8220;Black&#8221; and the water fountains that said &#8220;White.&#8221; And I can remember having to go to the back of the bus to sit down. And I remember when my brother and I asked my grandmother--she was taking us downtown--and we said, &#8220;Granny, why do we have to go to the back of the bus?&#8221; We got off the bus and we never rode the bus until they were integrated. Back then, a taxi cab was ten cents, and my grandmother would get the ten cent to ride a taxi downtown, or we would walk. So it was a time of having memories of African American people being treated as less than. And I did not like that feeling, as a young person coming up here. And my grandmother didn&#8217;t like it; my mother didn&#8217;t like it. My family just did not really accept the limitations that were put on us as African Americans at that time. It has changed. But it needs to change some more. JF: What did your parents do? SR: My mother was a hairdresser. I grew up in a single family. My father worked for the post office in Washington, D.C. after he left Tennessee. My grandmother raised us, so I did grow up in the traditional black matriarchical home of a mother, a grandmother, and two children, me and my brother. And my father and my stepfather (my brother&#8217;s father), they were absent for the most part. JF: What kind of impact did that have on your--? SR: It just let me know that women could do anything. It just let me know that you didn&#8217;t have to have a man to teach you how to live or how to work or how to do what you wanted to do in life. I think it was freeing. It gave me problems later on, I&#8217;m sure, when I married, but I didn&#8217;t grow up with any feelings of inferiority from the female perspective. That was nonexistent for me. JF: Was that unusual, do you think, for--? SR: I think it was unusual, because I grew up in a time when women were taught to cater to men. We were taught to be subservient to your husband. The man was the head of the household and all that. We grew up with the same type of value systems that white America had, in terms of the male-dominant, female-subservient type of attitudes of family and social life. JF: How important was education in your family? SR: Education was the number one thing in my family. My grandmother bought a book, a dictionary. It was fifty dollars. And she didn&#8217;t have enough money to pay for the dictionary, so she was able to make payments on it, five dollars a month, until she could pay for it. Every time me and my brother didn&#8217;t know a word, then she would say, &#8220;Go look it up in the dictionary.&#8221; And from that insistence upon learning, I went through school as an honor student, through junior high school, high school, and college. My brother was also an honor student. My mother and my grandmother, they did not accept anything less than what they thought we could do. Because we couldn&#8217;t bring home a C. And that might seem harsh. I remember one incident when I was a cheerleader, and I made the first and only C I had ever made in school. And my mother wasn&#8217;t going to let me cheer that semester. And it was in algebra. I&#8217;m a math-phobic, I admit to it, I just am. I still am. But I made that one C in my entire high school career, and it was just the worst thing that could&#8217;ve happened to me. And now I see where young people consider a C okay. They don&#8217;t get upset if they make a D or if they fail a class. I find it very disturbing, the lack of the striving for excellence that we did when we were coming up, as compared to what the young people today seem to take for granted or don&#8217;t even want to take advantage of. JF: How did the Civil Rights Act impact your high school experiences? SR: Well, I grew up on the line. There was a dividing line, where you went to the black high school, or you could go to the new white high school, East High School, that had just opened up. I had a very good comfort zone, being black, and I chose to go to the black high school. I did very well there. And I felt that I would do very well if I went to a white high school. So I did choose consciously to stay at the black high school. I had wonderful African American teachers that were interested in us, not just as students but as people. They were interested in our character, they were interested in our success. Alfredda Delaney, I had the pleasure of being taught by her. She&#8217;s an icon in the Knoxville community for her untiring dedication and service to the Mechanicsville area. In fact, my grandmother and Alfredda Delaney&#8217;s mother were best friends. And my grandmother used to babysit for Ms. Delaney. We had Ester Cowan, who knew English upward, downward, backwards, and sideways. When I tested to go to UT [University of Tennessee, Knoxville], I tested into Honors English. One professor, her name was Mrs. Newberry, she was [what] I consider a racist person. Because she didn&#8217;t believe that I came from Austin High School and I could write the way I did. And it just so happened, I kept all of my drafts and my notes, and I showed them to her so that she would not fail me. Because she really believed that, being a black student coming from Austin High School, in 1968, that I could not write as well as I did. I will never forget that. JF: And this woman was a college professor at UT? SR: She was a college professor at the University of Tennessee. And I remember that--. They called it the Tower back then, where all the offices were. And I went up to the Tower and I complained about her and my treatment, and nothing was done. Nothing was done, ever. I can&#8217;t say a lot of positive things about UT in terms of its record of race relations. I think it&#8217;s getting better, but I think that some of the things that went on when I was there were things that should not have gone on in an institution of higher learning. JF: How big was the community of black students at UT when you were there? SR: Oh, it was very small. It was very small. I don&#8217;t have any exact figures, but oftentimes there were one or two of us in the classroom. And we were there more in the freshman year. But when you got up to the senior year and the junior year, the African American seniors and juniors in classes, it was very sparse. Because it was said that the freshmen flunked out. I think that they have taken steps to really work with young people starting their freshman year at Tennessee schools and universities by giving them remedial courses. And I think this is a good thing, because walking from a farm--this was a rural area--walking in from a farm or from a small Southern city to a university that had twenty-five to forty thousand people in attendance was frightening. It did not frighten me, I don't know why. But it was frightening to some people who entered into that environment. JF: What were the opportunities like for African American women to go to college at UT? SR: At the time, as I recall, most of the women that I knew at that time, they were wanting to be teachers. Dr. Barbara Reed was not the first nurse to graduate from the UT College of Nursing, but she was the first African American to be the Associate Dean of the College of Nursing. And she did a lot to help African Americans get into the School of Nursing. They still don&#8217;t have many. One of the last acts I did as I was practicing was to keep them from dismissing a young African American female from the School of Nursing in Chattanooga for no good reason, who was on the dean&#8217;s list. Who was told that she was not nursing material. And this was in 2004, or 2005. So things really have not changed in many ways. But in other ways, the outwardly appearance, things have changed. They don&#8217;t have the signs. There&#8217;s not a law that keeps you from attending the University of Tennessee College of Law. When I went to the University of Tennessee College of Law, we were under a (12:05) de jure segregation order, where African Americans could not attend the College of Law as a matter of state law. But that has changed, due to the Geier lawsuit against the university. And as fate would have it, Dr. Geier, who brought the lawsuit to desegregate the university, is now working there as a professor. And that&#8217;s how life happens. What goes round comes round. JF: So you were at UT as an English student? As an undergrad? SR: I had a double major. I was an English major, and I was also a technical writing major. JF: What did you hope to do with your degree? SR: Well, I had wanted to write. I had wanted to teach English. The first time I went to school, I quit to go home and take care of my grandmother, who was sick. And when I went back to school, I had decided that I wanted to go to law school. That I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to help people that were not treated fairly because of the color of their skin. And that&#8217;s what spurred me to go to law school. JF: When did you begin law school? SR: I was a returning student; I began law school I think it was in 19--. Let&#8217;s see, I graduated in [19]91, so I think it was in 1988. 1987, I think it was in 1987 that I started. And it was three years. JF: And you graduated with your undergrad degree in 1978. SR: I graduated with my undergraduate degree in, I think it was [19]86, or [19]87. I have--. I&#8217;m a year off. When you get my age, your memory goes first. [Laughter] JF: That&#8217;s fine. So what were you doing in between, in the seventies? You said you had to leave college first to take care of your grandmother? SR: Right, right. I had to take care of my grandmother. I went to work for the--. Back then, it was called the Atomic Energy Commission; I went to work for the Department of Energy. And I also worked for the Department of Air Force. And while I was at the Department of the Air Force, I was coordinator of civilian personnel. And I did a lot of the--. Where people would have drug and alcohol problems, the human resources-type work. And I saw where people were having a difficult time during this period with drug and alcohol use, and they were losing their jobs. Thankfully, the government, under several administrations, eventually passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. Which helped those people that did have disabilities be able to get treatment and perhaps keep their job. Whereas it used to be you automatically lost your job. So when I practiced law, I always had an affinity for people that were on the downward side, that were the oppressed, that were not, I felt, given a fair break. At the time I practiced law I was also one of the few African American attorneys that would represent the gay and lesbian community. Which was something that just wasn&#8217;t done back then. It was a good--. It was the best of times, and truly the worst of times. [Laughter] JF: When you worked with the Air Force, and you were witnessing a lot of this drug and alcohol abuse, did you work with any Vietnam veterans? SR: Yes, I worked with Vietnam veterans, I worked with the Latinos. Basically I worked with good ol&#8217; boys from Maryville, Tennessee, which was a place that was known for being racist. And up until I went so high up, I wasn&#8217;t really faced with that much discrimination. I was one of the first women they hired, African American women they hired, at the Tennessee National Guard. But when I left there, I left them filing a lawsuit against them for discrimination. JF: Can you explain a little bit about how that happened? SR: Well, that just happened in terms of what I did with my career. I was in line for a promotion, and the promotion was given to a less-qualified white male who didn&#8217;t have half of the qualifications or experience--or education--that I had. And I was offended by that. But it was a long, tedious, expensive, horrendous episode to try and get help when you are wanting to sue a federal agency and you were poor and you didn&#8217;t have any money. I did have the support of my husband at that time, so I got a little further than a lot of people did. But by the time the case was dismissed, I had finished law school and was working for the Tennessee Human Rights Commission. So all of my life, I have been--. JF: So the lawsuit began in the late seventies? SR: Yeah. My attorney was attorney Marilyn Hudson, and all my life I have been concerned about the treatment of people who were not part of the white Anglo-Saxon protestant population that were treated differently because of their disability, or primarily the color of their skin. But I just didn&#8217;t feel that people should be discriminated against for any reason. Because either you live up to the truth of the Constitution and the Declaration, or it&#8217;s a joke and everything else is a joke. So we have to really make sure that we live up to the ideals of this country, or we&#8217;re no better than some of the countries we&#8217;ve invaded trying to fight for democracy for them. And I do want to say that one thing that does bother me is that--. I&#8217;m a liberal, proudly liberal, lifelong liberal. And it&#8217;s the conservatives that seem to make being a liberal a dirty word. To be liberal is to love this country just as much as any Republican does, or any conservative, or any Tea Party person. But it seems that if you&#8217;re liberal in some sectors of the red states, the conservative states, that that&#8217;s a bad thing. And that we&#8217;re not as patriotic, and we&#8217;re not as for this country as they are. And I think nothing could be further from the truth. JF: So during the seventies, before you went back to law school--. Let me pause for a second, skip to the next track. [Recorder turns off and then on again] I wanted to ask you if, during the seventies when you were sort of working and making a living but also doing these extraordinary things, like the first African American woman hired by the Air Force in your position--. SR: Department of the International Guard. JF: Department of the International Guard. Were you connected with other folks in Knoxville that were also fighting different kinds of social justice fights? SR: Absolutely, absolutely. I worked with Linda Parris-Bailey, who founded Carpetbag Theater, which is one of the oldest [African American] theater groups in the Southeast. I think it&#8217;s one of the oldest African American theater groups in the country. Linda has done wonders with Carpetbag Theater. I had the pleasure of marrying a man who was a civil rights advocate. So I went to the second March on Washington, and I went to Mississippi Freedom Summer, and I went to the Black Caucus events, and the Urban League events and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] conferences. I just came back, this year, from the fiftieth anniversary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. SNCC [pronounced &#8216;Snick&#8217;] was the young arm of the civil rights movement. They were the fighters, the quote-unquote, so-called &#8220;militants,&#8221; of the civil rights movement, who went into the South and lived there and really changed the face of this country. So I was very honored to be there, to see these people who, in the seventies, I read about and saw on television. Julian Bond, Harry Belafonte, the three men who integrated the lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina--. I think it&#8217;s the Greensboro Three. To see the Ladner Sisters [Dorie and Joyce], who were very active, and Bernice Reagan, of Sweet Honey in the Rock, who&#8217;s now at the Smithsonian. It was a very, very good experience, a very good event that these people are still with us. But my concern is that these people are now getting older. They&#8217;re getting sicker. They won&#8217;t be around one day, and then we wonder who will be there to pick up the torch. Because if you think that there&#8217;s no longer a need for people to be a conscience of America, you just need to look at what happened with the woman from the Agriculture Department, who was depicted as being a racist, who was not a racist. Look at what has happened to people who are being killed on the street, being murdered. For no other reason than their color. And the Klan-- not the Klan, but we did a march in the seventies [against white supremacy] when the police department beat up James Brown, who had a radio station here. And we thought it was awful that this man who came here to try and make a difference in Knoxville, Tennessee, a world-renowned entertainer, was beaten up by the local police. Spike Lee made a movie called Get on the Bus, and in his movie, Spike Lee talked about &#8220;Don&#8217;t stop in Knoxville, because their police department is really bad.&#8221; But we have a much better police department than we did in the seventies and the eighties. We have a man who seems to want to have more of a dialogue than an adversarial relationship with the African American community. The things that I saw then, sometimes they&#8217;re still going on now. JF: What were some of the most important issues in the seventies? SR: When I went to work for the Department of Energy, which back then, it was the Atomic Energy Commission, I wanted to buy a house. I didn&#8217;t believe in paying rent for an apartment. But a black woman could not--. JF: Were you still single at this point, or were you married? SR: I was still single. I didn&#8217;t get married until 1974. But I went to work for the Department of Energy, I think it was in 1968 or [19]69. And I stayed with them for four or five years. I made good money. I wanted to buy a house. And I had good credit. But a black woman could not buy a house in Knoxville in the seventies. Now, if she had enough money--. If she had an inheritance and she could pay for the house, and she didn&#8217;t have to qualify for a bank loan, then she could buy a house. But now, I tell these young black girls how wonderful it is that you can go buy a house and there&#8217;s nothing to stop you but your own economic barriers, if you don&#8217;t have the money or if you don&#8217;t have the credit. Because it didn&#8217;t matter if you had the money, it didn&#8217;t matter if you had the credit. You could not buy a home. And a lot of the discrimination that I experienced in the seventies and the eighties, I experienced as much due to my gender--. I won&#8217;t say &#8220;as much,&#8221; but a lot of it was due to my gender. And of course, it was more so due to my race. But we had a double-edged sword as African American women back then. Because we had African American males who we felt resented us if we were outspoken, or if we wanted to participate in whatever civil rights activity or local activity or whatever&#8217;s going on. As was true in the movement, and was true in SNCC, the women were not given leadership positions in the movement until, I think, Ella Baker founded SNCC. Medgar Evers&#8217; wife eventually--. Merilee Evers headed the NAACP. Dorothy Hyatt. The president of the National Council for Negro Women. And she was a young, tall, beautiful woman who was one of the peers of A. Philip Randolph and Roy Wilkins and Dr. King. She was a wonderful woman, and a legend in her time. And we&#8217;re losing those people. And that is my worry, that is my concern. It hurts me deeply when I see that some of our young people don&#8217;t even vote. They don&#8217;t want to vote. They feel that it does not influence them. And they have no idea that who&#8217;s sitting in Congress, who&#8217;s sitting in the Senate, makes a difference as to whether you&#8217;ll have a job, whether you&#8217;ll have an education loan, you&#8217;ll have healthcare, your parents will have a pension, benefit. The only thing I can think of, and I&#8217;ve said this before and I&#8217;ve taken a lot of heat for saying it. But I believe that when you let other people tell your story, and you don&#8217;t tell it yourself, something gets lost in the translation. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m glad to have the opportunity to speak in this oral history, because if our children have not been told and reminded of how things used to be, and they think that they&#8217;re out there without any ill will because of the color of their skin, or their gender, or their national origin, and then they&#8217;re surprised when they find out that they&#8217;re being laid off. And how can they be laid off when they&#8217;ve done nothing to be laid off for, but the white person still has their job? And if the government does not--. It&#8217;s a situation of benign neglect. If the government does not put teeth into the civil rights statutes, the statute [Civil Rights Act] of [19]64, Title IX, Title VI, these are the statutes that brought about the change in women's athletics, changes that brought about the fact that you could not deny a person to buy a house because they were black. The redlining of certain neighborhoods-- selling them insurance because it was a predominantly black neighborhood. The federal government under the Johnson administration, they did as much as anybody to bring about change in this country. We didn&#8217;t have that, I don&#8217;t feel, with the Bush administration. I found the Bush administration to be frightening on the level of the Nixon administration, as far as people of color were concerned. And yet, sometimes the Democratic party has put people who were just so racist out there, in the state of Tennessee, that I have voted for a Republican. And that&#8217;s not something I thought I would ever do. But if the person was racist, I would not vote for them just because they were a Democrat. The other person might&#8217;ve been racist, but they were smart enough to keep their mouth shut. And that&#8217;s what I remember about the governor who was a Republican, Ray Blanton. He made a statement about being &#8220;n rich,&#8221; the n-word rich, &#8220;on a Saturday night.&#8221; And even though he was a Democrat I would not vote for him. That was the first time I ever voted for a Republican. I&#8217;ve done so a few times since then. But I&#8217;m beginning to realize that we have to vote for the person and not necessarily the ideological banner that they wrap themselves in. And how do they talk to you and your community, and what do they want for you and your community? And that really determines who gets my vote these days. JF: What were women in the seventies doing to fight gender discrimination? SR: What were they doing with the commission in Knoxville? Well, they were very, very quick to file complaints against a business for discrimination. Most of the complaints, when I worked for the Tennessee Human Rights Commission--. JF: What years was that? SR: Wow. Wow. [Laughter] JF: About, you know, you can give me some rough years. SR: It was, let&#8217;s see. In the nineties. The early nineties, I think, was when I was with the Commission. But we handled a lot of discrimination suits by women. One of the big issues that we had at that time were people were dying of AIDS. And people were firing the mothers of the people that had AIDS, because they were afraid of catching AIDS. So we had a lot of women who came to the Human Rights Commission to file suit against the company that fired them. Because they had a child that died of AIDS. Well this seems barbaric now, to even hear this. But we settled many a case in the favor of the plaintiff while I was there, because that just wasn&#8217;t to be borne that you should lose your job because your son had AIDS. We also had a lot of women that filed complaints due to wage disparity issues. The white females seemingly filed more than the African American females did in the area of wage discrimination. Most of the African American females, theirs would say discrimination. They saw it as race, but it turned out to be when you looked at their case closely, it was race and it was gender. And it was hostile work environment harassment, due to sexual harassment or due to gender based, non-sexual harassment. One of the proudest accomplishments I have is that I had a partner, Helen Larson, who lives in Washington, D.C. now, but along with professor Grayford Gray of the UT College of Law, he was our mentor. And we developed the first mediation handbook for the Tennessee Human Rights Commission. And we were--. We both left before we solved the final book, which I was told they did adopt. But both of us left the commission. I went into private practice and Helen moved to Washington, D.C. to work with the--. She was the president of the LPM association, and she went there to work for them. But when we were together, we found so many companies guilty of discrimination that the people that were the administrators of the Human Rights Commission, they asked us to review some of our findings. And one woman said that we needed to reverse one of our findings, and we wouldn&#8217;t do it. So we left. We would never change any of our findings to suit--. JF: You were actually getting pressure from folks above you at the Commission to--. SR: Absolutely. JF: --to not find in favor of--. SR: Absolutely, at that time, yes. Her name&#8217;s Helen Larson, I think she&#8217;s still alive. And we refused to change any of our rulings. And we found a lot of--. It was sickening, the amount of sexual harassment that was going on to women who were employed. Women who worked as waitresses, women who worked in restaurants and nightclubs, women who worked in hotels as maids. Women who had jobs that were physicists, that were scientists. It just ran the gamut of sexual harassment in the workplace. When I was in private practice, one of the biggest things that I saw coming, just before I retired, was that there was an awful lot of women being harassed on the job with internet pornography. The internet pornography was exploding. It exploded from Jellico, Tennessee, to Knoxville, Tennessee to wherever you were, it didn&#8217;t matter how small the town was, how large the town was. On a military base, in a trucking company, in a federal installation. Men were having great issues with feeling that they had the right to look at pornography during work hours in the workplace. And I think that many workplaces have got in their handbooks that that is now a reason that you could be disciplined or terminated. But it was just awful. JF: So the language of sexual harassment in the right to stand up against it, that&#8217;s sort of something new. How did women talk about these things when they would first come with their complaints? Did they use the language that we use now, of &#8220;I was sexually harassed,&#8221; or did they talk about it differently? SR: They didn&#8217;t use the term &#8220;sexually harassment&#8221; as much as they did, &#8220;He wanted me to sleep with him or I would be fired.&#8221; &#8220;He got in my face with his fist and said if I told it, I would be fired.&#8221; One of the landmark sexual harassment cases in the country, came out of Tennessee and it was Hicks. And Hicks was a case in which the employer had made his employee reach in his pants pocket and take money out of his pants pocket to get money to get paid or whatever. Or for whatever it was that he wanted her to do that for, but it was a case that set the standard that you could be found guilty of sexual harassment and damages could be rewarded for psychological damages. Because at one time, the psychological damages were not a part of the remedies for a sexual harassment discrimination lawsuit. So now, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent emotional infliction of emotional distress, and whatever traumas you experience due to the sexual harassments you experienced on the job, is actionable and recoverable. JF: This may be a tough question for you to answer, so I can rephrase it if it doesn&#8217;t make sense. What would you attribute to women coming forward more? Because women have always been sexually harassed by men. SR: We just refused to, just had a generation of women that just said, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;ve had it, we&#8217;re not going to take it anymore, we&#8217;re going to sue--&#8221; JF: Do you think this is related to the other movements in the sixties? SR: Absolutely. It all came about at the same time. While we were marching to have the right to vote, women in the Northeast were also marching against the Vietnam War, and after they stopped marching, or during the same time that they marched against the Vietnam War, they also started burning bras. And the National Organization of Women became a national movement, a national power, and now it&#8217;s politically correct for some women to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a feminist,&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in feminism,&#8221; but feminism is what changed for working women, particularly the white middle-class woman. It changed her life for the better, because she was no longer afraid to step out and speak out against what she felt was discrimination against her. All of this was a result of the civil rights movement in the sixties and the decade of change from the late fifties to the early seventies, that people were wanting a different America. It was an America that did not want to fight the Vietnamese war. It was an America that had women suing because they were sexually harassed on the job, women suing because they were passed over for promotion and less-qualified men got the job. Women suing because they were called the n-word on the job and terminated. Any number of categories: gender--. And one of the worst categories, I think, in my practice of civil rights, was where the employer was not overtly violating the law. He didn&#8217;t do the overt things, like call you a bitch or use the n-word or just say, &#8220;I&#8217;m firing you because you didn&#8217;t sleep with me.&#8221; But what they did, many employers engaged in invidious campaigns of hostile work environment harassment, where day in and day out when the complaining party came to work, there was always something done to harass them, to upset them, to force them into quitting their job. And these were some of the things that women really started suing about in the seventies and the eighties. JF: You said feminism really particularly benefited white middle class women, and they were more likely to file wage disparity lawsuits--. SR: I think it did, I think it did. I think it particularly benefited them initially, but today I think that there is no gap in terms of people filing for complaints of discrimination. And I think that feminism got a black eye. I think it lost a lot of its followers because of the lesbian issue that became attached to being a feminist. And because we are such a homophobic nation, the very thought of being a part of a movement that had quote-unquote &#8220;lesbians&#8221; in it, a lot of women backed away from that. And a lot of women backed away from being called feminist. Of course, you were ridiculed by men also. They were ridiculed, you know, as &#8220;bra burners,&#8221; and people that couldn&#8217;t get a husband, that type of thing. They did a lot of good, the white, liberal, highly educated feminists, they did a lot of good. And some things that they did in the legal community backfired, and that&#8217;s why we ended up having these homemakers&#8217; laws, for homemakers that got left after they had been married for x number of years, and their husband would leave them and they wouldn&#8217;t qualify for their Social Security if they were divorced, and you had to be married--. At first, it was twenty years, to get your husband&#8217;s social security. And now it&#8217;s ten years to qualify for social security. But you had a lot of displaced homemakers because everything was equal, there was no-fault divorce, no cause to you or equal than everything&#8217;s going to be divided equally and what have you. We found out in this country, that all things being equal, the wife, the spouse that was a homemaker, did not have any resources to be able to make a living once that man did divorce her. So to not have him pay, quote-unquote, for his abandonment of this woman, really put this woman and the children into the welfare system and the poverty system. So that is where some of the no-fault divorces--. And men jumped on that with a vengeance, the male attorneys did. And they worked for their clients, and it was legal. But now, I think that we&#8217;re seeing more of a just justice when it comes to women with small children, and what these children are being given in a divorce action. JF: What was the relationship like between black women and white women when it came to these kinds of issues? You talked about how some of the efforts tended to favor certain women over others. SR: Well, I think in Knoxville, I didn&#8217;t see that there was any type of void that was because of the gender issues. If there was a void, it was because of the racial issues. In the North, I think that you may have had more divisiveness among women of color and white women because of the competition for the jobs, the competition to move up, the competition for the men that were available. For some reason, even though I was adamant about racism, some of my best friends were white. And color didn&#8217;t mean anything to us, and we still to this day have a relationship. We&#8217;re still friends. I think that when people get to know you, I think--. One woman, I can&#8217;t tell her name, because they would probably try and fire her if they could. But one woman worked where I worked on a job where they were trying to build up a case to terminate me, and they had her type up some things about my performance ability, which had been outstanding, that were untrue. And she gave me the papers and she was not used to black people, she&#8217;d never been around black people, but she said, &#8220;That&#8217;s not right.&#8221; It kind of reminded me of an old woman that I met in front of the post office after the election of President Obama. She said, &#8220;Did you vote for that that Obama guy?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221; And she looked around, as if she was afraid her husband or somebody would see her or hear her, and she said, &#8220;You know, I voted for him too.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good for you.&#8221; And then she looked around and she went away. So I think that until we stop being afraid of showing our humanity, I think we&#8217;re still going to be in this upheaval in this country where the Nazi party is coming here on Saturday, August the 14th. I don&#8217;t choose to go and demonstrate against the American Nazi party; I don&#8217;t think these people are worth the dignity of protesting against them, because we know who they are and we know what they represent, and they don&#8217;t do anything--. They don&#8217;t care about this country. They want a white Aryan nation, and they uplift the white Aryan race. And there&#8217;s no reason for people that have risked their lives for equality, risked their lives to vote, demonstrated so that they could have a decent life in America--. I wouldn&#8217;t take two steps to go confront those people, because I don't think their cause is a cause that rises to the level of us wanting to protest against them. I think they&#8217;re better off being ignored, and that is what I have chosen to do with these groups. Is to ignore them. JF: And now you&#8217;re currently president of the Knoxville chapter of the NAACP? SR: Yes, I am. JF: What kind of opportunities have women had in the NAACP, in leadership roles, as organizers, as activists? SR: Nothing&#8217;s been our limit to the opportunities women have had. One of the--. The president and CEO of NAACP has been Merilee Evers. We have had Julian Bond as a good friend of ours, and when he retired last year, another African American female took his place. So I think that the NAACP as well as the Urban League, I think there is definitely still a need for these organizations. And we would like to say that we live in a colorblind society. But we don&#8217;t. You can look at Sarah Palin and her popularity. Look at the Tea Party and its popularity. Look at the American Nazis and their popularity. And you know that we don&#8217;t live in a colorblind society. As long as we have these people who would not let you live freely in a society, then there needs to be organizations in place that can take these people out of their game, take them out of the system. The Southern Poverty Law Center has done a great deal in suing the Klan, hitting them where it hurts. Something similar to when the FBI took out Al Capone over his taxes. The Southern Poverty Law Center went after the Klan and won. We don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ll ever be fully paid, but--. JF: Can you explain how that came about, what happened there? SR: Well, right now, I would have to jog my memory. But the Klan is--. JF: Can you tell us about the Southern Poverty Law Center? SR: Oh, the Southern Poverty Law Center is run by Morris Dees. And Morris Dees is a man of great courage and great honor, who has dedicated his life to civil rights. The Southern Poverty Law Center, along with other legal organizations, have taken the Klan to task for the damages they have done to people and what they have been done, and they&#8217;ve been sued, and they have won against them in courts. And I will do some research on that to give you some specific cases--. JF: That&#8217;s okay. SR: --to let you know which ones I&#8217;m talking about. JF: It&#8217;s interesting that this organization links poverty and race together. Is that--. Can you tell me a little bit about how you feel about that? The connections between poverty and race? SR: Well, I think it&#8217;s a very close connection between poverty and race, because most of your poor people, the poorest people in the country, are people of color. And these people receive the less education, and they receive an inferior education, because they go to schools that were inferior, because they&#8217;re in a poor section of town. And they don&#8217;t get the same books and materials and teachers and what have you, that they get in the upper income areas of towns. So when you have the poor people getting the less money in their families, less education, then they become prime targets for the prison system. And they become victims of their circumstance, and they go to what they feel is the only job that they feel they can be successful at. It&#8217;s wrong; I&#8217;m not condoning it, but it&#8217;s happened. They turn to drug-selling. And this has destroyed once-prosperous communities and once-prosperous cities. This nightmare of the drug trade, it&#8217;s happened in Southern Appalachia with the methamphetamine, with the meth and the--. I can&#8217;t recall the name of it, but they call it the white man&#8217;s cocaine. The crack cocaine in the black community. So these people that are poor, they are needing the services of lawyers to help them keep a job, go to a good school. Go to a school that is not disproportionately funded because it&#8217;s a predominately black school. Here in Knoxville, we have one school that is predominantly black, that was the old Austin High School, where everybody went, all the black kids went. We could go no place else. We had tremendous leaders, tremendous citizens to come out of that school. And it merged with East High School, which was all white. It became Austin-East High School. White flight made this school predominantly black. Okay, now that school is one of the--. It&#8217;s not on the brink, it hasn&#8217;t happened yet. But it&#8217;s close to being put on a list of the worst schools in the state. And this is a school, when half of that school, Austin High School, that was once the greatest high school you had in Tennessee, for that matter. Not just here in Knoxville. We had leaders that were judges, they had Judge [William H.] Hastie, we have had people from Knoxville that have done great things in the country and in the world. We had a repository for that up at the Beck Cultural Center, and I hope that before you leave Knoxville, you&#8217;ll get to go up there and look at the repository of African American culture that they have available up there. But when you have poor people, you&#8217;re going to have the legal system involved, and Marian Wright Edelman, I just came from a program that she started with the Children&#8217;s Defense Fund. She had about five hundred to a thousand young people from across the country at the Alex Haley Farm this summer. And the object of this is to break the cycle from the playground to prison. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened: these kids are going from the playground--. They&#8217;re not investing in school, their parents are not invested in school, and they&#8217;re going to the prison. And the prison system, as you&#8217;re well aware, is one of the growing systems in this country. It&#8217;s one of the growing companies, one of the growing businesses, in this country, to house people. Who are you housing? You&#8217;re housing Latino, you&#8217;re housing African American, you&#8217;re housing people that were on this lower socio-economic strata of this country. And that needs to change. Marian Wright Edelman is a former member of SNCC, she is a civil rights icon, a contemporary of Dorothy Hyatt, several years younger than Dorothy Hyatt, but still a part of that sixties SNCC movement that went South and changed this country. And she bought Alex Haley&#8217;s farm for the Children&#8217;s Defense Fund when he died. Alex Haley, he was a good friend of ours, and he brought many people to Clinton, Tennessee, right outside of Knoxville. But he would say, &#8220;Find the good and praise it.&#8221; Find the good and praise it. And I don't think he had a bone in his body where he hated anybody of any color. And Marian having the Children&#8217;s Defense Fund there, I think, is a great legacy, not only for her but a legacy for what Alex stood for. And we have a statue of him also in Knoxville. Knoxville is a small Southern town to some, a small Southern backwater, but we have some things here in Knoxville that they don&#8217;t have any place else in the country. I mean African Americans, and I mean African American history. And it would take more than our short interview for me to discuss that [Laughter]. JF: How do you think the idea of civil rights has changed over the past thirty years? SR: Well, I think that civil rights has changed because the gays and the lesbian community, they want civil rights. And they compare their situation to the struggle for civil rights of African Americans in the sixties. Many African Americans object to that vehemently, because they feel that we were born with the color of our skin, and they feel that their lifestyle is a matter of choice. Personally, I don't think that anybody would choose to be gay in America, with the horrific way that they&#8217;re treated. I think that the Hispanic and the Latino community is under attack, and I think that they are wanting civil rights. I think that people are going to have to realize that you can&#8217;t go out and pick out a guy and say, &#8220;You&#8217;re illegally here, you&#8217;re an illegal,&#8221; or look at a Latino guy and say, &#8220;You&#8217;re legal,&#8221; or say, &#8220;Your children were born here; they&#8217;re Americans, but you&#8217;re not, so you have to leave." I think that what&#8217;s happening right now in the area of civil rights strikes at the very heart of what America stands for. Are we the land of the free, the humble, the brave, do we open our arms to all these people? Or do we close our borders and keep it safe for those who are here--whether they were brought here by slave trade or born here or are here because their families came over on the Mayflower? We&#8217;re going to have to make a decision in the national psyche as to what kind of country we want to be. And right now, on the issues of civil rights and social change, we are splitting. We are very much split. JF: Where do you see that split occurring? SR: I see that split occurring in the issue of civil rights between white America wanting to have illegal Latinos put out of the country, but how do you know who&#8217;s legal and who&#8217;s not legal if you don&#8217;t violate your civil rights in trying to find out who you are? Because I think nothing is more frightening than reminding you of Nazi Germany, when you had to have papers. And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to come down to if the laws in Arizona are allowed to stand. People are going to have to have papers to prove if you&#8217;re a legal or an illegal immigrant. Nobody is trying to defend illegal immigrants being here, but they&#8217;re here, and somehow they&#8217;ve been allowed to stay here. So when your laws are such that you have allowed this situation to exist, then the government needs to take steps to do what needs to be done to fix things, to either grant amnesty to people who are here illegally, or to build--. They&#8217;re trying to build a fence. They&#8217;ll never build a fence high enough or long enough or wide enough to keep people out. But they have to do some changes to either ensure these people that they&#8217;re welcome, or there&#8217;s going to be a civil war between the white people and people of color. Black people look at this with trepidation, because the Mexicans have taken a lot of jobs that the black people used to have. And it&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re supporting Latinos, but they know that if anything oppressive happens in America, we're not going to be far behind before it happens to us. So if you have one group of people that you have papers on that you must identify yourself with your papers, then it won&#8217;t be long before we probably think it won&#8217;t be long before they look at black people for the same. Chinese people, I think that the Chinese--. The Asian community has even filed suit for fear of them coming under the law in Arizona. So I think that the Obama presidency not only marked a turning point of greatness for this country in the area of civil rights, but it has also, as time has passed, brought out the undercurrents of hatred of civil rights in this country. And I think that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s having so many problems. There are people here who can just not get their arm around a black man being competent and good enough, and smart enough, and educated enough to lead this great nation. When I compare him to who just left, it&#8217;s just a mockery. It&#8217;s just an insult to think that this man could not lead this country. JF: How has the role of religion in civil rights changed over the past thirty or forty years? SR: I think that we have become more secular; I don&#8217;t think that the ministers are at the forefront of the civil rights community as they once were. The only place that we could meet was in the black church and in the black homes, and I think the black church has facilitated that. I think when Bush started his &#8220;thousand points of light&#8221; and started his program of--. And I can&#8217;t remember the term, where they give money for churches to do social things, I can&#8217;t remember what it&#8217;s called. JF: The faith-based--. SR: Faith-based! Faith-based initiatives. I think those faith-based initiatives were used to remove a lot of ministers from the civil rights movement, because they did not want to lose money that was being given out by raising sand over social issues that certain administrations felt were not important. JF: Well, is there anything that you thought I would ask that I haven&#8217;t, or anything that you&#8217;d like to bring up that we haven&#8217;t touched on? SR: I can&#8217;t think of anything right now. If I do, I will sure let you know. I have enjoyed discussing my life with you. If there&#8217;s one thing I would add, it&#8217;s that I think that one good thing that has come of the civil rights movement is that there is a sisterhood between black women that we may never have had before, but it&#8217;s on a much larger scale, and it&#8217;s made possible by the revolution in communications and contact. Because I am very blessed to have friends that have--. That we&#8217;ve been together for over twenty-five or thirty years. We love each other, not because of blood, but because of love. And I think that that camaraderie, that friendship, that fellowship, that support group, that African American women have for one another, I think it boils over into manifesting actions for our schools, for our young people that are incarcerated. I think that we form organizations whose sole goal is to do whatever is good for the African American race. And that&#8217;s one of the greatest things, I feel, that has come out of the civil rights movement. JF: If you&#8217;d like to leave any message to future generations of women? SR: If I could leave any message, it would just be that the answer to everything is love. It really is. It took me fifty years to realize that--. I won&#8217;t count the ten years from when I was one to ten, I didn&#8217;t know myself to know. But I think that, from the things I&#8217;ve seen as a little kid until today, I think that when we stop hating one another because of our differences, and love one another because of what we have in common as members of the community of man, of the community of human beings, then that would solve so much of the problems that we&#8217;re having in the world today. Because as an African American female, I speak on the issue of the environment, I speak on the issue of global warming, I speak on the issue of strip mining. Because if we don&#8217;t come together as a people, with one voice, one world, one vision for what&#8217;s going to be the best for this planet, we&#8217;re not going to be here. And then it won&#8217;t matter whether you&#8217;re black or Latino or Jew or gentile, or what have you, because nothing&#8217;s going to be left. So that&#8217;s what I--. If I would say anything, it would be that we need to stop hating and start loving and start caring for this planet before we destroy it. I guess you can tell from talking to me that I&#8217;m a pacifist. I think that all nuclear weapons should be disarmed. I&#8217;m for total global disarmament, and I think that if we don&#8217;t do that, then we could have an accident that could start a cataclysm that could also destroy this world. And we&#8217;ve just got to stop hating and start to live together. That&#8217;s about all I can say. JF: Well, thank you so much for sharing your time and stories with us. SR: Okay. You&#8217;re more than welcome...
