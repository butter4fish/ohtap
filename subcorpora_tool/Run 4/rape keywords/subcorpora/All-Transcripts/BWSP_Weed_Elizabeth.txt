 Barbara Raab: If you could just introduce yourself, and just give us like a little bullet point run-down of the different positions that youâve held here at Brown. Elizabeth Weed: Iâm Elizabeth Weed, and I came to Brown in, I actually got my PhD at Brown, but after that, I came back to Brown in 1977 as the Director of the Sarah Doyle Womenâs Center. And then I was founding Associate Director of the Pembroke Center, and aâ¦ also founding editor of differences, a Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, and a faculty adjunct in Womenâs Studies and in Modern Culture and Media. Raab: And then you were Director of the Pembroke Center for a while. Weed: Oh yeah, I was, I was with the Pembroke Center forever. From 1981 until I retired in 2000. So, I was a, I wasâwhat, Associate Director, I was Acting Director, I was Associate Director, I was Acting Director, I was Director, I was Director for ten years. Raab: Okay and now just officially you are retired from Brown, is thatâ¦ Weed: I am retired, yeah. This is the first year Iâm not teaching, so Iâm really retired. Raab: So I just want to, just, ask you a couple of other things kind of, chronology-wise just to be sure that, that I understand this. So you came to Brown as the part-time Director, or the first Directorâ Weed: No, full time. Raab: Not the part-time Director of Sarah Doyle, initially? Weed: Full time. Raab: Okay. Weed: I would not have come for a part-time job, right? Raab: In â77. Weed: Mhmm. 1 Raab: What was the year that you received your PhD from Brown? Weed: â73. Raab: And so then in those ensuing years you were teaching at Wheaton. Weed: I was teaching at Wheaton from 1970â Raab: But, continuing to live in Providence? Weed: Yeah, why? Raab: Well, Iâm just trying to get a sense of whetherâ¦ when you came to Brown as the Director of Sarah Doyle, you had still been living in the community and you knew people here. You werenât coming back sort of with no community, right? You were here that whole time. Weed: I knew one or two people. Raab: Okay. So, when, did you know Louise Lamphere? Weed: Not until I came back. Raab: So, can you just talk a little about how you first met her? When you first met her? Weed: I donât remember exactly our first meeting. Butâ¦ So was Louise here in seventyâwhen the Consent Decree was signed in â77, where was Louise? Raab: She was not here in â77. Weed: Right, so I didnât meet her then until she came back. Raab: But thatâs why I was wondering since you had been here as a student and then continued to have your home base here, whether she and othersâ Weed: No. Raab: â¦in her either professional or social circleâ¦ Weed: No. I didnât know her. I mean, graduate students didnât know people in Anthropology. I was a graduate student in French; I didnât know people in Anthropology. You know, itâs not the way it worked. So I really didnât know her untilâ¦ I came back as an employee at Brown and then she, and when she came back. And I donât remember the exact year when she came back. But then I, then I was, you know, 2 with her all the time because she was very much part of the feminist community and we were working on developing Womenâs Studies. And yeah, and we became good friends and so forth. Raab: So weâll get to all that in a minute. But, one of the things Iâm curious about is when you were teaching at Wheaton, the lawsuit at least during part of that time was under way. Were you aware of it? Weed: No. Raab: Did you know about it? Weed: Not much. I mean, I followed it somewhat. But, it was not something, you know, I lived in Providence but my professional life was there. And I really wasnât paying that much attention to the lawsuit. Raab: And then when you, well how did it happen that you actually ended up coming back here to be the Director of Sarah Doyle? Weed: Because the outlook for French Studies was not terrific in those days. And I had, actually while I was at Wheaton I had been doing some feminist development. Working on developing programs in feminist theory and so forth. And this job was open and I first looked at it and said, âI donât want to run a womenâs center. I have no interest in that whatsoever.â But, it turned out that the description of the job was a feminist research center. So the peopleâand I want to talk about where that came from. But it was the, it was developing the Womenâs Studies, developing feminist scholarship and so forth part that interested me. So thatâs why I took the job. Because I saw that there might be some interesting future. And there was. Raab: So you, you know, answered an ad kind of thing? It was just a job that was posted and you said, âOh, that looks interesting,â? Or was it that you knew it because you were friends with some of the people who were also interested in that kind of scholarship. Weed: A person, a friend of mine, brought it to my attention. And said, âListen, this is something you should look at.â So. Raab: And so when, Iâm assuming that when you applied for this job, it was probably sometime in 1976ish, [5:00] right? Weed: I guess. Raab: And the case was not settled by then. The case was ongoing at that point. So I was just trying to get a sense of when you became reallyâso here youâre coming to, to do what you thought was start a feminist research center at Brown, and yet thereâs this kind of raging sex discrimination lawsuit under way. 3 Weed: Yeah, which was a good thing. I mean by the time that I figured out that it was happening and so forth, I thought, âNo, this is excellent. This is excellent. This is a good sign; things are happening at Brown.â Raab: A person could have thought, âOh my God, I donât want to go there.â Weed: Thatâs not me. Raab: WhatâTalk a little bit more about what made you say, âExcellent. Good.â Weed: Because I thought the job had potential, and I wanted to be in Providence. Raab: But you had no concerns about coming to a campus whereâ¦ Weed: No, on the contrary, if youâre going to go to a campusâa university and try to change the way people think about the production of knowledge, you want somebody to be suing the university for sex discrimination. I mean this is a good thing, not a bad thing. Raab: Okay, so you come here in the fall of â77. Weed: Yeah, in August, actually. August first, yeah. Raab: And by this point there is a Consent Decree. Weed: Yes. Raab: And Iâm assuming you were aware of that? Weed: Yes. Oh, very much so. Yes. Raab: Talk about that a little bit. Did you, do you, I know itâs a long time ago, but do you have, do you remember kind of what your reaction was to the fact that now there was a settlement of this suit, which in many ways did a lot of great things for women at Brown. But, there was no trial. Weed: Let me just tell youâ¦ let me just tell youâthere was no what? Raab: No trial. Weed: Oh no, that wasâ¦ the fact that it was a Consent Decree was a very good thing. And, you know, I just, I have, I was thinking about what was it like when I came here in August of â77. And there were three things going on in myâthree things that I was, I was attuned to. The first thing was that Brown had 4 become a hot school. From the time I left to the time I came back, Brown was a hot school. The reason it was a hot school was because of the New Curriculum. Period. And so all of these exciting academic things were happening. And that, I was very attracted to that. So yeah, so so the whole, the whole world of, of the university was beginning to change. And Brown was at the forefront of these changes. And so, you know, there were things like modes of thought courses and independent studies and so forth, but thereâindependent concentrations. There were also in the departments, you know, various faculty, particularly in the humanities and in Anthropology, faculty, and Anne Fausto-Sterling as a, as a one exception for the sciences, you know really beginning to question the foundations of their disciplines in exciting ways. And so, the kind of feminist scholarship that was going on in that context, that was just beginning in that context, the kind of courses that Louise and Anne Fausto-Sterling were offering were sort of part of that whole thing. Okay so that was one thing that was going on. Another thing that was going on was institutional feminism. And that was because of the merger. So in 1971 thereâs a merger with Brown and Pembroke. And the most important thing in my mind that happened from that merger was the Minority Report. It was a Minority Report signed, in particular by Sophie Blistein who became a friend, I knew Sophie quite well. That really called for some serious attention being given to women. Because they assumed, and they were absolutely right, that once Pembroke College, which was actually a more exclusive, selective college than the university, than Brown, than the Brown college, and that was extremely well respected, that all of the strengths and the wonderful uniqueness of Pembroke would just be folded into Brown. And of course everybody wants to be a man, right? We all want to just be Brown. And they were absolutely right to have that worry. Because I saw that happening in a number of different places in my little job that I had. So what they called for, and I brought this along because I, it, it it was so, itâs aboutâitâs connected to the Consent Decree. So the majority, the majority report on the merger recommended the merging of the offices of all college offices, which did not happen. The increase of the number of women students, which did happen. And an increase in the number of women faculty. Now, that did not happen until the Consent Decree. There was noâbetween 1971 and 1977 there was no increase in women faculty. It was the last thing on peopleâs minds [10:00]. The, the Minority Report, that was the Minority Report, this is wrong, thatâs a typo. Itâs the Minority Report that recommended that, and the Minority Report also recommended the establishment of a Womenâs Center to be charged with the development of special programs for women and to act as a research center and data bank for special problems of women in society. And that Minority Report kind of laid the groundwork for the institutional feminism that became stronger and stronger during the late seventies and into the eighties. Raab: Did you notice, you were, so you were a student here in the early seventies and you came back in â77. Iâm curious whetherâ Weed: I came as a graduate student in â64, and I left in â70. Raab: So what was your experience, just as a graduate student? A woman graduate student? And then coming back in â77. Just curious if you felt the atmosphere, the ambiance on campus for women was very different. Maybe talk about each of those periods of time. When you were here as a graduate studentâ¦ 5 Weed: I was teaching, I was teaching undergraduates and I saw the dynamic that was going on between the men and the women. The men used to go to Wheaton to get girlfriends because the Pembroke women were too smart. You know, it was as simple as that. I mean there was this, thereâs this real tension between the Pembroke women and the Brown men. And I donât know if that was, like, everywhere. But in my French classes, I saw it. And, you know, they were, they were, it was hard times. The late sixties were hard times to, to be an undergraduate at Brown because they were struggling against the parietals, they really wanted, the women really wanted to get rid of it. Rid of the parietals, rid of the whole, you know that sort of constrictive system. And, you know, historical change was in the air, so. And thatâs what I knew, thatâs what I saw. And then when I came back I saw that things were changing. Things had changed quite a bit, yeah. Raab: So you said you wanted to return to what you mentioned about what seemed appealing to you about coming here. Weed: Well, no, I want to return to what I was saying. There were three things; I didnât get to the third thing. Raab: Iâm sorry. Weed: There were three things. The one was that intellectual excitement. The, sort of, change in the whole way that we think about the production of knowledge. Two, was institutional feminism thanks to the Minority Report. And three was this other thing, which was what happened after the Consent Decree. So I come in; I have a job in a brand-new little Womenâs Center. Not totally brand-new, it had been in existence for a couple of years. And I have only an adjunct faculty appointment. I am, I am dog shit, right? [laughing] As far as a lot of these faculty were concerned. I was nobody. I mean, zero. Next to nobody. Beneath nobody. And I had to interact with all these faculty about promoting feminist scholarship. What a great job, right? And so I was very, very attuned to the atmosphere after the Consent Decree. And of course this was, Iâm sure this had been building up all those years that I wasnât there. And I think there, again I think there were three different reactions. Now Iâm, I donât want to give the impression that the entire faculty and administration were this way. There were many wonderful fellow travelers among the men, and so forth. But there were certain quarters of the university where there was intense displeasure about the Consent Decree. And the three reactions wereâone was anger. Because you have to understand that up until the Consent Decree faculty departments did whatever the hell they wanted. It was total autonomy. All the business we have now about, you know, procedures in order to guarantee transparency when it comes to recruiting, and hiring and promoting and tenuring, nothing like that existed. A guy in Brown called up his friend at Princeton and said, âSend me your best graduate student.â They hired him. And if the guy got along with everybody and fit in and if they thought his work was good, they gave him tenure. You know, I mean, it was just outrageous to these people that, that an outside body, a court, would have anything, could interfere with their autonomy. So that was anger. There was also fear or apprehension. And that was that this whole process was going to bring in hordes of inferior people, women, who would ruin the university, and undermine [15:00] academic freedom. 6 Raab: So this was a misunderstanding of what the Consent Decree required. It did not require accepting anybody with credentials that were less. Weed: Right, well you just try to convince people of that, right? Because, and this, this brings me to the third thing, which is contempt, there was in a lot of peopleâs minds no way on earth that a womanâs credentials could be equal to menâs. Period. That it doesnât matter what it says on paper, itâs not the same because itâs a woman. You have to understand this deep, deep misogyny. And so I, I just, I sort of absorbed, I mean I just was fascinated by the sort of intensity of the contemptuous dismissal of the possibility that women could work on an equal footing. So, I mean, they didnât, for example, there would be these excuses âWell thereâs no pool of applicants. Thereâs no pool.â It would never occur to them that there was no pool because there had been systemic discrimination against women in engineering from the beginning and therefore thereâs a very small pool. And that, if someone emerged at the top of that pool it was probably because they had worked harder than anybody else, and they were probably better than anybody else, right? That was beyond imagination for a lot of these people. Raab: Can I just ask, how were you hearing these things? How were these things coming out? Weed: They were said, they were talk. I mean many many different venues. And I was, you know, my job was going around to various departments and talking about encouraging people to bring in feminist scholars for, to give lectures. Because one of the things we were trying to do is to get some of these more recalcitrant departments like Economics and so forth, to just invite one feminist scholar in the field, and just sort of let them get a little more acquainted with the idea of a woman speaking about their field. So, I came into contact with people in all different contexts: In faculty meetingsâI mean, you know, Iâ¦ Raab: And so people really had no shame or embarrassmentâ¦ Weed: No. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And there are still quarters in the university where a certain kind of contemptuous dismissal of a woman in a field would still happen. Raab: Can I ask youâ Weed: Itâs veryâI mean, did you hear just what I said? This is 2014. There are still places where this can happen today. Itâs much much rarer. And itâs probably a lot harder to get away with, but it still happens and I know that for a fact. Raab: At that time, I know there were not a lot of women faculty on campus, but was there any consensus among the women faculty who you met, and spoke to or heard from, about their feelings about this Consent Decree? Was there unanimity that this was a terrific thing? Weed: Yeah I mean all the women I dealt with were feminist types. So I donât know about the others, you know. I mean, I suppose some people felt a little threatened. Because itâs very hard when you have the powers-that-be believing that women scholars are inferior, to then be outed as a woman, right? [laughs] 7 And, so, I mean hereâs some poor woman whoâs trying to make your way in Geology or something and suddenly youâre a woman! And, you know, itâs a very difficult situation. But of course, the people I worked with were, were, were not people who felt like that. But I mean Louise was considered byâ¦ I donât know, I canât say percentages, but a significant percentage of the people at Brown as inferior, and totally unworthy of having gotten tenure. And because itâs not only that she was a woman, but that she was doing feminist work, which was absolutely beyond the pale and made people throw up. So these, these were very primitive times. And you know, you have to understand the passion with which people had these feelings. I mean it wasnât just abstract. They were angry, they were apprehensive, and they had enormous contempt. And it was enough people so that I have vivid memories, okay? And it was not just, it was not just faculty, there were also some administrators. And fortunately I have a very thick skin, and a sense of humor, and I know how to [20:00] be insincere and ingratiating and so forth and so on. So I got along fine. And I think all of us had strategies for dealing with these creeps. Raab: What do you mean by that? Weed: Well you all have your strategy, you know? Raab: Well here you came here to, what you thought was build a feminist studies centerâ Weed: I knew, no I knew what I was getting into. I mean, I, the thing that I didâlook I had, I had done some of this work at Wheaton trying to have a program of femâa yearlong program of feminist scholarship, right? And even though Wheaton was a womenâs college, there were plenty of nervous people at Wheaton. It didnât come as a shock to me that there was this enormous contempt. No, I justâ¦ you know itâsâ¦ Brown is bigger and the stakes were bigger. But it was fun because we were all working together, you know? I mean, Louise was, Louise was a terrific person to have done this because she assumed leadership without, you know, without it being explicit. I mean she was, she was just a terrific political person herself, and a very easy person to work with. Raab: I know you werenât here when she went up for tenure, and you didnât actually come here until after the Consent Decree was signed, but is there, do you have any sense that when sheâfirst of all initially, and again you werenât here, but she requested to go up early for tenure and I believe that request was just out and out turned down. And then she went up for tenure on scheduleâdo you think she had any sense at that point, one: that she was going to run into trouble, two: Weed: I canât speak to it, I donât know! I didnât know Louise at the time! Raab: I thought maybe youâd talked about it since. Weed: All I know is what Iâve heardâyou know, what I heard afterwards. It, I gather that, Iâm sorry to interrupt you, but I mean I just donât know any of the answers to those questions. Iâm the ambiance person, right? I just, I think from listening to Louise at the time and then more recently, that if she had not started doing feminist work she might have had an easier time of it. 8 Raab: And is it, well, I know you werenât here but even in your discussions with her, do you think she kind of knew that in real time? Or kind of after the fact. Weed: I donât know, you have toâ¦ Iâm not the person, I canât answer question that I donât know. Raab: So one thing we talked about on the phone was I think what you talked about as a rich network of support for her on campus, and Iâm really interested in that. Can you talk about that? When you say a rich network of support, what do you mean? Weed: After that wonderful minority report, after the merger, there were a number of people on campus who got to work right away and made the Womenâs Center thing happen. The two people I remember very clearly because they were there for me to work with when I arrived, was Karen Romer, who was the Associate Dean of the College, whoâs fantastic and really one of the great architects of the New Curriculum and all of the things that went, like feminist studies and womenâs studies. And Kay Hall who was a sociologist and, and was terrific about, you know, getting the statistics that we needed, the data that we needed, the proof that we needed about, you know, what was going on, where. And they and a number of other people, faculty, people like Louise and Anne Fausto-Sterling and so forth, started a group of faculty, administrative group. And they got to work right away. And so before I even came to the job, I was getting memos from, we didnât have email in those days, I was getting actual memos in paper from Karen Romer saying, âHereâs some good things for you to know.â And so I came into a community of people who were working to build a feminist program at Brown. Raab: And when you say you would get memos, you know, âHereâs some things you should know,â meaning what? About what weâre thinking about with respect toâ¦ Weed: Yeah, what this faculty group has done and the kinds of courses that weâre trying to work on. And just anything that was relevant. And so I really came feeling that, you know, I had a great group of people to work with. And it was true. And then of course, excuse me, the faculty and administration are there over the long haul, and then there are students who come in and out. And there would be students who would be very interested in some of the programs that we were doing and were very helpful. So yeah, it was a terrific [25:00] group of people. And then, and then the, what was interesting was this same group had convinced the administration to revive the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair which is the first chair, and only chair that had been established for women, and it had been defunct because ever since Rosemaryâ¦whatâs her nameâ¦ Raab: The Dean of Pembroke. Weed: No, no, not Rosemary Pierrel but the first person to hold the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair. Iâm sorry, she died. And then after that it just disappeared. And they convinced the administration to revive it in this context of this sort of institutional feminism. So this is, so things are sort of percolating, so. What they did at the beginning, because it wasnât funded, it wasnât fully funded by any means, was agree to bring in a 9 visiting faculty person for a semester. Just one semester. To be a visiting person in the chair. And the first person who came in was Lynn Aston. Absolutely amazing woman. A psychologist who did educational psychology from UCLA, a Greek woman who was so seductive. None of the administrators could resist her; I mean she was so incredibly wonderful. And she was the one who worked with the group of us, I mean, say, bring in this distinguished person from outside, and sheâs able to have a certain kind of leverage with the facâwith the administration that some of the people who had been working here for a long time didnât have. And so she really was instrumental in convincing the people to, the administration, the upper administration, to get serious about the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair. Raab: What year was this, about? â79-ish? Weed: Yeah weâre talking late seventies. To fund the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair and to hire a permanent person. Raab: And thatâs when Joan Scottâ¦ Weed: And this is a huge thing, right. And then the second person came, who came in, the next year, I think it was â79, was an economist Ann Seidman. And Ann Seidman and I worked on this, and a team of students and faculty, worked on this program of having a, throughout, I think it was spring semester, having a program in every single department on campus that was appropriate (I mean it wasnât, we didnât have anything in Physics) that had a feminist speaker, a feminist scholar speak. And that was huge. I mean, youâre talking about every single department including Economics, including, you know, Mathematics. Raab: So it, while all this is going on, you have this parallel track happening sort of writ large, which is the implementation of this Consent Decree. First of all, for you, were you at all involved in anything the AAMC did? Weed: No, no, because I was not a regularâI was an adjunct faculty member. Raab: So youâre doing your stuff that youâre describing over here, and at the same time you have, kind of at the university, there is this whole new system now for evaluation, for hiring, for promotion, for tenure. Weed: Right. And so these departments are, some of them, pissed as hell, because theyâre having to take their candidates for jobs and so forth to the committee, and at the same time Iâm going in and saying, âWouldnât it be great [laughing] to have a feminist scholar come and give a lecture? We have money, weâll give it to you,â and so forth and so on. We had a little bit of money that we were trying toâ¦ Raab: So howâd that go? Weed: Yeah, well, it was great! It succeeded. And we had this program that went on all semester. And every single appropriate department participated in one way or another. But, yeah, I mean, you know, the 10 actual, as you said, I mean, the Consent Decree was not about to destroy academic freedom. It was not about to force people down peopleâs throats. It certainly was not intended to take jobs away from people of color. I mean, you know, Louise had tried to get that in there, that there would be an exception for any man of color who was offered a job, but that was not accepted. So, I mean, the, certainly the intention of the Consent Decree was very positive, very creative. But, it was not perceived that way. Raab: And did you find over the decadeâ Weed: If youâre the chair of a department, you do not think that this is a good thing. I mean youâre just, youâre just infuriated. And especially since youâve had to, you know, had it your own way for a long long time. Now, again, Iâm just talking about, and maybe Iâm exaggerating the resistance, maybe itâs not as great as I thought. People like [30:00] Karen Newman and so forth can talk about the reality of, of what people, you know, what the various department heads were like and so forth. Raab: But from where you sat, over that, letâs say decade or a little longer. Weed: Yeah, the absorber of, of contempt. I was the absorber of contempt. Raab: Yeah, did you notice over that period of time that maybe, you know, people realized that it, wasnât what, as terrible as they thought. Did you get a sense over that period of time, letâs say, Iâm calling it ten years, it was a little longer. But when the, when the Consent Decree was in effect, had not yet, you know gone, I forget the exact legal term, but, was in effect and was governing all of these procedures, that people over time kind of softened their position about what a disaster it was, or did you feel the whole entire timeâ Weed: I mean yes, I mean there was a softening. There was a softening. You know people get used to it. They actually hire a woman and she turns out to be, you know, not as castrating as they were afraid she, or not as stupid as they thought she would be. You know, all these things. Yes, of course things got better. Raab: And one other question: at that period, during that period of time, or even maybe when you first came here, do you remember whether undergraduates, undergraduate women, even undergraduate women who were very involved in the things you were working on, were even aware of this lawsuit, of the Consent Decree? Weed: I donât think they were very aware. I donât know, I donât know, were you? Raab: Well, I worked on the paper and I was, becauseâ¦ Weed: So you were on the paper, yeah I donât know. I mean they were very involved in their own projects. I mean, the students helped a lot with this year long, or this semester long extravaganza of programs and so forth. And they were certainly aware that not all the male faculty were thrilled with feminism [laughing]. You know, I mean they were a group of wonderful students, I donât know, I never 11 remember when, but it was probably in the eighties, who, yes it was definitely the mid-eighties, who, who, went to department chairs and asked to speak to departments about sexual harassment. Which I thought was incredibly ballsy. I mean theyâre going, these are undergraduates speaking at a departmental meeting explaining what sexual discrimination, sex discrimination was like in the classroom. And I thought that was wonderful. They were terrific. Raab: Do you, so, but most of the undergraduates were not explicitly aware that there had been this suit, that there had been, that there was this Consent Decree, soâ Weed: No, nor should they have been, really. Raab: To what degree, looking back at it, to what degree do you think its existence, the lawsuit, the Consent Decree and the things that went on because of it, had any effect, or maybe had none? Weed: It totally changed the university. The university was never the same again. It changed everything! I mean, it changed everything. Now, Iâm a little biased. I suppose that if I had been inâ¦ you know, a certain area of physics, or something, I might not have noticed that anything changed. But it changed everything. And, I was fortunate enough to find this morning this chart that shows the percentage of tenured faculty women at various institutions, and this is from 1976 to 1986. And Brown is way on the top. Raab: And that is, I would presume, the direct effect of the goals and timetables for hiring, promotion and tenure. Weed: Thatâs exactly right. Exactly right. Because if you look at Columbia, Harvard, and Yale, youâre seeing a very very different story. And of course these are tiny numbers, too. Weâre not talking about huge numbers; weâre talking about having gone at Brown from three percent in 1976 to eleven percent in 1986. This is not huge. But, those numbers are really great. And other institutions really paid attention to the Lamphere suit. Raab: And you are persuaded that the line would not look like that had there been no Lamphere suit? Weed: Oh, itâs absolutely, itâs a fact. Raab: Despite the other things that were going on on campus, that weâve talked about? Weed: Campus things had, would have had no effect whatsoever. And thatâs why I mention that the Minority Report had, had demanded or whatever that there be more women on campus. That would never happen! I mean where was this impetus going to come from? Raab: And the undergraduates would, their actions [35:00] would not have made that happen? 12 Weed: Undergraduates are going to get the departments toâno. I mean I think that this idea that somehow it was in the air and it was all going to change, I think itâs a fantasy. Iâm sorry. I mean, I hate to be hyper realistic, but these departments, these academic departments, are powerful and entrenched. They have certain notions about what is good, what is acceptable, and how business is done. And there was no way that they were going to change the way that they did business just because a thousand undergraduates demanded it. Or just because Gloria Steinem is making speeches, or because even, even because some maybe law was being passed federally. Iâm sorry. Itâs about, itâs about your work, about your profession, itâs about the way you think about the practice of history or the practice of chemistry or whatever. I mean, youâre not going to be, say, âOh, you know what, I really ought to give some thought to the fact that weâre all white men.â Raab: Well, along those lines, and I donât know if youâre in a position to speak to this, but Iâll ask anyway. Judge Pettine was, was pretty out there, for a establishment, Rhode Island, downtownâ Weed: God bless him. Raab: Do you have any sense at all, again, I donât know if this is like anywhere near your circles of experienceâ Weed: All I know is he is a saint. Saint Pettine. And I know that, yeah. Raab: But, in some waysâ¦ looking at it before it ever happened, one could have thought that he would have the same, heâd be kind of like one of these department chairs. He kind of came from that world. Weed: No, he was at, he was a judge and he was a lawyer. And I donât, I have no idea what â Raab: He belonged to the University Club Weed: Okay. Raab: Was part of that establishment. And so, Weed: But do you, are you saying that he made his decision because he was a good guy? Raab: No, Iâm not saying anything. Iâm saying what was your perception, was it surprising, and again I donât know if this is a partâ Weed: I think if we had waited around for the good guys to come along and change things, we wouldnât have seen anything yetâ¦ I mean, good guys, itâs nice to have some good guys, there were good guys. Yeah, there was Judge Pettine, who read the law in a certain way, and I donât know his formation, and I donât know what got him to read the law the way he read the law. And we certainly had wonderful, as I said, male fellow travelers on campus. But, that would not have been enough to change. 13 Raab: Well what about some of the things Iâve heard about for years that I donât really have first hand knowledge of but maybe you do. These so-called âsmoking gunsâ or the so-called âsmoking gunâ that may have made a big difference. Do youâ Weed: Yeah, God bless the âsmoking guns,â too. Raab: Can you talk about those? Weed: No. Raab: Why not? Weed: Because itâs not my position to do that. Raab: Itâs forty years later. Weed: No, itâs Louiseâs choice to speak about smoking guns, not mine. Raab: Okay. Weed: I certainly know all about smoking guns. But, I thinkâ Raab: How smokingâwell let me ask you thisâ Weed: I mean the thing is look, if, if someone is going to write something so egregious in a letter or in a memo, or whatever, that it could be used as a smoking gun, it just demonstrates what Iâm saying about the contempt for women. I mean it doesnât even occur to the person who does this, that this might be an actionable act. That this, this might not be something that should be written down. So there wasnât even that sense of propriety, which now of course there is. I mean people know they have to, you know, have to avoid using certain words, and avoid saying certain things. I mean, thereâs propriety now. But there wasnât even propriety in the old days. Raab: Well, was it your sense, and again, I know you donât want to get specific about it, but based on what you know, that had those things been made public for a trial or some other way, that at that time, they would have been smoking guns to anybody who were to see them, or read them. Or were theyâ Weed: I think people wouldâve thought that, âI wouldâve said the same thing but boy, was that stupid to write it down!â Raab: Were they things that had this, had this case gone to trial, probably would have sunk the university? Or maybe not so much? 14 Weed: What would sink theâI donât understand what are you saying? Raab: I donât know what was in those papers, but I suppose if there were explicitâ Weed: Look it, if the university [40:00] was concerned enough by the smoking guns to go for a Consent Decreeâ¦ Raab: Is that you sense of why that happened? Weed: Youâre asking the wrong person. Iâm not, I am not going to just, you knowâ¦ I donât know. Talk to other people. Talk to Don Rohr, and talk to Maurice Glicksman if you can, and talk to Louise, and the people who really know. So, yeah. Raab: Other things that you may want to say about kind of the caseâs effect on the university, weâre now in 2014, hereâs the state of Brown. Just to kind of, kind of step way back and talk about the legacy. Weed: I think, you know, I mean, I really do think that feminist, organized feminism and academic feminism did a number of good things, in the seventies and eighties. And some things not so great. But I think that this very careful choice of whom to sue and when, whom to bring a Consent DecreeâI mean a class action suit against, and when, is just brilliant feminist strategy. You know, I mean, Louise gave a great deal of thought and strategy to this suit. Raab: I havenât heard that before; can you just explain a little bit more? Weed: I mean it was part ofâ¦ institutional feminism, or, you know, feminists working within institutions at the time were trying to figure out, âHow do we change these monoliths?â I mean, what do you do? If youâre going to wait around for the good guys to recognize that we are also smart, you know, weâll all be dead. So, so, Consent, I mean, why do I keep calling it consentâclass action suits are, is a strategy. I mean Louise isnât the only one to have done it. Sheâs one of the few to succeed. But, so these were, I mean, so, so, so it wasnât, you know, Louise didnât pull it out of thin air. It was a, it was a strategy available to people and I feel, I always, I was just always in awe of how skillfully and carefully Louise and her team did it. Raab: Well, and I know you said earlier, you werenât here earlier when those decisions were made. Weed: No, but I was here, I was very much a paâprivy to the personal team after the Consent Decree. And at that point, there were still things that needed to be done. And things that needed to be worked on, and fine points and so forth. And I saw how these people worked. And they were serious, really serious, principled and enormously smart. Raab: And when you talk about the team, are you talking about the legal team? 15 Weed: No, no, no. Well, I mean Iâm talking about Louiseâs group of friends and then also the way they worked with their lawyers, yeah. Yeah. And, itâs sort of a personal team and an extended team, yeah. Raab: So on the issue of, of making this a class action, or attempting to and succeeding in making it a class action, again I know you were not here at the time but from what you now know, was the impetus for that from the lawyers, was it from Louise? Weed: I donât know, ask Louise. But I do know that it was a feminist move. I mean this is how you do systemic change, right? Itâs not individual; itâs systemic. And Louise was all about the systemic and had the analysis of the systemic and you know it wasâ¦ Raab: Well and as you probably know, there came a point just sort of before there was actually a Consent Decree, when, if I have my facts straight, I think Howard Swearer offered three or four of the women in the case, you know, an opportunity for their tenure cases to be reviewed if they would drop the suit. And they, if I have this right, said âNo.â Which is part of what youâre talking about, which is this isnât just about give me mine. Weed: And it is very much a feminist strategy that was available to people. And they used it. And they used it well, and they used it with principle. And they, you know, it was just a great example of, of a certain feminist success. I mean there are other things I think have not been so successful in feminist efforts. But that, that use of the, of the lawsuit I thought was terrific. Raab: Anything else that I should have asked you and it didnât occur to me to ask you that youâd like to talk about? Weed: Well no, I mean, I was thinking back aways when I was talking about the contempt factor. â¦Weâre so used, now, to the [45:00] â¦ identity politics, which Iâm not thrilled with, but you know weâre so used to being sensitive to questions of gender and questions of race and so forth. And, these were not questions thatâ¦ came, these were not sensitivities that came natural, naturally to people. And Iâm thinking, just to use the example of race: Howard Swearer was a terrific president, and as Iâve said elsewhere and as I will say over and over again, none of the great things that happened at Brown could have happened anyplace but Brown, and we were very lucky to have Howard Swearer as President because he was enlightened and he was terrific and he was very helpful in many ways. But, he, he also needed to be brought along in terms of his sensitivity regarding things like gender and race. And I think about the race thing in particular because it wasâ¦ and I donât remember the time, but Joan Scott was still here so it must have been the early eighties when some kind of egregious racial attack had happened or something and there was, you know in those days there were always these wonderful âcommunity meetings,â and I remember Joan Scott being on stage saying, âThere is racism on the Brown campus,â and Howard Swearer being on stage saying, âThere is not racism on the Brown campus.â Because you didnât say that, that our wonderful institution was racist. That was unthinkable to even say that, you know? And I thought Joan was incredibly brave, saying, âThere is racism on this campus.â That even, 16 even just to think that way was revolutionary. And this is, letâs say, 1984, â83, â84. So, I think that one has to imagine what the mindset was in those, in those days. Raab: Well whatâs interesting about that when you say it, what jumps to my mind is, Louise Lamphere said, and brought a lawsuit to say, âThere is sexism on this campus.â Weed: Exactly, thatâs why Iâm saying it. Raab: And the Consent Decree, at the end of the dayâ¦ one of the things that happened because there was a settlement, and a settlement extremely favorable to the plaintiffs, was nonetheless, nobody had to officially, legally, admit that there was sexism on campus. Weed: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And thatâs exactly what Iâm trying to say. So, now, weâre very very familiar with things like racism and sexism and homophobia and all that stuff. But, this was not the way people were, were accustomed to thinking, in the eighties. At least, not everybody. Raab: Or in the seventies. Weed: Of course, our littleâof course, certainly not the seventies. Our little radical groups, you know, of feminists and so forth, of course we were. I mean we were, we were thinking in those terms all the time. You know, we were thinking of systemic femiâsystemic sexism, systemic racism. But, the very idea of systemic anything was just not in the air. So. Raab: For anyone to, so for Louise Lamphere to say, âThere is sexism in my departmentâ¦â Weed: Absolutely. Absolutely. Raab: ââ¦on this campus,â was a really radical act. Weed: Huge, huge! So yeah, so she was incredibly brave and smart to say that in 1970-whatever the first time she said it. And, and yet in 19, letâs say 83, I remember very distinctly going down to Joanâs office after she stood on stage and said that, and said, âYouâre brave Joan. Iâm proud to know you.â So, how many years later? Itâs still scary to say thereâs racism on campusâso, you know, so, yes. Yeah. They were very different times. And I, and, I, thereâs no way of understanding the magnitude of that suit without understanding the difference of those days. And, you know, thereâs no nostalgia for them, Iâll tell you that [laughs]. Raab: Let me ask my compatriots here, including you, Michael. Anything that I havenât covered that struck you as we were talking? Female Voice: Just a couple things. So when you were talking... 17 Raab: Wait, wait, let me do it so Elizabeth is looking in the right place. Female Voice: So when you were talking about the mix of negative reactions, the anger and fear and contempt mix. Weed: Yeah. Female Voice: How did that play out in the Anthropology Department, that Louise had come from? Weed: How did it play out, oh, in Anthropology? Raab: Let me rephrase this for the transcriber. So, the three factors that you talked about that were sort of playing out on [50:00] campus generally from the Consent Decreeâ Weed: Anger, fear and contempt. Raab: Anger, fear, and contempt, the three horsemen. Do you have a recollection of how those were playing out specifically inside Anthropology where really this all had started? Weed: I wish I could answer that. But I really canât. Not because I know and canât tell you, I just donât know. And I would say, I mean just from my experience working with departments trying to get those little programs going, that it probably was hard to generalize in any department. You know, youâd probably get a range of attitudes. And if you were lucky, the chair would be pretty enlightened. But I just, Iâm afraid, I wish I could, but. Raab: Along those lines, as you know, this afternoon, weâre going to be interviewing the former chair of that department, and we have lots of questions. But are there any that you might suggest, that maybe we havenât thought about, that we should ask? Weed: Oh, Iâm sure youâll have plenty, you know. Raab: But any, in particular that you want to make sure we asked? Weed: I would, I would be interested to know if there would have been less resistance to tenuring her if, had she not undertaken feminist scholarship. As I said earlier. Raab: Yes, her scholarship had changed. Weed: I mean, I think she seemed to have been acceptable as an Anthropologist for a while in the department, and considered one of the boys. And then all of a sudden, well I donât know all of a sudden, but then when push came to shove, she was, her work was not worthy of tenure. And I wonder if it hadnât been contaminated with this contemptuous feminist stuff, if maybe it might have been an easier decision 18 on their part. Thatâs what Iâd like to know, you know. Iâm sure Louise also has an opinion on that, so, yeah. Raab: Were there other things from this interview you wanted to follow back on? Voice: So the gang of women, Karen Romer and Kay Hall and faculty members who were beginning to do this hard work of questioning the institution, so what was the difference between what they had gotten, and what they couldnât do on their own, that could only be done in a lawsuit. Iâm talking about gathering statistics and documenting disparities. But how far did they get and what was the work left to do? Raab: Okay so let me see if I can rephrase that slightly. You spoke about the women on campus who were, even before you got here, in fact, trying to push some things along with respect to women on campus, and feminism and feminist studies. Were there things that the lawsuit and the Consent Decree ultimately allowed them to do in those efforts that without a lawsuit, they might not have ever been able to do? For example, now there were numbers being gathered about exactly what the situation was for women faculty. Weed: Right. These people like Karen Romer and Kay Hall and various faculty, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Louise Lamphere and others, were quite knowledgeable about the situation, the data, the numbers, but two administrators I referred to were in the Dean of the College office. And there is no power in the Dean of the College office to do anything about hiring and tenuring of faculty. And the faculty, for the most part, who were involved, were not chairs of departments, and were not in positions to do hiring and so forth. So you had people who were working very hard to build an atmosphere in which this could happen, but none of the changes could have happened just from their work. I mean you have to be in a position of power. You have to beâ¦ in a department, tenured full professor. Raab: So they would have absolutely hit a wall, and this profoundly changed that. I mean youâve said that. Weed: Absolutely, absolutely. It was very exciting. Thatâs why, when you said that the beginning, why would I come when thereâs a Consent Decree? Why wouldnât I come when thereâs a Consent Decree? Oh my God! Itâs just, itâs magic. Itâs fantastic! Goals and timetables for the hiring and tenuring of women? Ha! [laughs]. Raab: Well, other things, Wendy had a question, too. Letâs finish Amy and then weâllâ¦ Voice: A little bit more personal question. Elizabeth talked about having been an absorber of contempt, and Iâm just wondering maybe whether she could, you know, maybe not naming names, to not name names, just think about that to a couple of specific instances in which she was sort of on the firing line as that absorber of contempt. Raab: So I think, let me just rephrase the questionâ 19 Weed: Yeah I know but I donât have any examples. Raab: Well, can I? You talked about being an absorber, a sponge, an absorber of contempt when you first got here in particular, because of the Consent Decree. Iâm just wondering if there are any particular either anecdotes, stories, instances, people [55:00], that you might want to mention, or be willing to mention, as examples? Weed: You know, absorber, thatâs really the wrong metaphor. I shouldnât have used that metaphor because I, I wasnât a sponge in the sense that I took it in and kept it. So what is the biologicalâosmosis? The process where you take it in and then it immediately goes out? [laughs]. Thatâs more of what I was, you know? I, I was the recipient of contempt but I certainly didnât internalize it in any way. You know, I wish I had an example, I really, it would be fun if I had an example. Because how can you, how can you communicate a certain sneer on somebodyâs face, or a certain discomfort even being in your presence, or, you know, a certain look of incredulity when you ask if perhaps theyâd like to have some money to bring in a feminist scholar. So, I mean I donât. I mean the onlyâ¦ the only story I have was not about contempt, it was just about, it really doesnât even fit in any of those categories. It was just a very very very high placed administrator who, with whom I got along very well because as I said, I, I have very thick skin, and I have a sense of humor, and I just would cajole people and flirt and do all sorts of things to make friends, right? And to relieve the anxieties. And this one person, as I said, was enormously high placed, asked me to come over and have a drink with him. And I did, and then asked me what he could do to get Louise Lamphere off the back of the university. And I thought that was.. Raab: And asked you this, as though you would be an ally in that? Weed: And I, and I thought that was really funny. Well thatâs howâ¦ we had a good relationship. Raab: What did you say? Weed: I laughed, because I said, âWhat makes you think, number one: I would know? And number two: that I would want to do that?â And I managed to get the person to laugh. But he wasnât, he was disappointed, you know? Soâ¦ Raab: What would that have looked like, anyway? By the time you were here and that drink was had, there was a Consent Decree. What would it look like to get Louise Lamphere at that point off the back of the university? Weed: Well at that point apparently there were, and I donât even know what the issues were that were being discussed at that time, but it was definitely in the eighties, in the early eighties. Maybe very, maybe seventy-nine? I mean, whatever, whatever kinds of fine-tuning of the Consent Decree that were going on, there was frustration. 20 Raab: Do you remember, by the way, there were a couple of efforts, at least one, maybe two, to have the Consent Decree vacated before it actually was. And I should have asked you. Weed: Again, Iâm the wrong person to ask. Raab: You donât really remember anything like that? Weed: Yeah, no. Iâm really, Iâm just the ambiance person, thatâs all. Raab: I understand. Wendy, did you have a question? Wendy: Yeah, itâs not ambiance, but, personal. Iâm, so the flipside of being excited to come to campus and thinking that â¦ this environment of the Consent Decree is a good environment, what had you been thinking as a graduate student and an early faculty member about, you know, coming up for tenure yourself, or a professional... What that argument could have been like if you had not, you know, switched and come to Sarah Doyle but continued to be full-time teaching faculty, and how you were to trained to think aboutâ Raab: But just to be clear, Elizabeth was teaching not here at that point. Wendy: Yeah, but teaching anywhere. Weed: I was teaching adjunct. Raab: At Wheaton you were teaching adjunct? Weed: No, no. Raab: Well, so, if Iâm phrasing your question properly: so, before you did come back here, you were in, I assume, a tenure track position at another university. Had there, just for your own career, were youâyou said earlier that French Studies was perhaps not, not going to be the thriving industry that you had hoped, but even there, I mean you were a junior faculty member in a tenure track position, did you have your own concerns, anxieties, that went beyond the field itself, but just, being a woman who wantedâ¦ Weed: Yeah, I know what youâre saying. I think, I think that, French Studies in those days and probably still now was a fairly feminized field, so I donât think I would have run against the kinds of things that Louise did. But, Wheatonâs a small school. And I was very excited about the intellectual changes going on at Brown, about the Semiotics Department, and all that stuff. I used to come to conferences here while I was teaching at Wheaton. And I [1:00:00] just couldnât see myself staying as a tenured faculty memberâI donât want to say anything against Wheaton College, I mean. But I just wanted a bigger pond, and I wanted to be in on all these great intellectual changes, and I was ambitious to, to start this research 21 center that we eventually started, the Pembroke Center. You know, I just, sort of had my eye on the prize. I never knew it was going to be as great as it was, I mean, thatâs thanks to Joan Scott coming. Raab: But at thatâ Weed: So at that time, I didnât, I didnât experience that myself. And then the whole time I was here I was just an adjunct, so I didnât, I was not part of that, of that whole business. And so I didnât have to experience that myself. Itâs a good question, but I didnât have to experience it. Raab: But it seems as though the opportunity to come here might have come right around the point at which you might have reached a crossroads. If you, if you already knew you wanted a bigger playing field and a more dynamic environment, then it sounds like you probably would have tried to look for that next place, even if it had not been here. Weed: Yeah, this is just very, it was serendipity that this job opened, yeah. It really was. It was great. I was very lucky. Male Voice: I have an ambiance question. One last question. Can you talk a little bit about the buzz in the air the end of the eighties, in academia, across the country because of this? So here you are at Brown, you must have been talking to colleagues at other universities, and when we look at that graph and, and we talked about this in the previous interview too, that it was many many years later that other universities started to fall in line and those numbers started to go up. Did you get a sense from talking to other colleagues at other universities that this kind of buzz in the air, that things were changing? Weed: Absolutely. Male Voice: I mean did people really want to come here because of that? Weed: We were famous because [many voices] Yeah, Brown was famous, I mean. Shortly after we started the Pembroke Center, we becameâ¦ a member of the National Council for Research on Women, and thatâs where people, these fabulous people like Lynn Aston, and so forth, would be there, all these, you know. Women administrators from all over the country who were working on institutional feminist change. And we were like stars because we were from Brown, andâ Raab: But that was not really about Lamphere, right? That was more about Pembroke Centerâ Weed: No, it was about Lamphere. Yeah, but, Lamphere, Pembroke, it was allâwe were considered a great success. Because of the Lamphere Consent Decree. Raab: And what about, I mean besides being considered a great success, I would also imagine that the other universities that you mentioned, and maybe beyond those, the Ivy League and beyond, were pretty frightened by what was going on. 22 Weed: Absolutely. Which is why another reason why it was so wonderful. Yes, but I mean, I do have very strong feelings of being in that nice atmosphere with all of these terrific and smart and competent feminist administrators and faculty, that they looked to Brown with envy. Because we had had all of these good things happening, you know? We had, after the Consent Decree we were able to do so much. But you canât build a major, an important research center with no feminist faculty. You know? We had, what, the first seminar of the Pembrokeâthe first Pembroke seminar, which was in the fall of 1982, we had just started the Center with funding from the Ford Foundation and NEH and it was very exciting and successful. Louise Lamphere was, was one of the faculty fellows. So, I mean there she was. It was our very first year, our very first seminar, and Louise Lamphere was the very first faculty fellow. Raab: Which reminds me of something that I actually meant to ask, and this will be my last question, but many years later, she also turned around and gave the million dollar gift. Weed: Oh man, thatâs, thatâs so fantastic. Raab: Can you just talk about that for a second? Weed: I mean, I just couldnât stop smiling when I heard that Louise had given a million dollars to endow an assistant professor position in, in Gender Studies, or Feminist Studies, or whatever itâs called, and Anthropology. I mean that is such, that speaks to Louiseâs feminist heart, and an incredible generosity. I mean what, what, what a tremendously uplifting thing to do. To turn around to the institution that gave you a very hard time, and endow a chair. And, you know, the university, okay, one thing I didnât, I didnât tell you, maybe this is a little bit of an example of contempt, but. When Louise had got her ad eundum, I donât know if other people have talked about that [1:05:00]. Okay, so when Louise came back and she got her tenure, after you get tenure, you need to receive your ad eundum, which is the degree that you get that makes you also an alumna of Brown University. So, all tenured, recently tenured people at commencement receive their ad eundum degree, and theyâre at the front of the, you know, well the people sitting there on the green. And their names are mentioned. And when Louiseâs name was mentioned, people booed. And somebody said to me, they donât know if Louise remembers that. I remember it very clearly, because some of the people who were booing were corporation people. And I donât know who else, maybe faculty? I donât know. But, this was a horrible thing. Horrible thing. But, you know? It wasnât everybody. And a lot of other people were cheering. And I think, if you can say I have thick skin and I just go on, Louiseâs is ten times the bigger person. You know? She just would never let something like that get to her. Raab: Iâve never heard that before. Weed: Yeah, Iâm not sure that, itâs now on the record. I had told, I had told Nancy. Raab: You must have been shocked. 23 Weed: I donât know, shocked is too strong a word. I was disgusted. Remember me, I knew about contempt. So I wasnât shocked. [End of Interview.] 24..
