 Jennifer Dixon: Okay, Ms. Holt, if you&#8217;ll please state your full name. Sibal Holt: Sibal Suarez Holt. JD: Today is June 6, 2009, and I am interviewing Ms. Sibal Holt in Columbia, South Carolina. And Ms. Holt, will you state again for me your full name? SH: Sibal Suarez Holt. JD: I wanted to talk to you about--because you mentioned earlier that you were--. I read that you&#8217;re the first black female president of a state--. SH: AFL-CIO. JD: So definitely Louisiana. That&#8217;s true for the nation? SH: Yeah. There&#8217;s been no other black female to head a state AFL-CIO organization. JD: Okay. So let&#8217;s go back to the beginning. Tell me a little bit about yourself. SH: All right. Born and raised in New Orleans, father from Spanish descent, mother black. Attended public school all of my life and finished high school at the ripe old age of sixteen. JD: Oh, wow. SH: At sixteen nobody was going to hire a black female, way back then in the early &#8217;60s, so I initially started college at LSU, which was in the second or third year of integration. It was not--. JD: And LSU was--? SH: In New Orleans. Louisiana-- JD: Is that Louisiana State? SH: --State University in New Orleans. JD: Okay. SH: It was not a pleasant experience. As quick as they allowed us in they sought ways to flunk us out, so it was not a pleasant experience. As soon as I made eighteen I quit. Back then that&#8217;s when civil rights was becoming the law of the land and companies were being forced to admit blacks into the company. Well I applied at the Bell system because they were one of the companies that was being forced to take in African Americans, and I believe I was told I was the twenty-eighth black person they had hired in the state. It was not another pleasant experience because they hired us then in shades, you know, very bright with extremely nice hair, to bright with coarse hair, then brown with extremely nice hair, then brown with coarse hair, then a darker brown with halfway decent hair, and then a very dark brown with coarse hair, until whites could get accustomed to seeing our faces. JD: Oh, so they hired you--. They started out earlier-- SH: Hiring us in shades. JD: --with lighter skinned women? SH: Right. JD: Wow. SH: They hired us in shades. JD: Well not women but people in general, black people in general. SH: Yeah. Well back then it was predominantly women in operating services. JD: Okay. SH: So that was my first experience in the work world. To add insult to injury, besides just having to apply and to test they sent company officials to my house to see where I lived, who my parents were. They sent us to a dentist to check out our teeth and health. [Laughs] JD: Oh, my goodness. SH: And that was the atmosphere that I entered into the work world. I was smart enough to recognize that any union was better than no union at all so immediately when I got into AT&amp;T we started seeking out the union, but the truth of the matter was union people, because they were all white also, were no happier to see us than anybody else. So, I still joined the union and tried to persuade others to do the same because the first opportunity we got, we collectively got together and said we couldn&#8217;t trust them to defend us. JD: Mm hmm. &#8220;We&#8221; as in African Americans-- SH: African Americans. JD: --and &#8220;them&#8221; being the company or the union people? SH: The whites, the unions. JD: Okay. SH: The whites in the unions, because they would do things like, oh, they forgot the time and time had elapsed so we had automatically lost our grievance so we were automatically fired or dismissed, or sometimes we couldn&#8217;t even find a union rep who would want to handle the grievance for us. So we got together, all the African American women got together in operating services, and we said, look, one or two of us need to be the union rep to take care of us because we can&#8217;t depend on them. So myself and another woman by the name of Nora [04:24] decided we would be the two. Back then I was only eighteen years old, very timid, very shy. Nora, I have to acknowledge, was much more aggressive than I was. We went on to try to become union stewards for operator services. Well the difference was that while we were on the board they would do such ugly, nasty things, like when the whites would sit next to us they&#8217;d plug into the chief operating jack and say, &#8220;May I move please? There&#8217;s an odor,&#8221; and they would allow them to move, as though we were carrying an odor of some sort. Well you know many a day back then I would go home crying and my mother said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be damned. You are not going to let somebody push you out of your job. You need to get tough, and don&#8217;t come here crying, not another darn day.&#8221; So I decided that I had to do better, and I did. I got a lot better, [Laughs] much better than most people would appreciate-- JD: Wow. SH: --in a very short period of time, so that next time one of them sat by me and plugged up and said, &#8220;May I move? There&#8217;s an odor,&#8221; I would say, &#8220;Bitch, shut your legs. You won&#8217;t smell it.&#8221; JD: [Laughs] Right, right. SH: Okay? JD: Uh huh. SH: And I wasn&#8217;t crying anymore. Or they would sit on the board and pretend they were shooting all of us, to kill us, get rid of us. But what I did in that period of time, like most people read the Bible I read the union contract and I became very proficient in helping people to save their jobs. After awhile, white or black, if it&#8217;ll save your job they don&#8217;t care who represents them, so I started getting calls all over from whites as well as blacks when they had grievances. JD: All over the company. SH: Yeah, in operating services, so I was beginning to get a little reputation for being a very good union steward. Back then there was a president of the union who was Hispanic. Now how he ever made it as president I&#8217;ll never know because they truly didn&#8217;t like him, you know I guess as much as they liked us, because when he was not present they used to do ugly little racial jokes about, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between a spic and a bucket of shit?&#8221; and then you say, &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and they say, &#8220;Just the bucket.&#8221; But you have to realize if I wasn&#8217;t there it probably would have been, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between a nigger and a bucket of shit?&#8221; JD: Right, right. SH: But I just happened to be there so they would do it on him. I would not laugh. Things with them did not get better for quite a while, even though I was a union rep, and the Hispanic president of course took a liking because he understood what we were going through, Nora and I, and he pushed us to not get discouraged, not get disgusted, and he supported us one hundred percent. When it came to the conventions for--CWA was the union I was part of. JD: CWA stands for--? SH: Communication Workers of America. JD: Okay. SH: He made sure that we were part of it, and we were all supposed to go together in the car and drive to this convention in Alabama. Well Nora and I were supposed to meet these people we were supposed to drive with, and of course we&#8217;re standing there waiting for them and none of them showed up. We&#8217;re just standing there; nobody showed up. So when we called the president and said, &#8220;What happened? Nobody&#8217;s here,&#8221; they all had excuses about they had to drop somebody off, or they were afraid to drive with us in the car, they said, through Mississippi. It could have been legit. Of course back then I didn&#8217;t think so. JD: This was in the mid-&#8217;60s? SH: Yeah. This was around in &#8217;65, &#8217;66. JD: Okay. SH: So Nora and I wind up catching a bus and going to Auburn University, and when we got there, oh, they were so apologetic that they didn&#8217;t meet us, but all of them were already there. So [Laughs] I walk into this big old hall. It was a reception for all the CWA members. Well unknowing to me there had never been any blacks ever to attend the CWA, because, hey, integration was just becoming the law of the land. So I walked in there and of course I was like the fly in the butter bowl of milk, and someone walked up to me and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, this is the CWA meeting. Are you looking for someone?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No,&#8221; and I moved on. So they didn&#8217;t know what to grab from this. So they waited about five, ten minutes and they came in and they said, &#8220;This is a private meeting for the Communication Workers of America,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and I moved on. [Laughs] Finally, after about fifteen minutes, it must have dawned on them, maybe I knew where I was, so they came over to me and they said, &#8220;Are you a CWA member?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yes. Guess who&#8217;s come to dinner.&#8221; [Laughs] So, you know, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re so sorry. We didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; and then everybody was warm and friendly. Well that was until night came. So they&#8217;re sitting around drinking beer like they do after all the meetings and stuff, [and then] they decide that they&#8217;re going to sing &#8220;Dixie.&#8221; Okay. [Laughs] So my inclination was just to get up and leave. I told you Nora was much more aggressive than I was, and when they started, &#8220;I wish I was in the land of cotton,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Oh, hell no.&#8221; [Laughs] She said, &#8220;There&#8217;ll be no singing of &#8216;Dixie&#8217; in this damn meeting.&#8221; [Laughs] [And], &#8220;Oh, Nora, it&#8217;s just a song. It&#8217;s just a song.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Look, I can&#8217;t do nothing about anybody from any other state, but anybody from Louisiana singing the damn &#8216;Dixie&#8217; gonna have to deal with me.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Now either we not sing &#8216;Dixie&#8217; or Louisiana get your asses up and let&#8217;s leave.&#8221; [Laughs] So Louisiana got up and left. [Laughs] JD: Wow. SH: They did not mess with Nora. JD: Oh, my goodness. SH: But I mean this was the kind of thing we had to go to. As time went on, like I said, you begin to get a reputation for being able to help people out and whites started coming to you so they were a little more accepting when you save their jobs, and I used to do little things like--. I always think this is funny because there was a clause in the union contract that says you had to be counseled, warned, and then suspended, so on the counseling I would just always, when I knew people were wrong, I would say you go in there and tell them yeah, you were wrong. You&#8217;re going to try to do better. I will insist that that&#8217;s written into your record. Take like a girl that&#8217;s been absent three or four times in a month. Okay, so we go into the union meeting and the supervisor would automatically start raving and ranting and I would say, &#8220;Look, I have already spoke with this person, she knows she is wrong, we are prepared to accept the counseling entry, and I really want you to put that unless she improves there will be further disciplinary action,&#8221; and supervisors were so eager to write that down. They wrote it right quick. So the next time this kid, you know, eventually was going to get fired and I knew it and she knew it [Laughs] and everybody knew it, but the next time I was able to help her again because if next month she came, she missed once or twice, oh, she&#8217;s not improving. They would call me and they were ready to warn her, and I&#8217;d go into the meeting and I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a valid entry.&#8221; &#8220;Well how can you say it&#8217;s not a valid entry? Just two weeks ago she was counseled and here two weeks have passed and she&#8217;s already missed two days and the month&#8217;s not even over,&#8221; you know. And I said, &#8220;Because you told her she had to improve. This is an improvement. This same time last month she had four. [Laughs] This is an improvement.&#8221; JD: Yeah, right. SH: And when I get outside I say, &#8220;Now girl, you better bring your behind here on time [Laughs] this month, you know what I&#8217;m saying? This isn&#8217;t going to fly too often.&#8221; But I used to find little tricks like that to help people save their jobs, save an entry. As time went on I became an executive board member for CWA and then in 1975 I heard the AFL-CIO was looking for a staff person. Well initially I said they&#8217;re not going to hire no black. Nobody knows me. I had not been involved in a union outside my union. I had joined the A. Philip Randolph Institute by then because that was another entity. We always said the black arm of labor. It dealt solely with voter registration, education, and get out to vote. JD: So it&#8217;s more civil rights? SH: Yeah, but it was all union members, and we used to try to force the union, the AFL-CIO, to take care of their own house. JD: So that link-- SH: That&#8217;s right. JD: --between civil rights and unions. SH: And then we tried to get black people in the community to register and to vote, because it&#8217;s true, you tell me what it is that black people want, I&#8217;ll tell you what labor wants. Black people want better education. That&#8217;s what labor wants. Better housing: that&#8217;s what labor wants. Better healthcare: that&#8217;s what labor wants. Better jobs, well-paying jobs: that&#8217;s what labor wants. Whether we like it or not, there is a bond, a link, to labor, and the only way you can achieve these things is through the ballot box, through the ballot box, a union card and a voter registration card. So that was our message with A. Philip Randolph Institute. JD: Now where was that located? SH: New Orleans, Louisiana. JD: Oh, so it was located--okay. SH: Yeah, it was lo--. JD: Okay. SH: And A. Philip Randolph is a national organization. There&#8217;s one in just about every major--well in every state and practically every major city within the states. JD: Okay. SH: Okay and that&#8217;s all we do, voter education, registration, and get out to vote. We work tirelessly to get black folk to go and vote. And it&#8217;s a nonpartisan organization, but the realization is mostly minority communities is where you have the lowest voter turnout, so even though it was nonpartisan our deal was to get minorities to go vote. JD: Does the organization still exist? SH: Yes, absolutely it does. JD: What year did it come into being, do you know? SH: Now in New Orleans it was in 1965. JD: Okay. SH: I cannot tell you the original. JD: Okay. SH: And I should be able to tell you that because I was involved with it so long at one time I knew the history forwards and backwards, but I&#8217;ve been away from it for awhile. JD: Okay. SH: But anyway, when I heard that the AFL-CIO was looking for a staff person I initially thought they&#8217;ll never hire me. Then there was a black lady hired by the national AFL-CIO and she called me up and she said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you apply? Somebody told me about you,&#8221; a woman by the name of Lena Craig, who was involved in hotel/motel workers. JD: Lena Craig? SH: Uh huh. She had told her, &#8220;This is a nice young girl and she&#8217;s getting very active and she&#8217;d probably be dynamic,&#8221; so--. JD: Who was the black woman that was--? SH: Fannie Neal. JD: Fannie Neal. SH: She was working for the national AFL-CIO in what they call the COPE program which was their political education program. So she called me up and she said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you apply?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, Ms. Neal, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll hire me. Nobody knows me.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I know Victor Bussie personally,&#8221; who was then the president of the state AFL-CIO. He wound up being president for forty-seven years. Hello! So--. [Laughs] JD: Wow. SH: Yeah. And he was looking to hire a minority for his assistant. She said, &#8220;I know him very well. You apply for the job. If you can take of your own union politics I&#8217;ll take care of the national and the state,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m all over that then,&#8221; so I did. I applied. I got my union president, which was Jerry Fernandez, the Hispanic, to write me a letter of recommendation. I got the president of the A. Philip Randolph Institute at the time, which was another national AFL-CIO rep, a gentleman by the name of Willie Montgomery. He has since passed. So has Fannie, by the way. They wrote me letters of recommendation to Victor Bussie, and as fate would have it he hired me as his personal assistant. In that job--I didn&#8217;t know it at the time; I was hired I think March 1, 1975--a part of that job was being a lobbyist. Between you and I, I didn&#8217;t even know what a lobbyist was, had never been to the state capital, but I always had the attitude that if it can be taught I can learn. JD: Right. SH: Now I may not be as fast as you are but the thing about me is I am a quick study and once I got it you can get about your business. I got it and I&#8217;m gone. JD: Absolutely. SH: Okay? JD: Mm hmm. SH: So I had to register as a lobbyist. I didn&#8217;t know, once again, at the time I&#8217;d wind up being the first black professional registered lobbyist in the state of Louisiana. In the civil rights era a couple of years before I can remember seeing on TV where they dragged a minister out of the state capital because he was trying to lobby there. He wasn&#8217;t even trying to register as a professional; he just wanted to go into the capital and talk to the representatives but they had dragged him down the capital steps. And here I was, just very oblivious to the fact that I was being the first professionally registered lobbyist for the state. I mean it was just part of my job so I didn&#8217;t think anything of it until years later, to be very honest with you. But I wind up registering as the first lobbyist which, once again, stepping into a very uncomfortable situation because when I started lobbying there were white reps that told Vic Bussie just don&#8217;t let me come and lobby them because they were not comfortable with me. Well, the first time that happened, a little hurtful. He said, &#8220;But we&#8217;re not going worry, but I&#8217;ll take him just for the time being.&#8221; But after about the second or third time that happened I grabbed Victor Bussie by the arm and I dragged him to this white rep. I said, &#8220;Now you stand here before me and you tell him that when I lobby I lobby for the AFL-CIO and he either talks to me or he talks to no one.&#8221; Victor was shocked, and he said, &#8220;She&#8217;s right.&#8221; [Laughs] But you just have to stand your ground, and that was the attitude and the demeanor in which I lobbied. Well there was only, I think, three--no, I think there was seven--black reps at the time that I started there in 1975, and because this was a fresh face, they had never seen a black lobbyist, they were eager to help me. Once again I didn&#8217;t know all the history but they had pushed Victor Bussie to hire a black because they voted all the time with them because our issues were the same, so they said they wanted to see somebody who looked like them to lobby, which was motivation for him to hire a black, okay? JD: Mm hmm. SH: I have to acknowledge though, Victor Bussie was one of the most liberal white men I have ever met. Most people were very afraid of him because he was powerful. Labor back then was powerful and the name Victor Bussie made some people shudder. He was friends with all the governors, he knew all the senators and reps, and then he commanded a movement of about two hundred or three hundred thousand people, so he was someone to reckon with. When I got there, there was this little intimidation thing going on because he stood six foot five, okay? I mean a very statuesque man. But once again I had to determine and decide who I was going to be. So the first argument he and I kind of had, he wanted me to lobby against the building trades being in the vocational educational system, and I said, &#8220;Why would I do that?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Because you can&#8217;t train anybody to be an electrician in a vo-tech school. You can&#8217;t wire one shelf square in a vo-tech school.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, sir, but you and I both know it&#8217;s not easy for blacks to get into the building trades, not now, it hasn&#8217;t been in the past, and if we&#8217;re not able to get at least the basics somewhere we&#8217;ll never be able to get into the trades,&#8221; you know? I said, &#8220;So I don&#8217;t want to lobby for that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have to remember, black didn&#8217;t hire you, labor did.&#8221; I said to myself, oh, shit. Here we go. JD: [Laughs] SH: So I politely looked at him and I said, &#8220;No, you have to know. You see this color on my skin? Whether I&#8217;m with labor or not this is going to be here.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Like you just said, labor hired me, labor can fire me, but this is with me forever, so if I have to make a choice it&#8217;s really no choice at all. Do what you have to do. I will not be lobbying against blacks getting into vo-tech school.&#8221; Well he didn&#8217;t know what to say. [Laughs] He had not very long ago hired me, he wasn&#8217;t prepared to fire me, [Laughs] particularly not with the black reps and certainly not over an issue of this sort, so he politely just turned around and he walked away and I went back to my office. It was about a day or two and he came back and he said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t force you to lobby on this issue but you need to understand who you work for,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No, sir, you need to know who I am. I was very clear on who I work for. You need to be very clear about who I am.&#8221; He said, &#8220;We [22:27] have an understanding.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If you understood what I said, I certainly understood what you said,&#8221; and we moved on. [Laughs] We moved on. I have to admit that in the twenty-three years--twenty-seven years, I think--I worked for him as his assistant we only had four arguments, but every one of them were almost what you&#8217;d call violent arguments. We didn&#8217;t argue hardly at all and he came to respect my opinion, more so than most other people and certainly more than most of the staff, because they used to tease me all the time. They&#8217;d say, &#8220;What do you have on him? You can talk to him any kind of way. Do you have a picture of him with a goat or something?&#8221; [Laughs] I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have nothing on him.&#8221; [Laughs] But he knew if I told him something it was true. I was not afraid of him. I just had no fear of him. He was my coworker and my boss and that&#8217;s the way I treated him, and I expected to be treated respectfully as his assistant. As his assistant I didn&#8217;t feel I needed permission to tell him he needed to talk to somebody that&#8217;s in labor&#8217;s interest, so I didn&#8217;t cower down like others did, and he respected that also. I also became the leading political organizer, particularly in the black community, because it didn&#8217;t take much to convince him the people that vote with you almost one hundred percent of the time are African American. You ought to be trying to get every African American that you can in these seats, and he agreed, so that was my job, to get black folk elected, which was so unusual back then because labor never gave black folk any money, but with me they gave more black folk money than I can even mention to get elected. We ultimately ended up with like thirty-two blacks in Louisiana, I think second just to Mississippi. Mississippi had the highest number of black elected officials; Louisiana had the second highest number of black elected officials. So it was a good time and for a short period of time when there was like ten, nine, I didn&#8217;t really have to lobby very hard. I&#8217;d sit in the back and if it was an issue they knew I had an interest in they&#8217;d all look and I&#8217;d put thumbs up or thumbs down, and it became a joke, you know, hey, she just &#8220;thumbs upped&#8221;, [Laughs] and they all listened. But I realize I was blessed because they just respected--. They wanted to make sure I was successful. It wasn&#8217;t about me; it was about them trying to make sure that this little woman was successful in what she did, and when you can control thirteen, fourteen votes without a doubt--and as those numbers grew, like I said, it wound up being thirty-something--hey, that was a big deal. So I was very successful in doing that. Well, after twenty-seven years Vic Bussie decided that he was going to retire. Well it had been the tradition prior to me coming there that whoever was the secretary-treasurer would run and step up to president, okay, and someone would step up into the secretary-treasurer. Well, when he was going to retire there was a gentleman by the name of John Bourg who was the secretary-treasurer who was going to step up, and since I was the oldest staff person there, other than his wife and he certainly didn&#8217;t want to put that because that would have been a big thing in the labor movement, but he didn&#8217;t believe--which kind of surprised me--he didn&#8217;t believe that the whites of Louisiana would elect me, and he had planned--. There was a guy who got hired after me by the name of Joe [Vopey] and he was pushing Joe [Vopey] to step up into secretary-treasurer. Well needless to say I was disappointed but you know you sometime have to step back and say just maybe this is not your time, so I did not raise the issue. Now blacks in the legislature wanted to raise the issue but I said no. I was still a very young woman and I said maybe it&#8217;s just not my time. Maybe God&#8217;s trying to tell me something. So I just waited, to be very honest with you. Well as fate would have it Joe [Vopey] got cancer and he died, okay? Who was next in line--me, and I stepped into that position. Well John Bourg, who took Victor Bussie&#8217;s place, he was excited because I was kind of like a workaholic. He was in his seventies and getting tired so I could run the AFL-CIO. [Laughs] I did what I liked. He liked it; I liked it. I ran things for all practical purposes. And he was a wonderful fellow. As long as it made good sense to him it was good, so we had a wonderful sister-brother relationship. But when I got elected he said, &#8220;Let me just say this to you. My father used to be secretary-treasurer. He never made it to president. I just want to be president for a year or so then I&#8217;m going to step down and let you run for president,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Great!&#8221; So a year passed and--I respect this--he came to me and he said, &#8220;I know I told you just a year but I&#8217;m kind of enjoying this,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well Red, don&#8217;t,&#8221;--we used to call him &#8220;Red&#8221; for a nickname--I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me put you out of your job. If you want to stay you need to stay.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Okay, let me just do this one term and then I&#8217;ll step down and let you run.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Fine.&#8221; Well four years passed, and by the end of that four years we were being sued, the AFL-CIO and they named Red personally, to the tune of four million dollars. He came to me and he said, &#8220;I know I was supposed to step down but I&#8217;m not going to leave you with a four million dollar suit hanging over your head.&#8221; I really liked that and I said, &#8220;Not a problem, bro,&#8221; [Laughs] you know? Hey, I&#8217;m a patient person. Not a problem. So he said, &#8220;But when the suit disappears I will retire and then you can run,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Fine.&#8221; Well the suit disappeared and Red was not ready to retire because he didn&#8217;t know what else to do. Like I said he was in his seventies. This was all he had done since he was eighteen so he just wouldn&#8217;t have known what he would do. So when he came to me and he said, &#8220;Are you going to be upset with me?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, but you need to know at the end of this term I will have thirty-some odd years. I&#8217;m retiring. [Laughs] You can stay until you&#8217;re eighty. I&#8217;m not staying here until I&#8217;m in my eighties.&#8221; I was in my fifties then. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not staying until I&#8217;m in my eighties,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, I think this will be the last time,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s up to you. I don&#8217;t want you to feel I&#8217;m pushing you out of your job. I understand.&#8221; And I did understand, like I said. I always felt I could do--. I went back to college late. I could teach. I had my federal securities license. I could have done stocks and bonds. I had an insurance license, life and health, property and casualty; I could have done that. I had my certificate to be a travel agent. I had options to do things. He didn&#8217;t. All he knew was what he was doing, so I understood that and I figured I was only at that time one of six African Americans in the nation that was a secretary-treasurer for the AFL-CIO, so for me that was good enough, okay? But once again as fate would have it he got cancer and he died, and I stepped right up because I was the secretary-treasurer and I ran for the AFL-CIO presidency. I debated whether or not because the people I was closest to, i.e. Vic Bussie, Red Bourg, did not think whites in Louisiana would elect me. But I start receiving calls from all over the nation from African Americans who said first of all you are the only black that we know could possibly get elected. You&#8217;re in position. The AFL-CIO have done things with you that they&#8217;ve never done with any other black, even those that work for them directly. Years before, they had given me a check for a quarter of a million dollars. Never asked for an accounting, they just trusted me to go and do what they asked me to do, and I did. But I&#8217;m not a stupid person; I accounted for every damn penny because I didn&#8217;t want any questions after. I had gotten to do things that other blacks never in a lifetime had gotten to do and they were telling me: You have to do this. You have to break that ceiling for other people. I thought about it and I said, yeah. So I did, I ran, but the minute I got in there I told the guy who used to be my staff that he should run for secretary-treasurer and be prepared because by that time I was in my mid-fifties. I did not want to work--. I had been in labor thirty-some odd years. Well really almost forty years because I did ten years with AT&amp;T prior to getting with the AFL-CIO so it was going on forty-some odd years and I said enough is enough. The reason why they were so tired because they had been there too long, but they just wouldn&#8217;t leave, couldn&#8217;t leave, because they didn&#8217;t know what else they could do. That was not me, and I told him, I said, &#8220;You need to start preparing now, because in a couple of years I&#8217;m out of here, buddy.&#8221; [Laughs] He said, &#8220;You know you&#8217;re not going to do that. It took Vic eleven years telling Red he was going to leave. [Laughs] It took Red nine with you. [Laughs] I&#8217;m not telling nobody I&#8217;m running because I don&#8217;t want to force you out of a job. Besides that, every time you&#8217;re up for a position you&#8217;re killing folk. [Laughs] They all die. We ain&#8217;t messing with you. You can stay as long as you want,&#8221; you know, teasing me, and I say, &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you, I&#8217;m not staying that long.&#8221; But they really didn&#8217;t think I was going to leave, primarily because we fought, I mean for every worker in the state of Louisiana to have good benefits, good salaries, good retirement. We didn&#8217;t have that for ourselves. To be very honest with you, until I became the secretary-treasurer after twenty-seven years of work I was making thirty thousand dollars. Victor Bussie, the guy who was there forty-seven years, he retired making a salary of thirty-eight. We did it because we loved it. We didn&#8217;t make any money. Now when I became secretary-treasurer I said I&#8217;d have to be stupid not to lift my salary, at least to what he was making, thirty-eight. You know what I&#8217;m saying? But what the board did, because I said, &#8220;Had you hired a man would any man have taken this job for thirty-eight thousand dollars?&#8221; and the answer was no. So there was another Hispanic guy who said, &#8220;You are absolutely right. You deserve to be paid like anybody else.&#8221; They lifted my salary to sixty-five. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I had never made that much money in my life. JD: [Laughs] This was as president? SH: Right, as president. I had never made that much money in my life. JD: Wow. SH: Certainly once again they thought I would not leave, okay, but I just kept telling them I&#8217;m going to do this until the end of the term and I&#8217;m out of here. I&#8217;m going to do something different. I don&#8217;t want to do the politics. I&#8217;ve enjoyed labor but labor has been a labor of love, and I don&#8217;t want to be too old to be able to do anything. So I became the first African American woman in the history of the country or labor to head a state AFL-CIO organization, and it was no difficult task because I had been running it all along, unknowing to them. I was just very proud of what some people call the Bubbas of Louisiana, you know, they would tell me all the time, &#8220;I used to be a Ku Klux Klan, but I like you.&#8221; [Laughs] Or, &#8220;We held guns against A. Z. Young coming into Denham Springs, but you&#8217;re different.&#8221; No, I&#8217;m not. If you&#8217;ll just give yourselves an opportunity you&#8217;ll find there&#8217;s fifty million black folk just like me. But they came to love me. One time there was a politician who did not want to speak with me and he was running for treasurer&#8217;s office, and I was trying to be as polite as I possibly could to tell him that Red Bourg was not there, wasn&#8217;t going to be there, I was willing to do whatever he needed, but he was very insistent that he did not want to speak with me. So he called on a third day and when I told the little lady the gentleman was still, Bourg was still, not there, but if it was important to this guy I was willing to help, he sent her back a message: &#8220;Tell her I told her already I didn&#8217;t want to talk to her.&#8221; I sent him a message. I said, &#8220;You need to go back and tell him this. He&#8217;ll either talk to me now or he won&#8217;t talk to labor period,&#8221; and I hung up the phone. Well Red finally did come back off the trip and he tried to talk with Red, and our convention--. What he was doing, he was trying to seek support from the labor movement, but I called my board and I told them how he just point blank refused to talk to me and was not hesitant to tell me, and I said, &#8220;I will fight anybody who makes a motion to support this gentleman. He will not be invited to this convention.&#8221; Well he came to the convention anyway and he wanted to apologize to me, and one of the Klansmen got up there and said, &#8220;This is what you need to know: Sibal is our president and she told you absolutely right. If you can&#8217;t talk to her, sir, you can excuse yourself out of our convention because you&#8217;ll speak to no one at this convention,&#8221; and the whole convention stood up and clapped and everything. I guess in terms of the labor movement that was one of my proudest moments because I thought I&#8217;m looking at these guys who sometime didn&#8217;t want to sit next to me, certainly didn&#8217;t think I could handle any of their business, because that was mostly the building trades who didn&#8217;t think women knew anything about the trades. They had come three hundred and sixty degrees to support a black woman, and when I said I was running for the president I mean they called each other around the state to say: Sibal is our choice. She&#8217;s been there this long, she&#8217;s handled our business, she&#8217;s been a lobbyist, there is no reason why she should not be the president, and I got a unanimous vote from the body, so that&#8217;s how I became the first African American female president of the AFL-CIO. JD: That&#8217;s an amazing story. SH: But true to my word, in a couple of years I resigned--I didn&#8217;t resign, I did not run for re-election--because I was just tired, and that shocked everybody. Nobody believed me when I kept telling them, [Laughs] because they never thought I would walk away. Our retirement system was such that you could not get full retirement unless you was age sixty-five. I was fifty-eight, but like I said I&#8217;d been there thirty-two years, plus the ten from AT&amp;T, so forty-two years. That&#8217;s enough. That&#8217;s a long time, a lifetime for some people, and I just didn&#8217;t want to do it, so I walked away from the money. Then they would say, &#8220;What are you going to do? How are you going to live?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well it&#8217;s high time y&#8217;all start asking that question. I&#8217;ve been here forty-some odd years. Nobody asked me how I was going to live, but I&#8217;m going to be okay.&#8221; Well I shocked most of them because I decided I wanted to be a general contractor. I wanted to own a union company. They just never in their wildest dreams thought I would be able to go take the tests and become a contractor, but I did. Then they questioned whether or not I could ever be successful because what did I know about hitting two nails? And I said nothing, but general contractors don&#8217;t have to know how to hit the nails. They just have to know how to hire good people. I&#8217;ve been doing that for forty-some odd years. [Laughs] I&#8217;m good at it. And I give God the credit, but I&#8217;ve been very successful as a contractor, very successful. JD: You know, it&#8217;s funny. I was online just trying to get background information on you and I saw the company. I said, I wonder if that&#8217;s her? SH: Yeah, it is. JD: And it is. SH: Yeah. JD: That&#8217;s fascinating. SH: It is. JD: That is absolutely fascinating. SH: You know but when you&#8217;re in unions and the union movement you recognize some things that you just have to deal with, one being that most of the trades are ninety-five percent men, but all the other unions are fifty and better percent women, but you have very few women presidents, okay? So that kind of became an issue with me, first of all women in the union and the Equal Rights Amendment, the woman&#8217;s movement, because women in labor, clearly we have bigger conflicts. We have family, we have children, we have community, but nothing is more important other than your family--God first, family second, your paycheck third. This was kind of my message: Why is it that you have a union, take like AFSCME or the teachers, and it&#8217;s always a male president--locally, nationally. What&#8217;s wrong with that picture? We sometimes tend not to have confidence in ourselves, and I remember clearly in the beginning every step I made up there was first doubt whether or not I could do it, whether or not I could make it, and women do that in general. We are our hardest critics, the worst people who look for the negative in us, in ourselves, rather than assuming if anybody else can do it I can do it too. Why not? You make time for everything else; you need to make time for your job, for your paycheck. You need to make time to make sure that other women have opportunities. I lived in the state of Louisiana, and I don&#8217;t know how every woman, black or white, could not be involved in the woman&#8217;s movement. When I started working for the AFL-CIO because I was a lobbyist I had no choice. Crap was just forced in my face. I had to learn. I learned we lived under the Napoleonic Code there. Now if you don&#8217;t know anything about the Napoleonic Code, in Louisiana the man was head and master. What did that mean to a woman, black, white, or otherwise? That meant your husband could go to your job and demand your check, okay, because he was head and master of the home. That meant that even though you bought a house in both your names if you was the wife he could sell because he was head and master and had total control. He could sell your house from underneath you, okay? That meant that we had laws on the books in Louisiana at that time that said he had a right to slap you around. You were his property, okay? How could you not want to get involved, with that kind of foolishness? And when I started realizing the law I and other women were living under, I mean I was compelled to get involved with the women&#8217;s movement, and very fortunately--. I was staff then for Vic Bussie way back then in the &#8217;70s and the &#8217;80s. His wife was a feminist, okay? He had no choice but to be a feminist, and he would tell men all the time, &#8220;I&#8217;m a feminist.&#8221; He was totally supportive of us advancing women&#8217;s rights. Well we started with that Napoleonic Code. Very unfortunately though, it was predominantly ninety-some odd percent white women, very few black women that would get involved. JD: Why is that, do you think? SH: Oh, I know why. I always said, first of all, we were always about the business of just trying to survive, okay? We had children. What was it, six, seven, out of every ten families headed by a black, single female? She was trying to work. She was trying to take care of the kids, trying to do what little she could do in the school system if she was not too tired, some of them working two and three jobs, and if it didn&#8217;t affect her directly she just didn&#8217;t have time. What she didn&#8217;t know was--just like I didn&#8217;t know until I started working up there--it did affect us directly, because she wouldn&#8217;t know until something very negative had happened to her, that she found out that her husband had cleaned out her bank account and he had the right to do it, that her husband maybe had sold her house without her knowledge and/or permission. In order to stop that kind of thing you had to go sign what was called a homestead. Most black women had never heard of that. We thought if we bought a house with our husband, our names were both on the deed, that was our house. Nobody could do anything wrong. The other thing we didn&#8217;t know that if you made the mistake and gave your husband power of attorney it was irrevocable. You couldn&#8217;t change your mind, okay, under Louisiana law back then. I mean just foolishness. So since I was already lobbying for the labor movement, Fran, which was Vic&#8217;s wife--I mean a diehard feminist--we made sure every issue that affected a woman was a part of labor&#8217;s issues. JD: Wow. SH: Now that was another reason why a lot of the men in labor had no respect. &#8220;That&#8217;s not labor!&#8221; It is labor. You earning a paycheck, me earning a paycheck, is just about two people earning a paycheck. They couldn&#8217;t make the connection. She and I saw it clearly. We joined up with the ERA Coalition and as a matter of fact I headed the ERA Coalition. I walked in there--Fran took me to a meeting--na&#239;ve. I didn&#8217;t know nothing about nothing. As they say in Louisiana, I didn&#8217;t know my head from a hole in the ground, okay? And they said, &#8220;We need a coordinator,&#8221; and Fran said, &#8220;Well Sibal, you know how to coordinate,&#8221; and I&#8217;m saying, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t think that was a big deal. Little did I know they were talking about coordinating the whole ERA campaign, okay? JD: For the state or for the nation? SH: No, for the state. JD: Oh, wow. SH: For the state. I didn&#8217;t know any of these people. [Laughs] All white folk anyway, you know what I&#8217;m saying? I didn&#8217;t know any of these people, but I said, &#8220;Oh, yeah, sure. I know how to coordinate.&#8221; I had no clue about what that entailed, but they took my hand, guided me. I met some of the most dynamic white women I&#8217;ve ever met in my life, people like Robbie Madden, Pat Evans, just dynamic people, committed. Catherine Spake, who was a lawyer, who did all the legal stuff for us, Marie Sturbin, who was the lobbyist, Kim Gandy, who was a lobbyist; they were just dogmatic, they were focused, and they would not give up and they would not give in. When we realized we couldn&#8217;t get ERA they were smart enough to say, well we need to get everything else we can, so we start changing laws: domestic violence; we changed head and master to equal management; we changed some of the insurance laws. And I think--. No, we didn&#8217;t change. We tried to change the insurance law. In Louisiana this is the way the law worked. You marry and you divorce. You have children by your first husband. You have the kids. You remarry, okay, but you and your child is driving in a car one day and both of you get in a wreck and die. It is assumed under Louisiana law that your child, because she was younger, lived longer than you did, so therefore all of your stuff would go to your child, your direct descendant, and since your ex-husband is that child&#8217;s direct descendant [sic] all of your stuff would go to him. [Laughs] JD: Instead of to your current husband. SH: That&#8217;s right. JD: Wow. SH: Okay? So we were trying to change that, that if you gave your husband power of attorney you could change your mind. Okay? No, he did not have a right to beat on you. JD: Right. SH: Things of that nature. And we did; we changed a lot of the laws, because we couldn&#8217;t pass ERA. Back then, you know, &#8220;Women just want to be braless and burn bras! What is it going to look like, a woman in the army shooting a gun?&#8221; They should be living now, huh? [Laughs] JD: Mm hmm. SH: But that was the kind of thing. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go in a bathroom with a woman!&#8221; Hey, just lock the door. But we had to fight foolishness, and then the Republican women and then the conservative women. They had a lock on that kind of stuff. We did not pass ERA. As a matter of fact, in Louisiana as we speak they are still trying to pass a resolution-- JD: Oh, wow. SH: --for ERA because they&#8217;re hoping under Obama we will have the thirty-eight states to ratify and it will become a part of the law. No one back then other than us seemed to have understood that the Equal Rights Amendment was about women being legal equals, as simple as that, legal equals, and who would not want to be legally equal? But we fought all kind of laws, but like I said back then there wasn&#8217;t very many black women involved and we just decided that that was not good. There was something wrong with that picture, and certainly I could articulate how black women felt and I&#8217;d say: I understand them. I mean we don&#8217;t have time for what they call white women foolishness, [Laughs] and that&#8217;s the way black women looked at it. They&#8217;d say, &#8220;Sibal, why are you involved?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Because I understand the property thing. I understand the job thing. But black women don&#8217;t own much property, okay, and we&#8217;re on the bottom of the economic totem pole so with us we still don&#8217;t get the jobs.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But I know what it is that will bring us out. Black women are family and children, that&#8217;s our heartstring,&#8221; and on the books of Louisiana, if you can believe this, illegitimate children cannot inherit from their mother or their father, okay, if the child was illegitimate. I said, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that picture?&#8221; I understood why the law existed, even though it was wrong, why black children or illegitimate children could not inherit from the father, because way back in the day when that law was put on the books there was plantations and slaves and they were screwing us right and left, not only figuratively but literally, actually, [Laughs] and they did not want these half-breed children to come in for this white guy&#8217;s share of that plantation, the land, and all this kind of stuff, so that&#8217;s why that portion was there. JD: Right. SH: But there was no rhyme or reason in my mind why a child could not inherit from its mother, so that was the issue I used to get black women. I said why is it you can&#8217;t give your child what you want your child to have? Well they were just dumbfounded. They didn&#8217;t even know that was on the books, but it was there. A lot of black women then came in. We were able to expand that, about why should you as a woman make sixty-seven cents for every dollar a man makes, black or white? Why should that exist? Why should welfare--? Okay, they give welfare mothers I think at the time sixty-two dollars a month, yet they&#8217;ll give Catholic charities taking care of a child I think it was like a hundred and ninety-something a month. What is the difference between God&#8217;s children, okay? That&#8217;s the kind of things that ERA would be able to help us. If nothing else it creates the stepping stone for us to move on to those kind of issues. JD: Right. SH: So those kind of issues was what attracted them. When I did the flyers at the black churches and at all of the--what they call them?--Hellenic groups, the sororities, all of the social, because social clubs in Louisiana is a big deal. We went to the social clubs to get the women. I mean you need to see what rights you don&#8217;t have. JD: Right. SH: And very surprisingly at the meeting at the AFL-CIO office we had about fifty-some of them turn out, okay, and then we brought in the whole ERA issue. Some of them got very involved, which made the group more diverse,-- JD: Right. SH: --more balanced, and we were able to do a lot of things that we hadn&#8217;t been able to do before. So like I say it was a passion for me, to get women involved to run for office in their unions, because I always said if I could do it you can do it. JD: Right. SH: There is nothing special about me. I don&#8217;t have no--. At that time I didn&#8217;t have my college degree. I used to tell them I was an Angola potential inmate--Angola was the state prison--and I said the only reason why I&#8217;m probably not in jail, because at one time I wanted to shoot all white folk during the civil rights era, but you learn you can&#8217;t shoot them all so you put down the gun and you pick up a law book, you know? [Laughs] And you beat them that way. But they could relate to that. I had not gone to private schools; I had gone to public schools, lived in a poor neighborhood. I was no different from them. The difference was my mother used to say, &#8220;Every top stands on its own bottom,&#8221;-- JD: Absolutely. SH: --and if you limit yourself, that&#8217;s where you have to learn to live. JD: Right. SH: But your imagination should be your limit. You can achieve anything you can imagine. All you have to do is be focused. JD: Right, right. SH: Keep your eye on the prize, so to speak. So that was my attitude. If it can be taught I can learn. JD: Right. SH: It&#8217;s just that simple. I can learn. I don&#8217;t care what it is. I still have that attitude. JD: Right. SH: Now I may not be as fast, like I said, as others, but I can do it. I&#8217;m kind of like Home Depot: I can do it; you can help. JD: [Laughs] SH: [Laughs] But I can do it. JD: Right. I wanted to ask you, going back a couple of steps, because you mentioned earlier about this connection between the Civil Rights Movement and labor, did you have any Civil Rights Movement involvement prior to becoming involved in labor? SH: No, and the reason why I didn&#8217;t, I had a brother that was very involved but he gave my mother the blues, being involved. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen the movie &#8220;Mississippi Burning,&#8221; or read the book? JD: Mm hmm. SH: The little gentleman that ran that office in Meridian, Mississippi was named Matt Suarez. They used to call him the &#8220;Little Mexican.&#8221; Actually his name was Mateo Francisco Antonio Suarez. He&#8217;s my brother. JD: Oh, wow. SH: But nobody would remember Mateo so he just cut it short for Matt. JD: Mm hmm. SH: But during that time when he was running that office for CORE and SNCC and all of them back then, and these three boys were tarred and feathered, [Scherner] and Chaney and them, we had not heard from him. We didn&#8217;t know they were hiding him, because white folk was threatening their lives every day, and we didn&#8217;t know if he was the black that had been tarred and feathered. It was weeks before we had gotten any word from him. My mother almost went into a nervous breakdown because we didn&#8217;t know where he was and what had happened to him. But the only involvement was when he&#8217;d bring these Freedom Ride buses and we would have Freedom Riders camped all over our floor and my mama would be cooking for them, because he would just bring them. Mama always had red beans and rice and something that she would feed them and like I said they&#8217;d lay on the floor with blankets and stuff. Or they would be picketing in New Orleans, like I can remember when they did Kress and they would picket different stores, and I&#8217;d want to go because there was about an eight-year span between he and I, and my mother would say, &#8220;Are you out your damn mind? Keep your behind right here!&#8221; JD: [Laughs] Right. SH: And one time I remember clearly they went out one night, he and my sister and a couple of friends, and they went to this nightclub. They came back and they told us and I just thought it was the most hilarious thing. They went into this nightclub and as soon as they walk in, all these blacks--there must have been about five or six of them--the white bartender started immediately and said, &#8220;Man, please. Look, I don&#8217;t want no trouble. We just don&#8217;t serve Negroes here. It&#8217;s not me personally, that&#8217;s the business. I just work here. I just don&#8217;t want no trouble. They just don&#8217;t serve Negroes. Please don&#8217;t start nothing.&#8221; My brother said, &#8220;Did you order a Negro? I didn&#8217;t order a Negro.&#8221; JD: [Laughs] SH: &#8220;No, did you order a Negro? You don&#8217;t need to serve no Negroes. We don&#8217;t want none of them.&#8221; [Laughs] And the little guy was so upset. [Laughs] He was so nervous because whites were sitting at the end of the bar looking, and all that kind of thing. And they ultimately walked out, but they walked outside and just rolled and they came home and us, [Laughs] about they don&#8217;t serve Negroes, you know, nobody ordered one. [Laughs] JD: [Laughs] SH: But that was my only encounter, was through my brother. Then as I got older, like I said, I wind up going to LSU when it was first integrated a year or two before I got there. It must have been three thousand of them, whites, to every one of us. Then I went into the labor movement, integrated AT&amp;T, integrated the legislature, integrated the AFL-CIO. I wind up being the very blessed recipient of all that they had done. People often say, weren&#8217;t you afraid being the first? Really after awhile it just became, hey, I kind of like this, because when you are the first they bend backwards. There are always those that bend backwards to make sure you&#8217;re comfortable or have this, have the other, so I took advantage of it. JD: Right. SH: Now immediately when I got into the labor movement, particularly on the state level, what I discovered is that it was the labor movement that supported the NAACP. It was because of the A. Philip Randolph Institute that the labor movement supported one hundred percent that we were able to work hand in hand with the NAACP and other kind of civil rights advocacy groups. Then in the labor movement there was CLUW, the Coalition of Labor Union Women, which helped advance the rights of women within the labor movement, another wonderful group of women. JD: C-L-U-W? SH: Yeah, C-L-U-W. JD: Okay. SH: Coalition of Labor Union Women, who worked for the advancement of women not only in the workplace but also in the union, and I would venture to say--I couldn&#8217;t swear--but I would venture to say practically one hundred percent of the women that made it into the top echelon of the national AFL-CIO came out of CLUW, because that was one of their primary focus, to push women, because we used to always say you can&#8217;t clean somebody else&#8217;s backyard when your house need to be cleaned itself. JD: Right, absolutely. SH: So that&#8217;s what we used to do. On the black front we pushed through A. Philip Randolph Institute to make sure there was blacks moving up into the upper echelon, and then on the women&#8217;s front we used CLUW to push for women within the AFL-CIO to make sure we had sufficient representation. We did, we finally got black men onto the national board long before we got women, but we got finally got black men onto the national AFL-CIO board and black women onto the national board. I tell people all the time I was just born at just the right time in life. I&#8217;m what you call a baby boomer. I was born in &#8217;46. I came up through the civil rights legislation, the voting rights legislation, the Homestead Act, the women&#8217;s rights, a time of change. I&#8217;ve been there to see it all, and of course the highlight of my life was Obama, because never in my wildest dream did I ever believe I would live to see a black president. I can remember being on the streets with the A. Philip Randolph Institute, going to people&#8217;s houses and begging them to go register and to vote, and they would say, &#8220;It don&#8217;t make no damn difference. You be voting for all these white folk, ain&#8217;t none of them do no good. They ain&#8217;t going to help you,&#8221; and I&#8217;d be lying through my teeth, and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Oh, yes, ma&#8217;am. You have to do it. Just think if Martin wouldn&#8217;t have done it. I wouldn&#8217;t be in the job--.&#8221; Which was true. You have to do it for those that come behind you. You&#8217;re not doing it for yourself, and that was my pitch to get them out, okay? But I ain&#8217;t never thought I&#8217;d ever see no black president. I ain&#8217;t going to lie. [Laughs] Never. Never, never, never. And when he ran initially I was a Hilary supporter because I thought Hilary had the clout. I never thought. It didn&#8217;t take me very long, because I didn&#8217;t know very much about Obama prior to, but as I listened to him and I heard him be able to articulate issues, I mean clearly, and I say, &#8220;Where&#8217;d this little Negro come from?&#8221; I&#8217;ve never heard of him, you know? But as you listen to him--. I mean they say he&#8217;s charismatic. I say he was a smart little mother, and if you had any sense and listened to what he was saying you had to acknowledge he was brighter than the average bear. JD: Right. SH: And I quickly switched from Hilary to Obama, and a lot of my friends used to tease me, and certainly my white friends. They were upset with me when I switched, and I just said I could not in all good consciousness support Hilary, not that I don&#8217;t think she would be great, not that I don&#8217;t think she was capable. She had everything to be a good president but this is the first and only time I would imagine in my lifetime that there was someone equally qualified who looked like me. JD: Right. SH: Who spoke like me, who had the same sensitivities, which was more important to me than anything. He had the same sensitivities. Whether he always articulated it, if you listened to him you knew it. I could not in just conscience not support him. So it was not a hard thing, was not a difficult thing, I ain&#8217;t never looked back, wasn&#8217;t mad with nobody who was mad with me. JD: [Laughs] Right, right. SH: Okay? [Laughs] I was an Obama delegate and went to the convention as such. Was not even interested really in going to the convention before, did not lobby, did not call anybody, until I became Obama, and then I knew I had to be there. I just had to be there, and God blessed me and I was. JD: Wow, wow. SH: So I&#8217;ve had a good life. I&#8217;ve done things like I was co-chair of the women&#8217;s delegation for Louisiana for International Women&#8217;s Year. I got to go to Kenya also, Houston and then to Kenya. I mean how many black women get to do those kind of things? I was at the convention where the first black president was nominated. JD: Wow. SH: How many black people got to do that, a thousand of us? JD: Right. SH: In the whole nation? JD: Right. SH: How blessed am I? How really blessed am I? Then in terms of lobbying I got to do things that most of us just pray to be able to do. We always pray to God to use us, direct us. I got to do things that you can&#8217;t help but your heart feel light, your eyes light up, and you know not that you are special but God has just chosen you to be the one to do this. They used to want to arrest little black boys and girls for playing hooky, fingerprint, mug them, at ten, nine. I was able to kill that legislation for years and years and years. I say now whether black parents anywhere in Louisiana knew I did it, I knew I did it. I was able to help move voter registration laws to help make it easier for us to work in communities to get people registered. I didn&#8217;t care if nobody knew it; I knew it. By the virtue of the position I was in I was able to get black people jobs in state government where there&#8217;d never been blacks before, and when I couldn&#8217;t do it I pushed Victor Bussie and he always came through, just by the virtue of the job. I told you when they gave me this quarter of a million dollars, two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, to do voter registration? We put seventy thousand black folk on the roll within a two to three month period that had never been registered before. I did that--or I headed that campaign. I didn&#8217;t do it by myself; a bunch of people did it. JD: Right. SH: But I was able to head it, and I like I said it wasn&#8217;t about me. It was truly just about the virtue of the position I was in, and the position was truly a God gift, and I never forgot that. When people used to say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do that, you&#8217;re president.&#8221; And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;That and fifty cents will get me a cup of coffee.&#8221; I never forgot where I came from. JD: Absolutely. SH: Never forgot where I came from or who I was, because I used to tell them all the time, it matters not how much education you have. It matters not how much money you have. In the eyes of a racist you&#8217;re still a nigger, and you&#8217;d best not forget it. You&#8217;d best not forget it. You know how they say in church you need to know who you are and whose you are, okay, and I try to keep that in mind. Even now, even though I never knew what they say was your God-given purpose, I knew God had blessed me and placed me in positions where I was able to do things. But I didn&#8217;t know if that was my purpose because I never looked at it like that. I didn&#8217;t know what my purpose was. I went all through college and didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to be when I grew up. [Laughs] I just didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to be. So I was going, believe it or not, into education, because I said when I retire I&#8217;ll go teach. At LSU you have to do four semesters of practice teaching. I discovered that was not the thing for me. JD: [Laughs] SH: Okay? So I wind up--. I change out of elementary ed and I discovered I had a three point seven in English Lit and I said well, hell, English Lit it is, so I went and got a degree in English Lit, but I just didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to be. Then I decided that I wanted to do the contracting thing. Where that came from I swear I don&#8217;t know. I never in my wildest dreams thought I&#8217;d be in Alexandria, Louisiana. How I got there I&#8217;m not clear, but what I have been able to do as a general contractor, through the grace of God, I&#8217;ve gotten contracts to repair old people&#8217;s houses, old people who lived in sometimes unsanitary, not decent, dilapidated housing, and I&#8217;ve been able to get them fifteen, twenty-five thousand dollars that I can go in and do their floors, do their roof, give every woman what she want, a nice looking kitchen or bathroom. Some of them are so grateful, you feel like, hey, this has got to be all there is to happiness in life. But I discovered there&#8217;s two kinds of old people: [Laughs] the very grateful and then the kind that there&#8217;s nothing you can do to make them happy. But you can&#8217;t be mad with them, and let me just tell you why, because these people have worked all of their lives, never made very much money, most of them are living on minimum fixed income. I&#8217;m talking like three hundred fifty [or] seventy-five dollars a month. How they&#8217;re doing it I have no clue. But they&#8217;re living on fixed incomes, dilapidated housing, bodies are broken and wearing down, nobody come to visit them; they&#8217;re angry. They&#8217;re angry with God, they&#8217;re angry with just life, they don&#8217;t understand the why of their lives, and whatever you do it&#8217;s not enough, and it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not enough. Normally it&#8217;s not enough money to do half of what they need in their houses. I can just do some things. Rarely do I have money to do all things, so you do what you can, and inevitably: &#8220;Well can&#8217;t you just do that?&#8221; [Laughs] JD: [Laughs] SH: &#8220;Can&#8217;t you just do that?&#8221; and you wind up doing a couple more things you ain&#8217;t being paid for. JD: Uh huh. SH: But you do it. But no matter what you do it&#8217;s still not enough. JD: Right, right. SH: Because they need so much more. And you just have to get to a point and you say, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, I have to pay these people to do this. [Laughs] This little grant was for fifteen thousand dollars. I can&#8217;t do all of that,&#8221; you know. JD: Right. SH: But I kind of think that&#8217;s my purpose, to be honest with you. I&#8217;ve kind of discerned that&#8217;s my purpose. I&#8217;m supposed to do that. I&#8217;m supposed to deal with the headache and the heartache of it for some and then deal with the joy of it for others. There&#8217;s one program in Louisiana, and if this is heard or read by anybody I hope every state in the nation have it, because there&#8217;s a program, it&#8217;s limited money, but for old people who are living in houses that need to be condemned, Louisiana will allow me to go and inspect those houses and if I say it&#8217;s not livable--these old people, that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re sick, they&#8217;re ill--they will tear that house down and build what they call a replacement house for these old people, absolutely one hundred percent free. JD: Wow. SH: Now the sad part is that I&#8217;ve had one man die two weeks before I was finished. He never got to live in it. Then there are others who may get to live two or three years. There are others who are fortunate and live longer. But I can&#8217;t help but, like I say, feel the joy that for once in their life they live in a brand new house, everything shiny. They give them everything, the refrigerator, stove, the ice box, three bedrooms, two baths, living room, dining room. Now it&#8217;s not extremely large. It&#8217;s kind of like eleven hundred square feet. But for just an old lady, who we know is not going to be just an old lady because she&#8217;s going to bring her grandchildren and her daughter [Laughs] and all these other people who&#8217;s also never lived in a new house,-- JD: Right, right. SH: --to live with her. But is there anything better than that, being able to do those kind of things? JD: That&#8217;s amazing. SH: That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. I&#8217;ve had such a wonderful life, you know? Just a wonderful life, and I love it, and I&#8217;m just so grateful. The labor movement has been a very important part of me being able to step those stones and to see a bigger vision. I was a little black girl off [Roman] Street in the projects. I had no role models. My mother and father worked for minimum wage all of their lives. It was not until after my mother and father both died [that] all of my sisters and brothers went back, we all went back, and got our degrees. My mother and them didn&#8217;t live to see that. We had nobody professional in our family. In fact we didn&#8217;t have very much family, period, because my father, I told you, had a Hispanic background and his family all married white folk. My mother&#8217;s mother died in childbirth, so it was just us, all our lives just us. So for all of us to have come as far as we did, because my mother never let us think that there was anything we couldn&#8217;t do. JD: Which is so important. SH: Right. JD: That&#8217;s the key. SH: She never let us think that there was anything we couldn&#8217;t do. All you have to do is put your mind to it, she used to say, and nothing comes without hard work and sacrifice. If you think you can just go out there and get it easy it&#8217;s not going to happen. You&#8217;re going to have to work hard and sacrifice a lot, but if you just do that and stay focused, it&#8217;s going to happen for you, she used to say, and it has. All my brothers and sisters are successful, every last one of them. I look back and I say, how God? How did it ever happen for us? But it did, and I&#8217;m grateful. JD: That&#8217;s amazing. Well Ms. Holt, thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me. This has been--...
