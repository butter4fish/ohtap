 Evangeline Mee: This is Evangeline Mee, and I&#8217;m here with J.W. and Kate Bradley at their home in Wartburg, Tennessee, and it&#8217;s May 29, 2012. So Mrs. Bradley I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about your childhood and maybe where was your home and where you came from and things like that. Kate Bradley: Well, I was raised in Petros. Born and raised. Me and J.W. both were. And we was just stayed there until about eighteen years ago we left, and we&#8217;d been there all our life. And we felt like we wanted to do something good for our community because there was nothing much there except the prison, Brushy Mountain Prison. And we started working towards trying to get a better school for our kids and get building them--. Them Vanderbilt kids come up, and we got interested, and they helped us. And we built a health clinic. Then we got National Health Service Corps doctors. And we worked real hard. And it was just local, you know, and what they did down there, but we just met some wonderful people, and they helped us. And their families. And we&#8217;re still friends. And we still hear from them. Especially on Christmas. I get cards and pictures from all the kids, and I, you know, I love that. And--. My daddy was a coal miner. He worked in the coal mines. And I was one of seven children. And that&#8217;s just about it. J.W. Bradley: Delivered by a company doctor. KB: Yeah, we had the same doctor when we was born. EM: Really? KB: Yeah [Laughter]. EM: And where were you born? KB: In Petros. EM: In Petros. KB: At home. And his mother and dad live in Petros, and he was born with the same doctor at home. EM: Wow. And what number in the seven were you? KB: Let&#8217;s see. I was the sixth one. EM: The sixth one. So you were near the youngest. KB: I was the sixth--. Actually she has nine kids but two of them died. But I was number six. EM: Wow, so you had a lot of older brothers and sisters? KB: Yeah. Yeah. They&#8217;re all gone now. All my older--. I&#8217;ve got two brothers and a sister younger than me, but all the older ones are gone. EM: And what memories do you have of your dad as being a coal miner? KB: Well, I can just remember him going to work and coming in black and-- with coal dust. And it was kind of a hard life. But my mother always worked and had a big garden and raised all kinds of our food. And daddy, he&#8217;d pick berries and go in the woods and kill squirrels and all that kind of stuff. But school and church was about all we had back then. EM: And how long did you live there? KB: Well, let&#8217;s see. Well, after I married--. We married--. We was going about two years, and the rest of my life we lived out there until we moved here. Nineteen, eighteen years ago. EM: And what year did ya&#8217;ll get married? KB: &#8217;51. We&#8217;ve been married sixty years. EM: How did you guys meet each other? KB: I guess we just knew each other all of our life. Growing up there in Petros. [Laughter] EM: So you moved here to Wartburg about eighteen, nineteen years ago? KB: Yeah. EM: And when did you start getting interested in SOCM [Save Our Cumberland Mountains]? KB: Oh that was way back there in Petros. EM: Way back there. Could you talk about how that kind of started and how you got involved in that? KB: Well, he more or less was the president of SOCM for several years, but I always went with him &#8211; cooked for everybody. Fed everybody that come through the valley. We had all kinds of people come through. We fed people running for president and senators and preachers. I told him I&#8217;ve fed the saints and the sinners! [Laughter]. JWB: There was a guy; he was the treasurer of the state of Tennessee, and he decided to run for governor. And he run and some of the political people was afraid that he would win, so somebody offered him a judgeship, federal judgeship. And he was over the federal court in Nashville. And there was one time some truck miners&#8212;or truck drivers&#8212;sued me and a few more people for a hundred thousand dollars because we had brought a suit again them for running overloaded. And so we went to Nashville and went before this judge, and he asked me, he said, &#8220;Mr. Bradley.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Why are you again the barratry statutes?&#8221; The state of Tennessee had the barratry statutes, which allowed citizens to bring lawsuits, and I said, &#8220;Well, if we don&#8217;t have that access to the court system, it has caused a chilling affect on organizations like us.&#8221; So we defeated the state&#8217;s barratry statute by attacking its legality. KB: We&#8217;ve had several women that were president of SOCM after J.W. That was good leaders. EM: So what was the women&#8217;s leadership role in SOCM? Was there any difference between--? KB: The women were the strongest in there! They backed J.W. better than many of the men. I mean, they&#8217;d go forward, and they&#8217;d get in trouble and everything. But women made SOCM strong I think. EM: Why do you think that was? KB: Well, they were just interested. And we had a girl from Vanderbilt; she was a Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family, Helani Cook. And she come up here and stayed in these mountains with us and helped organize. And then there&#8217;s a young man, John Gaventa. He was a Rhodes scholar. And he come in the mountains, and he couldn&#8217;t understand all the wealth that was in the mountains like the timber and the coal and everything and the people. Our schools were poor and roads--everything. And he couldn&#8217;t understand that--why all that. He was raised in Africa really. And so he just got with us, and they organized SOCM. But John his parents were missionaries in Africa. And he was raised over there, and his mother was his teacher. She taught him. And he was so smart, when he got back, he went to on the board of Vanderbilt. And he was a good friend. Good worker. But Helani was the Vanderbilt that helped there, and her family they come visited with us and everything. We just met everybody [laughter]. EM: So why were you first interested in SOCM? What first drew you to it? KB: Well, he was the one that was first interested in getting it organized because of the strip mining, and he was just not happy about it. And he got that group together. And that first case they done before they really organized was the tax equalization board. And J.W. and about thirteen people--. That&#8217;s the first case ya&#8217;ll had wasn&#8217;t it? JWB: Yeah. In five counties. We was only able to get thirteen people from five counties that was willing to go to the capitol and ask the people to tax the land according to the law and by it&#8217;s rightful value. And they agreed to do it, and so then we decided since we had made a victory, while we had so many problems, we&#8217;d just form an organization. And I told them, I said, &#8220;The next meeting we&#8217;ll name this organization, and we&#8217;ll give whoever names it five dollars&#8221; [KB laughter]. We never did. But we had so many problems: our roads were being tore up by overloaded trucks, our mountains were being destroyed by strip mining. And TVA helped shut down the coal industry. We had a pretty good coal industry when they started. In fact, I started out in the mines when I was eighteen year old. And eventually TVA is just about to close down all the mining in the state of Tennessee. And I worked with TVA&#8217;s lawyers and showed them where that they was layer-loading the coal, putting stuff in there that wouldn&#8217;t burn. And so they had a spill four or five year ago down there at Kingston. You may have heard about&#8212; EM: Yeah, I remember. JWB: Well, that was because that they had been accepting stuff that wouldn&#8217;t burn. And I took TVA&#8217;s lawyers in the woods and showed them what was going on, and we finally got it in the federal court in Knoxville. And they didn&#8217;t do anything about it, and it continued to get worse because, when we went to federal court, and they saw that they couldn&#8217;t be sued in court over layer-loading, why, the ones that wasn&#8217;t layer-loading, started it. And that&#8217;s what made the spill as big as it was. EM: So, [interruption] you were talking about how you kind of got involved in SOCM because Mr. Bradley was the president. What kind of kept you involved? What was your interest? KB: Working! Cooking! I cooked and worked. I&#8217;d cooked all day long. The crowds would come in from strip mine tours, and I would feed them. Every weekend. And we never eat a family dinner without three or four extras just dropping by [laughter]. I fed everybody in the world. EM: And did you do any kind of community organizing? KB: That&#8217;s when I started working with the health programs. EM: Oh ok! Could you talk about your idea for that and how it got started? KB: Well, I worked in--. I actually started--. I was on the health council in Wartburg and on the county health council? And then we just kept on--. Me and J.W. was on that, and they rotated me and him as members of the health council for twenty-five years. But we helped get a health clinic built out here, working with them. And then I got interested in raising money to build a health clinic. And we had a little engineer from Vanderbilt that drew the plans up for the clinic. And then they come up and worked. So they even had dinners down at Vanderbilt: bean and onion and cornbread dinners [laughter]. And they helped us raise money. We got donations from everywhere. And we got that clinic built. And we had a boy from Vanderbilt that got out of medical school, and he was our first doctor. And then the engineer&#8217;s wife was a nurse practitioner, and she was our first nurse. And we really had lots of luck, and the Lord blessed us. Bill Dowd, that guy-- he&#8217;s from Chapel Hill. Pittsboro is where he lives I think. And he was really helped us a lot. Really stood by us. And the people in Petros were pretty good to help. It&#8217;s mostly family and friends. It got to where we would work, and then other people would want to come in and take over that didn&#8217;t know a thing about what they was doing. So we had to work with one had and fight with the other till it finally got awful disgusting. But we got what we wanted done. And we have a lot of good stories come out of that. EM: Do you remember any of the good stories that you could share? KB: Well, I&#8217;ll tell you this story about this: we got ready to buy the land to build the clinic. There was a boy from Vanderbilt; his father was friends with the president of the Southern Railroad. So he made me an appointment to see about buying the spot where we wanted to build the clinic. So when I got down to Nashville to meet with him, he said, &#8220;Well, you must be Ms. Bradley. You&#8217;re the only woman here!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yessir.&#8221; So he said, &#8220;You just sit right here by me.&#8221; He&#8217;s an old man. I was about forty at the time. He said, &#8220;Just sit right here by me.&#8221; Well, there was our county judge and the Agriculture Extension Office and a bunch of them over there trying to block us from getting that railroad land. Course they didn&#8217;t like me, and I didn&#8217;t like them. We&#8217;d been fighting for months. And this old--. I don&#8217;t know what all they had told him. They got there before I did. But anyway, this old man said, &#8220;You sit right here by me,&#8221; and he whispered and told me. He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll get your land.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So he hauled around a little while, and he said, &#8220;Gentleman, Ms. Bradley&#8217;s going to get her land.&#8221; But see what I&#8217;d told him; I said, &#8220;These politicians can give you a lot of money, but I get mine,&#8221; (it&#8217;s in this story) &#8220;but I got mine from cupcakes and having dinners and things.&#8221; When he told them that, they got up and out of there they went, and they never said a word. But he hollered and he said, &#8220;Why gentleman, me and Ms. Bradley&#8217;s been having an affair for years.&#8221; And I&#8217;d never laid eyes on him before. I thought, &#8220;Oh boy, when they get back to Morgan County and tell that!&#8221; [Laughter]. But then he laughed, and he said, &#8220;My daughter is in Harvard, and she&#8217;s doing the same work you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll get your money.&#8221; And we got it! But--. JWB: Kate raised money and bought a community building. And then she raised money to build a library for the clinic. EM: Wow, so you&#8217;ve done a lot of fundraising. KB: Yeah. We sold rummage every Saturday. J.W.&#8217;s mother and another old lady there in the community. Every Saturday they&#8217;d work all day in the rummage sales, you know, selling. And there was a church in Oak Ridge. A big, Methodist church would give us truckloads of rummage to sell, and we made a lot of money. And then we&#8217;d cook! We sold pies and cakes and had dinners. There&#8217;s one boy from Vanderbilt; his aunt in New Jersey&#8212;they had a bake sale and sent us the money to own the clinic. And one of the girls that stayed with us, they made a record at her high school and sold it and give us the money from that. And we just had a lot of little things, you know, that--. Women done it, you know. And it just really went over. It was fun but it was a lot of work. Course I never worked for anything that paid any money. It was all volunteer. Never got a nickel for nothing. And there was a woman there in the town; she was so jealous. She wanted to--. Everything I did and brought in she would tell things. She knew for a fact that I got a big salary from the government to run the communities here [laughter]. And you know I had to fight that kind of junk too, you know. But that about the railroad, that was fun. That man--. We laughed. But was just a jolly old man, and he sure put me on the spot! [Laughter]. Why I made talk, speeches everywhere. Went down there one time and all the health council members from the other two clinic &#8211; some of them went. Well, we went down there to a big church, and they said--. We was all going to talk about our program. And when we got down there, and I was first. And I mad my talk, and I said--. Well, I was the speaker of the day and I didn&#8217;t even know it. EM: [Laughter]. KB: We just had lots of things like that happen. But them kids they had a cake walk down there one time. And two little boys from Vanderbilt come by and one of them said, &#8220;I wonder what they&#8217;re doing?&#8221; One of them said; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but it just costs a quarter. Let&#8217;s try it!&#8221; They got their quarter [laughter]. But three years ago, Vanderbilt, they had a reunion. So we went, and it was great. They come from all over the United States to that forty years. And we just met them, and people was just tickled to death. But there was one boy, his daddy taught medicine at Vanderbilt, and he was a doctor. And he was the biggest cut up, and he&#8217;d tease and go on, and he told J.W. one day; he said; J.W. said, &#8220;When Kate gets forty, I&#8217;m going to swap her off for two twenties&#8221;. Well, them boys they thought that was the funniest thing, and they come and brought him two Monopoly twenty dollars. And they said, &#8220;Now we bought her. We&#8217;re taking here home with us.&#8221; So it&#8217;d been forty years, and we was down there at Vanderbilt. And one of the girls that&#8217;d been down there at nursing school; she was hugging him, and he just walked up. And I recognized him right off. And he said; I said, &#8220;When you get through hugging her, you can hug me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You bought me for twenty dollars and then you run off and left me.&#8221; And he looked really funny [laughter] and he turned around and he said, &#8220;Why Kate!&#8221; [Laughter]. We had a lot of fun. Bob, he worked at Briceville. And he&#8217;d come in every evening, and he&#8217;d try to get at my house for supper [laughter]. I fed them all. We clothed them with rummage and everything [laughter]. But it was worth every bit of it. And one little girl--. See they stayed in homes. Different ones. I picked homes special for them. And one little girl: I had lost her. And I wondered and wondered about her. And at the reunion, why she was there. And she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you remember me.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yes, I remember you, Sue Colby.&#8221; And she&#8217;s been writing to me ever since [laughter]. At Christmas, she sent me a crate of oranges from Florida. We&#8217;ve just kept up with a lot of them, you know. EM: And these were all people that helped you with the health clinic? KB: Yeah, they were just students! And now some of them&#8217;s retired. That girl there she&#8217;s a retired doctor in Virginia Beach. EM: Was it mostly students that helped you? KB: Oh, yeah. Mmhm. That&#8217;s students that did that. And they gave up their summer and didn&#8217;t go home. There&#8217;s boy, a Jewish boy from New York, who stayed two summer&#8217;s with us and didn&#8217;t even go home. He stayed with us. And now he&#8217;s got his own law firm down in Nashville, and they come down to see us. Him and his wife come by to see us two or three months ago. And he won a case for women before the Supreme Court. EM: Wow. What was it? KB: I don&#8217;t remember what it was. JWB: Something about women&#8217;s rights. Irwin Venick would be the guy. KB: Mmhm. EM: So did you guys ever&#8212;. When you guys got married, did you ever think that you would be so much community organization. That so much activism would be a part of your life? KB: Well, actually, we worked for years in the church. And we were both real active in the church. I helped build--. J.W. done the labor; I raised the money to build two churches. And everything. That was always my thing to raise money. So I guess it just sort of, when we got involved in the environmental agency, well we just--. It just come natural for me to raise money, I reckon. EM: [Laughter]. Do you know why that would be? KB: No, I really don&#8217;t! EM: Just something you&#8217;re good at? KB: Honey, I&#8217;m the only one in my family. I don&#8217;t have a brother or a sister that ever was outgoing or ever done anything worth while. You know. JWB: You got a brother that put forty-four year up in the navy. KB: Yeah. Yeah, my oldest brother, next to my oldest brother, he had forty-four years in the navy, and he had more time than any man in the United States. But other than that none of the rest of them would never even get up and do nothing. But I just always liked to be active. JWB: Always worked with kids. When I was just about eighteen, I went to a guy that owned some land there in Petros and got him to give me permission to build a cabin on his land. And I built a cabin, just a recreational cabin, for us boys. And then I always worked with the boys in the ball--. Took them fishing. They didn&#8217;t have no way to get fishing, and I&#8217;d take them fishing. And I&#8217;d take them to the movie. And when we started building the churches, why I&#8217;d go through town, and I&#8217;d tell them; I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Ya&#8217;ll want to go for a ride?&#8221; And they&#8217;d say, &#8220;Yep!&#8221; And I&#8217;d load them up and take them out to church and put them out and put them to work [laughter]. KB: I&#8217;ve got a little booklet that&#8217;s made at Vanderbilt. And it was about &#8211; do you remember when they shut the prison down in Petros? EM: No. KB: Well, they shut the prison down, and there&#8217;s a guy that come up there and was--. This is the one of the man. That&#8217;s me and this was our nurse. And this was a girl from Texas. And this was the guy that was--. He&#8217;s in the White House now. He was assistant to that lady that&#8217;s the head of the health and human services. He&#8217;s her assistant. And this is an old man that&#8217;s back up in Briceville clinic. This guy right here was a news reporter for the Nashville Tennessean, and he done a lot of stuff to help us. And this was &#8211; Jack Cohen &#8211; he was a photographer for the Nashville Tennessean, and he&#8217;s done a lot to. And this guy was a--. Bill was a Jew. Jewish. And his wife come from a real strong German family here in Morgan County. So when they married, her family turned against her and wouldn&#8217;t have nothing to do with her cause she had married this Jewish man. Well, she died, and he come to us, and he said, &#8220;Mary would like to be buried in Morgan County.&#8221; But none of her family was interested. So we had bought a big lot with several, and I said, &#8220;J.W., tell him to bring her to us.&#8221; And we&#8217;ve got her up there buried in our family lot. And they lived in California. So when he died, his two daughters mailed us his ashes, and we&#8217;ve got him up there. EM: You&#8217;re family&#8217;s getting bigger! KB: [Laughter]. He was a good guy. We loved him, and he did us. EM: So did you find that you preferred to have your separate causes that you worked on: you had the health clinic and you were president? KB: Well, we sort of worked together, you know. I&#8217;d go to Nashville for a fundraiser, and J.W. would always go and help me. I backed him; he backed me. There he was at this Mountain Life thing. Where&#8217;s that article? There&#8217;s where we got invited to the health--. This was an editorial about our clinic when we opened up from the paper. Yeah, we got invited to the White House. EM: Oh, wow! Tell me about that! JWB: Jimmy Carter--. KB: Jimmy Carter. EM: So why did you get invited to the White House? KB: Because of the strip mining bill; we got invited to watch them sign the bill. EM: Mm. And what was the bill? KB: Something about the strip mining bill or something. There&#8217;s a little article where we got invited. EM: Mm. 1977. KB: Mhmm. EM: Wow. And so what did this bill say? JWB: Well, that was the federal strip mine bill passed in 1977, and we had been working to try to get strip mining abolished or fazed out. And Jimmy Carter, and Ford they&#8217;d give him a bill before he&#8217;d come out of office, and he vetoed it. And Jimmy Carter said, &#8220;If I&#8217;d have been President, I wouldn&#8217;t have vetoed it.&#8221; And so then the whole industry began to weaken the bill that they&#8217;d give Ford. And we was working and trying to get strip mining fazed out, when they passed the bill. Why we&#8217;d worked on it so long, they invited. But I wouldn&#8217;t go. And there was only two provisions in the bill that was any good. One of them that was you could declare land unsuitable for strip mining if it had a higher value, and the other was a tax on mining coal for these strip mined lands. And the date was up on it, so they was fixing to drop it, and I wrote Jimmy Carter a letter and told him that I though since he had signed the bill, he ought to help us see that it was reinstated. And he wrote me back and told me--. Well, it said he felt like it was going to be reinstated but no help from the President or the administration. And I wrote him back, and I told him, &#8220;You can&#8217;t get out of it that easy.&#8221; And he didn&#8217;t answer that letter. But he only answered one. Told me that they would reinstate the tax on the coal. And they let it go for two years and lost all that money that would have been available for reclamation. EM: So you were talking about that there were some enemies. Who were the enemies of either SOCM or the health clinic? KB: Well, I dealt with strip miners and a lot of jealousy. And we had one woman: she butted in everything we had done. She hated J.W. Cause he had been a deputy sheriff and caught her in some illegal stuff and exposed her, and she hated him. So everything that I done, she would come in and attack me in front of people. So I didn&#8217;t like her either, and me and her--. When she&#8217;d jump me, I&#8217;d jump back. But this was an anonymous letter I got in the mail one time. I never did know who wrote it. But I was always having--. EM: Could you read it? KB: She says, &#8220;Bless you, Kate Bradley, for speaking out with your letter in the Morgan County News. We know how it is to do something, and someone else step in and take credit. We have been run over by this so-called extension service [laughter] leader. We&#8217;re sick of him, but people are afraid&#8212;er, can&#8217;t speak up. You speak the minds of many people, and we thank you for it. The majority of the county wanted to move the extension service out and use the money to much better use, but the county court felt sorry for the poor little fellow and kept him, so we go on putting up with waste we don&#8217;t need. The best to you and your work for better health in your community.&#8221; I never did know who wrote &#8211; who sent it. But when the prison closed, there was a guy come in there and wrote--. He wrote a story about what we did. I have it right there. And then it went in the Vanderbilt paper. There&#8217;s where we had our ground breaking for the clinic. But there was a news reporter from&#8212;Daniel Ford Thomas. Course that was before your time, but he was always getting me in something. And he called me wanted to know if I&#8217;d make a talk about the school system in Morgan County before the superintendents of schools. And I went down there, and I bet every superintendent in the state of Tennessee was there. And I made a talk about my life and how the unequal education was. That&#8217;s a clipping of a rally we had down in Nashville. EM: So what did you say about the inequality of education? KB: Well, let&#8217;s see. I have it right here. JWB: We had a school in Petros that was in terrible shape. In fact, it had bats in the attic, and you know bats carry bed bugs? And the bed bugs would fall out of the attic on the kids in the class. So they elected me president of the PTA, and I tried to get the school superintendent to do something about it, and they wouldn&#8217;t. And so I tried to get him to close the school down. And there was a guy that was running for superintendent of schools, and he come in, and he said, &#8220;J.W.,&#8221; he said, &#8220;If you help me get elected superintendent of the schools, I&#8217;ll see about helping you all get a building built.&#8221; So after he was elected, I waited a couple of months and invited him and the school board up there. And they come up there, and I took care of what business we had and turned it over to him. And he said, &#8220;Well,&#8221; said, &#8220;Actually, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s time to go before the county court and ask for a bond issue to build a building.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Mr. Galloway, we didn&#8217;t invite you out here to ask you what your opinion was. We invited you up here because you said you&#8217;d help us get a school built.&#8221; So I just ordered a petition from the floor and said, &#8220;We [38:38] signed citizens request the school board and the superintendent go before the county court on Monday (that was Thursday) and ask for a bond issue to build a building.&#8221; And so they did and it passed. And some of the JPs, when it passed, they cussed and said if they&#8217;d know&#8217;d it was going to pass, they wouldn&#8217;t have voted for it. KB: That&#8217;s what I talked about at that forum. So that night they had a band quitting the commissioner of education. He said, &#8220;I wish everybody in this building had heard Kate Bradley this morning.&#8221; I just do anything they tell me to, you know. And he wanted me to eat with him, sit with him that night at the band. And then when we got our school built, he asked me to come to the groundbreaking. And I about threw the first shovel of dirt [39:40]. EM: So the new school got built? KB: Yeah, we got it! Mmhm. EM: So did you guys attend the school you were talking about? KB: My daughter did. EM: Oh, your daughter did. KB: And then our two grandchildren&#8217;s going to it now. They don&#8217;t know how we got it. EM: But the elementary school that was built in 1928 that had the problems, did you guys go to that when you were kids? KB: Yeah. JWB: The reason we were wanting a new building was because that one was in such bad repair. And so they decided to build one, and it turned out that it&#8217;s going to be kind of a round school building. And I told them; I said, &#8220;We won&#8217;t argue with you about the design of the building. It&#8217;s just more expensive to build one like this.&#8221; And at the time it was built, it was the only fully air-conditioned, heated school in the county. And it&#8217;s been going on since the 70s. KB: And one time when we was building the clinic, they gave us a grant of five thousand dollars to buy equipment. Well, the county judge, he didn&#8217;t like me, and he wouldn&#8217;t give it to us. So I had been in Washington with this guy I showed you, and I told them that--. I&#8217;d been in Washington and the guy that was our host while we were there and took care of us that three or four days we was there. Well, he would call me, and he liked me. And so they wouldn&#8217;t give me that five thousand dollars over at the courthouse. The judge wouldn&#8217;t give it to me. So I just wrote him a letter and told him what they--, and he wrote the county judge and told him: &#8220;They&#8217;re due that money, and you give it to them.&#8221; Well, he still wouldn&#8217;t give it to me. So the health council &#8211; the county health council &#8211; supported me. And they got behind me, and we this guy at the school. Here at Wartburg. And it was filled that night, and they had the news people making pictures. And had me sitting up by the county judge. And they made tell that he wouldn&#8217;t give it, you know. And I told! He said [whisper], &#8220;You come out Monday morning, and I&#8217;ll give you that check.&#8221; And he did! [Laughter]. When I bought the equipment for the clinic, I made copies to the penny of the receipts, and he said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to say, I&#8217;ve never had a more accurate account.&#8221; But I knew I had to walk the chalk because he--. They was after me anyway! But we had to fight for everything. We bite! JWB: These are all war stories. This is not what your looking for. EM: No, these are great stories! JWB: You&#8217;re looking for something specific. EM: No, these are great stories. I&#8217;m interested in the stories that ya&#8217;ll want to share. So those are the best ones are the ones that ya&#8217;ll like to talk about. KB: Well, we--. Like I said, we was involved in a lot of junk. EM: It sounds like the community really supported ya&#8217;ll though. KB: They did. The ones that was really committed. There&#8217;s always some that&#8217;ll help, and then there&#8217;s some that won&#8217;t do nothing for you. And there all people--. Now this girl worked with SOCM from the very beginning, Maureen O&#8217;Connell. Do you know Maureen? EM: Oh, I&#8217;ve read the--. The grad student that I was telling you about did an interview with her. KB: Well, now she just retired this year. So she&#8217;s--. This was the story it was about it. This guy come from Vanderbilt and this was in the little Vanderbilt paper that they had. And it tells a lot about what we did. Now, the law students come in there, and they got hundreds of black lung checks get started for these miners. And this boy--. That was me and J.W., and that was when the prison closed. And this one said--. But I&#8217;ve got the magazine. I&#8217;m trying to find it. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve done with it. I had it last night. EM: It said, &#8220;You filled them with delicious food and homey conversation, and then tell them about your little town.&#8221; [Laughter] KB: One time there was a man from Highlander Center. You know where--. You familiar? EM: Mhmm. KB: Horton. What was his first name? JWB: Miles. KB: Miles Horton was in charge of that and founded that. And sent me one time to New Mexico to visit with a health clinic out there that they&#8217;d built way back in the mountains. A hundred and fifty miles from Albuquerque. And he paid my way, and another lady from Kentucky went with me. And that was really an event. But you know I&#8217;m still the--. One of my best friends in all the world is out there. I stayed with her family. They were Mexican, and I stayed with them while I was there. And me and her has been friends ever since. And we had a lot of interesting things happen because they wasn&#8217;t nobody there but the Indians and Mexicans. And they teased and carried on, and we had a good time! But I was scared to death part of the time. But we had a good time. EM: So do you think home cooked meals are the key to getting stuff done? KB: That was my secret! Course J.W. would take them on strip mine tours, and I&#8217;d feed them when they&#8217;d get back. And worked myself to death trying to feed them all and keep them going. But I always fed them! And I even fed Alexander Heard from Vanderbilt, and his wife. They eat with us. Oh, let me tell you a good one though! One time J.W. had somebody from New York come in there to do a--. They was going to give him a grant for SOCM. Well, course I was working on the health program, and he&#8217;s working on SOCM. And so I fed him and his wife supper. And I had everything out of the garden. And he said, &#8220;So where are you going to build that health clinic at?&#8221; And I took him over there and showed him the railroad track where we was going to build it. He give me ten thousand dollars to start it [laughter]. J.W. was mad at me! SOCM didn&#8217;t get that! [Laughter]. EM: You had more money than SOCM did, oh goodness. KB: But that man called me and write me letters. Back then, you know, there was stuff like that going on all over the country. Yeah, I got up there and made that talk at that school. I guess that&#8217;s the most scared I ever was. But I told my--. See I lived in Petros, and my mom and dad. Daddy lived and worked in Oak Ridge. In &#8217;48. &#8217;47 &#8217;48. And we moved over there, and I went to school. Well, I was valedictorian of my class in Petros! Well, when I got over there, they were so much further a head of me I liked to fail because, you know, they had advantages I&#8217;d never had! And that&#8217;s what I told them, you know, about that. I almost failed because there were things I&#8217;d never been involved in. And that was before those gates were open in &#8211; you don&#8217;t remember this &#8211; but the gates in Oak Ridge--. The gates opened in 1948. You had to have a badge to get in and out of Oak Ridge even if you lived there. And we wasn&#8217;t allowed to have a PTA because of the security. The people that worked there, you know; they were all kinds of scientists and everything. And we wasn&#8217;t allowed a PTA because they didn&#8217;t want spies to know the names of people that lived there. But now they had excellent schools. JWB: Did you ever hear about the City Behind the Fence? EM: No. JWB: There&#8217;s a book on that history of Oak Ridge: how they bought it and fenced it up. EM: Well, I&#8217;ve heard that the streets are really confusing--. KB: They are. EM: --on purpose to make it hard to get around if you were from out of town. KB: Yeah. J.W. talks [50:12] all the time about how it&#8217;s laid out. But I&#8217;ve watched Oak Ridge grow from muddy boardwalks to a city when I lived there. But we had wonderful teachers at school there. I told all that in my speech at the thing. EM: So did you go to high school in Oak Ridge? KB: Two years. EM: Two years of high school. And you were driving from Petros back and forth. KB: No, my mom and dad moved over there. Daddy lived there and worked there. Oh, lord, we done everything in the world to raise money. There was a turkey supper we had. Now see we charged a dollar and a half. Course that&#8217;s a lot of money back then. And we had a puppet show one time, and nobody&#8217;d ever had a puppet show in Petros. We had a puppet show. We had all kinds of music programs, and we&#8217;d go to Vanderbilt and have bean dinners and everything. Them kids would cook, and then we&#8217;d take--. And when I was in San Diego one time to meet my son when his ship come back, and my sister-in-law said, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s Vanderbilt car right down here!&#8221; She said, &#8220;I stopped one day and talked to him,&#8221; and said, &#8220;he&#8217;s a doctor. A navy doctor.&#8221; So me and her stopped one day and talked to him, and he said, &#8220;Lord, I&#8217;ve bought many a can of beans and jelly and stuff from ya&#8217;ll.&#8221; And of course, I didn&#8217;t know who he was, but he said he used to buy jelly. Course I&#8217;d take jelly and green beans and pickles. And them kids loved it. But you know it&#8217;s been really--. It&#8217;s really been a blessing to know how they all turned out. We&#8217;ve got one girl that stayed two summers with us. She was an organizer. And she&#8217;s been in Washington D.C.; she married a lawyer. And she&#8217;s taught deaf children for about thirty years. JWB: She&#8217;s at Falls Church. KB: Yeah, Fall Creek Church. JWB: She&#8217;s over the physically blind and hearing whatever it is in that area. KB: And there was a doctor down there. An old man that was always with the students and helped them and always supported us. And he was real old, and we got a letter one day that he said he wanted to see me and J.W. And we went down there to see him! And tickled the old man to death. He died not long after that. But I was glad we went. He wanted to see us. He liked us, and he wanted to see us [laughter]. But they sure was good to us, now. They took care of us. We loved them. But it&#8217;s interesting: I get a letter, and the kids, they&#8217;ve got kids in Germany and England and everywhere, you know. Nearly all of them done well, that keeps up with us. JWB: We was just trying to make a poor community better with healthcare and protection of jobs and protection from strip mine hazards. And so she always wanted a library, and she raised enough money to buy land to build a library on. And then there&#8217;s those stuff that kind of worked in as well. KB: Well, you know, there&#8217;s always--. The superintendent of schools was a real good friend of ours. And when we got the new school, he gave us the old school to make a recreation center. Well, they burned it. EM: Who&#8217;s they? KB: [54:49] Addists. JWB: [Laughter] Some of the good citizens of Petros. EM: And they burned it because they were so angry that--? KB: Well, no, they was ignorant. They was wanting the copper out of &#8211; the boys that burned it &#8211; and they just--. You just couldn&#8217;t help them people. And they finally burned the clinic. And JW and we got--. JWB: It took them four times before they got the clinic burned down [chuckle]. KB: And they burned two houses for us. And, of course, a lot of it was hatred for over strip mining and different things. And that old woman I told you that hated him &#8211; course I despise her today. She&#8217;s still living. She would come and but in on me and want to force me to work with her. And I didn&#8217;t want to work with her because she was a crook! And she wasn&#8217;t no accountant, and I just didn&#8217;t want to fool with her. And I just told her what I thought about her. And we&#8217;d fight all the time. JWB: Some of this stuff you&#8217;ll have to put on [55:42] paper. KB: Ain&#8217;t that the truth? [Laughter]. EM: I&#8217;m trying to understand when they burned the health clinic &#8211; they burned it, you said, because of copper? KB: No, that was the school. EM: They burned the school to get copper. JWB: They burned the school because I was the one in charge of redoing the school, and they did it for spiting me. But they of course got the copper out of it. EM: Why would the people in the community want to be against building a new school? JWB: It wasn&#8217;t that people; it was a person that burnt the school. He went up there and gasolined it and burned it just for spite because I&#8217;d arrested a bunch of them and took them to jail. EM: Wow. KB: Well, honey, they done everything to us. He&#8217;d be out somewhere on a strip mining trip or be in Washington or somewhere, and I could see them going around our house with cigarettes. You know, they&#8217;d have their cigarette. Trying to scare me. And one night, J.W. took an old boy to jail, and his brother come, and we had a glass door, and he said--. And it was after midnight, and it was snowing, and he didn&#8217;t have no socks, no shoes, shirt on. And didn&#8217;t have no socks on. And he said--. Started shaking my door, and I said, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get even with J.W. for taking my brother to jail.&#8221; And he acted like he was going to break that door, and I had three kids laying in there. And when he put his hand up there on that glass, I had a pistol, and I said, &#8220;When you break that glass, I&#8217;m going to shoot you.&#8221; And he backed up. And the sheriff come, and he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8212;&#8220;. I called and told the sheriff; I said, &#8220;Now, I&#8217;m not letting him in here on my kids. He&#8217;s drugged and full of drugs.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t let him in your home.&#8221; I said, &#8216;&#8221;Don&#8217;t worry; you can come get him.&#8221; And that worried me now because I see how easy I could have gotten in serious trouble. But, I&#8217;d have shot him! I surely will. But we had a lot of problems. EM: And then what happened with the health clinic? Who burned the health clinic? KB: Well, it was just different ones there. We had already closed it. We had trouble with a doctor there. He come from Notre Dame and claimed God sent him. Well, we thought he was just on the level, and he was just great [J.W. laughter]. JWB: He was a Holy Cross Brother. He belonged to them&#8212;Now are you Catholic? EM: No. JWB: [Laughter]. Anyway, he was the first of that order that ever become a doctor. And he was queer, apparently. We didn&#8217;t know it of course. And so, we had a woman in the community. She had three pap smears come back positive, and she got scared because her mother died of cancer. And she went to the surgeon in Oak Ridge, and he done a complete hysterectomy on her. And so when she come back, she was telling the people in the community that they was going to let her die. That she had three tests that come back that was positive. And I know&#8217;d that that kind of talk would hurt the clinic. KB: J.W., that ended--. JWB: I called one of the doctors in Oak Ridge, Dr. David Stanley, who was a good friend of ours. And he got Dr. Darley, one of the cloth women doctors in Oak Ridge, and they come over there. And they explained to the women &#8211; we had a meeting &#8211; and they explained to the women that they wasn&#8217;t any danger of what went on at the--. Actually, how many unnecessary hysterectomies we&#8217;ve done a year, and they said the clinic was in the clear of any liability. So he got upset that we was trying to practice medicine and tell him what to do. And he started giving us trouble when we had to get the health service board people to tell him that he was going to be discharged and get rid of it. And then there was a doctor and his wife come there that wanted to work in the clinic, and he told them that he discouraged it. They contacted him, and he said if they tried to come into the area where he was at, he would fight them. So, course that scared them off, and we couldn&#8217;t get anybody to operate the clinic for us. KB: Oh, honey, we had one time; he wrote a letter. And he demanded the deed to the clinic, which was local. We was just a little, community health council. And then he wanted to know how much money; he wanted to know exactly how much money we had. Well, that was money that I&#8217;d raised with cupcakes and quilt raffles! And it didn&#8217;t have anything to do with--. They got their money from Washington; we had nothing to do with that. But we raised a little funds for our, you know, for the council. And I wouldn&#8217;t give it to him. And he decided he&#8217;d just fire all the girls and all that. And he was going to bring people in. And I said, &#8220;No, you won&#8217;t do it.&#8221; Me and him ad the awfullest fight in front of the TV cameras. And they put it on TV for three or four nights. Me and him into it. And you talk about Catholics from everywhere. Buddy, they defended me. And they said--. Marie, she said; she went to his house, and she said, &#8220;Now listen. I know that you outrank me in being over me.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you one thing: I&#8217;m standing with the Bradleys.&#8221; And there&#8217;s another boy; he&#8217;s way up in the Catholic Church. He&#8217;s a lawyer. He went to the station, and he said, &#8220;Let me tell you.&#8221; They had made a video one time of patients without doctors and had me on it. And he said, &#8220;Let me tell you something. You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re dealing with. And I mean, I don&#8217;t want to hear no more that coming on TV.&#8221; Well, I called Washington and told what they was doing. And so this guy that had been my &#8211; took care of me when I went up there. He said, &#8220;What can I do?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well.&#8221; He wanted our grant to set up a clinic about six miles down the road, so he&#8217;d have full control. And I said, &#8220;Well, he wants our money for out grant.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, let me put you on the panel here, so people can hear you.&#8221; And I just told him the whole story, and he said. J.W. had been somewhere with him, and he was a good doctor. And we was proud of him, you know. J.W. introduced him to somebody and said, &#8220;This is our new doctor.&#8221; Well, he got real offended, and he said, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t nobody&#8217;s boy.&#8221; And he got to being so, you know. But we put him on the road, and he--. So then he went behind my back. All the health council was at work but me. And I went over there, and I went in, and he had the news people sitting up there and he was telling them--. Going to force us to keep him! And I looked him right in the eye in front of that whole--. And of course this old woman that had always hated J.W., and in she come. And she started talking about JW; she said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t work with the program on account of J.W.!&#8221; Never had helped her done anything. And I flew at her. And it looked like I was fixing to hit her is what it looked like. Well, they kept putting that on night after night. Buddy, they sent a man from Washington down here to his door and told this doctor. Said, &#8220;If there&#8217;s one more thing down at Ms. Bradley&#8217;s,&#8221; said, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to get you for inciting a riot in a small community.&#8221; And they saw the guy, the Catholic guy, and he went over there at the studio and he told them, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been working with these people, and you&#8217;re tearing down our work.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Lay off. And I don&#8217;t want to hear nothing else.&#8221; And buddy, they pulled that stuff off there. Lord, I was madder than a hornet. I was ugly. I was real ugly that day [laughter]. But that old woman, she just done everything in the world to upset me, you know. She come in where I&#8217;d be having a sale, or cooking or something. And she&#8217;d come in and jump on me in front of a big crowd. So I finally told her to lay off me. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to work with you, and I&#8217;m not going to work with you.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;You do what you want to, and I&#8217;ll do what I want to.&#8221; JWB: We one time decided to work with her boy and his wife, and we&#8217;d go places and they&#8217;d give us meat stuff. And they&#8217;d give us a bunch of meat over there. And that boy said he&#8217;d put it in his freezer. And when it come time for us to use it, well, it had all spoiled. And that was the kind of people they were. KB: Mhm. JWB: And when she was asking for that money, there was, some of the county officials was, trying to actually get money from the clinic that wasn&#8217;t &#8211; the county wasn&#8217;t entitled to it. And they was trying to make the clinic pay it back, and I got a news reporter to come over here. And they showed what the county was doing, and they got a lot of calls from different counties. They said, &#8220;If ya&#8217;ll don&#8217;t want them doctors, we&#8217;ll take them.&#8221; And so then that&#8217;s when they gave Kate the $50,000 and started backing off of the clinic. KB: And he that day after we had that fight on TV, why, he started grabbing his stuff, and he said, &#8220;Lord, this is the worst day of my life!&#8221; And I said; he started getting his stuff off the walls, and I said, &#8220;You better get them all!&#8221; I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re friends out there will probably burn you out tonight!&#8221; Well, they then went out there and said I&#8217;d threatened to burn him out! So they told everything in the world on us. It was interesting, but it was--. There wasn&#8217;t a dull moment in this family. EM: Ya&#8217;ll definitely sound busy! KB: [Laughter] We was! EM: Could you talk a little bit about how you got involved in the prison? KB: Oh, the prison? Well, they let a homecoming &#8217;86? You remember that? They let me have a bunch of trustees to come down there and clean up the community. And we painted the community center, and the clinic was still up running then. Or, it wasn&#8217;t running, but it was still there. And we cleaned up and painted everything, and they worked every day. Well, I spoiled them old boys. I&#8217;d cooked for them, made biscuits, and they&#8217;d help--. There&#8217;d be hot biscuits, and they&#8217;d get down there every morning. So one of the deputy wardens, he told me; he said, &#8220;Now, Kate,&#8221; he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s pouring the rain on morning, and they had their raincoats on wanting to come down there!&#8221; [Laughter] He said, &#8220;I told them that they can&#8217;t work in that rain!&#8221; But, there was one little boy that we just sort of adopted him. We just loved him. We helped get him out of prison. He&#8217;d been in there all of his life, nearly. But then later, after that, they called me and wanted me to, &#8220;would I take a job as a volunteer coordinator at the regional?&#8221; And I did! I worked two years. And we did all kinds of stuff. We had a Lifer&#8217;s club organized, and we had an education program set up for the boys that wanted to get college degrees. And we had birthday parties every month, and I&#8217;d get churches to sponsor it. And I had 250 volunteers that I was over. That was just church people, and people that wanted to help us, you know. And I really enjoyed it. It was really good. And when I left out there, these men come to the wall and cried when I left. Just old boys. But they were &#8211; some of them were so pitiful. They&#8217;d come to my office. And one little old boy kept coming, looking in, coming, looking in, and I said, &#8220;Son, can I help you?&#8221; Course I&#8217;d give him a stamp or even write letters for him and everything. He said, &#8220;I just like to come up here and look in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you just remind me of mama.&#8221; [laugher]. But it was interesting. And then my mother, she fell and broke her hip. And I took her and my daddy on [70:45], and then I run the nursing home till they died [laughter]! EM: You ran the nursing home they were in? KB: No, they was here at my house [laughter]! EM: Oh, this was the nursing home! KB: Yeah. My daddy died in my arms. My momma--. JWB: She had a aunt that needed a nursing home, so we adopted her. We three patients here at home. We took care of. KB: I took care of all three of them till they died. My mom was 97. She liked two weeks being 97. So I was just hindered for ten years there. That&#8217;s what I did. But I had home health that would come and help me with them, help with bathing them and stuff, you know. And that&#8217;s a good program because it helps a lot of people. And it&#8217;s good for people because if they--. They&#8217;s just like me, I couldn&#8217;t have kept them if I&#8217;d had to bathe them and wash their hear and all that. I couldn&#8217;t of done all of that. But that home health was good. JWB: We worked on laws. We got help get the nurse practitioners the privileges that they got. We worked through the state to get the laws changed for the nurse practitioners could do more than what they were allowed to start with. So they passed the law one time in Tennessee that any health clinic had to furnish birth control devices for anybody that asked for it without notifying her parents. KB: No matter how young it was. And we couldn&#8217;t--. JWB: I told them--. KB: Why they would have hung us. JWB: I said--. KB: You know about Petros. JWB: &#8220;We won&#8217;t do that.&#8221; KB: We couldn&#8217;t do that! JWB: So we just passed a resolution that they&#8217;d be no children, no minors, given birth control devices at that clinic without the written and personal consent of their legal guardian. KB: And I can imagine--. JWB: They said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that. That&#8217;s a state law.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going do it anyway.&#8221; KB: There&#8217;s a man come &#8211; one of the state workers from the health department come to me at my house. He said, &#8220;Now, Ms. Bradley, you&#8217;ll have to. You&#8217;ve got to do that to be able to get funding.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll just have to keep it cause they&#8217;ll hang us here.&#8221; And I could see all them little old kids going in there, and their momma coming to hang me! I said, &#8220;Now, they&#8217;d hang us if it--. You know. You just don&#8217;t mess with people&#8217;s children!&#8221; But now I think they finally quit that. I think it was--. JWB: We tried to get good laws passed, and we tried to obey the good laws. But if it was again our moral belief, why then, we didn&#8217;t encourage it. KB: When we lived out in Petros, we had a big a old house with big rooms, -- thunder? -- and so I&#8217;d keep--. We had kind of a hallways went through, so I had a girls&#8217; room and a boys&#8217; room. And they&#8217;d have wall-to-wall sleeping bags, and kids would [laughter] [74:28]. So I&#8217;d say, &#8220;That&#8217;s for the boys; this is for the girls!&#8221; Well, I met one of the doctors. He was a pediatrician, and he brought his wife to show me at a wedding. And he said, &#8220;Come over here, I want you to meet this woman.&#8221; He said, &#8220;She taught me right from wrong.&#8221; [Laughter]. He said, &#8220;She had a house that had girls&#8217; room and boys&#8217; room, and she enforced it!&#8221; You know what we never had one incident of any kind of scandal. They were just--. We never had a problem with nothing, with none of them! But I was careful where they stayed because I wanted them to be in decent homes, you know. Yeah, I&#8217;ve met a lot of them later. And down there at the reunion, why, they&#8217;s two of them. Two doctors came over and took my hand, and they said, &#8220;You never realized how much you meant to us.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;We all come from pretty wealthy homes, but we didn&#8217;t have love like you give us.&#8221; And, you know, they said, &#8220;You just changed our life.&#8221; And that made me want to cry, you know. I didn&#8217;t, at the time, know that I--. I didn&#8217;t really know that they was noticing all that, but they did. It was a great bunch. EM: So what was the Fifty Most Courageous Women thing that you were telling me about earlier? KB: The what? EM: The Fifty Most Courageous Women in America thing that you were telling me about earlier? KB: Well, it was when I worked at the prison. And Marie, of course, she&#8217;s always invited to everything because she&#8217;s a woman leader. And so they just sent me a letter and wanted to know if I&#8217;d go. And it&#8217;d be paid for. And I would be one of the Courageous Women in America. Me and Marie. So we went. And there was the biggest crowd their, but--. It was just because I worked at the prison. I used to escort people back into they prison, and they&#8217;d be shaking. They&#8217;s scared. They said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Why no, I ain&#8217;t afraid!&#8221; I never was afraid of but one old man. That never did bother me about none of them prisoners, but this old man talked strange sometimes. And he worked in my office, and I just sort of leery of him. I didn&#8217;t know to--. He told me one day he was supposed to protect me and watch out for me, and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m old enough to take care of myself. I don&#8217;t think I need nobody.&#8221; I was afraid of that old man. Well, now, I don&#8217;t know how many boys--. They had the varsity club. That was the education club. And there&#8217;s teachers, and there was people out of New York and Washington and everywhere. They would buy so much, you know, for a boy to go have classes. And Brian College &#8211; you know where Brian College is? &#8211; they come up and done a lot of teaching. And we got--. We had a good thing going with them. And we sold coffee and hot chocolate every weekend to visitors. And the men wasn&#8217;t allowed to touch the money. But they could do the work. They&#8217;d do the coffee and all that. But I learned a lot of things in that prison. I&#8217;ll tell you right now. One boy &#8211; he was from Chattanooga &#8211; he--. I missed him! He done coffee with me one Saturday. And I lost him; I missed him! And I kept asking, and nobody would tell me nothing. And they&#8217;d put him in the hole because he&#8217;d took the coffee pots back. And he&#8217;d stuck a bunch of drugs down in the coffee pots [laughter]. And I didn&#8217;t know it! [Laughter]. And he got--. But I found him on Christmas. I asked the warden if he would let me take a treat to them men in the whole. What they call the hole, is a cell, and it&#8217;s got a little place just big enough to their plate through. That&#8217;s all its--. And I said, &#8220;Would you let me?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Yeah, you can.&#8221; And I was the only woman that&#8217;d ever been back there besides the employees. And we fixed him up with like a treat bag, and put ham sandwiches. And we made candy and cookies and drinks and everything for him. And he let me, and I found that boy. He was in the hole back there. But they said, &#8220;Now, Ms. Bradley&#8212;&#8220; JWB: They call it confinement &#8211; solitary confinement. EM: Solitary confinement. KB: But sometimes they--. JWB: That was a punishment. The maximum they could give them. I&#8217;m sure this girl is interested in more than--. KB: She asked me about the prison! EM: I did, yeah! No, it&#8217;s very interesting. I think all the stories are interesting. I like to hear them all. JWB: [Laughter]. You think it&#8217;s interesting, you ought to have been here when we was making it! EM: [Laughter] I bet! It sounds like a really interesting time. KB: Uh huh. It was. It was a--. EM: What direction do you see it going now? SOCM, or? KB: You mean down or now? EM: Going now? How&#8217;s it changed? KB: Well, I don&#8217;t know. See, we&#8217;re not very active now because we&#8217;re both getting old. And we&#8217;re both cripple; we&#8217;ve got arthritis both of us. We don&#8217;t get out. We don&#8217;t go to much. We get the newsletter and that&#8217;s about it. We don&#8217;t participate much. Always give them a little bit of money for their walk and stuff like that. It&#8217;s more or less younger people in charge. And they spread out more over the state. We both are just about done our do &#8211; getting old! [Laughter]. But we&#8217;re--. We&#8217;ve had a lot of--. [JWB exits] When I worked out there at the prison, there was different groups and different churches I worked with. And they got petitions together behind my back to have me to get that award that come out of Knoxville. I think it&#8217;s from Jefferson [81:41] or something. Anyway, they had--. And the chaplain got jealous of me. And he was [81:49] working because the prisoners would come to me, and they wouldn&#8217;t go to him. And he got jealous. And so they had pictures they made of us doing our coffee and clubs and all that. And I didn&#8217;t know a thing about it. Well, he got--. When it come down--. Well, this woman come to me, and she said, &#8220;Well,&#8221; said, &#8220;the chaplain&#8217;s supposed to turn all that in.&#8221; And he didn&#8217;t turn it in because he didn&#8217;t want me to get it. To this day he don&#8217;t know I even know he did that. I done his job for two months while he went on a trip to France. And we had baptizings and everything while he was gone. He was a little bit--. He wanted this one denomination, and they had, you know--. They&#8217;s different! So while he&#8217;s gone, we had baptizings. So he didn&#8217;t like that much. But I thought that&#8217;s what I was supposed to do! But I got, Lord, they made me &#8211; them prisoners made me everything in the world. And sent me things. I&#8217;ve had letters from them since I left. And even their mothers sent me letters and called me. And it was really--. I really enjoyed that. But another volunteer thing that I did, that I really am proud of. I worked five or six years as the president of the Unicorn Fund. EM: What&#8217;s that? KB: Well, it&#8217;s a charity to raise--. It&#8217;s a charity we do for children. We&#8217;ve sent several kids to college through scholarships. And this woman, friend of mine, she was a--. Her daughter was twenty-one years old. And she got killed going to work one morning. And they named this &#8211; this was twenty something years ago &#8211; and they named this &#8211; she loved unicorns &#8211; and they named this program after her. And I worked; I was president for five or six years. And we did all kinds of charities and raised money. And sent scholarships. And we still do. And we&#8217;ve got a used clothing store. And there&#8217;s people in Brentwood in Nashville now that gives us all kinds of--. And they raise every dime that comes in goes to the scholarships to kids. The kids have to be of good character and poor, low-income. But have good grades. To be able to get it. And we&#8217;ve sent a lot of kids to school. And there&#8217;s never been a nickel paid out to the volunteer workers do it all volunteer. And we&#8217;ve had dances and balls and bake sales and everything. So we&#8217;ve--. I enjoyed &#8211; now that&#8217;s my favorite because I know where that money goes. EM: Yeah, you can see the exact result. KB: Mhmm. And we get to go pick the kids, you know. Course I don&#8217;t go now, but I did then. EM: When did you do that? When were those five or six years? KB: Did I what? EM: What years did you do that? KB: Well, part of it was when I worked at the prison. Let&#8217;s see, I worked at the prison &#8217;89. It was about, I guess, &#8217;85. But now we&#8217;ve done a lot of good--. Got a lot of--. Now it&#8217;s a well known organization. So we--. I know everybody on there, and I know every dime that&#8217;s done. So, I kind of got tired of giving and finding out it wasn&#8217;t on the level, so. EM: Yeah, it&#8217;s good to know where it&#8217;s going. KB: Yeah, I like to know where my money goes. I just had a life of volunteer. That&#8217;s been my life I reckon. EM: Sounds like it, yeah. How did all this business affect ya&#8217;ll&#8217;s marriage? Was it hard ot keep of these projects going? KB: Well, you know, we just kept working, but it really affected him. He was testifying one night and him Maureen, this girl, and two more people were in the court house testifying about Frozen Head Park. Keeping stripping out. And strip miners beat him up. And he got hurt at work and for a long time [JWB footsteps on stairs]. He&#8217;s a lot better now though. But a long time he was in bad shape. [JWB enters]. And the kids! But that&#8217;s one thing: our kids. They&#8217;re not volunteers and they&#8217;re not a giver. They said they&#8217;d had enough. EM: [Laughter] They&#8217;d had enough of that? KB: [Laughter] They won&#8217;t even talk about it. They said, &#8220;Now we don&#8217;t want to hear none of that!&#8221; They don&#8217;t either. Chip, he&#8217;s got an organization &#8211; they&#8217;ve got an organization &#8211; where he works, and they all donate money. And he just sits--. &#8220;I give for that and that&#8217;s all!&#8221; [Laughter]. But the girls, now they&#8217;re all--. They don&#8217;t like--. Well, really we&#8217;ve cheated them. We cheated the kids. Because we--. JWB: But we thought we was doing for them. We was trying to for them. But evidently it didn&#8217;t work out that way. KB: They don&#8217;t want to have nothing to do with none of this stuff. [Laughter] none of these projects! Man, we get involved with something once in a while, and they don&#8217;t want to have nothing to do with it! EM: Maybe they&#8217;ll come back to it later in life. They just need some time to do their own thing. KB: Now Connie, our oldest daughter. Connie works with the Department of Human Services; she&#8217;s a supervisor over for the county. She&#8217;s got a real good job. Buddy, she&#8217;s very dedicated. And they&#8217;ve told me about it; different ones has told me about it. She&#8217;s strong willed, buddy. She goes in and fights with them little, old kids. She don&#8217;t care a bit more to go in the house and take a kid out of there if he&#8217;s being abused. She&#8217;s pretty tough. EM: She learned that from her mother. KB: [Laughter]. JWB: I always told people that my daddy didn&#8217;t raise to smart of guys, but the ones he did raise wasn&#8217;t afraid of nothing that wiggled or walked. And that&#8217;s the way we raised out kids. We wouldn&#8217;t let people let them ghost stories and stuff and scare them and try to control them. KB: Well, we got that rain we didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d get! EM: I know, I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s cooling things down! It was so hot yesterday. KB: Oh, it&#8217;s awful. EM: So hot. KB: Me and Connie went to Sam&#8217;s and we had a--. Oh, it was hot. EM: Well, do ya&#8217;ll have anything else you want to add that I didn&#8217;t think to ask about? Is there anything else that you can think that I should have asked about? JWB: You want to start all over! EM: [Laughter]. No, I just want to make sure that there&#8217;s not anything that ya&#8217;ll want to say that you didn&#8217;t get a chance to say. KB: Now, that was the first SOCM Sentinel. JWB: You are--. My people were some of the first people in Tennessee. Bean Station up there is--. My people come in there and started that. And her daddy, his daddy, was in the home guard. And he was a lieutenant in the militia, state militia. And he got a bunch of people released there&#8217;s some convicts that captured some people. Did you ever read anything about the Coal Creek War? EM: No.. JWB: Kid, what&#8217;d--? EM: I don&#8217;t think so.. JWB: They&#8217;s a--. Back when the prison was first starting, they had a rule in the state of Tennessee that anybody that wanted to get cheap labor; they could go to the prison and get a convict. And they actually hire out slaves is what they was doing. And a lot of the mining companies hired these guys because they didn&#8217;t have to pay them any amount of money. And they come over there at Briceville, and them people they decided to run them off. And they turned the prisoners loose, and her daddy was working with a bunch over here at Oliver Springs, and they captured some guards. And he was able to get their release from prison. KB: My grandfather. You said my daddy. JWB: And the Governor Buchannan thought so much of him, of what he had done, that he give him two tickets to the Chicago World Fair. And the men that the other soldiers over there; they had a fort at Lake City. And they made him a medal for bravery for getting them guards released. So we&#8217;ve been in this part of the country for a long time. EM: A long time. Wow. KB: My daddy&#8217;s family is McCoys. And believe me there&#8217;s the fighting McCoys. EM: Well--. JWB: We are both from coal mining families. And we had the coal companies would hire doctors for the community. And they delivered young&#8217;uns and treated everything. And so we wound up with the same delivery doctor. EM: That&#8217;s amazing! JWB: We was delivered in her parent&#8217;s home. EM: That&#8217;s amazing. JWB: My momma had five kids and all them are delivered at home except one. The last boy, he was delivered at Erlanger Hospital. KB: This is our family here. That&#8217;s the kids when they graduated. That&#8217;s mine and J.W.&#8217;s graduation pictures. And that&#8217;s Faith; she&#8217;s the youngest. And she and Connie. And this is Connie&#8217;s two boys. And we&#8217;ve been sort of proud of them. They&#8217;re good kids. EM: Beautiful. Well, I&#8217;m going to switch this off...
