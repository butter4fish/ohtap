 Merze Tate: The day is August 29, 1977. We are in the home of Mrs. Orris Robinson, a long time friend of Dr. Flemmie P. Kittrell, dating back to their work together in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Dr. Kittrellâsometimes I will be saying Flemmieâwould you like to start with the background of your parents or grandparents? Flemmie P. Kittrell: I would like to start with my grandparents on my father's side. My father's grandparent, of course, was a slave. He lived on a plantation that was owned by the Kittrells and so he took that name because that was the custom in those days. Then my father's father's name was Essek Kittrell. He married Rosa Parham, who, incidentally, lived to be 115 years old. And Rosa Parham was the mother of my own father, James Lee Kittrell. Rosa Parham Kittrell, James Lee Kittrell. My grandmother, Rosa Parham Kittrell, had six children and the oldest one was Millie, then James, my father, Susan, Essek, Lucie, and Rosa. The youngest daughter was named after her mother. I was very close to my grandmother and many times when she was around, I felt that I had a really true friend, and didn't always listen to my mother because I thought my grandmother would take my side, which she did. But on the other hand, my grandmother and my mother got along very well together. Also my father. So I have real fond memories of my grandmother on my father's side. Now on my mother's side, I did not know her grandmother. Her grandmother was born a slave, that is, my mother's grandmother was born a slave, and strangely enough her name was Kizzy. Isn't that interesting? Not that it had any connection with Roots that we know about, but I'm looking that up because I think that's very interesting, how Kizzy really got started. Apparently it's an African name, and it may have some real interest there. So I discovered that this was very important. Now my mother had nine children and I was the eighth of the nine. She had four girls and five boys. Then as the youngest, almost the youngest member and the youngest girl in the family, I had the benefit of many of the privileges that my older brothers and sisters had had, without having to work for them, so to speak. As a rule, they thought that I was not too alert when it came to working on the farm on which we lived, but when it came to going to school, I was always quite willing to get there on time. That followed me allï»¿2 FPK: (cont) the way through the elementary school. And then when I went to the high school, the Hampton Institute Academy, I had to change my way of looking at it, of not participating in all the work. I had to work at Hampton Institute in order to get tuition to go to school. So I learned after all that work was important and one had to do one's fair share. So that about brings up my family from my father's point of view, and my mother's. MT: Then you feel that being the eighth child, that in a way you were favored at home. FPK: I was a favorite at home, yes, I think so. And in fact I was smaller than the others. My parents were rather healthy people. I was healthy, but I was rather small for my age, so I think perhaps I took advantage of that and didn't do my fair share of the housework. But as I look back over the whole situation, we had a good harmonious family and we protected each other. The one thing I seem to remember most about my own life and my youngest brother Fred, we protected each other in such a way that when my mother would say, "Well, who broke this cup," we didn't know who broke the cup. We didn't say we didn't know, we just didn't answer. And she got to feeling that this was good. She didn't like to have us reporting each other. And in fact my mother was a very tolerant person and remembered that children were learning apparently all the time, and that many of the things that they were learning would be good, and she didn't interfere too much with it. I thought that was very important. MT: That's interesting that you can go back to your grandfather, your grandparents, and through your brothers and sisters, and sort of understand your favored position in the family. You mentioned when you went to Hampton Institute, now that was for what would be high school? FPK: That was high school. I had finished the elementary school and the grammar school in Henderson, and then I went to Hampton Institute, to the Academy, primarily because we didn't have a high school in Henderson. It wasn't a missionary type of school, but it was founded in 1868 for the freed slaves, and interestingly enough, ten years later the Indians came to Hampton Institute, and the first buildings on the campus for Indians were called the wigwams and Winona Hall. And during the bicentennial this past year, those two buildings were cited as the most outstanding buildings in the country, because they were the only two that had been built for Indians. They are still there now, and they have been renovated and they are looking very attractive. MT: And you know the founder of Hampton Institute was Samuel Chapman Armstrong, and he was the son of missionaries in Hawaii. And it's very interesting, I don't want to go into it, but they were, in a sense, the first technical agents to go out from the United States, to carry handicrafts and agriculture and work with the hand as well as. the mind with other people. FPK: Dr. Tate, that's very remarkable that you remember all that, because that was General Armstrong's outstanding contribution. And when heï»¿3 FPK: (cont) came to Hampton Institute he brought some of those ideas, but at the same time he wanted to have a good academy, and that is why I went to Hampton, because it was a very good academy. At the same time, there were many young people who couldn't afford to go to school. They didn't have money. For example, I had to work in order to make ends meet. They called it a "work-year," where you worked a year and earned money, and that money was put aside for your tuition. You also were able to get additional jobs later on if you needed them, but the "work-year" was a solid background investment for money, and students who went through the "work-year," I think, profited a great deal. They don't have that any more, but that was necessary then. Talking about General Armstrong, there was a man by the name of Thomas C. Walkerâhe was the first lawyer in Virginia. He wanted to be a lawyer when he was quite a youngster, but he didn't have an education, and he knew he couldn't do much about it. So when he was sixteen years old, he, along with three other young men from that area, went to Hampton and applied for admission, and when he took the tests, he couldn't pass. General Armstrong told him that because of thatâthis was long before my day, of courseâthey wouldn't be able to remain at Hampton. Mr. Walker said, "Well, General Armstrong, I came here to get an education, and I ain't leaving until I get one." And General Armstrong said, "Well, I don't know how we can manage that," and he said, "Well, let's think about it again tomorrow." And so the next day when they got together to see what would be the outcome, he said, "I have thought that this place needs a lot of work, to keep it clean and to have it going, and it isn't as it ought to be. I could help you clean this place up and these other boys can help. Why can't we work in the day and go to school at night?" And General Armstrong thought about that, according to Mr. Walker's story, and he said, "Well, that sounds all right. I believe I'll have to test this out with the teachers." They didn't have but six teachers then. And so he did and so he came back and said, "Boys, I think you won the argument, and that is the first time a general has had to go over to a soldier." But at any rate, Mr. Walker wrote that up beautifully in the book that is a part of his life called The Honey-pod Tree.* This is the man that I'm talking about. MX: Well, you know Booker T. Washington's entrance exam was cleaning a room, a bedroom I believe, yes. And you know how he passed the exam. Now in speaking of Armstrong and the type of education that he introduced at Hampton, which came from ideas of the missionary band of 1820 and thereafter in Hawaii, out from Hampton Institute went Booker T. Washington to train the hand, the head and the heart. And when Mahatma Gandhi wanted to establish basic education in India, he studied what Booker T. Washington had done at Tuskegee Institute, and introduced basic education in India, which means it goes back to the missionaries in Hawaii. I wrote an article on that. The Sandwich Island missionaries, the first Point Four agents, won a prize when it was published in the Hawaiian Historical Review as the finest article of that year, and it is now sold over the counter in Mission House. * Thomas Calhoun Walker, The Honey-pod Tree (New York: J. Day Co., 1958)ï»¿4 FPK: May I please get a copy of that? MT: I may have an extra copy, and it's, of course, footnoted in my United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom,* and published in full in my Diplomacy in the Pacific.** But the idea of this basic education-training the head, the hand and the heartâwent to India from the missionaries in Hawaii, through Armstrong. FPK: This is very lovely, I'm glad to hear that. This is very enlightening. Also, if I may reflect for a moment, I am beginning to believe we are now at a stage in education in America where much of this is now being tried out again. MT: It should be. FPK: But it is being tried out again, but the thing that I am concerned about, however, is that they ought to have good intellectual education going along with it. I think that there may be some loopholes in there, where children are not learning as well as they used to because there are so many modern inventions, so much technology. They're doing things with their head, heart and hands, but they're not doing them very well intellectually. This is what Hampton was very fussy about and I think they did a good job. MT: Now after the academy, which was basic for what would be secondary education, and really prepared you for college, better than some places would have, and then where did you go? FPK: It prepared me very well for college; I went from Hampton Institute to college. I majored in home economics. This was interesting as how I got into that particular field. I had thought I wanted to be in the area of economics, or political science, or some field like that, and then one of my teachers, Mrs. Blanche Rollonson, called me in one day just as I was about to graduate from high school at the Hampton Academy, and wanted to know what had I decided to do for the future. I had told her what I told you. And then she said, "But have you thought of home economics?" I said, "I don't think I'd like that," and she said, "Why not?" And I said, "Well, I just don't think I'd like it." I didn't have a good reason, except I thought the home was just so ordinary, you know all about it anyway. But she said, "Well, you read this book and come back and let me know what you think'about it." It was a book on the life of Ellen H. Richards. She was one of the outstanding women who went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], and strangely enough, she had the same experiences and hardships that some of us -romen seem to have today, in having equality along with men. She made a terrific contribution and now she is cited at MIT as one of the outstanding graduates. She herself graduated from MIT. So that's how I got into home economics at Hampton. I went from Hampton Institute to Cornell and there began to enlarge my research and seeing the broader aspects of it. Before going to Cornell, however, I was at Bennett, teaching. * Merze Tate, The United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965) ** Merze Tate, Diplomacy in the Pacific (Washington, D.C.: History Department, Howard University, 1973)ï»¿5 MT: FPK: You taught before going to Cornell? Now the work at Cornell was graduate? You took two degrees there? That was graduate work. I got two degrees--the master's and later the doctorate, Ph.D. MT: Well, that gives you absolutely the superior background in home economics. We'll see before this interview is over what paths it has led you around the world, and even next year back to India, for the... FPK: ...for the 25th anniversary celebration of their college of home science. And they have the colleges of home science in all of the states of India now. That grew out of the Fulbright experience I had, you may recall. Baroda University was one of the first universities to have the full-fledged collegiate program leading to the B.S. degree, all over India now we have... MT: Yes, you say it was one of the first, but who established that school of home economics? FPK: I rather think that we did. The vice-chancellor, Mrs. Hansa Mehta, an outstanding educator, was the person that I would give full credit to. Also Raj Kamara Amrit Keun, the minister of health, you may recall her name. These were the two women who had a profound influence on education and particularly in this area of the home. MX: Yes, but you went out to help establish it. FPK: I went out to help... MT: You're being too modest. I'm trying to interview you... FPK: I went out to, let's say, help them get it started. MT: That was 1950-1951. FPK- That's right; in fact, I've been back several times since then. I went back the second time to help with the completion of the new building. Then I went back the third timeâthese were invitations, of courseâthrough AID*, at which time we invited many women throughout the country, through the government of India, to come to Baroda to study extension methods in home economics. And in turn we went to Japan and to Hawaii, because Japan has some outstanding programs there, and so we thought of ourselves primarily as an extension service. I remember that year. I remember dates in your life because our paths have crossed at several times. Not only that, Dr. Tate, but you were among the first Fulbright professors in India and you were stationed at... Shantinaketan, in the World University, Rabindranath Tagore's World University, and you were at Baroda... MT: FPK: MT: * AID is the Agency for International Development.ï»¿6 FPK: Right, in other words, Tagore to me is a university, so we look to South India, and in fact probably had more intellectual people in the arts than any other part of India. You were in a very strategic place. MT: Our paths crossed accidentally two or three times... FPK: In Kashmir... Mt: Yes. And South India at Christmas Eve. I think they held you from getting on a plane because my plane was coming in and they wanted to surprise you and me. FPK: Those are pleasant memories, and I like to rehearse them, as you and I are doing. MT: Then I visited you at Baroda, where you lived in India like a princess. FPK: Well, you know Baroda University was fortunate in having money from the prince after they became independent. The maharajah gave a great deal of money to Baroda, and he wanted some of this money spent for home science, as they called it. So we were living in some of the places where some of the people of royalty had been living. Although my dormitory that I lived in, what I worked in rather, the residence was newly built, but the building, you could see, they had stature and beauty and all the things that would go with money. MT- I know I felt that you were living palatially, when you had screens in your window! And I had no windows! The insects came and stayed or left through openings. FPK: We had screens and we also had nets for sleeping. MT: I had a sleeping net, of course, but didn't you also have a refrigerator? FPK- Oh yes, a refrigerator, and some air conditioning. In fact we had imported some of the West to the East, but when I look at India and look at the way they provided, I don't know if our living was much better, even though we had much more conveniences. I found that the fans that they had in the ceilings of the rooms were eternally at work in keeping the rooms cool. MT: And they didn't have blackouts'. FPK- No blackouts, and also we didn't have to pay any heavy electrical bills. So in a way, I think maybe I might exchange some of those experiences and services. MT- I think we got ahead in our enthusiasm, about your work in India, and of course there's so much more in other places. Now then, we have you finishing with an M.A. and a Ph.D. from Cornell, but in the meantime you had taught at the college level, between those two degrees. FPK: You're thinking...oh yes, going back to that. My first teaching job was at Bennett. Not only was it my first job, it was the most satisfyingï»¿7 FPK: (cont) job I've ever had. I think I can say that. Most satisfying. I think primarily because of the leadership of Mrs. David D. Jones, the wife of the president, and the president himself. They knew what they wanted to do. They worked hard at it, and they had keen insights as to what the needs of the people were. Mrs. Jones was the admissions officer and also the registrar, and I was then called the dean of students, but I didn't start as the dean of students, I started off teaching. My teaching experiences first were in the high school, because I only had the B.S. degree and I had had no other teaching experience. And I'll never forget the students, and may I call her name at this time, particularly one, Maxine Laughlin. She was a very attractive girl in the high school, in the second year, and I could see that she was very capable of teasing the teacher. This was my first class, on my first day, and she was chewing gum very loudly, and looking at me for attention, and I gave it to her by saying, "Will you please not chew gum," and she said, "Why not?" And then I couldn't think of why not. And I said, "Well, you don't have enough to offer to other people." And she said, "Oh, I have plenty." So she picked out a package of chewing gum and passed it around to the whole class. The students were on my side; they felt apparently a little bit sad for me because I didn't know what to do. But you know what the students did? They took the gum from Maxine and went over to the waste-basket and put them all into the wastebasket. I thought that was the best thing that ever happened, so from that day forward, my very first day, I knew I was going to like Bennett College, because that experience gave me a little bit of a lift. I was teaching a class in art appreciation, how to select pictures, and how to interpret the meaning and so forth. It was a nice class, and so from that day on I got along all right, as soon as I knew they were responsive. MT: Now, when I came to Bennett, you were already there, and I think of you in two areas, as dean of women and in home economics, but I didn't know that that was your first teaching position. FPK: That was my first teaching position, and I was there for twelve years. MT: Well, Mrs. Jones spoke so highly of you and your work and philosophy of life. In fact she named four or five women who had, she thought, touched the students at Bennett. She mentioned that in an interview that I had with her last July. I think your name was first. FPK: Well, thank you. That's very kind. MT; So our paths crossed first actually at Bennett, except I had met you at a dean of women's conference, I believe, at Fisk, and rode back from Fisk with one of your colleagues. That was my first year in North Carolina. Then I came to Bennett. FPK: I remember. I think we were with Velma Hamilton, who was driving the car.ï»¿8 MT: Now, you were at Bennett. I was there five years. And then left for Morgan State and finally came to Howard. You were there a longer period. FPK: For twelve years. MT: Then you went from Bennett to Hampton Institute, and then you came to Howard. How many years did you teach at Hampton? FPK: Four years. My work at Hampton was primarily in the area of dean of women. And as you may recall, they were the years when the U.S.A. was at war, and so the campus was changed almost overnight into a training program for the men, because of Hampton Roads channel and its strategic position in the navy. Now that was a very unusual experience, and I had a very high regard for the armed forces because the men who were in charge of the program were outstanding, and the men who came there for training were outstanding. And these men made up the mechanics and the leadership positions in the army posts abroad. That was very unusual. Then the women who were there were also working to become members of the business areas, secretaries and so forth, but the regular program still went on for the regular students; this was in addition. So it was an unusual experience for me. MT: Yes, you had many. Then the next... FPK: The next was going to Howard. It was sad to leave Bennett; in fact, I wept. Then I was sad to leave Hampton. And then to go to Howard University, I didn't know too much about Howard, but Dean Thompson came down to Hampton to see me, and said that he had known me at Cornell because his wife had graduated from Cornell and we were in classes together. And he said to me, "Well, Flemmie Kittrell, I think you belong at Howard," just like that, and I said, "Oh, I don't think so, Howard's a very sophisticated university." He said, "I know, but you're sophisticated enough for it." Well, I didn't take it very seriously, but then later on he wrote me and said he thought I should really think about coming to Howard, and I could head up the work in home economics and so forth, and by that time I had gotten my degree from Cornell, my doctorate. So I thought about it, but I still had not felt that I should leave Hampton, and then all of a sudden as though I had made up my mind, I decided that I would accept it. So Dean Thompson asked me would I write it out, and I told him I wouldn't write it out at this time because I wasn't sure, but I thought I'd like to consider it again. He said, "Well, I would like to invite you up to Howard." So he invited me to Howard, and I met with President Johnson who was enthusiastic, of course, and had wanted me, otherwise Dean Thompson would not have pressed it. And so President Johnson said, "Well, now, Miss Kittrell," (you know how he used to talk) "we would like to have you come because we think home economics is a most important field." And his voice, you know, was always very commanding, and I said, "Mr. President, I have seen your building and your facilities, and it doesn't show that you think that way." And he laughed and he said, "Well, daughter, what would you suggest I do?" And I said, "Mr. President, I think you need a new building; you need a new plant." And I said, "Home economics,ï»¿9 FPK: (cont) I think of course, is a very important field dealing with the science of living and it draws on the natural sciences and the humanities and the arts, and therefore I think Howard is wonderful, but you really need better facilities." "Well," he said, "daughter, if you come, we will get that building," and I said, "That's very nice," and so forth. To end a long story, I didn't come that next year though, because I hadn't been at Hampton but three years and it wasn't good to leave the navy and army program. So I suggested that I would come the next year, and Dean Thompson said, "Well, that would be all right if you do that." And he said, "Now Miss Kittrell, when you come..." He used to call me Miss Kittrell, Flemmie, whatever. He said, "Now, when you come, remind the president that he said that if you'd come, you would get that building," and that's what I did. So the president remembered it and he was very gracious, and I was very pleased to work with a man like that. But the first year passed, of course, when the war was still going on; the second year passed, we were getting a new start; and you may recall the third year we had a new secretary of education who wanted to cut the budget. I didn't dare say a word to the president at that time. Then the fourth year Dean Nelson, William Stuart Nelson called all the heads of the departments to tell us that we had to cut our budget and...where is the building going to be, with cutting our budget and we only had four people. And so I said to Dean Nelson, "Mr. Nelson,I don't see anyone to cut. Why don't you let me take a leave?" "Oh no, we can't do that," and I said, "I think it would be very good if I would take a leave. It would give me a new perspective and I'm not sure what I would do, but at least I don't want the people who have been here to be denied continuance." He didn't accept my thinking, but I was still thinking about it and strangely enough, that very day that I made that decision, I had a long-distance call from Cornell University asking me would I be interested in a post in India and said that Mrs. Hansa Mehta was there. Her daughter was in the college of home economics at Cornell and wanted to talk with me, and so Mrs. Mehta got on the telephone and said she'd be down to Washington. She came down to Washington the next dayâthis is in the midst of the discussion with Dr. Nelsonâand asked if I would come to India to help them get their home economics program started. And at the time they were going to pay me from their funds, because the maharajah had left a lot of money to be turned over to their state university. But I got to thinking that Fulbright ought to have something, but I couldn't accept the idea that Fulbright would come through, so I just said to Mrs. Mehta, "Yes, I think I would like to do that, Mrs. Mehta." At the same time I knew that we had to reduce our staff. So what did we do? She signed me up and I signed the papers and so forth. I had not been there long enough to look for more counsel. I just went right ahead, I usually do that. So I inquired downtown if the Fulbright people would accept an application for home economists to go to India and they said, "Miss Kittrell, today we have just gotten word that that program would be approved for India, and you will be the first home economist to ever go to Asia under the Fulbright." So thisï»¿10 FPK: (cont) is how things worked out. Now it turned out beautifully and it worked out well. President Johnson liked the idea, Dean Nelson liked the idea, Mrs. Mehta liked the idea, so it was all tied in together. That was a very nice experience for me, and I always look back on that as one of the sensible things I did. And then we got the building, of course. MT: Well, yes... FPK: We got the building after I came back. But the interesting thing about the building, you may recall, President Johnson stayed on two years after he was going to retire. Then he said to me one day, sent me a note and asked me to come over and talk with him, because we still didn't have the building, two years before he left. And so he said, "Now well, Lady," he called me Lady, I'll never forget that, "you have been very patient with me and you know you haven't even called me to inquire on that building, but you have reminded me every year when you sent your budget in, but I haven't forgotten it." He said, "Now, I want to get your opinion on something. You know the Congress [U.S.A.] will only give one building a year, and now we have two buildings on the drawing board, the physical education building for men and the home economics building. The physical education building for men, three million dollars. The home economics building, two and a half million dollars. If you were the president of Howard University, which would you choose?" I said, "The home economics building." "Well, daughter, that is what I've chosen." I thought that was lovely and so this was the way the fellowship had been...and so I enjoyed working with President Johnson, knowing that he was doing all that he could to get that building. Then finally it came through, two days before he retired. He was there for the dedication, and he was invited and did attend the luncheon. MT: It's a beautiful building, and your hand, your mind and your eye and your arts interests I find everywhere in the building. I wish that the people who will listen to this interview could have a description of it. Will you briefly describe its features? I know some of them but you can do it much better. FPK: Well, all right. I hope I'm not boring you on this idea of the Howard University home economics building. Well, it was a joy working with the staff in that building and the students. I have learned not only to enjoy students, but to call on them for help and I did. The building reflects the philosophy of home economics. The art and the science of living is reflected in its structure; the living room has an atmosphere of warm hospitality which can be reflected for each season of the year. The food and nutrition laboratories are inviting for research and food preparations. The child development center is scientifically equipped to observe behavior of parents and children, et cetera. MT: We were discussing your trip tional standards at the time you like to expand on that? to Uganda, and you mentioned the educa-and the part that women played. Wouldï»¿11 FPK: Yes. I was particularly interested in their program, especially at the university. They had a very outstanding university, and many of the professors there were women, in the upper ranks. They also had a very strong program of the American Association of University Women, the international association, which was affiliated with the American Association of University Women around the world. They were outstanding scholars. At that time, there were a great many Indian women there, who were in leadership positions. But you know, after Amin came in, later, he ordered the Asians to leave the country, and that was the beginning of the trouble that we now face. But they have gotten worse, as we now read from our newspapers and magazines. Then I may move on from there to Kenya. At the time I was in Kenya, following my stay in Uganda, that was part of the program then, and I was able to learn a great deal about it from the late Mr. Tom Mboya, who was working in the labor relations, and he was not in one of the detention camps. He introduced me to some of the women in Kenya who wanted to come to America, and particularly Howard University. So I met with these women, and there were three of them who came to Howard; they were in home economics, and they got their degrees and they are now back in their country doing outstanding work. I am amazed at how easily they went in just like that, and they have sent other women students over to Howard since. As I look back over my African experience, in regard to Howard, Howard got so many of these African women and men students, and I think the program under Mordecai Johnson was very, what should I call it, very rewarding in that the African people felt so much at ease at Howard, and then they went back home to carry on the work that they had wanted to do. So I think that Howard, I suppose still does do a good job in regards to Africa, but at that time, we were able to see the fruits of our labor in that the graduates went back. I think that about winds up what I did in Africa. MT: Now that was in Uganda. But you also went to Kenya... FPK: It was in Kenya where the students were interviewed who came to Howard and got their degrees. And two of them stayed on for their master's and then went back to professional jobs in teaching and extension work. And of course during these years they were married and that's good, that's a good sign. MT: Some of them continuing... FPK: All continuing with their work. MT: That's fine. Now that was official, through the United States govern- ment. Now you also visited Africa under the aegis of the Methodist church. Now you mentioned some of that for South Africa, but yet it was USIS* when you were in Johannesburg... FPK: Yes, that's right. MT: Now for the Methodist church. * USIS is the United States Information Service.ï»¿12 FPK: Now the Methodist church, the United Methodist church headquarters in New York sponsored my trips to Africa, but they themselves wanted me to do it on their behalf and I was pleased to accept the invitation. This was in the Congo, it was in Mozambique, and it was in the country that is now having its difficulties that has endedâ isn't that interesting, Mozambique is not called Mozambique any more, and the other country isn't called... MT: Yes, it's called the Republic of Mozambique. FPK: Oh, good. MT: They kept that name. You're not speaking of, of course it was some- times called Portuguese East Africa, but also Mozambique. FPK: Very good, I didn't realize that. I'm glad they're keeping that name. What's the other... MT: Angola is on the other side, that's on the Atlantic side. FPK: That's right, Angola is the one that is next to Zaire, and I visited that country. They had a struggle, but now they are trying to find their way through, but I have not been back since they got their independence. So we have students at Howard and have some at Hampton Institute, from Angola, but I didn't follow through with them as I did with these other places. So Africa was fascinating, and now with this independence here all over, or just about, I think they're going to move ahead. MT: I know that having lived a year and then having revisited in there any number of times, you must have made comparisons, and must have seen some similarities and some differences in your visits to Africa from your period in India. FPK: Yes. MT: I did. FPK: In fact the whole countryside has changed and is changing. MT: Yes. FPK: Now some of it rapidly, some slowly, but nevertheless the trend is there. I find that they are depending a great deal now on technology. They are not having so much of it developed in their own country, but the radios and the televisions and the whatnot from the West, they're using it in rather large amounts. I think this is good, in a way. I think maybe our own programs on television could be improved, however, in this country. MT: Right. Now you must have seen many Indians, certainly in East Africa and some elsewhere. Even in my visits, which were after yours, there were Indians of different categories, many of them leaving, even when I was there in '77, on this last trip, '76.ï»¿13 FPK: Yes, there are Indians in all the African countries in large numbers and doing interesting work. In all the countries, as I said, except in Uganda. Now Uganda, you see, expelled all the Indians. MT: Right. And now they're still trying to get compensation. FPK: That's right. MT: Ten dollars. FPK: That's right. But the other African countries, the Indians seem to be on good standing, and I'm very pleased with that. MT: Well, not in the East African countries; they're having to leave, they're not treated... FPK: They don't have to leave Kenya, do they? MT: They're leaving. FPK: Is that right? MT: In some instances. They were the traders, the merchants, and so on. FPK: Oh, yes. MT: And they're going to England. FPK: Well, I didn't realize that Kenya had done that, because Kenya has lots of land, and it's good fertile land, and the climate is one of the best I've ever experienced. They have a good, even climate, even the winters are mild and the summers are cool. MT: Well, there were some on the planes, going to ports, to go to England. In Zambia I saw something that no one was able to explain to me. These were well-to-do Indians of 5'8", 9", 10", and 6 feetâI've never seen Indians that tall! FPK: Except the Sikhs. MT: The Sikhs, but these weren't Sikhs. FPK: Uh huh, they were over in another... MT: I suppose after years of good living and food and... FPK: ...good nutrition... MT: ...but they were tall, they had gathered at an airportâit was in Livingston, when I flew to Livingston to see the falls on that side. But these were very well-to-do and enormously tall. FPK: Well, they have had good nutrition some place along the line. MT: I figured that. Not like an Indian.ï»¿14 FPK: No. Well, now, thinking about the rest of Africa, as I look at it... Then I went to Australia, you know, but they don't have any Indians in Australia. MT: Not too many, except a few students. FPK: But when I say "They don't have any," I mean in numbers. Then I went from there to New Zealand. MT: Yes. But now, this is recent and under what...was it under the church? FPK: No, no, no. My trip to New Zealand and to Australia was under the auspices of the International Nutrition Conference. MT: Oh, yes. FPK: We went there to participate in the conference. MT: And this was actually in... FPK: '76, '77. Because I was...it was '77. MT: I know the card that you sent me from New Zealand was recent. FPK: From '77. In fact, I'm forgetting my datesâit was in '77. Now there are no Indians, so to speak, in Australia. The immigration laws are very prejudicial and the people who lived there originally, what did they call them? MT: New Australians. FPK: Huh? MT: New Australians, they're not called aliens. And they come generally from southern Europe: Italians and Greeks and so on. FPK: Right, right. But I'm talking about the people who lived there originally. MT: Oh, the originals! The aborigines. FPK: The aborigines. They are living in locations, I think you would call camps, in the interior, semi-arid desert. And they are required to live there; they may come in for medical treatment, but they're trying to get medicine to them. And they have one person in Parliament, to represent all the aborigines. MT: I know. FPK: So I would consider...I was very disappointed in Australia, disappointed in it as a country, but when I learned that it was settled by...it was a penal colony of Great Britain, New South Wales. It was a penal colony. And so when I discovered that, then I could see how long a tradition could last, which I hoped would be changed.ï»¿15 MT: But that is only a very small percentage of the present population of Australia, and there were people other than the, what they call the transported, because there were the army and the government officials who were not tainted. Then came the gold rush, almost at the same time as '48, it was in '49. And that brought in people. FPK: No question about it. But the tradition of the original thought was there. And then of course Negro Americans, they cannot migrate there. MT: Unless you see, they've changed their immigration legislation, they've also changed their regulations for visitors. There is not a word on the Australian information form about race. Now New Zealand's different, they have foreign...because when Australia had the Olympics, they took out everything that had to do with race. And they haven't put it back. FPK: And they had to. MT: But if you have a profession that is needed and in which they are short in Australia, you may enter. FPK: Of course. You may enter upon their invitation. MT: Oh, yes. But then they need you. FPK: Of course they do. And in a way, one could say that it's smart, but on the other hand, that does something to the United Nations idea of international brotherhood. So I have for myself, I've underscored Australia as a country needing a great deal of help. From people who are able to give a broad vision of human life per se, and I was very upset, in quotation, "upset," by the way the aborigines had to live. MT: Oh, that's it. FPK: And so many have taken to the bottle or the drink, because you see this is...when we found in almost every countryâthis has been my experienceâdrinking too heavily, it's because their human needs are not being met. MT: You know the Australians, though, are heavy drinkers, tremendously heavy... FPK: They have their own bar, they had an open bar... MT: ...and hotels, there's a difference. There's the Hotel Marina or the Marina Hotel, if it's Marina Hotel, I think they serve liquor, and the other isn't...but they drink heavily. FPK: But they have the saloons on every street, every other one is a saloon, right in Sidney, where you have your largest number. But then let me quickly tell you that when I went to New Zealand, it was most refreshing. Yes, most refreshing. MT: They are very different. FPK: And the people who were there when the English people came to Newï»¿16 FPK: (cont) Zealand to live were accepted, the Maoris are accepted as a part, they feel very adequate. I felt no tension at all in New Zealand among the people or among the travelers who were getting out, people of different nationalities. MT: They do have a problem of their islanders. You see, New Zealand has had a mandate, has had control over several South Sea islands, and under their immigration regulations, those islanders are free to come to New Zealand and many of them have come, like Puerto Ricans have come to the United States for social services. FPK: Right, they get the benefits of the government. MT: And when I was there doing research on the Pacific islands, the minis- ter of the islands was very cool at first 'cause he thoughtâI heard laterâhe thought I had come in to criticize. Someone had been in a day or so before, and they'd torn him to pieces. Well, I was only there for information, but as he warmed and had one of the secretaries bring in tea, then he proceeded to open up and tell me. He said there was quite a mixture now of New Zealanders with the Maori and Polynesians of the islands. FPK: They accept each other and so there seems to be no problem. MT: Up to a certain extent. But he told me that every fourth New Zealander had an island relative. FPK: Isn't that interesting? Isn't that interesting? Which means that they're really involved with the whole population. Well, I believe, Dr. Tate, that brings me up to date on my foreign travel. MT: Yes. FPK: And of course I have done Europe, as you know... MT: Many times. FPK: Going to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, going to Rome for FAO*, so I think I'd like to think of myself as an international citizen. MT: You certainly are I FPK: And I have enjoyed knowing that human beings respond predominantly the same ways... MT: All over the world... FPK: Right, to the problems they meet, all over the world. MT: Well, I think that's basically true. FPK: And I can say this last statement, thinking about my beloved professor, Dr. Ethel B. Waring of Cornell University, who was the most humane person I've ever known, who gave us a formula, as I remember, when I *FAO is the Food and Agriculture Organization.ï»¿(cont) was one of her students in graduate school, dealing with how to observe behavior of humans and how to not put in what you didn't observe. And then she taught us how to observe and how to read. If I had to look back and write down what has impressed me the most as a student, it probably would be Ethel B. Waring, in helping me to observe objectively and to not be prejudicial, because prejudice means having your thoughts get right too soon. That's an interesting definition of prejudice. ...having your thoughts get right too soon. [laughter] I thank you very much. This is August 30, 1977, continuing our interview with Dr. Flemmie P. Kittrell at the home of her friend at 31 Argyle Terrace, Washington, D.C. Although we covered in a general way many aspects of your professional career, not only in the United States but abroad in India and Africa, I'm sure that there are some more aspects of your activities in India on the different occasions that you were there, that we could enlarge upon, Dr. Kittrell. I think so, too, Dr. Tate. For example, the University of Madras invited me to serve as the chairman of the committee, to pass on the merits of their first Ph.D. And this particular dissertation was so outstanding that when I read it, I suggested that we might have another person from the U.S.A. to serve with me, and so it was very convenient and appropriate for Dr. Margaret Dole, who's a professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Minnesota. So we worked together from this side, and then when I went to India to serve as the chairman there, I was so pleased to see the quality of the work that they were doing. I came to the conclusion that India was going to be a leading research center for home economics, with special reference to nutrition. And they indeed have been just that. The other thing about India which I was so pleased with was, when they had the International Home Economics Conference there, we were a part of itâwhen I say "we," the U.S.A. was a part of itâand it showed a kind of continuity and partnership in this field that was very encouraging. All right. I know during your stay in India you were very busy with your assigned activities, but we did have some breaks, some holidays, during which we could actually see the country and meet interesting people in other areas. I remember my trip to South India, particularly Madras, during the Christmas holidays. I was told there was a surprise for me waiting in the airport and they had held you, you were enplaning and I was deplaning, but they had held you on the ground for some kind of surprise and so we met. Now where were you going? I was coming to visit Madras and to visit with Dorothy Pearson, who was a home economist from Canada and who was working at the Women's Christian College. And it was amazing that you should be going, I believe at that time, to Kashmir.ï»¿18 MT: No, KashmirâI went later before the monsoon, that was the summer; this was Christmas. FPK: Well, you know, our paths crossed almost again there, because Dorothy Pearson, the home economist from Canada who was in India, and I spent our vacation in Kashmir. And during that particular time we learned a great deal about the total country; Kashmir's entirely different from South India. First of all, it's cold and mountainous and snow-peaks . MT: It's a Switzerland of Asia. FPK: And when I went to Kashmir, I was amazed to find that India has so many beautiful types of surroundings, and the people in Kashmir were so unique and artistic. And while I didn't have much money to spend, because I had to take this from my allowance, I must confess that I spent more money in Kashmir for beautiful objects than in any other place in India. It was a delightful experience and particularly when we were living on the lake, in the houseboat. And then could shop on the boat and people would come to us. So the whole thing was delightful, and I am looking forward one day to go back to Kashmir and to have an experience like that again. MT: Yours was similar to mine. I vacationed there with a Fulbright lecturer from Burma I had met in Rangoon, speaking for the USIS. And she was anxious to spend some time in Kashmir but didn't know anyone with whom she could go, you see, and of course one doesn't stay in a hotel in Kashmir, one lives on a houseboat. FPK: Exactly. Dorothy Pearson, the one I referred to from Canada, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but we saw to it that neither would leave the houseboat and one would be left alone, because it was not... MT: Why? FPK: Well, we just didn't want to be out in the lakes all by ourselves and neither could swim. [laughter] Not very well. MT: I don't know whether that entered my mind but we were always together, because we took side trips in the chicara and went into rivers and other lakes. And when we went into Kashmir to shop, because we were out on the lake, we went in the chicara and then came back. But that didn't enter my mind. FPK: Well, I think it entered mine, because there were so many interesting things to do and we both had to try to decide what we would do together, and Dorothy wasn't too well at that time and I didn't want to leave her. But talking about arriving on the mainland, so to speak, of Kashmir, I never saw so many beautiful people, when they went in and out, and particularly small childrenâthat was my special interest. And here they were, not only attractive and apparently very well fed. . . MT: Yes, that's... FPK: ...compared to South India. * The houseboats remained moored or anchored. Chicaras are used as taxis on lakes and rivers. They are quite comfortable. (M.T.)ï»¿19 MT: Oh, much more food there, yes. FPK: That of course caught my attention, and of course, they are a differ- ent type, a different build. But yet they all blend into the overall general customs of the country. MT: Quite. Yes. Quite. FPK: Well, I long to go back to India on a vacation, and I'm hoping I might do so within the next three years, and if so I will try to get to Kashmir again. MT: Yes. FPK: It's worth our time and worth our interest that we hold so dearly in regards to India. MT: Now you were, of course, at Baroda as far as your assignment was concerned, but I know you got around to other areas. Were there some other sections in which you spent some... You mentioned Madras, did you get out from Madras? Did you get down on the Malabar Coast at all? FPK: Yes, I did that, but I also went up to Allahabad, and that is the birthplace of Mr. Nehru. MT: Oh, yes.' FPK: It was famous for that particular reason, then there were other reasons of course. But I was so pleased to hear the great admiration that people had for that great man. So we went into his home and saw his family background, and I fell in love all over again with Mr. Nehru's philosophy. MT: On your way home from India, I know you went out through Europe and returned through the Far East, as most people do on a Fulbright. What stops did you make that you found interesting and fascinating? FPK: Well, I found Thailand most interesting. I also was able to see the countryside and see the people, and to see the way they lived on the lake side or the water side of that country. I was amazed to see how healthy the children were looking. Of course, I was always looking for children, and they were well cared for and tenderly looked after. That impressed me very much. Also the pagodas. Now they were very attractive, and there one had to use one's best judgment to keep at least enough money to get back to the U.S.A. But I was pleased there with the jewelry and what have you, and bought as much as I could afford for Christmas gifts for my friends back home. That was a very delightful experience. MT: And did you get to the water market? FPK: I went to the water market and at the water market, I had never seen anything quite like it. What was your impression of the water market?ï»¿20 MT: Oh, I was making pictures and to me, it was just fantastic, how they maneuvered the boat to make sales, and the hats that looked like lampshades.* FPK: And it was almost like a festival and a circus, but a beautiful circus ! MT: Yes. FPK: Beautiful circus. I loved it. And then from there, I also went to Rangoon, and I was fortunate to know some mission people there and they took me through the country, and I learned so much more from them by being there on that occasion. In the meantime I did not plan to stay several days, because I was en route, and most of my stops were short stops between planes, but I want to go back to that part of the country. Coming on further, I stopped over in Japan, that was the time it was occupied by the United States Army, and of course I didn't like the looks of it and was so pleased when that occupation ended. When it ended a few years later, I was invited by the U.S. Department ofâwell, AID, that's what they called it thenâto go with a group of Indian women to Japan to see the extension services that they had developed, and they had done an outstanding good job in this whole field of extension. They had already had some programs along this line, in kind of a neighborhood way, but they had it much more organized, the government was in back of it. And the thing that impressed me the most was that I lived in the homes of the Japanese people and that's when you really learn a great deal. Having tea, seeing how well they took care of their children again, and I saw absolutely no child abuse, just none, no child abuse whatsoever. The children were loved and cared for, and they were helped to do things that they wanted to do. I saw no one scolding any children. I made a real point of that. Had you noticed that among the Japanese people? MT: Well, I wasn't there probably under the same arrangements as you had, but even though Japan had been through a war, the children weren't like children in India. FPK: No, they were not. They were very different. But you know, on the other hand, I think the war had been over about two years when we were there, and by that time, the Japanese people had been able to do a great many things to bring them back to their normality. I found there was no food shortage, the children were well fed, but more than that, they were well treated as humans, with thinking powers of their own, and their parents and the other adults appreciated it and also encouraged it. I felt very good about that, and believed that we could learn a great deal from the Japanese people on child rearing. MT: No doubt... FPK: There was no child abuse at all! No child abuse at all! MT: How did you enjoy your baths in the Japanese homes? * At the water market, vegetables, fruits, hats, cloth, et cetera, are for sale. (M.T.)ï»¿21 FPK: Well, I would say they were unique, but I was glad to get back to the American baths with a tub. [laughter] Or with a shower. But on the other hand, the Japanese people were so gracious and so polite and so gentle that I was very pleased to have that experience, living in their homes. MT: Yes. Then from Japan, of course... FPK: Hawaii. I had been to Hawaii before, but I'm always very glad to see it again. I had some old teachers there who had retired and who were elderly, so that made it a great joy in returning. MT: It was my first visit to Hawaii. I've been back twelve times since, but that was my first. And I was so glad that I approached Hawaii from the Orient, because to me it's the crossroads between the Orient and America. FPK: Absolutely. Absolutely the crossroads. The University of Hawaii represents that. And it's a beautiful university as well as a very efficient one, it seems to me. I was pleased with what I saw in the way of the library, the extension service, the history programs, the exhibits; it was very fascinating. I could very well live in Hawaii with peace and ease, but the volcanoes still did disturb me a little because I saw some of them still active. MT: You mean, on the island of Hawaii? It's been active these last couple weeks. FPK: Right. When I see a volcano... and that reminds me, Dr. Tate, that when I was in New Zealand this past year, I found many active volcanoes, and the people have learned to live with them for hundreds of years. I guess I would have a hard time ever learning to live with a volcano. [laughter] MT: Since you've mentioned New Zealand, that was a visit that was sort of an adjunct to your trip to Australia? FPK: Yes. MT: Well, let us discuss something about what you saw in New Zealand, and your attitude towards the people there. FPK: Well, the New Zealanders were very different from the Australians because they settled under different conditions, but I found New Zealanders to be very fascinating and very attractive in their way of living. The English people who had come there to settle were very gentle and considerate of the natives. MT: That's for New Zealand? FPK: New Zealand, yes. They got along so well that you just didn't see any line of separation. That impressed me a great deal because just the opposite is true in Australia. MT: Yes.ï»¿22 FPK: Then the other thing about New Zealand, I liked their system of education. They believe in having it general for all the people, and the University of New Zealand was outstandingly fine. We only visited shortly, but I had a chance to meet some of the professors, to see their laboratories and to chat with the graduate students. That was in the main, the North Island. MT: What was your port of landing in New Zealand? Was it Auckland? FPK: Oh, yes, Auckland, by air. MT: And then you did the North Island, so to speak. FPK: But the North Island is the island with Auckland. The island below the big island is called the South Island. It's just this narrow strait... MT: Right. FPK: Now the South Island was so cold that... MT: At the time you were there... FPK: ...during their winter, and I was told that the South Pole is colder than the North Pole by several degrees because of the angle at which the earth rotates. MT: Yes, yes. FPK: Well, I'm going to look into that a little bit more, because I don't think it could have been any colder anywhere than what we experienced when we were there. Now in addition to that, the winds are very strong. MT: Yes, that wind... FPK: And so we hadâ¢difficulty landing, and before we got to our particular area where we were going to stay, the plane had to be brought down. MT: Now this was in New Zealand... FPK: This was in New Zealand. MT: You had an emergency landing? FPK: Emergency landing. MT: Was this in the interior of the South Island or at Wellington, which is of course the capital. FPK: No, this was in the interior, just middle way between the beginning and the end of the island. MT: Oh! Oh!ï»¿23 And what we found was, however, that they had very good communication, because they probably had these kinds of experiences often, and the people were told how to lean to the left to have all the weight on one side of the airship and so the pilots were able to manage. Otherwise, we could have been destroyed. You mean, if you moved your location on the plane... Physically...we left our seats to go to the other side. Like they do sometimes on board ship. Right, right, to average the weight. But this was frightening to all of us and I must say... But you did make an emergency landing. Emergency landing. And then what happened? When you say emergency landing, therefore, you were not on an airport floor? No, no, we were out in the...people call it the hinterland. But the pilot was very skillful and landed in such a way that the trucks and buses could reach us. So he knew. You see, they have that all the time, I'm told, during this time of the year. And so they were able to put us in a position where the buses could reach us, and the buses came and picked us up. I know you were happy to see the buses! I'd never had that experience before, and I was very grateful that the pilots knew their business. Thank God, every time one's in a situation like that. And so we did not make our complete trip down to the South Pole, that's where we were headed, but we were very pleased to compromise and go no further than to the Tourist Hotel, that's a very distinguished hotel, and we stayed there; it was about ten miles from where our plane landed. But it was very cold there and incidentally, I had some pictures made of it and I hope to use them for Christmas time. Oh! In my Christmas cards. Now this was just this past year. It was in July, last July. It was '77. And I know you sent me a card from there, that's what amazed me. Well, I thought about you because you know you had traveled in all parts of the world, and I said, "Well, who among my American friendsï»¿24 FPK: (cont) would appreciate a card from New Zealand?" So I thought of you. Ml: I was down the Fourth of July, the year that I visited Australia and New Zealand in '68. I was invited to the embassy affair, the Fourth of July, only you must know that the Fourth of July in New Zealand is the first spot where the Fourth of July is celebrated. It's really the third on the mainland because of the difference in time. FPK: I see. You mean, they're a day ahead of us, in the U.S.A.? MT: Yes, because the sun rises there first. FPK: Isn't that amazing? MT: We celebrated it there, which was actually the third here. It was the first time that the American flag had had the extra star for Alaska, and they didn't have the official flag, but someone appliqued a star from an old flag to put on, and therefore they claimed this was the first spot where the flag had flown with the star on it. FPK: Well, whoever put the extra star on, he should be rewarded for his ingenuity. But I think, as we look back over our travels and what we have done in regards to our academic work, I believe I can say that human beings are essentially the same in terms of interest, and of motivation. We all respond to the situations we meet, and some of us respond one way and some another, but basically I have found mankind pretty good. MT: Yes, when you look for that, as we do â FPK: We do. MT: ...we find it. FPK: That's right, we find it. MT: And if you expect otherwise, sometimes... FPK: MT: You find that, yes. So we put into our travel, I think, what we think is good and we get it back in others. I've been amazed at how easy it is to travel around the world, extremely easy. Even not knowing all the languages. In western India, for example, where they speak Gujarati,* I was never able to learn that language well, because they spoke English, and that was for the Americans. But I learned a few words that were very effective and I used them for about everything! [laughter] Accha and bus, I remember those! I shouldn't get into this, but I ii^ber the evening that you were going to take me across to Baroda University to have dinner. FPK: Yes. Right. * Gujarati is the language of Gujarat, Baroda, and neighboring regions xn northwestern India. Other languages are Bengali in Bengal, Hindi et cetera. There are twelve major languages and well over a hundred others. (M.T.)ï»¿25 MT: And you ordered the tonga that we were to have. FPK: Right. [laughter] MT: And you told the driver how to go and you used bus and accha most of the time. FPK: Accha, good. MT: And you would give him the directions with right or left and accha and bus... FPK: Yesâand I was awkward at this and, of course, the driver used his judgment I MT: I was interested, because when I climbed in the carriage I just wanted to see how Dr. Flemmie Kittrell was going to get on with this driver! [laughter] FPK: We got along all right, didn't we? MT: Yes. And when we arrived there, I couldn't understand what the driver said, but it meant that if he had known where he was going, he could have gone a shorter way! [laughter] FPK: Well, that would not surprise me at all. MT: But we got there. FPK: Very good. And you know, when you bring that up, I was just thinking how pleasant Indian people are and how generous they are, and how they give us the benefit of all our mistakes without calling us to task. And I love them very much because of that, too. MT: FPK: MT: FPK: Well, we have covered some of your side trips. I know many things will come to your mind after this brief interview. Then you have kept active after retirement. You retired from Howard about two or three years ago. Three years ago. And you skipped town more or less. In fact, I left town, Merze, because I felt that would be good for Howard and good for me. And what I did was to go up to Cornell; in fact, I was invited to Cornell... MT: Yes, I heard that. FPK: And I was there for two years as a visiting professor, and then I was fortunate to get a grant from the NIH and did some special research my second year there. So altogether I feel that I've still been in the academic world, not the routine part of keeping records, but more or less the creative part, in researching. I had more ideas, using the ideas approach, trying to find some more substantial facts. And * A tonga is a two-wheel vehicle with one horse. We never rode in what is considered a carriage here.ï»¿26 FPK: (cont) in doing that, I was interested in seeing what NIH was doing about research, and at that time they had a special conference in regards to what we might do to improve our methods. Well, I was thinking about this quality of life all the time that I was working at Cornell, and so when I was asked to prepare a statement in regards to our need for research in human development from infancy through old age, I tried to pull together what I had been doing in my field of home economics, human development, and nutrition. I said that we ought to now begin to look at research that was carried on from infancy through old age, and this would take approximately seventy years, because that's our average. But I think that would be very good, and I hope some day this will happen, that we not just take little bits of this and little bits of that, because the real test of how we are moving ahead in human development is to see what happens to a person from infancy through old age. And I was very pleased that they thought well of that at the institute when I gave my paper, and I'm hoping that something will come of this. This was last year. MT: Have you an extra copy or a copy that may be duplicated and returned to you by Radcliffe? FPK: I'd be very happy; in fact, you may take this one. MT: And we'll have it duplicated and returned. Now you may have other supplementary material that you would be happy to have duplicated and returned to you. FPK: Well, all right. That was the latest material I was trying to deal with in terms of continuity and research. Then I worked in the church, you know, or did you know that? MT: Yes, you... FPK: I worked in the Methodist church. MT: Well, yes. FPK: And I was very pleased about two years ago when Reverend Robinson, the home in which I am now entertaining you, shall I say, presented me with the United Methodist Union Award, for '71, for the Methodist Laity of the Year, and I won't go into that, but I was very pleased â MT: For distinguished service to United... FPK: Methodism. MT: Yes, you have mentioned that you received that award. FPK: Yes, I was very pleased with that because I had been interested in the church all my life, not from the emotional side, but I think as a youngster I learned so much from the church that helped me as I grew up that I just kept on with it, and I think it has paid off. I hope so. MT: Yes.ï»¿27 FPK: Now going back to the matter of longevity in your research. I have done some work on family needs I've seen around the world. And this brings up that same general idea, and this was in the Methodist Woman, that was the journal that was used by the United Methodist church. And the Methodist church before it became United Methodist. MT: Would you like to have that duplicated? FPK: Well, you could have that article duplicated if you would like. MT: And they will return it to you... FPK: And I think it says something that I still believe is true. Now, that was several years ago, this other was more recent. Now then, Dr. Tate, it might be of interest to, let me go back... I have several MT: ...have you found some other material that you would like to recommend? FPK; I thought it would be of interest for you to know that I was a part of that mission to Bangladesh when they got their independence. And it was called an airlift of understanding, and that was a very rewarding experience, because I didn't realize that there was so much suffering in the world. The American people...there were seventy of us who volunteered to go, and we paid our own way, of course, to see and to offer any sympathetic understanding we could as individuals, not representing our government, but as individuals. It was most successful, I think, and although Bangladesh has had a very difficult time since its independence, I think they were very pleased to have the feeling that there were many Americans, as well as our own government, interested in their welfare. That, to me, was a very good thing to do, and so I look upon it as one of the things that I ought to be doing. Then another thing that we were doing, in regards to helping the Bangladesh people, was an international development conference that is held every year by a private organization, so to speak. Bishop Lord, who was our bishop of the Washington conference at that time, the Baltimore conference, gave a great deal of support, and Mrs. Lord; they supported programs in regards to helping Bangladesh. MT: Now I was surprised when Bangladesh received its independence that its national anthem is the saga of Bengali which was composed by the great teacher-God Tagore. FPK: Oh, yes! MT: Tagore. And I heard it over the air... FPK: Oh, yes, no question about Tagore. His name was mentioned, I would say, over and over and over again, that Tagore was from Bangladesh. MT: Well, it was East Bengal. FPK: Exactly. And it was the... MT: ...at the fall of Bengal which he composed as the national anthem and theï»¿29 FPK: (cont) And in fact I am predicting, Dr. Tate, that in the future, home economics will come into its full understanding among people, and that we will have this as one of the basics if we're going to have a good life. I think the piecemeal of specialization and no one to integrate it into a whole...now there are many aspects of home economics where we become specialists. That's all right. But a specialist is not much good unless the specialist knows also about the other parts that would go to make a whole. What do you think about that? MT: Well, that's true in the social sciences. A person who may have specialized in history should know political science and certainly geography, to understand...and economics is basic. So I am hoping that what we are facing, as we look at this new concept... FPK: ...it's not a new concept, it's old, it's Ellen H. Richards's concept. But there are so many people who are eager to do a specialized thing that they forget the total meaning of what the word "home economics" means, and I would like to suggest that all the folks who would want to be interested in this further would read Ellen H. Richards's life story in regards to human ecology and home economics. They're the same, those meanings are really the same, but human ecology being so much more sophisticated, people think it's so far removed from the home, that they prefer it to be something else. But the home being really the center of all our learning, it will one day come into its own, after we learn how not to be sophisticated, but to be really sincere and scientific in our working with peonle. MT: That's interesting and I think you're absolutely correct on that. FPK: Well, thanks for that, but you can see that I'm still a home economist, [laughter] MX: Yes. But you're a broad home economist. Very broad. FPK: I think the home economist in general would be broad, if so many people in executive positions didn't try to make it so narrow. Now maybe that's a good statement. Many people think that if you're a home economist, you really are concerned with just food and clothing. Well, when you're interested in home economics, you're concerned with the whole of life, and that brings in all the disciplines. And I don't believe that one should begin to major in home economics per se, until they've had a very good liberal education in the liberal arts. MT: That should be true for most subjects, but it isn't. FPK: But it should be. I say one should not teach in a major field of study, like the social sciences or the physical sciences, the humanities, unless they know how all these things work together to help people to grow and live and to understand...and to be happy! In the universe. MT: Yes. Uh huh. And with all peoples. Lï»¿28 MT: (cont) minute I heard it, I'd heard it forever... FPK: And it also gave me a closeness to the country, because... MT: Oh, I was surprised! FPK: That is where the intellectual part of India really is. It's definitely there with Tagore's background, his contribution. But that was one of the things that I thoroughly enjoyed. Now that was several years after I had been to India, and on our way back we stopped by and we were well received by Mrs. Gandhi, then the prime minister. And she was extremely pleased because India helped Bangladesh in their struggle, and so it was very close. Then it was after the others...I have done work with the United Nations and so every year, you know, we have the United Nations Day and the American Association of University Women invite people to send in names, and I was very pleased to have been chosen by the National Association of University Women, for the United Nations Day. MT: Excellent. FPK: These are the same things, or relating to internationalism, so I suppose I am an international girl. [laughter] I hope so! MT: Well, you are. FPK: Are there any other points of interest you think that you might want to have me say? Now, this has been a part of my teaching experience... MT: These are interesting. This you could mention, too; these are from New York? FPK: This is from Cornell. MT: Yes, well what is this? Read it. FPK: This one from Cornell had to do with Dean Canoyer's celebration of the completion of the new wing of the home economics building. Now they call it human ecology, but then it was home economics. May I tell you that home economics really had a broader base than the human ecology, because human ecology can be broken into so many different areas, and people are apt to not see it as a whole, so I really now prefer home economics to human ecology, after I have seen how many interpretations people can give it. But in home economics, those of us who have been educated in that area, particularly in research, now know that if you have a home economics program that is valid, it has to draw its basic content from the major discipline. I said that, I believe, earlier in my discussion here, but now I am convinced it has to be from the major discipline, and that the people who propose to work in the field must have a general strong background in all the fields of education, not as specialists, but in the core material. And from this core material they can use ways of working with the child from the beginning of birth, at birth onward, they can know about the history of the home, can know about the scientific aspects of nutrition, can know about how to handle money and how to manage.ï»¿30 FPK: All people! MT: Some aren't happy unless they're with Americans when they go abroad, the first restaurant they look for in Paris, it's an American restaurant. FPK: In fact, what one who is really a world citizen would do, and some of us do do that, I hope, at least I try to do that, is to stay away from all the Americans and learn about everybody else. Because I know that much Americanism [laughter] and love it! But when I go abroad, I'm interested in other people's way of life, and as we do this, it seems to me that we begin to look at all people everywhere as our kin and we are one people, irrespective of race or creed or color. And so I feel at home in the world, I do not feel a stranger anywhere in the world. And when I say "I feel at home," I think that in working with children, this is very evident, that if you smile at a child or have a pleasant face for a child, he will eventually come your way. So that looks like I could be a good kidnapper, doesn't it! [laughter] Well, I believe that takes in my concept of what living is about, and here's some articles in regards to the family as the central cornerstone to human development. I wrote some articles for the American Association of University Women...you don't need to duplicate that because I have several of those, you may keep that if you wish. And then going back to the public school system, where we all have interests, and unless the public schools are going to fulfill their role, we still will have difficulty in our way of trying to make for a better world for all people. And I have been working with the Head Start program and the Follow Through. The Follow Through program continued on after the first six years of Head Start. And I was a consultant at the Goldsboro City School, and continued on with Follow Through for eight years. And you might be interested in seeing this sometime at your convenience. All in all then, thinking about what we have talked about, would you like to raise any questions about anything else that I have been concerned with? MT: Well, I... FPK: I brought a few pictures around â MT: I am interested in that picture, what is that? FPK: That reminded me of my days at Bennett College. That was my first year at Howard University. MT: This is your first year at Howard? FPK: At Howard and these were the students who wanted to be a part of the football celebration, homecoming. And the thing that was interesting about this is that even then I had been encouraging internationalism. This young lady here is from India, she was one of our first graduates to get the master's degree from India, Mrs. Singh. And this girl here is from Bermuda, and this lady here is from Africa. Now they have on all the American costumes except the Indian lady; that's the sari.ï»¿31 FPK: (cont) But they were among the young people selected to he in this float, so that represents scholarship as well as internationalism. MT: Now that could be duplicated and returned to you? FPK: That would be all right, if you want to do that. MT: Now you have others, I see some others here. FPK: Now that's a new building, but that was before it had the shrubbery and the nice environment, but these were the students who helped to plan that building and here they were very happy. These were some of them, and that girl right there was the chairman of that student group, and I thought that showed a kind of a continuity. MT: Well, all these pictures will be duplicated and returned to you. FPK: And you may know that one, that was Dean Snowden. MT: Oh, yeah. FPK: He was not the dean then and here's William A. Banner, professor of philosophy...and this is... MT: He was in sociology and he passed, you know. FPK: That's right. And this person right here, she was one of the social workers from the city. From the beginning I was interested in working with all of the people at the university and the city, so we were opening up our Homemaking Institute Week, something like the ones we used to have at Bennett College. So Dean Snowden was the speaker for that luncheon that we had that day and this person right there is May Thompson, wife of Dr. Charles Thompson, then dean of the graduate school. MT: Oh, yes! FPK: She was always helping. This is the wife of the sociologist. This little lady here was the president of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and she was president also of the Home Economics Club, so she was there. And this is Mr. Gibbons, of course, who passed. I'd like to have that one back, but I think that's... MT: Oh, all of these photos you'll have back. FPK: And that one, I didn't know whether or not you wanted that or not. MT: About when was this taken? FPK: It doesn't say much, I don't think, but I just brought it. MT: Do you have any others, do you feel that you have one that you would prefer? FPK: Well, I think I do. I think...now this one right here...it was inï»¿32 FPK: (cont) a folder, I'll find it. MT: You found the one that you were interested in. FPK: I believe this one might be a good one. MT: Oh, yes! This is fine. Now, when was this taken? FPK: That was 1944. MT: And you're wearing cap and gown. FPK: Well, that was after I got my degree from Cornell. MT: Oh, that would be excellent. FPK: And this was, we were in the procession at Hampton Institute, getting ready for commencement. MT: Oh, yes. FPK: And this lady asked me would I cooperate by coming out to have my picture made, so I did. I was younger then. [laughter] MT: Oh, yes, I can understand. FPK: But I believe that might be the one that would be fitting for Radcliffe. What do you think? Now this one here I thought was a little too artificial. MT: Why? FPK: I don't know, do you like that? MT: Well, it's in front of... FPK: ...the old home economics building. MT: Which you described yesterday. FPK: That's right. MT: And you think...what? FPK: That's Mrs. Rogers. MT: Yes, I know, from Bennett. FPK: That's right. MT: Why do you think it's... FPK: Well, if you like it, I just thought there were so many faces but if... MT: You are where on this?ï»¿33 FPK: There. MT: Well, I don't think we have you too many times. You're not in that picture, it would only be twice. Now we have some awards and honors, but I don't think... FPK: There are the girls, the students, rather. MT: Yes. But these are the ones who participated in the plans. FPK: That's right, they were on the committee. MT: And this is the float, that's only two of you, that's not too many. FPK: All right, well, just keep it if you want to use it. MT: And I'll make a notation for these to be duplicated. I noticed you had another award somewhere, a D.C. award, right here, certificate of... FPK: That was dealing with Follow Through and Head Start. MT: That's D.C., District of Columbia, isn't it? FPK: That's right. Oh, this is the one you were thinking about? MT: Yes. FPK: Oh, that's a political life, you know, I'm political too. [laughter] MT: Explain this then. FPK: Yes, I have been interested in helping in the city government, and particularly after we got the D.C. vote. So for the last four years I've been working with it, and I was just appointed to this ward commission on Advisory Neighborhood Council, and I served for seventy five days, one can only serve for seventy-five days. Mr. David Clark is our ward council member, and he's a very good council member I was very pleased to be asked to do this. MT: Now, just what did you do in that? FPK: I attended the ward meetings and brought up some of the problems that we should be looking after, worked with some ideas in regards to the school system. Incidentally this was a time when we were having our difficulty with the superintendent of schools, and we gave ideas as to what we would like to see in a superintendent. So this is what this was all about. MT: So you were in politics? FPK: Oh, absolutely. And when I said politics, I was thinking about political science; one has to be in politics if one is going to help things to become real in the community. You simply can't just have theory, so I did some passing out of ballots, and I went toï»¿34 FPK: (cont) the voting polls and helped with the counting of ballots, to see that people didn't have fraud ballots and I got right with it. [laughter] MT: Yes. FPK: Now one other thing, Dr. Tate, that might be of interest â there's a fellowship that they had established in the American Home Ec. Association, and this tells you about it. MT: Well, you tell us about it so we'll have it on tape. FPK: Right! All right. Well, when I retired from Howard University the American Home Economics Association, through the leadership of Alice Stewart, who worked in the education department, as a home economist, thought of the idea of getting a scholarship made for me. So I thought they were whispering around, and I wasn't sure what they were talking about, but when I retired they announced it, that a scholarship had been provided for international students in home economics, and that pleased me very much. And they got this brochure out to tell what I had been doing, which is something like internationalism. MT: Yes. FPK: This is when I was with the Indian students abroad, and this is when I was speaking at some place in America, and this is at Baroda, and at that time, I was the officiating dean; while they were looking for a new dean, I was asked to serve for that year. And so that picture always interested me. MT: Well, then this may be duplicated. I know you prize it a great deal. Do you have only one copy? FPK: I have only one copy of that, so I'd be pleased if that was dupli- cated. And I believe that's about what you would like to know about what I have been up to. Now for the vita that you asked me for... I think I found it here, and put it aside. FPK: I think that's about enough. If I find a more complete copy, I'll send it to you. MT: Fine. Now I know for any educator who has worked so widely, not only in this country but other areas of the world, that you must appear in some of the Who's Whos. FPK: I can say, hopefully, that I'm somewhat modest. [laughter] I have been in the Who's Who in America and Who's Who of American Women and then Who's Who in the United States. MT: Oh, yes, I mentioned that yesterday and I was certain that you were in it. FPK: And Who's Who of Negro Women, well, women in particular but I think men and women.ï»¿35 MT: Yes, the last one, it was about two years ago. FPK: That's right. MT: I was asked to fill out one, and that must be it. FPK: That's right. And then Who's Who in Sciences. MT: Oh, they did have one? Men, American men... FPK: I'm in that. MT: ...American men and I was rather amused when I filled it out. Now it's American Men and Women. FPK: That's right. I'm in that one. MT: - Yes. FPK: And what else...Who's Who in the South, yes. But I think, Merze, I feel a little embarrassed about this because some of it is a duplication, and if you're in Who's Who and you live in the South, why do you have to have another for the South? MT: Well, the South... FPK: ...one for the North. MT: ...well, they have one for the Southwest, too. FPK: Do they have one for the North? I haven't seen one. MT: I haven't seen one for the North. FPK: They must think the South is underdeveloped. [laughter] MT: No, I think the South felt that they weren't getting in some of the larger ones, and therefore they got out one of their own. FPK: ...but anyway I'm proud of the South and incidentally, Merze, I'm very proud that we have a president from the South. MT: Yes! FPK: I'm very proud of that. And it seems to me that we're going to have a new look, not that the South is...what shall I say? Well, I'm glad that the South has done some good work that the North has not yet even caught up with. Particularly in regards to education, and when the Supreme Court worked on the idea and passed the regulation that we should do better, the South complied much quicker than the North. MT: And they have some of the most bitter opposition to busing and integra- tion in the North... FPK: Boston and Detroit.ï»¿36 MT: Exactly. FPK: And we had thought of Boston as the center for culture and learning. So I'm proud to be in Who's Who in the South. [laughter] MT: That's good. FPK: Incidentally, you are from the Midwest... MT: I'm from the Midwest but somehow I got...I don't know whether it was from having taught in the South...they sent me a form. I can't remember whether I filled it out, but... FPK: I hope you did, I hope you did. Because to tell the truth, you know, you've done all your teaching below...inevitably it's in the southern region. Not all of it... MT: But Howard used to be practically so...Howard, "on the banks of the Potomac," is practically... FPK: Exactly. Exactly. So that's very good. Well, at any rate I think that the American Men of Science did a good thing when they said Men and Women...and that's all right. Well, it's been nice having this conversation with you and we have exchanged ideas, and I'm so pleased that I have had the opportunity to know you, first before you came to Bennett, all the days since then, and when you were at Howard, this was very, very good for me. MT: I know the advisory committee and the coordinator of this project as well as Dr. King, who is the director of the Schlesinger Library, will be very happy to have these tapes and the transcription on file for Dr. Flemmie P. Kittrell. Because we were concerned when we couldn't locate you. [laughter] That was a year and a half ago. FPK: That's because I was at Cornell, and then I was in Europe, as you see, and then I went back to India. But I've been running around still, and now my friends are saying, "Are you retired?" And I say, "Somewhat." MT: And to think that I caught you between New Zealand and moving, I'm really amazed... FPK: And I may say, of course, just in ending that I hope our friendship will remain, and our fellowship intellectual-wise and so forth, and I am going to be living in Gloucester, Virginia, and I do hope that you will make it your business to visit me there and keep up our communication and our friendship. MT: Well, I should like to very much. Now the transcript which you will eventually receive and the material... FPK: I'm going to send you, though, a completed... oh, you mean the trans- cript of what we're recording? MT: Yes.ï»¿37 FPK: Yes, yes! MT: Now these will be returned and I should have...do you want to give me your home address now? FPK: Well, send it to Gloucester, Virginia. MT: All right. Now is there a â FPK: We don't have streets in Gloucester, we just have the post office. MT: I see. FPK: So what you would do, address it to Flemmie P. Kittrell, in care of the Post Office, Gloucester, Virginia. And I don't know the zip. MT: Well, that's all right, I can find it, I can get it. FPK: All right. MT: Well, this has been a most happy occasion, and I am so glad that I was able to catch you, anyone moving as rapidly as you do. FPK: I'm extremely pleased to have been a part of your project, Dr. Tate, and especially was I pleased to see you again. MT: Once you mentioned your satisfaction with the period that you spent at Howard University. Would you like to conclude with a little more on that? FPK: Well, I think I would be pleased to, Dr. Tate. I think I can say with real affection that I enjoyed my work at Howard University under Mordecai Johnson, our president, and then later I enjoyed it under Dr. James Madison Nabrit who followed him. Both of these men not only understood the broad concepts of what home economics was all about, but they supported it with their efforts to get money, first for the building, and then later for the equipment and for the programs. We also were able to get a very good staff, and both President Johnson and Dr. Nabrit, and I may say Dean Charles H. Thompson, were the men who, for me, made working and living at Howard a very happy experience. Mennen Williams was in charge of the African Desk in the State Department, and not only was he helpful in locating good students, but he saw to it that they got grants, and they did move along very nicely under his leadership. MT: Do you know, during his period, they called him "Soapy" Williams* in Michigan. He had charge of the African Desk, and now practically every African country has a separate desk. FPK: Wonderful. Very good. MT: Instead of one African desk. * "Soapy" because he had made his fortune in soap and soap powdersâMennen products. He was the governor of Michigan. (M.T.)ï»¿38 FPK: And the thing that I was so pleased about him, he was so outgoing, and the African people were very fond of his leadership. MT: Is that so? FPK: And so it was during his administration that I made these trips to Pretoria. MT: He was really well known in that field, and very popular, of course, at Michigan. FPK: And a very understanding person. He was understanding, and he had insight, which I appreciated. Now may I move on to what I did in South Africa? MT: Yes, I'm very interested in that. FPK: Well, the U.S. Information Agency was also helpful in helping me to get to South Africa. I requested that my itinerary include South Africa. Now of course that was a different story, because I was going as a person, and they knew that I was going because I wanted to find out what was happening in the country, and therefore it was not easy to get a visa. I couldn't get a visa for South Africa until I got to Rhodesia. MT: Oh, in Salisbury... FPK: Rhodesia, in Salisbury. When I went to that area, they had the visa started for me from my own government here, and they told me before I left that I would get it in Rhodesia. So it was very interesting, how these questions came up as to who I was. Are you a European? A Bantu? Or an Asian? And I'd say U.S. citizen [laughter], and then I went all the way down to answer the question, "Who would recommend you for being a good person to visit South Africa?" And I said my friends in the American consulate here in Rhodesia. [laughter] So I went down to the line, but there were about a hundred questions I had to answer, and they were kind of contradictory. At the end of the information list it said, "Do you understand all the questions that you have answered?" "Are you willing to take the consequences?" And I answered by saying, "I think I understand all them and I'm willing to take the consequences." Well, when I got down to South Africa... MT: Which was your city of entry? Was it Johannesburg? FPK: It was Johannesburg... MT: Yes, that's the port of entry... FPK: ...port of entry. And at Johannesburg, I wasn't sure if I was going to be accepted, but I knew the embassy folks were going to be looking out for me. On my way down I was sitting in the back of the plane, and I was so thirsty that I thought I'd have a Coca-Cola, and so I asked if I could have a Coca-Cola. A man looked around because my accent was distinctly American, and he said, "Are you from America?"ï»¿39 FPK: (cont) And I said yes, and he said, "And you're going to South Africa?" And I said yes. And he said, "Well, I am from South Africa, I'm an Afrikaaner, and I'm glad you're coming, but let me tell you, when you get there be careful that you do not let them pin something on you in regards to sex, or in regards to being with people of the Caucasian race." He said, "Now when I get off of this plane, I'm going to take your bag down for you, but I'm going to leave it right there for fear that they will identify me with you." And I said, "Thank you very much. You'll have no trouble with me." Well, so when I got off of the planeâI think it's important to say at this time because when I got off the plane in South Africa, I had no need to worry because who was there to meet me except the American ambassador! MT: The ambassador! FPK: The ambassador. And his family. MT: You didn't have to go through customs. Your luggage was not even opened. FPK: Absolutely. But I'm saying that only to say that an American person in a foreign country is very important, and it was very important in Africa, and so I wrote back and thanked them for that. And I also wrote my State Department about how well our ambassador behaved. So that was it, and I was there for a week, and in that week, I visited the mining area and I visited where the people lived and I saw the locations for different groups. And of all the people, the Bantus had the worst location. They had moved them way out into the hinterland, they could only come in by bus for working, and leave. MT: Before night. FPK: Right. Leave before night. And in addition to that, they had to get permission if they wanted to be outside of that little... MT: What they call "township." What we would call a town. FPK: Right, they had to get a permit from the police and if they didn't, they could get shot down on sight. Well, I saw all of that. And I saw the men coming in from the mines, and I saw them coming up to get a drink of cold water and beer, and then once a week they could come all together, just a little exercise for them, and so I saw that. And when I went in, they hadn't seen any woman of color in so long, looking dignified, so they all just applauded [claps] and they made so much noise, I just put my hand up so they would not make so much noise, and they just calmed down, just like that. Then they asked me to say a few words. They knew English and I spoke in English, and they interpreted it, and my statement was simply something like this, "To my fellow citizens of the world, I'm glad to be here and so happy to have this chance to see how you live and work, and I will tell my people about this when I return, and the Americans will be glad to know about how you're getting along." Now that was a political speech. [laughter]ï»¿40 MT: That was innocuous. FPK: That was a political speech! And so when I was ready to leave, and I had the Afrikaaners with me, of course, I couldn't go anywhere without them. The American consulate traveled, rode around in their car, but they always followed us when they saw that it was a white man with a woman of color, and when they saw the American tag, they then turned back. But they could have put me in prison. At any rate, when I got ready to leave South Africa, and I had behaved myself very well! I would go up the main entrance to the embassy, it was on the fifth floor of this tall building, and they never would bother me when I was with the American embassy folk, but you let me go out by myself, and then they'd say, "Would you use the back door?" I said, "I don't think I need to use the back door." But I knew the Americans would be coming down in a few minutes, so here were some Americans, and I'd go upstairs with the Americans. I never reported I was having this difficulty, until I was ready to leave, because I didn't want to make a nuisance of myself. But when I got ready to leave South Africa, they said, "Miss Kittrell, you are a great lady, we recognize you were having these problems and we certainly thank you for your discipline." And then he said, "Would you like to make a statement to the people before they leave? They have a present for you..."âthis is my escort, my American escort from the embassy. And I said, "Well, yes, I'd be very pleased to say goodbye to them." And they said, "Well, they think you're wonderful, but you have puzzled them because they now know that you are so against their form of government." And I said, "Well, who wouldn't be?" And I was calm and quiet. And, so when I was ready to leave, these Afrikaaners who were the escorts for me, gave me a gift, a beautiful gift, and they said, "We want to thank you for coming to our country. We have enjoyed your presence among us and we hope you have enjoyed yourself." And then, Merze, I had to speak up and I said, "Well, gentlemen, thank you very much for your courtesy in presenting me this gift, but you know I have never been so unhappy as I am now,to think that you think I enjoyed my stay in South Africa." And I left. And so the American embassy was very pleased in the way I behaved, and what I said. Because what I said, I had to say it, I just couldn't whitewash that. But it was serious. MT: Now what year or years... FPK: All of that's in my vita someplace, so when you get my vita you'll find it. MT: But about when was it? FPK: It was about... MT: Was it in the sixties? FPK: The late sixties, moving into the seventies. MT: Yes.ï»¿41 FPK: MT: FPK: MT: FPK: MT: FPK: -MT; FPK: MT: FPK: MT: FPK: MT: FPK: MT: FPK: MT: FPK: MT: FPK: That was my last big trip out there under the USIS. Yes. Well, your experience, of course, was quite different from mine, and I'll not go into mine, since this is your interview, but I... You had a diplomatic visa, didn't you? No, I had a regular visa, I got it in one day. I didn't have to show them a roundtrip ticket, and I was treated as an honorary South African. Well, who invited you, Merze? I invited myself through the embassy.. Actually, the Information Department of the Republic of South Africa invited me to be their guest. Right. Because I had been pestering them for two and a half years for information, and they gave me a wealth of it and sent to Africa for more, and I was in touch... This is the South African embassy? Here, in Washington. Right. And two or three gentlemen down there knew me very well, and I got my visa in one day. Well, may I say that you are a fortunate international lady! Because you see, your reputation was such that you had done a terrific amount of research yourself, but they did not know me. But the point that I am making here is, I reacted to the normal situation. And then you were there representing a church group that is not... No, no, no, it was not a church group then... No, you were USIS. But they couldn't very well reject you as an official from the United States government. But they were wondering maybe what you were looking for. Exactly. You're right about that. And they see the church as a threat to them anyway. Oh, yes. I was a threat. You were an academic scholar; I was a threat to them in human relations.ï»¿42 MT: And what I wanted to see, the two great harbors that were opened only ...one opened the day I arrived, and the other had opened Aoril first. FPK: That was a specific purpose, too. MT: Yes, but they showed me everything in between. FPK: They didn't show you where the people lived, did they? MT: No, no, no. FPK: See, mine was a sociological problem. MT: Yes. FPK: And they would react to that sociological problem. MT: But I was free on my free period to go anywhere I wish, but most of the time was taken in a program that they had set up for me with university professors in between these projects. FPK: Right. And you see, a university professor is a very fortunate person to be, because the university professor is free. MT: And many of them have studied in the United States. FPK: No question about it, no question about it. You were in an entirely different situation. Mine was going over for inquisitive purposes, you were going over as an invited guest. MT: And it was the Information Department. FPK: Exactly. MT: And of course I was met by Information [Department] officers and I was under their guidance every hour, practically, of the day. FPK: When you are an extraordinary scholar, people don't care what color you are, but when you're coming over as the person working for the general good or looking for humanity or what have you, they question that more than they would a scholar. Not that I wasn't a scholar, but my objective was a little different. MT: Yes, oh yes. I know from others who've gone for the USIS, even this past summer, a person at Howard in city planning, and also someone from the YWCA, and she stayed in the same hotel. I was in the Carleton in Johannesburg. But she said the black maids, when they saw herâ and she was definitely black, she was a black American, not brown as we areâthey were curious, and they gathered around her to learn. They wanted to know how could a black person in America get up, and â make it. They were curious. FPK: This is what makes America a great country. MT: How could she rise to that position and stay in the Carleton Hotel and so on.ï»¿43 FPK: Well, Merze, talking about that, I stayed in the ambassador's home. MT: Well, you were well taken care of. FPK: But the ambassador was sensitive to the fact that he wanted the Africans to know how we treat the minorities and so forth in this country. So he kept his maid and his butler and the yardman and one other person in his home that night until I arrived, and then we had dinner together, all of us, buffet dinner. Now you imagine, with the American ambassador, these people [sighs], they cried, they were so overjoyed. And then they asked me to tell them about my life in America, and so the ambassador was very pleased with that. So then after dinner we all had a general meeting. MT: Do you know the official United States embassy people in South Africa, not in the other countries, hands off, not a single one ever got in touch with me. They wouldn't interfere with anything the Informat ion Department..â¢'cause they have a set up program. FPK: On the other hand... MT: They knew I was coming, but they didn't do one thing. FPK: Well, in a way that was bad but on the other hand, they may have been very pleased that the South Africans themselves were doing this. MT: Yes. FPK: And so that was a compliment. MT: And it was the first and only... FPK: Yes, that was a compliment to you. MT: And some of the... FPK: Merze, now, who is interviewing you? MT: Theresa Danley. FPK: Oh, that's good. MT: But I don't want to go into that. I like to compare notes from different people who are in the same situation. FPK: Well, we are exactly opposite, aren't we? I mean, almost opposite experiences? MT: But you were under a different aegis. You were under the aegis of USIS. FPK: That's right. MT: You see. Now I was in some countries where the officials of the USIS had me in their home as a paying guest, rather than my having to stay in hotels. Both in '73â'74 when I was out, and again in...ï»¿44 FPK: I'm very proud that you did this, and I want to read about you because this is very important. I didn't know this. MT: Now in Salisbury, in '73, December, I was the guest of the Foreign Affairs Department. We have no embassy there. FPK: But we have a consulate, though. MT: We had none there at that time. Well now, I can't even go to Rhodesia, it's prohibited; any travel agent who would sell me a ticket would be in for a $50,000 fine and six months in jail and so on. FPK: Because they think the propaganda would be... MT: It's under United Nations regulations and the United States, no contact with Rhodesia. But in '73, I was there in December; I think they were anxious that I wouldn't be in trouble when they heard I was coming through the Rhodesian Information Office here. They cabled, they wanted me as their guest, so they met me at the airport. I was with them every minute until I was put back on the plane, and they went through an interracial dinner and all that. FPK: They went through the customs for you and everything? MT: Yes. It was a very...I think they did it, perhaps from the depths of their heart, but I also think they did it to protect me. FPK: No question about it, and also to keep confusion down that might have arisen. MT: If I had been trying to see these things on my own, there would be no way for me to have seen what I saw in South Africa. Because the South Africans can't see it. They come up to these harbors and beg to get in, and they're turned away at the gates. Because they say, "We haven't finished, and we don't have time for tours." I couldn't have seen it without having been the guest of the government. FPK: Well, you were the guest of the government. MT: Well, I probably wouldn't ever have been able to get there. FPK: Well, I told them that this was the saddest day of my life, when they asked me had I enjoyed myself, and I said, "Well, I'm sorry to say, this is the saddest day of my life, but thank you for your courtesy." That was the most moving thing that's ever happened to me in South Africa. But you know, as I look back over my trips in Africa, I was very fortunate not to have gotten into more trouble, and particularly I was fortunate that I had read the history of the country and knew exactly what to expect. MT: Quite. FPK: And what not to expect. MT: And you were in Uganda before the present president?ï»¿45 FPK: Yes indeed. Yes indeed. MT: And got out. And got out! FPK: Let me say this about that, for the record... MT: It's a beautiful country. FPK: Not only is it beautiful country, Dr. Tate, the people have made the furthest advances in education of any country in Africa, on the intercollegiate level. Women had very prominent roles to play, and they had good professorships for them. Although they had their education divided in the public schools for whites and blacks and so forth, Indians, but when it came to the university, it was first class and open to all who qualified. I spent two days there with some of the professors, and I found the university most desirable and beautiful, The fine arts department was one of the best I'd seen in any African country, and to think that you've got the present government, and I don't see how the United Nations, in cooperation with other countries, can have it continue like that. MT: Well, what can they do? You see, black Africa, though they know what's happening in Uganda and certainly would not approve of it, but they would not want any white organization to interfere in African affairs. FPK: But why can't they do something? MT: How can they! I mean, with...ï»¿FLEMMIE KITTRELL..
