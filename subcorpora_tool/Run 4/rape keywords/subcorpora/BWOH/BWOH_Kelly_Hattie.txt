 ï»¿ Mrs. Hattie Simmons Kelly: This is an interview with Mrs. Hattie Simmons Kelly, retired Dean of Women and educator of Tuskegee Institute. Mrs. Kelly's service at Tuskegee has spanned the years from 1924 to 1962. This interview is being conducted on Sunday, September 5, 1976, at Mrs. Kelly's home on Chambliss Street, Tuskegee Institute, Alabama. The interviewer is A. Lillian Thompson. Mrs. Kelly, I would like to begin the interview with you this evening by having you reconstruct, to the extent you can, the family tree as it might have existed at the time that you were born. For example, beginning with your father's side of the family, how much did you know about grandparents or great-grandparents, what did you hear him say about them, if you never met them? Mrs. Thompson, I'd like to make a statement that would perhaps clarify anything I have to say. First of all, I'd like to dedicate whatever I have to say to those who feel that the Kingdom of God is within them. Secondly, I would like to make an acknowledgement. I am sure that I will not be able to separate memory and imagination. In thinking of my early childhood, I know when I was born because it was recorded that I was born on March 9, 1896, in Charlotte, North Carolina. In the meantime, when I think back, I can think of nothing of myself as a baby other than the fact that I knew that my father was a minister and we lived on Ment Street; that he was pastor of an A.M.E. Zion church on Ment Street inï»¿2 HSK: (cont) Charlotte, North Carolina. It seems to me, I can recall that when we were getting ready to leave Charlotte, that my mother allowed me to spend some times with my godmother. She had told me that my name was Hattie Flora Etta Elizabeth Eliza Simmons and that one of those names, I do not know which, was the first name of my godmother, Mrs. Rivers. Mr. and Mrs. Rivers were considered by me to be very wealthy people. Although, at that time I had three sisters and a brother, I lived with the Rivers as an only child. I remember that I had a room alone. I had every comfort that perhaps would be given any child. I remember that Mr. Rivers was a barber and that often Mother Rivers would dress me and he'd take me to the barber shop and he'd sit me on the table and I would sing for the men who came to the barber shop. I don't know how long I remained with Mrs. Rivers, but I know that we visited in Statesville, North Carolina, after my mother and father and my sisters and brothers had moved there. And I made this statement to my mother, a statement that I was sorry about. I said to Mother Rivers, "This lady's children bother me." ALT: Whose children did you mean? HSK: My own mother's children, my sisters and brothers. I said to my mother, "This lady's children bother me," and my mother did not let me return to Charlotte with Mother Rivers. From then on, I lived in Statesville, but I can't remember much about Statesville. I remember that there were apple trees, just any number of apple trees. I remember that my sister Alberta and my brother Sydney sold apples and we thought that was just the finest thing ever. In speaking of my brothers and sisters, I think I came to realize when we went to Statesville that my sister Alberta Lillian was the oldest sister. My sister Rowena Allegra was the next oldest. My brother Sydney was the next and I was the next child. My other sister was born later in Statesville. I remember one interesting thing there, we had a horse that said his prayers. My father would go out and just touch the horse on his front legs and he would kneel and say his prayers. And when we in our home had prayer, morning, noon, and night, my mind was always on that horse and wondering what the horse was thinking when he knelt to pray. I don't remember anything else about Statesville, but I remember when we moved to Fayetteville. ALT: Before you leave Statesville, did you know anything at all about grandparents? HSK: Not a thing. ALT: I see. HSK: Nothing, no. When we moved to Fayetteville ....ï»¿3 ALT: This was about what year? I don't think you said the year that you were born^ HSK: I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1896. ALT: Yes. And you were the fourth child in the family? HSK: Yes, that's right. And there were two who were younger than I. ALT: Two younger and three older. HSK: Yes. Two sisters and a brother older. ALT: Now, you said you lived with the Rivers family. Do you happen to know why you lived there away from the other children? HSK: I don't know. I think when my family - when they were all moving to Statesville - the way I heard my mother tell it, was that the people loved me so that this godmother wanted Mother to give me to her. She said no, but I'll let Hattie stay with you a while. And when she found that I had become so attached to Mother Rivers and that I hardly knew my brother and my sisters, she felt that that wasn't the best thing to do and she'd never let her children be separated again. ALT: Did you find it very difficult to get back into a sister relation- ship again? HSK: I don't recall that I did. ALT: Don't remember. HSK: Yes, that's blocked out. I don't recall that I did because as I see it now, shortly after we went to Statesville, we moved to Fayetteville. ALT: Now before we leave there again, what about your mother's people? Did you know anything? HSK: Not until ... ALT: Not until then. HSK: No, I don't remember anything about any of them till now. ALT: I see. HSK: All right. We moved to Fayetteville and a great big house in which my father and his first wife had lived. The first relatives I met, and the ones that seemed very near to me, were my father's first wife's sisters and cousins. They all looked like white people.ï»¿4 HSK: (cont) They were all very light. My father's first wife looked like a white woman, was very light, but we were very dark and yet, these sisters â they had funny names,they wouldn't let us call them "Aunt." There was Sister Fib and therewas Sister Jerd and there was Uncle Lewis and there was Cousin Lill. Those are the ones that you want to hear most about. Sister Jerd had a husband who was blind, Uncle Wesley. Uncle Wesley was blind, but he always wanted us to read for him and I remember how I read the Bible for Uncle Wesley and he explained the Bible to me. ALT: Now you were able to read the Bible at that time? HSK: Oh, yes. ALT: Where had you learned to read? HSK: I don't know. As I can recall, I'd always read and I don't know how old I was. ALT: Had you started your formal education at this time? Had you gone to school? HSK: No, no. I was a little girl. I must have been ... I had been in the first grade, but I must have been seven or eight years old when I read for Uncle Wesley, but I remember it very well, because he always explained the Bible. I don't know whether I did so much reading or whether he recited it, but I always sat with Uncle Wesley. And I mention that because I am a lover of the Bible. I love the Bible very much and I read it a lot and I have been trying to wonder why I love it so. ALT: To what extent do you think your father's being a minister influenced your religious beliefs? HSK: Now when we moved ... I was going to tell you about that just a little later on. Esther, my baby sister, was born in February and that was the first time that I remember my mother's mother. My mother's mother came home. We knew ... but I can't tell you my age. If Esther was born in 1904 and I was born in 1896, then you figure out how old I was. But at school, the children had told me to ask my mother if her stomach hurt. And I asked her and she said, no, it doesn't hurt. But I knew she was pregnant because they had talked about it at school. Grandmother came and on the night that Esther was born, my father and my grandmother got in a horse and buggy and took a suitcase and went some distance and came back and we were all downstairs. And when they came back, they were supposed to have brought Esther. Esther was not named Esther, she was named Booker T. My father and mother admired Booker T. Washington. We heard them talk about Booker T. Washington and they had thought this child perhaps wouldï»¿5 HSK: (cont) be a boy. It was six years between my sister Anne and my sister Esther. But my grandmother came and that was the first time I knew my grandmother, Sydney Covington. My brother was named for my grandmother. He was named Sydney for my grandmother and Britton for my father's father and I'll tell you about them 'cause I didn't learn about them right away. But, I can remember Grandmother at prayer. We had prayer three times a day. ALT: How'd you feel about that? HSK: I felt good about it then. ALT: You did? HSK: Oh,yes. We just enjoyed it 'cause we would kneel down and just die laughing. ALT: What did knowing that your grandmother was coming mean to the family? HSK: Well, that was great ... ALT: Was that a special occasion? HSK: Well, that was great, that was great. Grandmother was just a great lady all right. ALT: And had you known her before this? HSK: No, no. ALT: Of her? HSK: I don't recall having known Grandmother before Esther was born. I don't recall her having come to these other cities. I don't recall much about Charlotte, I only remember being with my godmother, Statesville, I only remember the prayer meetings, the apples and the horse. In Fayetteville, Grandmother came and at the prayer meetings I remember this: my grandmother, she'd say, "Lord, help us to walk circumspectly before thee," and we'd just die laughing and it was years before I knew that there was a word, circum, circumsp ... (laughter) ALT: You thought your grandmother had made it up. HSK: We thought she had made an error. Then, my grandmother had a box, a tin box, and in that tin box was snuff. And she took a twig from a tree and she would chew the end of that little twig and twist that little twig around in that snuff and her teeth were beautiful, beautiful. That snuff looked so good. So one day when she was out, I slipped in, I got that snuff box, I got me a little stick and I put some of the snuff in my mouth and it made me sick. I neverï»¿6 HSK: (cont) wanted any more snuff or tobacco or anything like that since that time. But I knew Grandmother because she came to see us when Booker T. was born. ALT: What about your grandfather? HSK: I don't know Grandfather yet. I'll tell you when we visited him. We moved from Wilmington Road out of the home that my father's first wife lived in so far as I know ... ALT: Why were you moving, you had mentioned several times while you were quite young that the family had moved? HSK: My father was a presiding elder. I don't remember him as a minister. He was a minister of a church in Charlotte,but all I know is that he was pastor of that church. But in these days, he was a presiding elder of the church. He traveled all around and he said he would not take his family around. He owned a lot of property in Fayette-ville when he married my mama. And so ... ALT: Do you know how your parents happened to meet? HSK: Yes. My mother was a little girl; as quite a young girl at one of the church meetings he saw her and he fell in love. His wife was dead. Grandmother didn't want Mama to marry him because he was so much older than Mother - about twenty some years older or maybe more. And then he had a daughter that was just about three years younger than Mother, ... and so they met, and they married. Mama loved him very much and Grandmother, although she didn't approve of it, they married. ALT: I was wondering to what extent can you describe the relationship that you had with stepbrothers and sisters? Was it close? Or how would you describe it? HSK: My father by his first wife had seven children, five girls and two boys. We only knew Sister Mayme and Victor and an older sister whose name I can't recall just now â it will come to me. The older sister was married to a Doctor Mask and they lived in Wilmington and we just thought she was the greatest thing ever. We just worshipped the first wife's children. Sister Mayme wasn't married, but she had a big wedding shortly after. The youngest one was Victor. Mama always told this story about Victor. She said that Papa decided that he'd never marry anyone whom Victor did not love and as soon as Victor saw Mother, he said, "That's the one. I want her for my mother!," and so Papa married her. Victor was very close to us, and lived at home. I can't remember much about Sister Mayme because she married and went to Hamlet to live. I visited her there many times when Ruth, her oldest daughter, was a baby, I remember. But the relationship was very good. I don't rememberï»¿7 HSK: (cont) much of a difference. There were things I learned after I was grown, but when we were young we just all thought the world of them,especially Brother Victor. ALT: Did they also move along with the family as you moved from place to place? HSK: I don't remember. That's strange, isn't it? I don't remember Victor and Sister Mayme until we got to Fayetteville. ALT: Did you have playmates and friends at these different places, or do you remember at that stage what the community ties were? HSK: Oh yes, I remember them at Fayetteville. On Wilmington Road, in this great big house in which Dad had lived with his first wife, there were neighbors on both sides of us and all of them had children and we had lots of fun when I was young. ALT: What types of things would you do for fun? HSK: North Carolina is a tarheel state, they call it the Tarheel State. And I don't know how those boys made ... they had boxes and the tar was put in there and it would burn and they would run up and down the street with those tar wagons. That was one way that we'd play. And then we girls used to sit out at night and watch them. We enjoyed that. And of course, there were the ball games and all that and we'd always play in the fields. ALT: And your father was still active in the church at this time? HSK: My father was a presiding elder. We didn't see much of him because he was away from home. Presiding elders in the AME Zion Church traveled from church to church. They had charges. So we were left to Mother. He'd come home ... I remember one interesting thing before we moved from Wilmington Road. Mama had a man cleaning from under the house and he began to find money under the house. So Papa dismissed the man and he, Papa, started working and they never did find any more money under the house. ALT: Well, speaking of money, you haven't mentioned anything about the economic status of the family. How would you describe that? HSK: Well, as far as we knew â parents didn't discuss those things, we always felt that we just had plenty and everybody thought that. People always thought that about ministers and teachers too - and doctors' children. People always thought that they had plenty. And although, I don't think we were ever vain about it because at both houses, almost from the back of the house over to another street, we had ... not just a garden, almost a farm. There was always squash, there was always corn and lots of things. And I remember how Mother used to go down to gather the corn but she would neverï»¿8 HSK: (cont) let us carry the corn. If we went down to help her, Mama would bring things like corn and squash and pumpkins up from the field herself. Whatever there was in money affairs, we didn't know. We knew we had lots of property and we knew Mother made all of our clothes â whether they fit or not, we had to wear them â but other than that, I don't remember anything other than we thought that we had plenty. Then, when we moved on Gillespie Street, the school was right next door. We knew that our father gave the land on which the school was built. There were two families, very interesting families. The Wilkersons lived on one side and Mrs. Wilkerson's sister, who we'd call Aunt Hettie, lived on the other side of us. But in front of us, up the street and all around were white people, and I said that because, this is not complimentary, but I don't ever recall having a question about where those white children went to school. They were going way downtown to school, but I was going next door. ALT: Were you aware of black/white at that time, of the differences? HSK: No, I don't think ... I don't know why we knew that those children were white. ALT: What did that do in terms of relationships ... did you play with them? HSK: Yes. Mother was Mother Simmons to everybody on that street, white and black, in Fayetteville for that matter. Those white children always came over with us and played. There were a lot of Wilkersons, there were a lot of McNeels, there were a lot of Willistons. We had more playmates on Gillespie Street than when we lived on Wilmington Road. Most of the Wilmington Road children were relatives of my father's first wife. There was one other relative - I have to go back to Wilmington Road, that's when we met Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam was my father's half brother. Uncle Sam had a store and because he had that store, we just thought that he was the richest man in the world. We'd go down to Uncle Sam's store and things were very cheap, but we'd buy things there. So I did know my father's brother then. I'll tell you about other members of the family as I came to know them. So Uncle Sam had children; I remember Pearl very well and we were all good friends. Pearl is the only one I can remember now of Uncle Sam's children. I remember more of Cousin Lill's children. Cousin Lill was my father's first wife's sister's daughter, and she had children that we loved very much and played with.ï»¿9 HSK: (cont) But on Gillespie Street, there were a few things that stayed with me. One was upstairs in that house, in my father's study. In this study, my father had a large Bible and he sat in a big chair that turned from side to side. The study was very small, but I had a stool at his feet and I used to sit on that stool and massage my father's feet. Sometimes, as he read the Bible, he would read aloud. And sometimes he would read portions of his sermons and I remember how I always enjoyed them and always felt that some of the interpretations my father gave, and some of the things that he said he was going to say when he preached, some of those things I think to a large extent, had to do with my loving the Bible. At this time, on Gillespie Street, I remember any number of things, but one thing I want to mention in particular. Sister Alberta and Sister Rowena, in the summertime, were working at a silk mill. Early in the morning, Mother would fix their lunch and they would go to the silk mill which was quite a distance away. In this silk mill, there were winders and weavers and quillers. Now, Sister Alberta was working in the office at that silk mill and when Sister Rowena came, she worked in the office. When I came along ... we never worked in the wintertime, but worked in the summertime when school was closed. Everybody knew that the Simmons girls were going to work in the silk mill. And they always wondered why we worked there. We never questioned it. We received an envelope either every week or every two weeks and I know that we brought those envelopes to my mother and never did we question her about the envelopes. In the meantime, must have been very early, must have been 1906 or 1905 or something, we saw our Sister Alberta getting ready to go to Oberlin Conservatory of Music (Ohio) and my father wasn't home. My mother and Sister Alberta were making clothes and writing letters and we knew that she was going to Oberlin Conservatory because prior to that time, she had played in just about every church in town. As we have heard her tell it in later years, when she played for the Episcopal Church, a Rev. Sothern meant more to her than her music teachers. My mother felt that pianoforte was just like reading, writing and arithmetic and every child of hers was required to study piano. My sister, Alberta, took music from my mother first and then she took music from teachers in other cities where we lived. Sister Alberta went to Oberlin Conservatory of Music and I don't remember how long she stayed, but Mama said that Papa wrote and said he was going with her and she was worried because she knew she didn't have enough money and he didn't have enough money for both of them to go. But he went to Oberlin Conservatory of Music with her and she stayed with a family, Sister Lena Barrier. Sister Lena was almost a hunchback with a very beautiful voice. She visited us often and we loved her very much.ï»¿10 HSK: (cont) When Sister Alberta came back home, she would sit at the piano and play. We didn't have radios and T.V.s, and we used to raise the window and run down the street to hear Sister Alberta sing and the neighbors would come to hear Sister Alberta play the piano. Sister Alberta had been to the Conservatory and was back. I remember one little song that Sister Alberta wrote and she never did like for me to sing it, but I, I don't think I'll ever forget it. And it went like this and she used to play it and sing it on the piano: (sung) Come dear let's make up, and let's don't quarrel any more, Let's be the sweetest friends As we were once before. Come let's make up. Let's sit together and chat For the sweetest kiss to a lover's lips (kissing sounds three times) Is the kiss right after a chat. And so we children sang that song, we sang it forever because we remember how she sang it to us. It wasn't long, however, before Sister Alberta was recommended by one of the trustees at Oberlin, who was also a trustee of Tuskegee Institute. This trustee recommended that Sister Alberta come to Snow Hill Institute, Snow Hill, Alabama,to teach. It had to be before 1911 because it was before I came to Tuskegee to school. Sister Alberta taught music at Snow Hill Institute. A Mr. Edwards was principal. Snow Hill was a branch school of Tuskegee Institute and one of the largest branch schools. Tuskegee helped Mr. Edwards to raise money for that school and we were very proud of Snow Hill Institute in Wilcox County. I ought to go to the other brothers and sisters, but I'll finish this. In 1911, I had finished the eighth grade and my sister had given recitals and knew about Tuskegee Institute. The director of the choir, Miss Jennie C. Lee, was very fond of Sister Alberta. She sang at Tuskegee Institute very often and came here often, and she wanted me to come to Tuskegee Institute. My mother wanted me to come also because she was fond of Booker T. Washington. And so, I came to Tuskegee. And if I did not spend the summer in Tuskegee, I would spend it in Snow Hill. My sister had met a Mr. Harry Siirims, who was an Agricultural Field Director for the State of Alabama, and they married and lived in Snow Hill. She continued teaching at Snow Hill Institute and we continued to visit her. I think I'll go on back to my other sisters and brothers and come back to Sister Alberta later. My sister Rowena and Sister Alberta finished State Normal School, Bayetteville, North Carolina, at home before they went away. Myï»¿11 HSK: (cont) sister Bert played piano around for many of the churches. We went to the churches with her although we were Methodists. I can recite now the collects that they recited in the Episcopal Church. I know the songs that they sang in the Episcopal Church because my sister played there, and when we were not at our own church, we would go with her. My sister Rowena went to an Episcopal school â St. Augustine's in Raleigh, North Carolina, and then she worked around in Warrington, North Carolina, and later married a Doctor Westbrooks and went to live in West Virginia. Beginning with Brother Sydney - we went to grade school and when we had finished eighth grade at home we went away. I have one little instance that I think contributed to my brother's ambition; he was so ambitious about his work and in attaining so many of the accomplishments that he did. Our grade school teachers were very, very strict, especially our principal, Professor Edward Evans. Every morning ... first of all, we had exercises outdoors, we jumped and we had exercises, we marched in for assembly. One morning in assembly, Professor Evans said, "S.B., what are the angels doing in heaven?" And my brother Sydney said, "I don't know, I've never been there." And the professor took him and whipped him and whipped him,right before all of us, he whipped him. S.B. walked out. All that day I cried because I knew my mother was going to bring him back. We never did see him come back. After school we went home and we said, "Mama, he didn't come back, did S.B. come home?" She said, "Yes, he came home, and he told me what it was and he will not be going back anyway." And so she sent him to Bricks Academy â it is out from Charlotte, North Carolina. I never visited there, but S.B. went to Bricks Academy and oh, I forgot to say that Professor Edward Evans not only whipped him, but told him he'd never amount to anything. S.B. said he gritted his teeth then and said that he would. ALT: What did you think about school at that time? HSK: I thought it was very good. ALT: Did you? HSK: Oh sure! Sure we were ... ALT: What was particularly significant to you about school? HSK: They were strict, all right. They were strict and we , ... in those days ... it was seventy years ago. You didn't doubt what your mother did, what your father did, what the principal did, and what the political people in our town, whoever they were,did. Everything they did was all right.ï»¿12 HSK: (Cont) So, in school, Professor Evans was very strict. I know I used to study all night. I was good in arithmetic. You would line up and teachers would ask you questions in geography as well as problems in arithmetic. We had mental arithmetic. If you missed one you had to hold out your hand and the teacher would whip you in your hand. I think that's why so many people have heard me say I don't believe in corporal punishment. But I was determined they would not whip me. When we'd go to bed, and my mother would put out the lights and think that we were asleep, I'd turn that light back on and memorize, memorize, memorize, memorize everything because I was determined I would not get whipped. And then we used to have ... you'd cut up and down. That is, if you were in a line, and a question was asked, if that person missed it, and you had it, you'd go up ahead of that person. We'd call that cutting up and down and the girls would always pull for me in arithmetic because I would cut up and down. I remember the men now, when I go back home, they tease me because they thought I was as good in arithmetic as they were. ALT: Did you feel a sense of competition between the boys and the girls? HSK: Oh yes ... ALT: Or was it equal? HSK: No, no. No, no. There was competition because they felt that boys would know the math, but the girls would not and some of the girls didn't try. They'd just have fun, but I'd always vie with the boys. Teachers were very strict and they would whip the children. If you missed anything, they'd whip you, if you were late ... you had to run and get to school on time, you couldn't be late. You had to sit in your seat, you couldn't be excused. S.B. went to Bricks Academy out from Charlotte, North Carolina, and after that he went to A. & T. College, in Greensboro, North Carolina *, and after A. & T. College, he went to the University of Illinois and graduated. I think he worked his way through the University of Illinois. You see, my father died in 1910. I still didn't know anybody but my father and my father's brother, Uncle Sam, and his children. Well, I'll bring in what I knew about my father a little bit later. We had lots of property. When Papa died, my mother was the administrator and all of us were given our property. My sister Mayme and Brother Victor sold theirs. Sister Alberta, Sister Rowena, Brother Sydney, Ann, Booker T. and I made our property over to our mother. Down where my property and Sister Alberta's was, a street was cut. If you visit Fayetteville, North Carolina, now, you'll see Simmons Avenue cut down that street. People built houses on the other side * North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College.ï»¿13 HSK: (cont) and paid for them with dimes and nickels and cabbage and so forth. So, I guess that's the way we were educated. There were some rent houses, but she could not have been getting very much. We never questioned that. Oh yes, we worked in the silk mill. ALT: Do you think it was unusual for a family the size of your own with your economic status to aspire to go to college? Was that unusual at that time? HSK: So far as I know. I can't remember any of the other girls having left there ... ALT: Did you accept going to college as routine, as just something that ... HSK: But you must remember, as far as I was concerned, I wasn't going to college, I was going from eighth grade to Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute. ALT: Oh. I see. HSK: You see? So many people don't realize that, but Tuskegee Institute was a normal school and I was coming here and I'll tell that when I get to me. ALT: Okay. HSK: But going off to school was unusual. I hadn't thought of it, but as I think back ... ALT: Did your mother go to college? What was her educational level? HSK: Mama went to Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we used to tell her Shaw University must have gone to the third or fourth grade. She said that's all right, I went to college. I'm sure Grandmother told me that her father sent her. Sister Ann says that that is not true. ALT: Now, you haven't talked about her father yet, so ... HSK: No, well, we'll go on back to the children â where we went to school. I guess that's the best place, then we'll have to come back. S.B. went to the University of Illinois and then I was the next*one! I finished the eighth grade at home and came to Tuskegee. Ann finished the eighth grade at Fayetteville Elementary School and went to Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia. Esther finished the eighth grade and came to Tuskegee. She finished business at Tuskegee Institute. ALT: Could you have gone to school in Fayetteville? There were other schools that you could have attended?ï»¿14 HSK: Oh yes. Yes. My oldest sister, Alberta, and Sister Rowena finished Teachers Normal at Fayetteville, but it was a distance out (from the city). They used to walk out to that school â way out to Teachers College. When we came along, for some reason, I don't know why, Mother wanted us to go off, but we could have walked out there too, but we didn't. The rest of us, from S.B. down, went off to school before we finished high school. But Bert and Rowena finished high school at home in Teachers College, so did my sister Mayme, so did Victor, his first wife's children. So, that's where we went to school and we were sent away by our mother. ALT: Could I interrupt just a moment before we get to your part of the education? Describe the house. There were so many of you, what was the living arrangement like? You mentioned, I think, that there was a study, what was the rest of the house like? HSK: Well, all right. 1 remember there were not more than two of us in a room. ALT: Was it a very large house? HSK: Very large. Two of us in one room. It seems to me that Bert and Rowena were in another room. You must remember that by the time I could remember, Bert was away and then later Rowena was away. When we were very small children, on Wilmington Road, the house was^ large. I don't remember ever having lived in a small house. I don't remember having been crowded unless some children were visiting or something like that â we were having fun. Even when my brother Victor lived at home, he had his own room. I remember we went up the stairway and that first room was Brother Victor's room, we knew that and he was alone in that room. We also had a study. When we first moved to Gillespie Street, we had an outdoor toilet, remember that. You know theyalw^s called it the "garden house." The house that' was out in the garden was the outdoor toilet. I remember when an indoor toilet was put into the big house. I remember we always had two dining rooms. ALT: Why? HSK: Well, I don't know, I think it musthave been a custom. We ate breakfast in the dining room and when my father was there we ate in the big dining room. It was just back of the living room, big folding doors there back of the living room. When we were children, I noticed across the steet, those white girls were having boyfriends. We couldn't have boyfriends. ALT: How did you know you couldn't? HSK: 'Cause my mother wouldn't allow us. We weren't allowed to have boyfriends. On Sundays, when we'd come home from church ... weï»¿15 HSK: (cont) went to Sunday School early in the morning and stayed in church and we'd come home and we'd have dinner. And in the afternoons, we all had to gather around in the living room and read a book called The Devil Today . That book - we'd read that book until I could see the Devil coming with his pitchfork after me. ALT: Why did you have to read that book? HSK: Being good. We had to be good. It was like reading the Bible. ALT: I see. HSK: We were reading about the Devil, the book was The Devil Today and told all about the sins ... the Devil would get you. We just knew the Devil would get us if we weren't very careful. We had to sit and read that book, The Devil Today. After Sister Rowena had gone; she was living in West Virginia, then a Cousin Augusta Sides and her two children came. Her husband died and she came to live with us. And Lillie Bell and I were about the same age. We were in the eighth grade. I had a boyfriend and she had one. So one boyfriend's father had ... I don't know how he had so many horses and surreys, people rode in surreys. You know, a hack, a surrey was a two-seated buggy, sometimes three-seated. Well, these two boys were coming to take us for a ride one Sunday. And so, at school they had arranged and I was afraid to tell them I couldn't go and Lillie Bell always defied her mother. She said, "Well, I'm going, I'm going out for a ride." Now I remember that Sunday, the boys came early. We were at dinner, sitting in the dining room and we could see through the double rooms, through the living room out front when that hack drove up. And one boy got out and came to the door. Mama went to the door and he said, "I came for Hattie and Lillie Bell." She said, "You came for Hattie and Lillie Bell? They're not going anywhere." Lillie Bell said, "Yes, I am going." I sat still. But we didn't go and I always think about those boys were our boyfriends. I thought I wouldn't call their names because they have wives and children. They live in Fayetteville, North Carolina, now. But those were our boyfriends. By the way, I don't remember a time when I did not have a boyfriend. When I was in the first grade, I remember we had a lovely little teacher, Miss Kate Bain. Miss Kate Bain was kind of crippled, but she was the cutest little thing and very sweet and I think that, from her teaching, I learned more of what it meant to be kind to students in a school where the other teachers were whipping and going on. I had a little boyfriend. I started to call his name. We used to draw little circles out, draw a person, draw a little circle out from the mouth and write on there, "I love you" and pass that on. And then as I grew up, I still had boyfriends. Iï»¿16 HSK: (Cont) almost feel like calling their names. The reason I thought of it is because I was thinking of my grandmother. One Christmas, Grandmother came to visit us, and one boyfriend gave me a watch. Mother said, "I'm sorry, you'll have to give it back." And S.B. had a fit. He was two years older than I. He said, "No, you can't keep that watch." Grandmother said, "I'm very sorry, you can keep that watch." And I kept that watch and I'll always love my grandmother for it and I think that it has to do with my being a little lenient on boyfriends and girlfriends. ALT: Was the relationship then with your grandmother stronger than that with your own mother? HSK: No. It was different. ALT: What was the role of ... HSK: Grandmother never stayed at home more than two or three days, then she went back so we didn't know her too well. She was very strong. She was a stout, dark lady and very "This is it!" "That's it!" And my mother stepped back when Grandmother came. But somehow, there were no comparisons in my mind. We went to visit my grandmother very early. My mother took us to visit Grandmother. Grandmother lived in Rockingham, North Carolina, and we always thought she was very, very rich because we'd go out in the back yard and there were plums and apples ... peach trees; she had chickens all over the yard, she owned her own pigs â¢â¢ â¢ ALT: This was her own home? HSK: Oh yes. Her husband was named Patrick. Patrick Covington. My mother was Julia Covington and we met a number of Mama's brothers and sisters. All were grown when I met them. My first recollection of Rockingham, North Carolina, was after Mother's brothers and sisters were grown. They were all as dark as we were, but my mother was a more Indian type with long straight hair, very Indian type of a woman. I always wondered why Mama didn't favor her brothers and sisters. There were a lot of them, she had a lot of brothers and sisters. And so, one day, I asked Grandmother why Mama didn't favor Grandpa Patrick Covington and why she didn't favor her other brothers and sisters. I remember, Mama told us,"Hush, don't ask such questions." Grandmother said, "Yes, they do." Grandmother said, "Your mother's father is a white man. He was the son of my overseer in the family to whom I belonged." And she said that on the eve of or after the Emancipation, "Your mother was born in 1865." Grandmother said, "I was a house servant. I was never mistreated by the family. I was like a member of the family, but this young boy," she said, "he didn't rape me, but he took advantage of me and your mother was born to the slave master's son." And she said, "Later or., I married Patrick Covington and to Patrick Covington, all of these children were born." Then we always understood why Mother did not favor her brothers and sisters. And they loved her.ï»¿17 HSK: (cont) Later on, Mother told us that she had had to help rear all those brothers and sisters and that she worked very hard. Mama was glad to get married and to leave home. But, Grandmother, with the chickens out of the yard ... I remember I'd just get the chicken and somebody would hold the head and cut off the head and get some hot water and get the feathers off of them, we had lots of chicken and a lot of cornbread and, ohhhh, it was something! And the beds were so high, we had to stand on a stool, sometimes we'd get a chair, big old cotton beds, way up so high, you'd have to get something to get up in them. We had the best time falling out of those beds. And the beds had big old wooden backs way up. And when Grandmother and Mother would disappear, we'd play falling over the back of the beds. And one time, we split one of those beds. We (laughter) covered it up till we left. And Grandma never fussed, she never did find out that we did it. We were jumping off the back of the bed and we split it. ALT: I understood you to say that your father died in 1910 or thereabouts? HSK: That's right. ALT: What impact did that have on the family? HSK: Well, I thought it was the end of everything. ALT: You remember ... HSK: Oh sure. I was getting ready to go to Tuskegee Institute. Alberta was in Snow Hill, Alabama. And Sister Alberta had, here s something beautiful ... she had sent Papa a beautiful suit and shoes. Papa was running for the Bishopric - she may have sent it the year before he died - he was up and around and was running for the Bishopric and there was a Bishop at home, I don't want to call names; but the Bishop at home had encouraged my father to run for the Bishopric and then as we were told in later years by my mother, we didn t know it then, but later Mother said that this Bishop, who lived in Fayette-ville, had turned and didn't vote for him and that broke his heart. Well, then he was running for the Bishopric and going to the conference. Bert sent him, I remember this suit, fine suit with a fastening collar to the back and sent him shoes and he went to that conference. He never went back to the AME Zion Conference any more. ALT: other than his influence on your life through religion, how else did he influence your life? HSK: All right. My father was a very strict man, very, very strict. My mother never worked outside of the home, I mean she worked in the garden. When we woke up early in the morning, she was coming out of the garden way down in the field and worked hard at home, but when ministers would come, my father would always have a lady comeï»¿18 HSK: (cont) in and help Mother. I remember when they used to make beaten biscuits. We were always glad when he was going to bring somebody. And when he went to Wilmington, he'd always come back with a lot of fish, fresh fish. When I came to Tuskegee Institute and they served fish, I thought the fish was rotten. It didn't taste right and I didn't know that there was a difference, but my father brought fish. He brought watermelons. Now this is the only way I can tell you about my relationship with my father. He brought watermelons that big. Every night before we would go to bed, we would gather in Mother's and Father's room and I remember when he'd have watermelons, we would cut the watermelon half in two, And he and Mother would eat out of one half. I imagine there was always about four of us, then. He'd give us ... divide the other half; I made up my mind that if I ever worked with any children,I'd give them an equal part ... (laughter) of the watermelon. I never could understand how my father and mother could have a half of a watermelon and then four of us have a little piece. And then he'd bring fruit home and that was, oh that was really something. But Mother would take an orange, cut it in half and give us all a section. And I said, goodness. And if you have ever noticed with fruit, I leave it all out and I tell everybody, "Help yourself!" And I think that it started with that. My father would whip my brothers and he whipped my sister Rowena. My brother, we had what we call a country place. But we lived right in town. Our home was right on Gillespie Street. You come right down from the market, it was right in town. But my father, even though he was a minister, had cows and he had horses and he'd get in that wagon to go to the country place to get wood. My brother S.B. never wanted to go to the country place. He was ashamed; but I've seen my father whip my brother and make him get in that wagon and go to the country place with him. My sister Rowena, although in her late years, she was almost sanctified, she was a very worldly girl. She dressed beautifully. Now, we were not allowed to go to ball games. Rowena would slip off and go to ball games. And I remember once, Rowena came from a ball game and Mama and all of us were just afraid. Papa was waiting for her and he whipped her, and he whipped her. He whipped her, I can't tell you how he whipped her! ALT: Your mother could not have stopped that? HSK: No, she better not say anything. He whipped her, and you know what Rowena did? She looked at him and said, "I'm going again." (laughter) ALT: And then what happened?ï»¿19 HSK: He whipped her some more. But when that ball game was another time, she went to that ball game. ALT: Are you saying that no one in the family would confront your father or challenge ... HSK: Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! ALT: His was the absolute word when he was home. HSK: That's right. There were two times, two times, when Father attempted to whip me. But he didn't whip me much. When I was a kid, it snowed a lot at home and my father required us to go to the side door and not come in the front door. Or go around to the back door, I made up my mind, I wasn't going to no back door. When Mama was there ... I didn't go to the back door. But there was a side door and when it was very bad, you'd go around the porch to the side door. There was a machine right in front of that window. Before I went to school, I fixed that window so I could open it. And one day when it was very cold and snowing, just as I got in the window, stood up on the machine, I looked up and my father was coming down the stairway. "I thought I told you not to come in this side door or the front door. Go around to the back door." And he whipped me, but I don't think it hurt me much, I can't recall. But he did. He was very strict and I think we respected it. You see, the standards were different. We respected the fact that our father was very strict and Mother was very quiet and calm, never said anything because you couldn't say anything back to him. You listened to my father. But the thing I am trying to do is give you my feelings then, and perhaps a little later on, as a grown person, I will tell you. About the time I was in eighth grade, I learned about my father's people. We knew Uncle Sam, who was a half brother and was lighter than my father, so we knew he was a half brother. But he was married to one sister and my father was married to another sister, his first wife. We began then to talk about the family and we learned that my father's father was a slave and was named Britton. Sydney got the Sydney from my mother's mother who was named Sydney Covington. But Sydney, S.B., was named Sydney Britton Simmons. The Britton was my father. My father's father was a slave. My father's mother was a free woman, came from the North. Her name was Drucilla Simmons. And so my father didn't want the slave name and he dropped his slave name and called himself Simmons. You don't hear of many white Simmonses. Many blacks did that after slavery. They dropped the slave name and took some other name that they thought ... I don't know about this name, but I do know that that's what they say, he took the name of Simmons. I don't know any further back than that. I just heard about my father and his brother, that my father's mother was a free woman andï»¿20 HSK: (cont) lived almost in the same county. I don't know how she happened to come South. I don't remember that, but she was born above the Mason-Dixon Line and was free. My father, before he was a preacher, I understand that he was a policeman in the town of Fayetteville, North Carolina, a deputy, a sheriff, had a very high office as a policeman. But he decided he was going to be a preacher so far as we know, he later was this preacher. My mother's brothers and sisters visited us often and we knew their children. We knew them very well, but we became acquainted with them after we were grown and some of us had been off to college and had returned. I think that in grade-school, there were many things that impressed us, and one was our church. All of us were required, on Sunday mornings, to get up early. You had to have your grits and gravy (because we had the grits and gravy for breakfast.) Grits almost every morning, and rolls which my mother made and the chicken and other meat we had at no0fl. But you had to get up, had to get dressed in a hurry. We all had to go to Sunday School in the morning and we stayed for church. On the second pew, the second seat of the church was the Simmons' pew and we all filled that, filled that pew and listened to the minister. We grew to love the Evans Metropolitan AME Church very much. When I was getting ready to come to Tuskegee Institute, I asked the people to pray for me. My cousin Lillie Bell said, "'Why did you do that? You should have been ashamed to get up and ask those people to pray for you." Lillie Bell stayed at Tuskegee Institute one year and she became disgusted and did not return for some reason. I attributed a good bit of the strength that I had, to go on through with school away from home, to the fact that we were brought up in that church. I remember when we little ones got religion. They would have revival in the night time for grown people. My mother and some of the other ladies had revivals in the afternoons for children. And we would run to the church. The sisters in charge would call us all up to the front seat and they would tell us we were sinners ... that we had sinned and that we had to get religion. I don't remember any more that they'd tell us, but we wanted to get religion. Everybody wanted to get religion. So you had to kneel down with your head toward the seat and they would pray and pass over you until you thought that you had religion. And when you thought you had religion,you would get up and say, "I have religion," and they'd say, "Well, you're not going to sin anymore?" "No," "You're going to try not to sin anymore," and everything you were doing that was a sin, you'd have to do away with. ALT: Did you understand what was ...ï»¿21 HSK: Uh uh. I couldn't think of anything that I was doing that was a sin but playing marbles. We used to make big circles, I don't see the children playing marbles like we did. We had beautiful marbles. I think the marble you shot with was a toy, and you'd shoot a marble and if you shot it out of the circle, you'd win the other people's marbles. I could always win marbles. The day I got religion, I went home and I took my marbles way down back and threw them away and all the children ran down there and got them. But I never played marbles anymore after that. There was one thing that disturbed me. We all went to funerals. Parents would take their whole families to funerals. And the preacher always preached up to heaven and down to hell. So one day, I asked my mother, I said, "Mama, when is somebody going to heaven?" She asked me what I meant. I said, "Well, the pall bearers put everybody down to hell." I thought when they put them in the grave, they put them down in hell and I always longed to see them take a ladder to take somebody up to heaven. All of these things that I am telling now had quite a lot to do with how I talked to children about religion, heaven, and hell ... When I work with little children, I look at them and wonder what in the world they were thinking because I never understood anything the preacher was saying other than I knew I loved to go to church. Even now one of my favorite songs is I Love Thy Church 0 God and I don't think I would miss church unless I just could not move. I don't think I've ever missed going to church. So getting religion was an experience for young children at that time. ALT: Did children have an active role in the church other than just attending? HSK: I can't recall anything but our going to Sunday School and going to the Christian Endeavor and I think you were in those groups and you talked. But I don't think of anything other than that. ALT: Do you think being the children of a minister created any peer group pressure of significance because you were different than the children whose fathers were not ministers? HSK: I think so, and some children lived like that, but my mother and her children did not live like that. I remember I had one friend, I was just about to call her name. She was supposed to be a bad girl. And people criticized my mother because that girl always came to our house. Mama welcomed her to our house. And my mother went all over town, as long as I can remember, she was all over town having prayer meetings. In 1918, they started a prayer meeting in Fayetteville and Mother was one of the original ones to start it. And I can recall every timeï»¿22 HSK: (cont) I go back home, we go to that prayer meeting, we'd walk with her. She'd walk over to that prayer meeting. You remember, I told you that we all worked in the silk mill. There were some of my friends, I think, that were different, but not my family. Then, besides having the prayer meetings, Mama had meetings for the children and other activities. The only activity I can think of was candy pulling. We made candy and we would pull it until it was white and then we'd twist it. We would vie with each other to see who could make the prettiest candy. So she made no difference. Any children could come to our house. In addition to that, when my sister Alberta, I don't know whether it was after she came back from Oberlin Conservatory or when it was, or whether it was when she was there in the summer, but she had what we called a Coleridge Club. ALT: Your sister did this? Your sister, Alberta? HSK: Yes, she was the musician in the family. She had a Coleridge Club and any children who wanted to could join that club. So at that particular time, we knew of children who were friends of ours who were ... a bishop's children, children of a pharmacist who lived right down the street. Their children came to see us, but I don't recall that their parents were interested in missionary work. So because Mother was a missionary, people were coming to our house all of the time, bringing milk, butter and things of that sort. ALT: So, are you saying that because of other people's interest, the economic status of the family was not necessarily changed when your father died? HSK: No, no. ALT: How was your mother able to maintain ...? HSK: I don't know. We were never told the difference. Mother never discussed and ... ALT: And she never went out to work? HSK: No, not at all. She worked when she came to Selma University, Selma, Alabama. This is interesting, I hadn't thought of that. But that was evidently while I was in school at Tuskegee - I think too, the fact that we worked in the silk mill, I don't recall any other girls on our street having worked in the silk mill. Mama was like that, and then Mother never talked to us. I don't recall Mother ever sitting down and telling us about business, I never heard anything about hard times. The only thing I can say, yes, there was plenty. My sister Rowena was the only one who defied Mama. I remember Mama sewed ... Rowena was very proud ... I remember oneï»¿23 HSK: (cont) particular incident. Rowena says, "I'm not going to wear it'' Mama says, "Yes, you will." Rowena said, "It doesn't fit me, I am not going to wear it." Mama pulled that dress around and we were trying to hunch Rowena. She didn't wear that dress. She wouldn't wear it. She was the only one, the rest of us would wear whatever was made for us. ALT: What were the other relationships within the family? Now, you've spoken of your sister, Bert, with a great deal of pride. What about your relationships with the others? HSK: Well, it was all different because ... ALT: All different. Could you describe ...? HSK^ Sister Rowena was a society sister and I don't remember much. You see, Bert taught us all music. I remember Bert would wake us up in the morning. As she'd come, pull your toes and say, "This little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed home, this little piggy had roast beef and this little piggy had none," and sprinkle water all over our feet and make us get up. And I think Rowena and Ann and I were more together like playmates. But I fell in a different category from the rest of them. For instance, Mother never allowed us to make noise at night but her room was downstairs and there was a porch upstairs to our room. One night, we were laughing, laughing and I was telling jokes. Mama hollered up there, "Annie, Annie, you stop that noise." Ann tried to tell her that it was me. She wouldn't believe it. "No it's not, No it's not." The children called me Missy. My nickname was Miss Hattie. I was always a little lady, which I did not like, but there was nothing I could do about it. ALT: You did not like being thought of as a lady? HSK: No! I wanted to be a girl like the other girls, but they thought of me, and I guess it was because I was always afraid. I didn't do the right thing because it was right,I did it because I was afraid. ALT: And yet you were competitive from what you have said, in terms of .. if the boys could do it, you could. HSK: Yes. ALT: But shooting marbles usually is considered a boy's game and yet you played, and played well. HSK: That must have been an exception because all of us played marbles, but there were extreme things that girls did in those days. They ran away from home, they wouldn't go straight home from school -and I have reference to those things. But if we went straight homeï»¿24 HSK: (cont) we had a lot of fun. For instance, I remember once, I had Sister Ann in the baby carriage. Evidently, it was Esther's baby carriage. We used to have big tall baby carriages. Mama had told us not to play with that baby carriage, but I put Ann in the baby carriage. I was running around the house with Ann in the carriage. We were having fun. Right around in front of the door the carriage turned over and Ann fell out. Mama told us us to get some switches and come in. We went down to the dog fennel. You don't know what dog fennel is? A dog fennel is brittle, it is long, but it will break kind of soon. Mama whipped us with that dog fennel and afterwards we teased her. We asked Mama if she didn't want to hurt us. She didn't mean for us to bother with that baby carriage any more. So I had a good time. ALT: Did you have chores to do? HSK: Oh yes. ALT: What was that like? HSK: My dear, there were wood stoves and coal stoves. There was wood to be brought in and we had to bring it in. There was coal to be brought in and we had to bring it in. There were ashes to be taken up everywhere. We had to take up those ashes where there were stoves. I think I can remember one fireplace inthe back dining room. There were stoves, big old stoves everywhere. But they had ashes, so you had to take up ashes and ashes; taking up ashes was something. Moreover, we had lamps and you had to clean the lamp chimneys. ALT: There was no electricity? HSK: There may have been, but I remember we had lamps. I don't remember when the electricity was put in that house, but I know we had to clean lamp chimneys and lamp chimneys would get pretty smoky. We also would grind the coffee. Mother would put the coffee in the stove and parch it and then there was a little mill on the wall, and she put that up there and we had to grind that. Our curtains had ruffles. Mama would wash and iron the curtains, but that ruffle had to go through a little machine, and we'd put it through and go like that and would make the prettiest little ruffle. You'd pu t the irons in the fireplace and then stick them into this machine and run the ruffle through there, so we had to do that. ALT: So you'd have to heat the iron in the fireplace? HSK: Yeah. Well, you see that iron right there, that isn't what I am talking about, however, but those were the smoothing irons. But this little machine, if I can describe it, you see, to put the ruffle on there, you had to iron it. All right, here's a little something here and there were two long things that went in here,ï»¿25 HSK: (cont)those things were heated in the fireplace and stuck in those holes and the ruffles ran through there. So you had to be careful and not let the other part of the ruffle go through there. ALT: HSK: Now, this iron that you just pointed to, is this an iron that's called a flat iron? HSK: That's a flat iron. ALT: And people used to put this in the fireplace to get hot? HSK: You'd put it in front of your fireplace and heat it and that's what you had to iron with. ALT: And that's what you had to iron your clothes with? HSK: Yes. That's what you ironed with. Your iron ... it irons clothes beautifully. ALT: Really? HSK: Yes. And you could clean the iron. We cleaned the iron, it seems to me with cedar, or we'd wax it if the iron got dirty. You'd clean the iron underneath with cedar or wax as I can recall. Oh,we had lots of work. We had to run home from school to do what we had to do before dark. We'd clean the lamp chimneys. And then, in the mornings, there was an outdoor garden house, you emptied the slop jars in the house. Every house had a washstand and on that washstand was a bowl, a pitcher with water in it and something for the soap, and you washed up , ... you had one of those in each room. You washed up in that and poured your water in the slop jar. We called them slop buckets, I reckon. Then at night, if you wanted to go to the toilet you used that slop bucket. So in the morning, you had to take those slop buckets way out in the field and empty them. And they were emptied, I believe, in the garden house stool, you emptied them in there and then you had to bring the slop jars back in and wash them. And you had to do all that before you went to school. ALT: Oh really? Yes. You got up in the morning and you had to empty all those things. ALT: And would you have breakfast before you went to school? HSK: oh yes. My mother was very formal with breakfast and lunch. You didn't have to take lunch to school, but we took lunch when we went to the mill. We'd come home for lunch, we lived right next door to the school, there was just one house between us. The dinner - my mother always had a big dinner. Always, we had a big dinner. We ate lots of vegetables, three or four vegetables, butï»¿26 HSK: (cont) I think of another story about Grandmother. My mother would never fix much meat. She was not a meat eater. She didn't believe in it, and I think it was because it was expensive. But Grandmother would visit with us and I remember once, Grandmother was at the table, we had three or four vegetables, we might have had squash, beans and stuff. Grandmother said, "Julie, Julie, this ain't no dinner, Honey, for your grandmother. You ain't got no meat!" So, we had lots of work to do and you couldn't go sit out front unless you did that work. ALT: Was sitting out front the high point of ... HSK: Yes, because all the children from down the street came to our house which was kind of the headquarters. Come to think about it, I don't remember playing in the McNeels' yard or the Wilkersons'. yard. Now the Wilkersons' I remember a little better because our marble rings were between the Wilkersons' and the Simmons' house. I was fixing to tell you about something else which is not so good, but we had a good time doing it. Over in a field, not so far from us was a cucumber patch and we used to sit on the steps and the boys would run over and steal cucumbers and we girls would have to furnish the salt and we'd eat those cucumbers and just have the best time. ALT: I thought of something, ... if using a flat iron and the other instrument that you used for the ruffles had to be heated on the fireplace, there was a possibility of getting burned or hurt in some way. If so, what was the treatment for that? HSK: Oh. Now, I don't know what most people used, and we didn't get burned often, but there were people who did get burned often and a most interesting thing. I am glad you asked that question, my mother could talk the fire from burns. I have seen people bring children and grown people to our house and she'd make us all be very quiet and wave her hand like that over the burn, we'd never hear her say anything. ALT: Now, what you have just described, to wave the hand, one hand over ... HSK: Wave her hand over wherever the burned place was. ALT: Her hand over the burned place. HSK: I don't recall any follow-up. ALT: And yet, you say she was talking the fire out, so she would do something as she moved her hands. HSK: She would move her lips, but we wouldn't hear what she was saying.ï»¿27 HSK: (cont) She said she talked the fire from the hand. I don't recall ever following through to see whether,- ... but everybody always said it felt all right when she got through. ALT: Do you know of anyone else who was able to do this? HSK: No. But my mother used to look at my hand. I have hands that look very much like my mother's. And she told me. She said, "Be careful how you touch people." She said, "You can talk fire out of people, you can ease people with your hands." But I have never had a desire to do it. I've never ... ALT: Do you think you understand what she was saying to you? HSK: No. No, I don't. Maybe as I get older I will, but I don't now, and I have seen burns and it never occurs to me that she said that. I don't do much hugging and kissing. You've been around me a long time. You haven't seen me ... I don't, I really don't. I don't know why, but I don't have a reason. As I grow older and people come to me for advice and so forth, I think perhaps, there's something to what she said. But for my childhood, I think that is sufficient. I belong to the Evans Metropolitan Church at home, but all of us played for all of the churches. I never played for an Episcopal Church. I played for a Congregational Church, a Presbyterian Church, a Baptist Church, and of course, our own Methodist Church and a sanctified church. The Holy Sanctified Church was on a street back of our house and Mama insisted that I go play for them. I never could play anything but songs that you had the music for because I studied music and could read it, but never had an ear for it. So many of the songs they sang at the sanctified church I didn't play for them, but for all the children's groups I played. And there are many songs that I know now because I played. So that was a part of all of our early ... the older ones of us that I knew particularly. Sister Alberta and I had to play for all the churches. Ann was always considered the one whowould help with the cooking and cleaning, although she took music just as we did. When Esther came along, she was the one to do nothing. Nothing was ever required of her as I can recall. That's the way I feel about it. ALT: Do you know why? How did you feel about that? HSK: Well, we always felt that Mama was partial to Esther because she was so hard on us about the way we fixed our hair, the way we dressed and what we wore. But when Esther came along, it didn't make any difference. Whatever she did, where she went, never would she let us reprimand Esther. All my other sisters did reprimand her,but I've never reprimanded Esther about anything. And for that reason,ï»¿28 HSK: (cont) she always,even now, felt that I understood her better than any of the other sisters. But they were trying to help her. ALT: Do you feel that any of your childhood experiences had a lasting influence on your life? And if so, which one, other than the parental influence? HSK: Sure. Sure. ALT: What institution for example would you say was very influential? HSK: I think, as I think back on it, the fact that we had to read the Bible made me feel that there are some things in the Bible that will always stay with me. I know that when you pray "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done ... " that means that Imusthelp bring the kingdom. To me they are not just words. "Thy will be done." As long as I can remember, I've been trying to find out, well, what is the will of God? Who interprets? And so, my mother made us understand that Jesus was the most perfect interpretation of God, and for that reason when I see Jesus and talk about Him, I don't see a white man, I just see love and kindness, doing the best you can and my mother would say certain things. She'd say to us, "Never pity yourself. Never pity yourself. Always be thankful." These are the things that saved me and I've never lost them. "Thankful," she said, "Thankful for the bad, thankful for the good. Always be thankful." We never saw her moan or worry. We never saw her say that there is not a plenty. I don't care how many came to our house, there's plenty for all. She always said that there's plenty. So I think that was really stamped upon us - had an indelible impression upon me. We read a whole lot, there were certain passages that she read so much, besides the Lord's Prayer which we all had to memorize. We read the blesseds in the Chapter of Matthew and I used to wonder about the meaning. "Blessed are the meek, Blessed are the pure of heart, Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness." So the Bible has had a great impression upon me. But for some reason or another, I have thought of it more in the spiritual context than most older people do. I don't think that anything was said to me that made me feel that a literal interpretation of the Bible was it. My mother always applied it to people and to things. Let me give you one example: there was a lady who lived around the street from us. She worked at some Jews' home right above us. And every time she'd come home, she'd bring a big platter of food and we were not accustomed to eating food with a whole lot of stuff in it. My mother cooked things plain. It was either greens, collard greens, or turnip greens, or string beans. But this lady brought us a mixture of stuff. Ohhh, and we thought that was for the pigs. And we usedï»¿29 HSK: (cont) to fuss with Mama. She said, "No, no. Any time anybody gives you something, appreciate it." We had to say, "Thank you very much." She said, "You don't have to say you won't eat it, you don't have to eat it. Thank you very much. And you must appreciate anybody who gives you anything ..." I think that was stamped indelibly upon me. Even this morning, a lady called me and said, "I have some apple tarts for you." I thought that she was going to give me about seven or eight apple tarts. When I went out there, I received a little bitty cup with some stewed apples in it and I thanked her so very very much. I think the things my mother did were stamped indelibly upon my life. I have other, other things that happened in my life that caused me to grow on those things, but I still feel that the kingdom to come is within you and I think that my mother's making us read the Bible was one thing that started me that way. I don't think it has left me. But there are other things in my life that were just as important and just as lasting. I think too, that the fact that, now ... I don't remember whether Mother went across the street or not, I never saw her. But we saw the people from across the street over at our house. ALT: And the people across the street were white? White people? HSK: White, yes, white people. Those white women used to come and talk. If they didn't call her "Mother Simmons," they called her "Miss Julia." Mama's name was "Miss Julia" ... I noticed whites call people by their first names: Miss Helen, Miss Anne, and Miss So-and-So. Well, Miss Julia, my mother, had the greatest respect for all people. So I think those things have a lot to do with the fact that, at eighty years old, I have a peace that just passes all understanding. And yet, I go through all the things that other people go through. I see, I'm not blind, I see. I read the paper, but nothing, those things don't ever seem to reach me inwardly. So, I think that had a lot to do with it. When I go into my working life, then I would like to mention some other things if you want me to go on with that. ALT: Okay. Well, just one other thing before we move on. You mentioned that you had one brother and you had several sisters. To the extent that you can recall, was there a difference in the treatment from your parents toward you or the other girls in the family and the boy in terms of what was expected of you? HsK: My brother was always like the father in the house because my father was away. And, although he was just two years older than I, he was the father in that house and we had to listen to my brother. We had to be very, very careful about our relationship with boys because my brother didn't approve of it. He was very hard on us, as our father was. My father was not as hard on the girls as he was on S.B. My mother ... I just can't see any difference. I don't evenï»¿30 HSK: (cont) remember S.B.'s working in the silk mill. Isn't that strange that I don't remember? ALT: Did he work at all or you don't ... HsK: He must have worked. I know what it is. He left home early. You see, he went to Bricks Academy. After he went to Bricks, you see, he must have been about seventh grade because he didn't finish school at home. He went on to finish grade school - the eighth grade -at Bricks Academy, so we didn't see much of him after we grew up. When S.B. was a little boy, he was supposed to have been a very pretty little boy. I don't remember so much about this, but he had long curls and he used to go to school with curls. I cannot remember that Mother and Dad were partial other than we always felt that my father was too hard on him. ALT: so, to put the question another way, there is nothing that you remember about the difference in treatment that would have caused you to say, "Well, gee, if I were a boy, this might be an advantage of some kind?" HSK-" I have never wished that I was different from what I was. But I have said if I had come into the world differently, if I had had different parents or something, maybe I would have done differently. I've always felt that I have done the best I could although I have done it with the understanding that I have watched other people and tried not to bend. All my life I have hoped - up until recent years - it seems my prayer has always been that people would love me. I saw so many people that people did not love. I tried,even with children in grade school. I would take most anything, anything they said, anything they did with the hope that they would love me. Why was that important? HSK: I don't know, you see. Now, I don't feel that way. ALT: I see. SK: Now, the only thing I feel is this, what is the truth, how can I find the truth about this, how can I express the truth about it? But whether people love me or not, it doesn't make any difference. But you see, I've lived so long wanting people to love me, that now, I get the love of people, love that I don't think I deserve. Isn't that interesting? Because people almost anywhere, they'll say, "Hi!" They love me, but it's like the story of the great stoneface. I remember, in school, we had stories that we had to memorize,and this boy looked at this great stoneface and wanted to be like it so long that he became just like the stoneface. So, well, I always had some particular thing in mind and that was love. It's the same through grade school.ï»¿31 ALT: When you completed the eighth grade, you went to Tuskegee Institute. Do you remember why Tuskegee Institute was selected as the school for you? HSK: alt hsk hsk alt HSK: alt: hsr: alt: hsk: My mother and father were always interested in what they had heard about Booker T. Washington and how he felt about education. They felt, especially my mother, felt the same way about education. She always felt that if there was something, if you needed food, get out and plant some, raise some. If you needed clothes, make them. If you need a house, build it. She had gotten the impression that Booker T. Washington's school was a school where they taught you to do things. She said that, even with the older ones, she wanted one of her children to go to Tuskegee Institute and so she started writing and I was accepted at Tuskegee Institute. In addition to that, I think the fact that my sister Alberta Lillian visited Tuskegee Institute frequently, sang here with various groups and gave recitals here and taught at a branch school â we called it a branch school of Tuskegee Instituteâalso contributed to the fact that I came to Tuskegee Institute. I mean, when they talked about it, I wanted to come. Did you come to the boarding school, or to live with someone? I came to the boarding school. ALT: And how old were you then? About fifteen. I finished the eighth grade and came here to the ninth grade. What did it feel like to leave home at that age for the first time by yourself? I was very happy to do it. I think Bert was with me when I came the first time. I think she brought me. Did she come up there to get you? I think so. I think she brought me here as I can recall and helped me to register and all, and I don't recall having felt so young then. Tuskegee Institute was Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School. The grades, they called, really the ninth grade was called junior. Junior, b-middle, a-middle, senior. When you came, you had to take an examination. I came here, I took an examination. I was placed in the junior class. Well, all I had heard about a junior class was that it was next to senior and I was bragging to the girls that I had made the junior class and that I'd be a senior next year and they said, "No, you won't, because that's just first year. You're just ninth grade." They called the first year the junior year? First year was the junior year. The other thing, if you were a pay student, and when you hear people talk about Tuskegee Institute they talk differently â I came as a pay student. Tuition was ten dollars and board was ten dollars a month.ï»¿32 ALT: Now,how is it that you came to high school and college, Tuskegee College? HSK: Tuskegee was not a college. ALT: Oh, it wasn't? HSK: No. We didn't add two years of college until Dr. Moton was here, and then four years, but, this ... ALT: Well, wasn't Dr. Moton here when you came? HSK: No, I came when Booker T. Washington was here. ALT: Oh, did you? HSK: Yes. I was in thelast class with Booker T. Washington. He died in 1915 and I came in 1911. ALT: So you actually knew Dr. Washington? HSK: Oh yes. Very well, and in those days, you got better acquainted. I think I'll explain this. I came to take education. If you paid, you could say what you wanted to take. So I wanted to be a teacher, I always wanted to be a teacher. ALT: Why? HsK: So, I came to take education. Well, it was about the only people I had seen--- I hadn't seen women do anything but teach and I guess it was no other way for me to make a choice, unless I wanted to be a washerwoman or hairdresser or something ... ALT: So, it was just a matter of picking something that you had observed and had been ... HSK: No, I think I really wanted to be a teacher. I recall when I was little, I used to take all of the things off the washstand and row them up and teach them. All those children. And then I taught music. I taught piano at five cents a lesson. ALT: Did you? HsK: Oh yes. From the time I was very small. And so, I wanted to be a teacher. I always wanted to be a teacher and although this was a high school, in the last two years of the high school, the eleventh and twelfth grades, you took all the subjects that the states required, the subjects that were being taken in other states two years above the high school. Booker T. Washington did that. See, when I came here, I was one of the young girls. There were older people here; there were so many teachers who had just finished the second and third grade and then, Tuskegee Institute was not accredited. You see, we couldn't do that now, we were just not accredited then. There was reciprocity between the states. For instance, when Iï»¿33 hsk: alt hsk alt hsk hsk: ALT: (cont) finished, I went back to teach in North Carolina, and they went by the subjects on your transcript. I had all the subjects on my transcript that the girls in North Carolina who had done two years above the twelfth grade had. Booker T. Washington was very responsible. They had put all of the subjects down; then we had to take the Alabama Board. alt: As high school graduates? hsk: Yes. We had to take the Alabama Board. I had an Alabama Certificate before I left here in 1915. When I went to North Carolina, all I had to do was have that Alabama Certificate transferred and I got a North Carolina Certificate and taught in North Carolina. So you came to high school with the intent to take your major in education? Yes. That's right. What else might have been available to you, say as a possible major? Well, I could have majored in, we didn't call it home economics, I don't know what we called it, but I could have majored in home economics. I could have majored in industrial arts. I could have majored in agriculture. I could have majored in mechanical industry just as the men did. Many things, we had any number of trades. ALT: Would you say ... I could have majored in one of the trades. Now, let me tell you about it. I don't care what you majored in, Tuskegee was like a vocational guidance school. I went to school one day, and went to work one day. If I had been a work student, I would have perhaps worked in the dining room or on the farm or in the housing department, cleaning. But since I wasn't, I had to take something else on that day, so I took sewing. I had plain sewing. I had ladies' tailoring. I had dressmaking. I had millinery. Those four years, I went to school one day and I went to work another day. Well, I thought that you would just do any kind of work, but if you paid, you could take another particular trade. You see that? I also took piano the whole four years I was here. That cost extra, but I took piano. Now, the trades that I studied were cooking and sewing and teaching. But in the first two years, everybody, the ninth and the tenth grade, everybody took the traditional subjects. Everybody was taking about the same subjects: English, Math, Geography, History and things of that sort. Tuskegee Institute was a little bit more than just going to school. I sans in the choir the four years that I was here. Most everything that we did was required. We had required chapel. We went to chapel every night. Every night? Every night. ALT- How would they know if you didn't go?ï»¿34 HSK: Well, they took the roll. ALT: In chapel, they had a roll call in chapelt hsk alt hsk alt hsk alt hsk alt: HSK: alt: We had cards. There was a card, you had special seats. There was a card with your name on it and if you were not there, of course, you were marked absent. There were monitors and in those days, the girls who were on duty, oh, they were just like instructors. They wouldn't cheat for you. I imagine there were some who were caught cheating and I imagine plenty people did and didn't go to church. But I don't know. I know that I didn't. I know I sang in the choir, so I went. We wentevery, every night when I first came and we went twice on Sunday. We went Sunday morning and we went Sunday night. On Sunday mornings there was always a sermon and music, and on a Sunday night, if Dr. Washington was here, he spoke. Was this a religious service on Sunday night, or a more HSK: No. No. ALT: ... different? He spoke or someone else spoke. They had music and someone spoke, but Dr. Washington always spoke on just the things of life that had to do with your living, the things you wear, things like keeping your building clean and thenbeing punctual â everything was done by the bell. The whistle blew, and just in recent years they stopped blowing that whistle. The whistle blew at six o'clock in the morning and you were up and out. We had family style service in the dining room, so you had to be there. If yau weren't the door was locked. And the boys and girls just mixed and intermingled in the dining room? Yes, in the dining room. Chapel and what not? Not in chapel. In the dining room, as far as I can recall, we had our special tables, but there were boys and girls at the same table and we had family service. There were waitresses, students who were working their way through. They were waitresses and they brought the food to you. But in chapel, we sat, the men on one side and the women on the other side. Were there any social activities? Oh yes, because you see, we were confined to the campus. Baseball was one, like every weekend there was a baseball game. I don't remember football as much as I do baseball, strange to say. I remember football in the later years, but baseball was the main thing. Then there were band concerts every Sunday afternoon; there were band concerts on the lawn. And all these were high school students who were doing this, the band concerts and___?ï»¿35 HSK: Yes. Yes. And some of the students were older, much older than others. ALT: Did your mother make your clothes for you to come to Tuskegee? hsk: hsk alt: hsk: alt: Hsk: ALT; Mother made most of them and then she had a lady make some and then, you see I knew I was going to have to wear a uniform. ALT: Oh. Did you wear uniforms? HsK: Oh yes. ALT: What was that like? We wore uniforms every day. The blouse was blue wash material, the skirt was blue. ALT: Every day? HSK: Yes. But on Sunday, the blouse was white. In the afternoons and on Sunday afternoons as soon as you came in from chapel, you see, you could change your uniform and wear your own clothes. My sister Alberta had just gotten married. I don't know what year she married, but she had just gotten married as I can recall and if she hadn't just gotten married, she had had all of her clothes made to get married. But she didn't like some of the things my mother had made, so she gave me many of the things, because she had been working for a good while. She gave me many of the things that she had made for herself. So I came here well-dressed. Did you find it difficult to adjust, coming from a household where there was strictness and discipline to a campus where you were absolutely free to do what you wanted to do? Do you think we were free on this campus then to do what we wanted to do? Then you're wrong. I could take the strictness on the campus because I came from a home that was strict, but many girls could not. What was it like? What was the nature of it? We could not go off the campus without an admit. It was very difficult to get an admit to leave the campus. Everything we wanted was right on the campus. You couldn't go to town without a chaperone. You had to get a ... sometimes the older girls, I told you about Mary Rossâ¢ My roommate was much older than the rest of us and she was one of the chaperones. There were many older girls who were chaperones, but they were very, very strict. We couldn't go to chapel up on the street. The girls had to go down through the bottom to chapel and no boys spent any time over on the girls' lawn at all. When there were calling hours, they could come to the buildings to call. But ... And that was a formal arrangement where they would be announced at the door? Coming to call, describe what would happen.ï»¿36 HSK: alt alt HSK: ALT: HSK: ALT: HSK: ALT: Well, there were girls on duty, who sat right near the door and they'd call for the girls and somebody would get the girls and they would go to the living room and they would sit and call. ALT: They wouldn't go out and stroll about the campus? HSK: No. ? They had to sit right there in the dormitory? HSK: That's right. Were there chaperones there? HSK: oh yes. The lady in charge of every building and then there were girls called duty girls. Girls on duty on every floor. You see ... they were very strict ... your room was inspected, your trunks were inspected, your closets, your clothes, everything vas inspected and you were given demerits if everything wasn't just right. And when you went to chapel, you marched out of chapel and the physical education teachers stood there as you marched out, if there was a button off your blouse, or if it was soiled - the white blouses on Sunday - you were pulled out of line and that was on Sunday. ALT: Oh, really? They would pull you out of line. The man from the military department inspected the boys and I can see Booker T. Washington standing at that podium in chapel, he'd stand there and look. I, however, was in the choir and did not march out. We were in the choir and we'd have rehearsal right after almost every service. We'd have a little rehearsal - especially the night services. But they were very strict. We were really confined to the campus. There were a number of girls whom I know who lived in the community, but we didn't visit them and we didn't know where they lived. Did you have dances or sororities or anything of that kind? We didn't have sororities and fraternities. Sororities and fraternities did not come to the Tuskegee campus until the '40s, but we did have all sorts of social organizations. The Christian Endeavor and Little Men and Little Women. I can't remember all the names. But the most important dance was military, although this military was not connected with the government. Describe what you mean by being military. Well, we had captains and lieutenants, but they were not captains in the United States service, but in school. You mean the school just decided that you would be a captain and you'd be a lieutenant and whatever?ï»¿37 "SK: Yes. That's right. There were men in charge whom X guess had been in some service. The men wore uniforms too, but their uniforms were made in the tailor shop and the ... social affair that was most prominent was what we called an officers' hop. Those of us who went, went with officers, but every girl had to come to White Hall, made no difference what building or dormitory you lived in, you came to White Hall and you were inspected to see if you were dressed properly and everything. ALT: What would be proper dress for something like that? HSK: a:i.t: hsk: alt: HSK; alt: HSK: alt: hsr: alt HSR alt Hsk ALT: Well, we were wearing long dresses then anyway, I think. I can remember one long dress I had was kind of split skirt, the blouse had ruffles all down and ruffles around here. And the men came into White Hall for you and then you'd walk over to the dining room, the dances were always in the dining room. And we did dances like the Skating Schottische, it sounds like this .. the Waltz Oxford. Those kinds of dances were the kind of dances where you take hands and dance. I don't think ... A young man didn't put his arras around you? I don't think we had any dances other than when you whirled around, you see, you'd have to put your arms around the girl. What kind of music did you have for that? Did you have orchestras? Orchestras. We always had good music. We always had good music because the orchestra played every Sunday. I think they played Sunday morning and Sunday nights, it's vague to me now, but I know the orchestra ... Did you enjoy the dances? Oh yes. I could not dance when I came to Tuskegee. You see, good girls didn't dance. Did you feel guilty when you learned how? No. I don't know why I didn't, but I didn't. I didn't feel guilty at all. But then, you didn't dance, we didn't go to dances in small towns. Maybe city girls did, but you see, I was from a small town and we didn't go to dances. We had church parties and things. But I remember my boyfriend taught me to dance. He was very popular and somehow, I don't remember, but I remember the matron allowed him to teach me to dance because we knew I was to go to the next hop. Where did he teach you? In the living room. In the living room? Yes. He taught me to dance in the living room and then the girls followed through on it to help me, every night, during study period. And what was that like?ï»¿38 HSK: Well, all the girls went to the big living room in Douglas Hall for study hour. And I remember we would study. I have some friends now who laugh and tell how they would sit behind me and eat and I was afraid. And I would sit there and study like everything. We had supervised studying, but there was always some carrying on behind us. And then you didn't have long Christmas vacations. You perhaps had Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, so you couldn't go anywhere really. We didn't even go home at Christmas time. And then some of us stayed during the summer. If I didn't go to my sister Alberta's home in Selma, I stayed during the summer, and worked. I remember one summer, I worked in the laundry. I stayed here and worked in the laundry. ALT: And would you get paid for that? HSK ALT: HSK: ALT: HSR; alt HSR alt HSR Yes. You'd get paid for that. ALT: How much pay would you get? Do you know? HSK: f rprtflinl v rln-n't- T /^/-i-n ' t- -t-omom'KoT- Rnf I certainly don't. I don't remember. But it must not have been very much. And another reason we don't remember much about money, all the bills went to our parents and our parents paid the school and all things ... we would have known if they hadn't paid but we didn't see ... Now the children pay their own bills and they know it. But we didn't. Were there any white students, or white faculty at that time? You see, Alabama law â I imagine we abided by it â said that blacks and whites could not go to school together. But there were always short courses. There was always something when there were a number of whites here. Then we had so many foreign students. I knew more Puerto Rican students - there were more from Puerto Rico, I think and Afr ica. But as for* just Caucasian students, if they were here, they were here on some special mission. Okay, now if they came here at all, still in keeping with the Alabama law at that time, to what extent did they mix and mingle with the black students and black faculty, say at chapel or in living accommodations or other facilities? Well, one thing about Tuskegee Institute and most people who grew up here and most people who went to school here, they met only white people who mingled freely with blacks. We never met ... we didn't know any other. The trustees and their wives and those who came for workshops, they came because they were philanthropically inclined and there was no difference. And would they be right in the dormitories along with the ...? No. No. We did not live together. Dorothy Hall was a guest hall for whites. Oh, really? Yes. The girls' industries were downstairs, but there were rooms in that building for whites. All colored guests stayed at different buildings. Every building had a guest room until the later years. In later years, you know the building, not Huntington Hall, not the academic Huntington, there'sï»¿39 HSK: (cont) another Huntington Hall, that was a guest house for blacks eventually. But whites lived in Dorothy Hall. ALT: Now suppose they attended a chapel service. Did they just mix in with everybody else or how was that? HSK: All students had special seats. They sat there. We had special seats where guests sat, white or black. Our teachers sat on the stage for the most part, trustees sat on the stage when they came, most of them were white, although we always had one or two colored trustees. But if guests came in large numbers, the boys were required to get up, they'd have to get up and stand to give the guests their seats. That was an old custom. You always gave the guests the best. It was not until later years that the students realized that you didn't do that. Even when we had commencement and big affairs, we students would move from the building for guests, white or black, so that was the practice. We knew Booker T. Washington very well. We knew him first of all because he spoke in chapel often, and we knew him secondly because he came to the dining room to see that everything was just right, he followed through. I remember when I first came, we had a meal, I think we had potatoes, corn and rice. We had three starches. I ate all but the potatoes. And I heard somebody behind me say, "Why didn't you eat those potatoes?" When I looked up, he had gone. That was the first time I had seen Booker T. Washington. I said, "Who was that?" They said, "That was Dr. Washington. Don't you know him?" I said, "Why is he so interested?" They said, "He's interested in everything you do. He's going on back in the cafeteria to see if there's anything wrong with the potatoes. Why didn't you eat the potatoes?" So he followed through on things. So there were a number of things that we learned here besides a lot of the things that were in books: to be on time, and we knew that whatever you needed you made, most of the bricks in the older buildings the students made them and they made them because you couldn't buy them. The clothes were made because you couldn't buy them. The food you raised because you couldn't buy it. You didn't eat things from cans in those days. So I was at Tuskegee for four years. I sang in the choir all that time and graduated in 1915. ALT: Is there any teacher that stands out in your memory from those years? Yes, the teacher that stands out most vividly, I think, is one who died just recently and that's Mr. G. W. A. Scott. I went to Mr. Scott for geography. Nobody had taught me how to outline. He taught me how to outline; all his students had to outline everything. You had to outline to the 'nth degree and then you had to talk from that outline. Then he always talked from a map and whatever we were talking about, we knew that everything had to have a place and a time. And he not only taught through a map, but we made timetables, tables to show the things. So he was perhaps one of the teachers that impressed me very, very much although at that particular time, most of our teachers were college graduates. I think of men like Dr. G. Lake Imes who was here and in charge of ourï»¿40 HSK: (cont) entertainment courses. He was very good. ALT: What was an entertainment course? What was that like? HSK: Well, I remember when Marian Anderson was brought here. I remember when Roland Hayes was brought here and gave a recital. I remember bands and orchestras in the chapel. But there were singers and there were orchestras and concerts. Almost every week there was some big recital here. And that stayed in my mind too, very vividly. I think that the crafts and the industrial work that we had to do was important and different from anything that we had had. The other thing was the practice teaching ... I did my practice teaching in two places. At night und er Mr. Scott, I taught geography to the high school students. Then I did my other practice teaching at the Children's House. ALT: What was the Children's House? HSK: ALT: HSK: The Children's House was Tuskegee Institute's practice school. All people on the campus who were interested in studying students did it at the Children's House. All practice teaching was done first at the Children's House. That is, they would go to the Children's House to observe under the master teachers, and then they'd go to places like New Rising Star and Harrisbarret. These are communities outside of Tuskegee? Baldwin Farms. Yes, and over in the Washington public schools. They would go there, but they always had to do their work at the Children's House first. I never went out to any of the other schools. I did all of my practice teaching under Booker T. Washington's son's wife who came to teach at the Children's House. She was from Washington, D.C., and had just graduated from Miner Normal. I remember, she was teaching one day, teaching from stamps. The children had collected a lot of stamps and they were studying wherever those stamps led, that was what they were studying. So the other teacher who ... really, Mrs. Edith Shehee Washington. Edith Washington, Booker T. Washington's son's wife, made quite an impression upon me. The other one, and I'll just mention one other, was a choir director. Jennie C. Lee, a choir director â who was very precise in what she did. Everything, all of the songs, had to be just right and we enjoyed singing. Because I could read music, I was always on the front row, but I never had much of a voice. But when she'd get after any of the girls about singing off key, then she'd say, "Why don't you listen to Hattie? You'll never hear her off key." And behind her back they'd say, "No, because she can't sing loud enough for us to hear her." I could read notes. Those are three particular areas in which I think that what the teacher did was very influential upon me. Then I really don't see, how in the world we were given the opportunity to work in every division of the school - everybody who came here. I remember when I worked in one office, the first time I ever heard of making 'triplicate' reports.ï»¿41 ALT: HSK: ALT: HSK: ALT: HSK: What kind of work did you do? Secretarial work? Or? Yes. Filing things. Many of us couldn't type but we did filing and things of that sort. Then I remember, I was assigned to the teachers' cafeteria. The teachers didn't eat with the students? No. The teachers had what we called the teachers' home. Downstairs in Tompkins Hall, we had a big building for a long time, teachers ate there. And they had family service too. (Break) I believe we were talking about your experiences at Tuskegee Institute and there were several questions I want to ask you about which I don't believe we covered yesterday. To the extent that you can remember, were there any women at Tuskegee Institute on the faculty or working on the staff who had an influence on your life? Hdw did you see the role of women at that time? When I came to Tuskegee the first woman I met was a woman that we called Dean of Women. She was like the first lady. Mrs. Sue Helen Porter, Sue Helen Porter was a very tall woman, beautiful, very strict woman, showing no love toward you at all, everything was business. And when you came into her office, you just felt like straightening up. Mrs. Porter was, of course, our Dean of Women and when you came to Tuskegee, she gave you the orders. She told me and all of the other girls that we were confined to the campus. Everything we had would be inspected and that we would be expected to be out of our rooms by a certain hour. The classes at that time were continuous, that is, you didn't have an hour off like you have in college, you went to school from eight a.m. to four p.m. Those times we were supposed to be out of our rooms and either Mrs. Porter or someone else would inspect your room while you were out, inspect your trunk and everything. You were given your room and given your roommates, and meetings were held often. In the residence hall, almost every night when you first came, a meeting was held. You sat around on the floor and the person in charge of the hall would talk to you. But Mrs. Porter was a woman who was always dressed for the occasion. She always looked dressed up. Her office was in White Hall and her room and apartment were in White Hall right across from the office. We had very little communication with men, but I remember that the first time I walked in the Tompkins dining hall, a very handsome fellow looked at me and told me later on, "That's my girlfriend." So right from almost the first day, Willis Peek became my boyfriend. And since we couldn't communicate much, they sent us locals. I remember once, he sent me a local in a Bible, left it in the office with Mrs. Porter and told her to give me the Bible. She got the letter and she sent for me and told me that we were not supposed to write to the boys, but she said, "This time, I'm going to give you this local, but I'm never going to deliver it again. Don't have him write to you, you can talk in the cafeteria and then on Sundays between 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 4 P.M. he can call on you and that's sufficient for you." And I grew up feeling that way, that you met men at certain hours. And so I told Willis "Please don't write me any more." But such things as that, such things are expected. One other little instanceï»¿42 (cont) about Mrs. Porter. I told you sometime ago, we wore blue uniforms: a blue blouse and blue skirt. I sang in the choir, so I thought I could get by. My sister, Alberta, had a blue silk blouse that she had for her wedding as part of a suit. That blue blouse was the same color of my uniform. I put it on and satup in the chapel thinking I was looking just like the other girls and as soon as we got home, somebody came to my door. "Mrs. Porter wants to see you." And she said, "Hattie, you were sitting up in that choir and you didn't have a uniform on, now, if you don't want to wear your uniform, I am going to take you out of the choir, you understand?" We didn't have to march out, so we got by with different kinds of shoes and everything, but I didn't get by with that blouse. And a number of things she did like that which made me growup feeling that you don't try to get away with things. So Mrs. Porter was the first woman. The next woman we met was Mrs. Booker T. Washington. Mrs. Booker T. Washington was the third wife of Booker T. Booker T.'s first wife had one child, Port ia Pittmann who is living now, she must be ninety some odd years old. She was here in April for Founders' Day. His second wife, Olivia Davidson, came from ... we thought of her as a northern woman. She was a woman who put Booker T. in contact with many of the people in the North who gave money, people who were philanthropically inclined. She was the mother of his two boys, Davidson and Booker Jr. Those two I knew. And the third wife - both of these wives lived very short times. His wife Fannie lived, oh, only about one year after she came here. She had a tragic death. Olivia Davidson was working here. School was started in 1881 and she came to teach and to be first lady in 1882, I understand. Shortly after his first wife died, he married Olivia Davidson. Olivia Davidson died and he was visiting at Fisk University and saw Margaret Murray and knew she was the one. And he married Margaret Murray Washington. She was the one whom I knew. Mrs. Washington was in charge of girls' industries. Every girl, I don't care how much money you had, or how little, you had to take some industry, so I took sewing. Mrs. Washington taught cooking, but so often she had a substitute to teach for her. We had theory books and we had to write up everything that she taught us to cook. And we spent a lot of time on setting the table. That hadn't dawned on me. We were taught to set the table properly. We knew that knives and forks belonged on a certain side, spoons on a certain side, the napkin a certain way and Mrs. Booker T. Washington was the one who taught us that. Moreover, she had a club that was called the Tuskegee Woman's Club and I learned a lot about club meetings by going to that club. The girls who wanted to could volunteer to serve. We were in her cooking class and she would tell us, "We're going to have a Woman's Club and if any of you want to come, you can come and serve." So I went every time I got a chance to serve. And I heard something that I've had to repeat to people here who say Negroes never voted. I heard Mrs. Washington get up and say, "Ladies, I want to see that all of you register. We're going down to vote and we're all going down together." It had to be between 1911 and 1915. People don't believe that, but they did and I was very much impressed. Another thing that impressed me about her was the swiftness with which she carried on her meetings. She'd call on the chaplain, "Let's say the Lord's Prayer." "Amen." "Read the minutes of the last meeting." And she wentï»¿43 HSK: (cont) fast like that about the meetings and she was always thinking about the poor. We listened to her then and she would say, "We're going down to Chehaw, Alabama. We're going to meet the train. We're going to meet the girls. Now who will meet this train? Who will meet that train?" Every girl who came to Tuskegee Institute was met either at Atlanta, Georgia, or Montgomery, Alabama, or Chehaw, Alabama. Sometimes men were sent to meet us and sometimes women, but very seldom did a girl come in from Chehaw alone. But from Chehaw there was a train that came in. All these were things that I heard Mrs. Washington plan for and talk about. As students, we didn't go so much into the town and into these other places, but we heard her ask the women to meet in town. There was a place she rented, a store so that people wouldn't stand around on the streets. And they would go up and they had milk and coffee and they'd take care of the babies and they'd give demonstrations. I remember having heard them ask, some of the girls were not from the South, and some of the teachers were not, and they would ask, "Well, why are those women standing on the streets?" She said, "Well, they've come to get their pay from the storekeepers. The people who own the land, own these stores and they come up. They also stand around on the streets because their homes are not comfortable." So, in addition to Mrs. Porter, Mrs. Booker T. Washington was a woman whom I remember very, very well. There was another woman whom we knew and that was Mrs. Bess Walcott. Mrs. Walcott came here to teach English and we knew that she was from Oberlin Conservatory and I was interested in her because my sister was from Oberlin Conservatory and they became very, very dear friends. Mrs. Walcott taught English and was very strict about our talking. She said to us something that I'll never forget. She said, "It is all right to be a Southerner. It is all right to have a Southern .accent. But there is no excuse for your not sounding your "t's" and "d's"5 anti your "s's"." Those are the things I have passed on to every child I have come in contact with. I say, "What did you say? What is your name? I don't understand what you are saying," because that is what was said to us in our English classes. Those were three women who stayed with me. There was one other one who was our class mother. Every class had a class mother and a class father, and this woman was our class mother. When we had class meetings, you couldn't meet unless your class mother or an advisor was there and she always met with us and she loved us. I think I ought to mention this too, Mrs. Jennie C. Lee who was in charge of the choir. Mrs. Lee loved the girls who were in the choir. If we wanted to leave a class, or if I did, I never saw anybody in the room but me, but I guess she was the same with all of the girls. But if at any time I didn't feel like staying in class, I couldn't go back to my room, but I'd go to Mrs. Lee's room and rest. Mrs. Lee, I guess she was a graduate of Fisk. I know her home was in Nashville, Tennessee, because she went back to Nashville. But the spirituals, and I guess I know dozens of them, had to be sung and they had to be sung right and they were beautifully done. Our choir was very noted at that time and Mrs. Jennie C. Lee was in charge of the choir. The organist I ought to mention for several reasons. There was a Mrs. Mooreï»¿44 hSK: (cont) who played the organ and Mrs. Moore really could play that organ. But to tell you how students are, her boyfriend, Mr. Neley, worked on the grounds and we could tell that she didn't like Mr. Neley. He would come in chapel to wait for her and when he'd come into chapel, Mrs. Lee would wink at her and she'd slip out the back door and leave and he'd be sitting there waiting for her. We students knew it. These little things I mentioned, these are the things that were the makings of me. I never wink at grown people. If a grown person hunches me before children, I never accept it because people see it, they know it when you do things like that. And I think perhaps those things were impressed upon me because of my dealings with these women. There were other women, but those are the most outstanding ones as I think of in the past of Tuskegee women. ALT: Yesterday you mentioned one man, Mr. G. W. A. Scott,who was an influence in your life at that time. Were there any other men who stand out in your memory as having had, you know, influence? HSK: ALT: HSK; Yes. Besides Mr. G. W. A. Scott, there was Mr. Ezra Roberts. Mr. Roberts was in charge of the academic department; he was a teacher of sociology. As I told you, in the last two years of the high school, we had subjects that I had to take over again in college. But we had them and that's how we qualified as normal school graduates. Mr. Roberts was a sociology teacher and a very, very excellent teacher he was. Booker T. Washington required that everything teachers taught be correlated with something in life, something around the school or where you lived, the people you lived with. Another one I remember was Mr. R.E. Lee. We knew Mr. Lee well because he had a son who was my classmate. I think Robert is still living, but Mr. Lee was one of our teachers and I think he taught psychology. But whatever he taught was thoroughly done and was combined with our other work. And let me tell you how it was combined. Let's take my literature teacher, Mrs. Palmer. Her husband was the registrar, and Mrs. Palmer was a teacher. We had what we call rhetoricals and a rhetorical was always combined with whatever you were doing in industry. I was in sewing and I remember that because I embroidered well. I used to make the hem stitching-it was done by hand - for the nurses' aprons. So on one rhetorical I had to tell how that apron was made. My sewing teacher did all of the details about it to be sure that I was telling the truth about how it was made, the patterns and so forth. But my English teacher and literature teachers were the ones who taught me how to talk on the stage and how to turn those sentences around and how to have the topic sentence and have all the things agree with them and my summary sentence. My speech was reviewed, not by Hiss King, my sewing teacher, but by my English and literature teachers. Mrs. Palmer was a very good teacher and I think I should mention her. Those are a few of the women teachers and the men teachers that I think ... Well, had Dr. Carver come to Tuskegee Institute at that time? I should 'have named him first. Dr. Carver came to Tuskegee Institute in 1895 and perhaps was the most influential person on my life, next to Booker T. Washington, so far as Tuskegee is concerned. In my second year, I am sure it was the second year, I had botany with Dr. Carver. There wereï»¿45 (cont) many things that he taught us, but the first thing we knew was that everything came from God. He used the word "God" in all of his teaching and then he would take us all over the campus. We could name almost every grass, we could identify every tree by the bark or by the leaf. And he said, "All of these trees and all of these plants are for our use." He would tell us the use of certain plants and things that we could eat. He'd give us simple names and then he'd give us scientific names and the boys tried to catch him. They'd go back and get the big books, look up the long words and those words were in those books â the simple names and then the more difficult names. Professor Carver had us practice what he was teaching throughout the state and throughout the county. When he came, people were raising cotton right up to their doors, but Booker Washington knew they needed food and that they should be raising something else. So Professor Carver started first with them raising potatoes, peanuts, greens and peas, something besides cotton. And then he knew they needed money so he started experimenting with what could be made from these products so the people would have money from something other than cotton. The planters got very little money. The only thing they got was permission to trade at the store and by the end of the year, they had traded all of their part of the money they had made from the cotton. So Professor Carver said, "Now, here is a peanut," and he started making a number of things from the peanut and the sweet potato. So many people don't realize that his work was funded. The United States government recognized what he was doing and Tuskegee Institute became an agricultural experiment station. So he was experimenting for the government, not only for Tuskegee Institute. Then theybegan to put out pamphlets, some of which I have saved. But pamphlets were sent throughout on what to raise and how to raise it. Then he started exhibits on what he had. Many of the things that he had canned fifty years ago are still in the place and we were a part of that canning, we were a part of the raising of things. I told you and I like to tell you over and over again because the student who worked his or her way through Tuskegee would have a different story, but every one in the class at this experiment station had a plot of land and you had to raise something. My plot, there were two girls, we had a plot, it wasn't as large as this room, we raised strawberries and it was delightful. But the other children were working in the greens fields and the beans fields, the peas field and raising things for Tuskegee Institute. But I don't remember ever picking bushels of strawberries, it seems to me it was small. But we saw strawberries grow and we picked them and we ate them and enjoyed them ourselves because we were not working to make money for the school. Now we heard Dr. Carver lecture a lot, he had a very high voice. I think you know, he had never married, he talked very high. Now, one of his favorite poems and every time I look at the plant I think of it, "A little flower in the cranied wall, if I understood you at all, I would know what God is." A beautiful quotation. Then he had another one, and some of them, he recited so much that we couldn't help but remember. He had another one he always said to students and I never memorized all of it but I think of the essenceï»¿46 (cont) of it. "Think it out for yourself, my man. You have what all the other boys have: two eyes, a nose and a brain to think ..." and on it went. So we knew from Professor Carver that we had to think it out for ourselves. He very seldom told us anything. You'd ask him a question. "Go look it up, work it out for yourself." He had another poem called "The Bridge-builder!" It seems that the essence of this poem, an old man was building a bridge and people began to question him, "Old man, why are you building that bridge? You'll never cross it," and he said, "I'm building this bridge for others to cross." I thought that was beautiful. Those are some of the poems that he recited almost every time he spoke. Professor Carver stressed saving everything. If you had seen him walking across the campus, you'd say, "I wonder what beggar that is?" But you'd have to ask yourself, "Why does this beggar wear a flower in the lapel of his coat?" He'd pass a trash can and you'd see him in the trash can, picking out strange things and if you go to the Museum you'll see his crocheting, his embroidering, his needlework that he made from scraps. When he came to the crafts room, if we were making baskets, we were using raffia that came from abroad, I guess. He took the yucca plant, he took the cotton plant and stripped those things off and showed us that those things could be used. I remember he went out into the graveyard that was right across from Dorothy Hall. He picked up the pine needles from the ground and he showed us how these pine needles could be used. We were using for raffia the strings that people had thrown away for our baskets. And right now we could take the pine needles and make baskets and make containers for various things. We made mats from those pine needles that were in the woods. And I grew up feeling that nothing should be thrown away. It is very difficult for me to throw even a piece of paper away, because he would show us how these things could be used for various other things, so Professor Carver should be remembered. I think most people think that Professor Carver just picked up things and was not an educated man. He was. When he was very young, he was taken by a white family. He was a little sickly child. But somehow the Carver family thought they should care foir him and they did. And they soon found that he could read and he was interested in plants and things and when he was a little older, they sent him to school at Iowa State. When Booker Washington found him, he was teaching. He was doing research at Iowa State University in Ames. He received his doctorate, not as an honorary degree. Later years, he received many honorary degrees, but his first doctorate was an earned doctorate. He came to Tuskegee as an educated man. I don't know why scientists did not receive him. They didn't think of him as a real scientist. They just thought he was somebody who was just working up something. But in later years, they began to understand and by the time I graduated, he was being sent for to speak at various places and to demonstrate the things that could be made from other things. There was another thing that I bring in here because I may not get back to Profes sor Carver. I not only knew Professor Carver as a student, but I came back in 1930 to work and he was here. In the '40s, people began to criticize Dr. Carver. They said that commercial places were commercializing on all the products that he had shown you could get from the potato and the peanut.ï»¿LI HSK: (cont) I had heard so many criticisms that I went to see him. And I said, "Professor Carver, Tuskegee needs money and people are saying it's a shame you don't help us to have a manufacturing concern right here on the campus." And he said, "Not interested. Not interested." (spoken in a very high voice.) He talked just that high. He said, "What I do, anybody can do." I said, "You think so?" He said, "Yes. Ask God and he will tell you." And I said, "Well, Professor Carver I asked God to show me and I don't even know what." He says." "Go ask him again, go ask him again." (laughter) And I think that needs to be brought out. That he was only interested in showing possibilities. I think anybody who does not go to the Carver Museum will miss a treat. I think I ought to mention something else now even though we're talking about the early days. We have a Carver Foundation here which is more important than the Carver Museum. Dr. Carver was interested in showing possibilities and when he died he left all of his money; They say he just had many checks that he never cashed; the money he had,he'd never used. So we built the Carver Foundation Building. He had expressed his desire to people. He wanted professors to experiment with various things that companies wanted you to experiment with, so that students who studied under them could receive their masters or their doctorates in agriculture. So this has been done ever since his death. I want to mention a few of the simple things. Now they have such complex things they are doing, I could not even recite them. Well, a long time ago, I remember one or two I want to mention. For instance, the Parker Pen Company wanted an experiment with their ink to see to what extent it was something. A professor here took some students who were enrolled at Tuskegee Institute and they did that. The Parker Pen Company paid the professor and I think those students received money too. I remember once they were studying, and this was long ago, studying foods that were particularly Southern, the nutritive value of certain foods like collard greens and black-eyed peas and why pregnant women ate clay. I think any person who is interested should get in touch with Dr. J. H. M. Henderson at the Carver Foundation and find out some of the things that they're doing now because they're doing the same thing at Tuskegee now. Under the professors they are studying certain things and the companies for whom they are doing these studies are making donations, I understand, to the professors. It's just a beautiful thing to think about - Dr. Carver. We like to pass it on because of the waste that you see and the things that we can use that he taught us should be used. And most of the people who were his students, if you talk with them,you'll find that they say that they're using a number of things that people never used. Contrary to what most people think, his things have been published. I remember in grade school we had a book that was written by Mrs. Graham about Dr. Carver. In the back of this book there are all kinds of menus by Dr. Carver. He had a certain oil that people used for rheumatism. That was made by him. There are other books about Professor Carver and those books contain interesting things that he did and that we could still use now. Things for dyes and all that. He used cotton to make pavement. You see some seats on the Tuskegee campus and in the Museum, they're hard as rocks, that were made from cotton and discarded shavings.ï»¿48 HSK: (cont) So we could talk on about Professor Carver because his life really meant so much to all of us. ALT: in describing several phases of your life, you mentioned the word 'complexion' â whether one group was darker or lighter than the other. You also said something about the Alabama law at that time which kept the races separated and I was wondering if, during those years at Tuskegee, either your complexion or your race had any significance as a fact of your life? x Can tell you what I know. And I can tell you how others felt. Marian Anderson, my friend, was not a race person. There were some of us who always lived above race. If anything was ever done because of my color, I don't remember it. But I do know the facts and I'll give them to you. These are facts from friends whom I know. There were within the race different colors of people and, because I knew some things that came to me from somewhere, that didn't disturb me. If a person was very bright or he wasn't so big and fat, you saw those persons on stage and you saw them on programs, even little children. The ones that were fat and ugly and dark -by some people they were not called upon. But the little light ones and the little pretty ones were. Now that was within the race. And it was true of grown people. But I hasten to say what I found out. When I found it out, I don't know. As we were removed from slavery, you don't find as many bright colored people as you saw 70, 80 years ago. All mothers during slavery who had bright children were not raped. They knew that if their children had a white father and if those children were light, they would have better advantages in the world. Many of the white men during slavery educated their children. Many of the women who had children by those white men were house servants. They had charge of that man's house, all the cooking, all the cleaning. They even nursed the white woman's babies. The white women were ladies. They did nothing but sit in the front room and dress and sleep. It was not until white women rose up against that, and told their men they would not allow them to accept these black women any more, that that was stopped. Now those of us who remember that are not as mad as perhaps those who think that all black women were raped. They were not. There are many bright colored people who were as close to their white parents as we are to our black ones. I am going to tell you about one, something that I know. I'll name the place and the people who lived there would not object to it because they talked freely. When I taught at Snow Hill, Alabama, I had a friend, a young man, a friend in Dothan, Alabama, who was from Beatrice, Alabama. Beatrice, Alabama, is near Snow Hill. A friend in Snow Hill said she would take me to Longmire's home. Longmire was then in Washington studying to be a lawyer. She says, "I'll take you to Longmire's home. You can meet his people." She took us to Beatrice, Alabama. And we stayed in a home where there was a woman, a dark woman, and several bright men and women. We heard one fellow say, "I'm going to get up and go to the big house and look after my father." This was as late as ...I taught at Snow Hill in 1924. And I asked, I said, "Where did he say he's going?" They said, "His father is white and lives in that big house up there." And his mother had every convenience that she could have, but they never married. I visited another house where theï»¿49 (cont) woman was a friend of ours. She lived just like a white woman, but she was colored. Her mother lived in a home and her father lived in a big home. Now that's enough of that within the race. The laws of the South said that blacks and whites did not eat and sleep together At Tuskegee Institute we didn't know anything about that law. It is true we didn't know where the whites were sleeping but if black and white trustees came at the same time, or black and white people came to visit for the same purpose, they lived in Dorothy Hall. Although we thought of Dorothy Hall as a guest house for whites. The whites that we knew were people who loved us, were people who were philanthropically inclined. I think too that you asked me about the uniforms. As I think of it now, any time we had a trustees' meeting, we were notified that we had to march to chapel and everybody lined up in front of White Hall, girls. And boys lined up somewhere else. And we marched to chapel. I can see all those white people standing on the line, white and colored looking at us. And T think that they saw there blacks finely dressed. You must remember that if we had cleaning establishments, I don't know it, we washed our clothes, and we wore uniforms - in order to be inspected and to be sure that your things were clean and that you were dressed properly. A long time ago, you wore a certain thing in the morning, and you wore a certain thing in the afternoon. In the morning you wore hats. When I came here, we made our hats. We had uniform hats and we made the hats. And you were inspected. And I think that much of the money that Booker Washington got was because there were people who saw us marching to chapel. Now, in the outer world, we knew of lynchings. Booker Washington and Monroe Work ... Booker Washington and somebody put out a lynch report every year. There were lynchings. When I went to New York to school, even in '44, a number of my friends asked me to tell them about a lynching. I said, "Well, I understand there are really lynchings because it's in the paper, but I've never seen anybody lynched." They tell me that blacks were, just sometimes, thrown into the river. You had to say, "Mister." You had to say, "Yes, Sir." All that type of thing. So I think ... the race question ... Booker Washington said once, I heard him in a speech, "Black people have not just gotten disturbed about what's happening." When they asked him, he would answer publicly and he told us once in one speech, "You will live to see the day when those who are lynching one race will begin to lynch each other. You will live to see it." He said that race prejudice is like cancer. He said that over and over again. "And if it continues, it will destroy us from the inside, more completely than any army could come from the outside and destroy us." He spoke like that. So this lynching report was put out and you can see copies of it. Now when the lynching ceased, and in later years, they stopped putting out the report on lynchings. So those things I have to mention are true but I also have to mention that Tuskegee Institute had grown because of people who were philanthropically inclined. And yet, Tuskegee Institute started not as a private school. Booker T. Washington was sent for to come here to start a school, a normal school for Negro teachers. It started as a teachers' college. But he saw the needs of the people. He went out throughout Macon County, he traveled throughout, and he saw that the needs of the people were for food, shelter and raiment. He felt if you needed food, you ought to raise it;ï»¿50 HSK: (cont) if you needed food cooked, you ought to cook it; if you needed clothes, you ought to make them; if you needed a house, you ought to build it; if you don't have the material, go out into the woods and cut the wood and make the bricks. So the bricks in the older buildings were made in the brickyard that we have here. And he believed that, and because he believed that the school grew. And I don 't think that we ought to try to give the impression that it was easy for him because many of the blacks objected to the whites who were philanthropically inclined and gave us money. Many of the blacks said that Booker T. Washington was teaching the people to do what they did in slavery time. But there was a difference. In slavery, we worked under the whip, but when he was teaching us, he was teaching us to work because you love it and because you need these things. I don't think he ever thought, as many people accused him of, that every Negro ought to wash and iron all his life or plow all his life, but he felt if that was the best you could do, why you ought to do it. And whatever you could do, do well. Plough a row, plough it, plough it well. There is no secret about how Dr. W.E.B. DuBois felt about Booker T. Washington. There were many people who felt as I feel, that there was nothing wrong. Both of them were right in a way. DuBois felt that blacks who had the best minds would be accepted. If you were a scholar, you would be accepted. Booker Washington felt that whatever you do, if you do it well, you would be accepted. Dr. Benjamin E. Mays spoke at a later date, and this was much later, in the '60s, I guess. I heard Dr. Mays speak, and he said, "Both Dr. Washington and Dr. DuBois were partially wrong. We have people with the best minds who are not accepted. We have people who are doing the best they can with what they can do, they are not accepted." And he said something else that was sad for me but in the '60s I saw young people like this, so it's true. He said, "Any person who can, is going to stand on your neck and make you work for him until you knock him off." That's a bad commentary, but it makes us understand that, even though they were right, there was something else. Because at that time, when Dr. Mays was talking, in the Baptist Church, Tuskegee Institute had been gerrymandered and many of us were out of the city "limits and we were told that it was done so that this county which is predominantly black, could not vote blacks in as we had done in recent years. So there are many things about Booker T. Washington and about the school that have to do with the race and that don't have to do with the race. See what I mean? So those of us who were here in school were exposed to only people who loved blacks and blacks who loved whites and they mingled freely. We did have on our faculty, many colored people who looked like whites. And I must truthfully say that I heard, I didn't work in any home - but at that time you could also, if you didn't have money, you could work in the homes of ... coloreds. Colored people were on the faculty. I won't call their names, but I understand that if a girl came here to work in a home, that she was treated just like the girl was treated who worked in a white home. She could only come in the back door. She ate in the kitchen. And I understand that that was true. I did not witness it but I had girls who did and they toldï»¿51 HSK: (cont) me that that was true. ALT: HSK: ALT: HSK: ALT; HSK: ALT: I think that those are the most important facts about the race as it has to do with Tuskegee and all. Unless you want me to say something about the town. We never went to the town; Booker Washington spoke in town. We had a quartet, black students and one or two from the faculty. I know one, a Mr. William Wiley who had charge of the quartet. They not only sang in town but they traveled everywhere. Whites enjoyed having blacks come in and sing for them but there were 2,000 students when I was here. My class was a big class, over 150 odd, but we never went to the town for anything. Was the town black and white, or ...? Yes, black and white but if you saw the pattern of the town, it was like it was in most small towns. There were small houses behind the big houses. That's true, you can see those now although nobody lives in them. Blacks lived in those little houses, the ones who worked. And then there were sections of the town that were just thick with blacks. We had, many girls who lived in town and came to Tuskegee just as ... Now about how far is the town from the campus? I don't think it's more than a mile because we walk it easily. It isn't more than a mile. You could walk it. There was no communication other than this. Any time we had big concerts, any time the trustees were here, Booker T. Washington, Dr. Moton, Dr. Patterson and I think I'll stop here. I don't remember much during Dr. Foster's time because times had changed. We would know that seats were reserved for our friends from town and we knew them. I think there's one other thing, since we're talking about schools. When Tuskegee Institute was built, there was a white school, I understand there were two, a school for women, white school, in the town of Tuskegee. Oh, really? Yes. And when Tuskegee was started and grew so fast, this school was moved to Montgomery. The college for women is in Montgomery now. But it was started in Tuskegee. And there was so much, words were passed by word of mouth, I haven't seen this written, but it is said there was so much confusion about which school was which that the white school just moved to Montgomery and it is now Hunter College. Well, before we leave the high school years, I would be very much interested to know, what did graduation day mean for you. Were there awards or honors, was the community involved, what was that like? HSk: First of all, we had class night. I think in all high schools, way back a long time ago, they had class night. Class night, we all assembled and all the students came and students spoke, they gave their prophecy and they gave their history and they gave gifts and all sorts of things. I remember this class night. I had gone with a fellow for four years, but we had a play daughter who was very much in love with him. He was Catholic and I wasn't. I put in that will that I would give this girl to him. After they graduated they married. But we had lots of fun on class night. There was a classï»¿52 HSK: ALT: HSK: ALT: alT: alt. HSK; (cont) song which was lots of fun. And then, on graduation day, we always had students speak. If a student was a farmer, I remember he talked about a horse and if he was going to talk about shoeing a horse, he'd bring the horse on stage. That's the truth! On the stage! Was this in chapel? Yes, right in chapel. They had the floor covered if he was going to talk about horses. There was a big exhibit of collard greens and sweet potatoes or a beautifully decorated stage. If he was talking about cleaning the cow, he'd clean the cow on stage and milk it on stage. Then we'd always have a speaker. And of course, this is not new, we had a valedictorian who did the speaking. I was vice-president of my class and of course had great responsibility in helping to plan the affairs at commencement because we students would plan whom we wanted to speak. But as I told you a few minutes ago, the industrial teacher would give the facts and then your English teacher or your literature teacher or some teacher would help you with the speaking and you had to practice, practice, practice. We didn't have any loudspeakers, but they could hear us in the back of that chapel. When I see people who can't be heard without a loud-speaker, I say, "How in the world did they hear us?" They heard us when we spoke. More marvelous than that, on commencement day, there were wagons and horses and buggies. People came from everywhere. Down back of one of the buildings, back of White Hall, people put up stands and they were selling fish and selling all sorts of sandwiches and drinks. Some of the people never got into the chapel. Then we would line up as they do today although we would have on our white uniforms (we didn't have caps and gowns), but we'd line up in our white ... Where did you get these white uniforms? Made them. We made them. We made white dresses for commencemnt. You see, we didn't wear blue blouses and blue skirts and white blouses and blue skirts on Commencement Day. We made these white dresses. In 1911, they made special hats, but after, when I came to graduate, we didn't have on hats. We just wore the white dresses. And we'd line up way over in front of White Hall and the band would play and we'd march into chapel for graduation. And everything else would go on just about as usual other than the speaking demonstrations. And there were exhibits all over the campus because we'd have open house on those days and people would come to see the school. Farmers' Conference was just about the same thing. Farmers' Conference was a big day too here, as well as commencement. Thank you very much. Now is this about the year 1915? Graduation was 1915. 1915. And to the extent that you can remember, what did you do when you left Tuskegee? Did you go on to school? Or did you work? What was the life like when you left Tuskegee? All right. When I graduated, I had worked so hard that I was ver^ very tired. My sisters and my mother, Esther was a little girl, they all came to graduation.ï»¿53 (cont) After graduat ion on the campus, the students usually had a big dance and had a good time. I was too tired and all of them worried about me. I had gotten very thin and so I wanted to leave right away. We left right after Commencement and Mama stopped me with Miss Shaw, a cousin of ours. She wouldn't take me home because she felt that I needed to rest. And I rested at Cousin Rosa Shaw's in Laurenburg, North Carolina. I stayed there about two weeks before we went home. We had started applying for work and I had been accepted before I left Tuskegee because, if you took education, you took the Alabama Board here and if you passed, you received a certificate, and I knew I was eligible to teach in Alabama. I had an offer at Winston-Salem and I had an offer in Dothan, Alabama. Because I wasn't sure we had transferred the certificate into North Carolina to teach, I didn't take a chance on it. So 1 came to Dothan to teach in the public schools. But I only came to Dothan because that was offered and I felt I had to work. I wanted to go to work right away. L wanted to go to school. I had applied at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee, but when they wrote back, they told me about the examination I'd have to take for entrance and I thought I wasn't prepared for that. So I said, I'll work a while, I won't go on straight to school. All of my dreams for education and working were as the dreams of most people who were almost marked by Dr. Washington and Dr. Carver. I think and I can almost say that we all felt we wanted to work where there could be a "blessed community." When I worked in the public schools in Dothan, we had a principal, a Professor McCray. There are only two things that I want to mention about Dothan. I joined the church there, joined Cherry St. Church, my second church, and was very active in the church. In the school, most of the women were old and they were always trying to tell you what to do. That disturbed me a little bit and so, as an old woman, eighty years old, I am still very sensitive about what I say to young people. I say it, but I laugh and take it back. I'm just like the other old people, I know everything. I know all the answers, but I am a little different m that those old people would get mad if you didn't take their advice. I would give advice and laugh because of how I was treated at this school; not only were the old folks giving me advice, but they were sending children from the class and Professor McCray would beat them. This was in 1915,1915-16. He would get switches. Most of them were boys and the boys would run all around the house. My class was upstairs. They would run around the house and he would try to catch them. I didn't care what the children did in my room, I never sent them out. Now, the mistake the principal made was when he'd have teachers in meetings there, he'd say, "Now, Miss Simmons doesn't have that trouble. She never sends anybody out of her classroom." So the older women began to hate me and said I was making it hard for them because they were about to pass a law that you don't send them out. I made up my mind then that corporal punishment was not good for me. Really, I can't tell you how ridiculous it was. I can see those little boys running all around the house and laughing at old Professor McCray and he used to run after them. He'd get a boy to help catch other boys and then he'd whip them and go back into the classroom. They'd do the same thing over again at recess. The boys just laughed andï»¿54 (cont) planned what they were going to do to the teacher next time. I said corporal punishment is not it. I taught there two years. If you look back at my life, you will know that I came up under a hierarchy and I still am that way. Anywhere I go, I look to see who is in charge. I'm not a radical. I'm not a trailblazer, which is not a compliment, but I can't help it now. I follow in the line that is set up. Who's in charge? So, there was nothing I could do because of the many old women. Old women did not retire from school then because you had no retirement fund. That's why they stayed there until "Death do us part." They would tell stories about their ages. They would stay. About that time, a girl who was my roommate at Tuskegee, Mary Ross, came to Dothan and said, "Hattie, I am the principal of a Rosenwald school in my home, Blufton, Georgia." She said, "I am having a difficult time getting teachers. We have about eight teachers. But I wish you would come. We've offered you a job and we feel that you can help us a lot. And you'd live right in my house." I went to visit Mary. Mary Ross lived in a house almost as big as a hotel. Her father looked like an Indian. Mother Ross was an invalid and sat in a big chair, a great big, fat black woman sat in a big chair and talked â never stopped talking. The house had a porch all around it and Papa Ross had property and had people working for him like slaves. There were little houses all around for people who worked for him. Then he had one son who wasn't married. Byat lived in the home, Byat Ross. He had another son who lived in a home not so far away from him and this son had children. Mother Ross ruled that roost. She had women who came in and did everything. I was delighted that this was a "blessed community." Mary and I rode to school in a little buggy, a little buggy with a horse. The school was some miles away from the Ross home. Another friend of mine and I were roommates upstairs in the room across the house. At night we heard a car come to that house most every week. And for some reason we knew that we should stay upstairs. This is the truth and so we decided that we were going to find out what came in the car. So we decided that we were going to peek. And one night, one of us, perhaps me (laughter), I don't think I was the one â that's terrible. We went downstairs after the person in that car came in the door â a handsome white man and we found out that he was Mary Ross's boyfriend. Where he came from, I've forgotten. I think he was up from Florida, I can't remember. Mary was a tall girl with beautiful hair, brown, quite brown. But when she came to Tuskegee, she was older and she always had plenty of everything. This other girl, my roommate was from Tuskegee too. We were satisfied though, after we visited Mary's house, that her father took care of her. Whole bales of cotton, all sorts of fruit, everything that was marketed was all around. The house was way out in the country and we just loved it, because .1 had longed for a "blessed community." Well, we pretended that we didn't see him and I took my roommate back upstairs as fast as I could. Then we always heard Mary and this man in the living room because we lived right above the living room. Before we left there, Mary was pregnant. But we knew she didn't have another boyfriend. People in the community - I don't know if they knew. At that time, the stylish dresses were high waists. Mary made dresses for all of us, we dressed alike. She bought material and helped us. She knew we knew, and all of us looked like we were pregnant. She kept on teaching. She taught until almost the last and Mary said she was going away. I served as principal. I shouldn'tï»¿55 HSK: (cont) have called her name. Well, it is all right, she's dead, but she has relatives right here in Tuskegee. I worked at Mary Ross's school, this Rosenwald school,fur two years. I think I will tell you why I was interested in the Rosenwald school. Mr. Rosenwald, at the request of Booker T. Washington, saw that there were no schools for Negroes and he gave dollar for dollar. In any community, starting around Tuskegee, spread all over the United States, all over the Southern states for every dollar you would raise, the Rosenwald Fund would give you money. That's why many of the schools, elementary schools for blacks, were Rosenwald schools, they were built like that. Most of them were built just alike. So Mary's school was a Rosenwald school and I was interested because Rosenwald was a trustee of Tuskegee Institute and I had seen him many times coming here. When someone called and asked for a teacher to teach summer school at Fort Gaines, Georgia, I went. When I went to teach summer school in Fort Gaines, we just had a good time. We lived with a family. Another thing that was impressed upon us at Tuskegee -Booker Washington had been abroad and I understand his idea about school was from abroad; that if the principal and his wife lived in the school and some students boarded in the school, they could best help people learn how to live. So, New Rising Star, which is near Tuskegee was that type of school. A couple lived in the school and we went out and observed. So,always, I wanted to live near the school and felt that how I lived would be of help to people. When we went to Fort Gaines, we lived with a family, the man was a trustee of the school. I was teaching alone in the school, but so many students came, I sent for my sister, Ann. Ann came and we taught in this church and we had programs. A part of the school work was to fix the stage and put the curtain up, write the plays and have exhibits. When we had commencement, we had an exhibit. My sister Ann was very good in crafts. She had been to Hampton Institute - the same type of school that I had attended - and we had things made from nothing. We had dresses made from sacks and all sorts of things made from nothing. alt hsk alt Bishop William D. Johnson was having a conference near Fort Gaines or in Fort Gaines in the town. His wife was invited to our commencement and she was so impressed that she said she wanted to talk with me. So she said, "We have a college." They called this a college, Johnson Industrial College. I visited there and I said, "Now, a very 'blessed community,' " â two big two-story buildings right out in the country. Plains (Georgia) is as small as a town can be and Archery (Georgia) was two or three miles out from Plains. Now, what state is this? Georgia. Oh, in Georgia. Plains, Georgia? Fort Gaines is in Georgia. We were in Georgia now. So, I decided not to go back to Mary's school. From what I can understand, I think she stopped teaching. But I didn't go back to Blufton. I went to Archery, Georgia, to beï»¿56 HSK: (cont) principal of this schoo], which was quite an honor. Mrs. Johnson used to brag that "this is the only colored woman, president of a college." I think we had about eight or nine grades. We had some old people who from their age, could have been in college, but not from what they knew; but they called it a college. It was a private school and Mrs. Johnson was eager to have the County put some money into it. So I had to go to the Superintendent and I visited the schools around. I had to make a survey and see how many children there were. There were just a few children. There weren't more than about twenty families, colored families, in the whole two miles from Archery. But I found out, and the County appropriated a certain amount of money to this school for the teaching of these children, so that made us have from first grade on up as high as students were able to go. We taught them according to what they were ready for. But our grade work was really graded. I remember, we were so pleased with our school that we sent for my sister Esther. And Esther went to school there in Archery. If ever there was poverty, this school was one. The dining room was in a little shack off from these two buildings, and often, the meal was boiled, salted peanuts. This was in, it had to be 1918, and I think everywhere we were having a difficult time. And 1915 to 1916, 1916 to 1917, I taught in Dothan, Alabama. 1918 and 1919 I taught in Blufton, so this was about 1920. I was teaching in Archery and we had to beg money. Mrs. Johnson went to all the conferences. When the Bishop had a conference and other conferences in the area, she would go to the conferences and talk about the school and people would give money. So that was the way that money was gotten. After I was there a year, she started me going to the conferences. I'd make a talk to all those men and she felt that they responded to my talks. I dressed very well. I've never had many clothes, but what I got was good. And I looked good, they said, and I always was very, very free talking with men. That's what the ministers needed, and yet, I kept my distance. Sometimes I'd get $100 and $200 at each conference and take it back to the school. Then I started traveling with a play. To me, this was a 'blessed community' and this was the type of place I wanted to teach in. At Archery, we would go and give concerts in Americus, Georgia. When I went to Archery of course, I took my sister with me. She sang and I played. We'd sing in Americus and we were acquainted with a doctor, Dr. Pughley, and a lot of people there, so we had lots of fun when we would go back and forth from Americus. We sent for other friends to come and teach in Archery. I've never put Archery on my resume because the school was discontinued after Bishop Johnson died. I think they carried on a little while. But when I heard Jimmy Carter saying that his farm was two miles from Plains at Archery, Georgia, then I began to think about it. In Jimmy Carter's book, Why Not The Best, he mentions Bishop Johnson as a leading family man in that community. And he tells how Bishop Johnson would come to his home to talk to his father, but he'd ride in his car and they would sit out in the back yard and talk. I was at Archery in the early '20s and Jimmy Carter wasn't born. Whether hisï»¿57 (cont) family was there or not, I don't know because what he says in his book is of later years. For instance, he mentions Alvin Johnson whom I taught in third grade. He talks about Alvin as a man who was studying in Boston and who would come back and forth to Archery, and he says that Alvin was the first colored man that came in their front door and sat down and talked. He said when Alvin would come, his father would go on out in the back like he didn't know him, but his mother would sit down and ask him about his education. Then I think back of something else about Archery which I never thought much about until Jimmy Carter started talking. He's running for President and he mentions Plains, Georgia, a lot. In his book he mentions Archery. Then it made me think of some other things. In 1970, I had a friend teaching here, a white friend who spent most of the time in my home, Sally Robinson. I found out later that she was working on a Jfasters and was doing some studies here, but she was teaching out in the country. One day we began talking about Conmere Farms, Conmere Gardens they call it now. It was in Georgia and she was surprised to know that I knew all about Conmere. Mr. Charles G. Gomillion and other people had gone there and it was the only interracial thing they knew about. A man from the North had started it and I said, "Ooh, I'd like to share." She said, "I'd like to go to Conmere Farms," I said, "I'll go along with you." We were riding along and I never noticed where we were until we got to Plains. I said, "Girl, we're right out from a place where I used to teach." We rode on and I saw the railroad and I looked up and saw the church and I said, "That school was across the railroad from the church." She said, "Well, let's stop and ask the family." We stopped and a colored lady came out. We asked her if she knew anything about Bishop Johnson's school and she said, "What's left of it is right down there." She said his daughter Fanny was the last teacher, and she said,"If you ride over that railroad you will go right down there." So we rode over the railroad and went down there. One building was down all together and, all on the ground, were Bishop Johnson's papers, his pictures and all the Bishop's reports ... all over the ground. And the building was falling down. I picked up a few of the pictures. I picked up some books that I knew but that was most interesting. Back in the '70s, I went back. In 1919, as near as I can guess, 1923, I must have stayed in Archery two years. Things were really too difficult. They were just too hard. I just could not continue to live like that. So I went back to New York. I said I am going back to school. So I went to New York and stayed at a "Y" and took Esther with me and I said, 'Well, Esther can go to school and we'll both go to school." I had saved enough money and then I worked I got a job on the side. I had the most interesting job in New York. We had material ... you put something down and just put a little paste over it and then put beads over it. I can't call the name, but when you took it up, you had beads all on the garment, or silver things, or whatever you wanted to paste on that. It was beautiful, but it was easy work and I decided I would stay in New York and send Esther to school. Every time I'd go home to the Y.W.C.A. Building, there were all sorts of men there to see Esther. She was, I don't know how old she was, but she was in her teens I guess - old enough to be attractive. When I went on the streetsï»¿58 HSK: (cont) by myself, I never saw a man look back at me, but they began to look at Esther and I began to get frightened. I said, "Oh, my Lord!" I did a very interesting thing that I don't tell. But it is all right. I went to a spiritualist church one night â I didn't believe in them, but you pass them in New York like holes in the walls, you just see the signs. It wasn't far from the "Y". So I went back to this spiritualist church and the man said, "I want to come to a lady in the back with the so and so on." This is the truth if I ever told it. Now maybe I told somebody at the door, I don't know, but "You're from the South, you're from the South. You are trying to decide what to do. Go back to the South, there's no place for you here. This is your father. Your father has come to me, go back to the South." I got up out of that place. I had already been attending summer school in Cheyney, Pennsylvania, and was well-known there. I attended summer school in Cheyney the summer before. From the time I finished Tuskegee, 1915, I never missed a summer or a year in school. I always felt that if you're going to work, you ought to keep on studying, for sone reason. Then, Southern women took their vacation that way. So I would go to Philadelphia and go on out to Cheyney, Pennsylvannia, and go on to school. So, I called Dr. Hill, the President. I said, "It's too late for me to make a formal application. I want to bring my sister there to school." He said, "Well, we know you and if you recommend her, bring her on. But we can't classify her." I said, "Well, that's all right, just if I can bring her there." Honey, I bundled Esther up. Poor Esther, I won't even talk to her about it. I bundled Esther up to go to Cheyney; put her in school; went back to New York; gave up my job; and came to Fayetteville, N.C. I can't remember now, how I happened to go right in to work, I just can't remember that, but I began working in the public school at home on Orange Street. I wasn't satisfied with that because it was in the public school system again where everything was just mill work. I've never been satisfied with schools, I wanted a 'blessed community,' but Archery was killing me. They couldn't raise enough money for food. And Mrs. Johnson would try. Bishop Johnson would go and then people were getting critical of him. He'd started out with an insurance company and that had gone down and it began to be questionable about money that was being raised. You know a long time ago a Bishop ... I don't know why he handled so much money. That isn't true now. They have business managers. But I began to question the cause. When Bishop Johnson would come, we'd have to count pennies and nickles and all that and I didn't like that. And sometimes, we were paid $20 and $30 in nickles and dimes and quarters. I didn't like that, I didn't know. But he's dead so I reckon he hears me, but it is the truth. So I started working in Orange Street under Prof. Edward Evans, the same man who was principal when I went to school. I didn't see him whip the children, but I saw a very rigid set-up. My salvation was the church and I went back to my same Evans Metropolitan Church and I started teaching Sunday school. I had 30 men. This was the delightful part of my work in Fayetteville, North Carolina. I had 30 men in our class. The Sunday school lesson was so interesting that we decided that we'd start meeting on a week night. We met on a week night and for some reason or another, we decided to read a littleï»¿59 HSK: (cont) book called, What Would Jesus Do? As I can recall. What Would Jesus Do? I remember. But, anyhow, it was What Would Jesus Do? And we decided that we would do what we thought Jesus would do. The pastor of the Church, Reverend Benj amin Robeson (very few people know Ben but they all know his brother, Paul Robeson). Paul Robeson's brother was our pastor. Ben Robeson and Mrs. Robeson decided to join with us. And we had meetings on What Would Jesus Do? The Church turned into a kind of Quaker meeting for those of usâ who were in it---- even my mother wouldn't join with us because sometimes I would get out and go to Church late at night. My mama said, "Baby, you can't do it." My mother was a good Christian, but she couldn't take that. If we saw anything in the papers, we didn't do anything but just say something. If we heard that people were cheating or stealing we just testified about it without calling a name. I never saw anybody in the upstairs of that Church until we started. I was the organist and the Bishop's daughter was the director and she thought she'd join with us. And sometimes I would start playing and they would sing. We didn't practice, we decided that we'd sing the songs we knew. We'd stop singing anthems. Rev. Robeson would start preaching. I remember once he came in the pulpit with a rose in his hand, (laughter) And handed me that rose. It liked to kill my mama. Honey, the Bishop came, they sent for the Bishop. The Bishop came and told them, "You have to stop that foolishness in the church." ^LT: why would they object to it? HSK alt Hsk Alt hsk You start it and they would stop you. It's breaking up a Church program. I see. And you don't break into the program of a Church. I see. We would, any of us, you see, everybody in the Church was not a member of this What Would Jesus Do? group. But those of us who were, we might get up and speak or say something. Sometimes Ben would get up and look and say something. And sometimes he'd just stand and look at the audience. And sometimes we would start singing. There were two or three in the choir who were with us, but whatever we started the congregation would join in but they were frightened to death. The Church was crowded, Bishop came and Ed, the same Ed Evans, said, "We are going to lock up the Church. Can't have that in the Church. The Devil's work." So we said, '&11 right, have to lock it up." We were always sweet and quiet but we didn't stop what we were doing. And they locked up the Church and Benjamin and the crowd of us went to homes and started having meetings. I don't know what happened at the Church. I can't recall. But I know we stopped having meetings at the Church. But my mother was so excited about it and it worried her so until I know now that my sister, Alberta Simms, maneuvered and Mr. Roberts of Tuskegee wrote me. Well, Ed Evans sent the white superintendent of Fayetteville Schools to see me and said that if I stayed with that group, I couldn't teach. I said, "Thank you very much." Got a letter from Bert; also a letter from Mr. Roberts of Tuskegee who was head of the academic department: theyï»¿60 HSK: (cont) needed a teacher at the Childrens' House. "Come at once." Mama picked me up so fast, my head was swimming! Oooh, she packed me up! And got me ... but I was kind of glad to get out of it. After we moved to the house, people began to say so many things about the little group and we were trying to do what Christ would do. But anyhow, I came on to Tuskegee, it was 1923. I can't get that wrong. I came to Tuskegee and started immediately working at the Children's House. Somebody must have dropped out. I don't know what it was, but I know it was Sister Alberta Simms. You know, I never accused her of it and the reason I didn't talk about it was because Fayetteville, North Carolina, and my work with the church there was so questionable with Mama and Bert. They were so sad about it. They just thought it was terrible. Mama knew they were going to drop me from the system. And she just thought that it was a disgrace, but we didn't care. And so I came to Tuskegee to teach. alt hsk alt Was your sister Bert then living in Tuskegee? Yes. She was living here. She was living here then. I see. HSR: Mr. Simms was working for Tuskegee Institute. I think he was a financial agent in some sort of way. I really don't know, but she lived here in that big house in which her daughter Lillian,I think was born. But she lived in a big house on what we call Montgomery Road. And when she sent for me, she sent for me to come and I stayed with her. I didn't stay on the campus until perhaps the next year. I just don't recall. But I came to Tuskegee. Now the Children's House, to me, was almost like the public school system. And I was not particular about working in it. But I joined the church here. And the pastor of the church - although I was AME Zion - the AME pastor had me join the church. I had charge of the children and the children used to come running in the afternoon to church. We had a good time. We'd sing and we'd pray and I started the same thing over again but started with children. And we'd talk and we'd pray and it made it a glorious community. The principal, however, Miss Laura Jones, was quite a lovely lady. I didn't think of the Children's House as a thing that was as rewarding as I wanted it to be until, (and I'm going to skip way up) a Dr. Bond came to serve as dean of the School of Education. Dr. Bond was like Booker Washington and I understood him. Nobody else did and he had a hard time. He came to the school and he said, "Don't have the children march." He said, "How are these children going to learn how to walk out of the assembly room if you're going to play a march and march out?" Inez Pitts, I recall the name, was in charge of the music then, she would give BONG! (chord on the piano) The children would rise. BONG! and they'd turn. (Sings) Bumpety Bump, Bumpety Bump (piano march). And they'd march out. I said, "Dr. Bond, I agree with you." I said, "Now you must remember that pandemonium would break out first because these children are not accustomed to walking out." He said, "Well, she can play quiet music. Anything she wants to play. But no marches." So we tried it and honey, pandemonium broke out. Those children didn't even hear the music. They just ran out the first two or three times, but I knewï»¿61 HSK: (cont) that was going to happen so it didn't worry me but it worried Inez Pitts and the teachers. "Hattie West and Dr. Bond are just going stone crazy and letting these children do as they please. They're just going to break up the place." But Dr. Bond came down to visit once to see how it was getting along. The children were in assembly and he came to the door and Inez said, "(chords on piano) BONG! BONG! Stand! Turn! Bumpety Bumpety Bump! (march)," He said, "I thought you said ..." I said, "Well, I thought they were walking out. We'll try it again." Couldn't get to first base. Teachers ganged up on me. Said, "We're not going to let you break up this school." All right. Couldn't do it. Let me back up a little bit. I came to Tuskegee in 1924 and then I'll come back to that. I came in 1924 and Mrs. Simms and her husband were here and Mr. Simms was more like Professor Carver than anybody I had ever seen. ALT: This is your brother-in-law? HSK: Yes, my sister's husband. My oldest sister's husband. She was in the music department here, then, teaching piano and teaching public school music. In 1924, there was a shoemaker who had been here since 1901-,but his wife died and his wife was a very dear friend of my sister's . So my sister was to sing at the funeral, at the Baptist Church. And I played for her to sing "I've Done My Work" as I can recall, or something like that. And I don't know whether Mr. West saw me then, maybe not. But one day, I was coming home from school and Mrs. Simms said, "I want these flowers to go on Mrs. West's grave." This was after the funeral and everything. "Go by the shoe shop and leave these flowers and leave these shoes." So I went by the shoe shop and left them. And that's when, as far as I know, Mr. West saw me. One day after that, I was coming from school, (I don't think Mrs. West had been dead a year) and he stopped and said, "I want to thank you for the flowers." And I said, "Well, I didn't give them. My sister sent them. I told you." "Well, will you ride on home?" I said, "Sure." So I got into his little car and rode up to the home. Across the street there were friends of Mrs. West. They put it out that Frank West was going with a young teacher. His wife was hardly cold. They talked and talked. Then another day, they really talked. And then another day, Mr. West passed and said, "You know, I'm sorry that people misunderstood our being together." I said, "Well, I don't care." Because I thought of him as an old man. He was just about fifteen years older than I, but I just thought he was an old man so what difference did it make? He said, "You don't mind?" I said, "No, I don't mind." He said, "Well, come on, will you ride around the block?" I said, "Sure." I got into the car and we rode to Chehaw, Alabama. He was a very intelligent man. People used to go to Chehaw for amusement, to see the train come in and all. He didn't stop at Chehaw. We rode all around and we talked. We had read some of the same articles, so we came home and talk started then. But contrary to what you would believe, his daughters began to write me letters.ï»¿62 ALT: Oh, he had daughters? HSK: Yes. He had grown daughters. Arnena, his oldest daughter, was teaching at the Children's House. She was a home economics teacher and my classroom was right next to hers. When I came, I started teaching the third grade and so my classroom was right next to hers. And she was just crazy about me. We spent a lot of time together. Alphia and I were taking French from Mr. Dorma. And she began to write me notes in French. Because we were trying to, you know, show that we could speak it, I guess. So then I left, I went to Hampton Institute that first summer - it must have been the summer of 1925. Mr. Frank West was coming to see me a little too often and I felt that I wanted to and I just went on to Hampton that summer. Mr. Harry Simms had been called to serve as principal of one of Tuskegee Institute's big branch schools, Snow Hill. And Dr. Robert Moton, who was President at Hampton sent for me. He said, "We want a Children's House down at Snow Hill. Will you go?" I said, "I'll be delighted." And I think I said it because I wanted to get away from Mr. West. People were talking and I felt sorry for him so I went out with him more than I would have. So I told Dr. Moton, "I'd be delighted." And he said, "You will?" I said, "Yes." He said, "All right. You can come back to the Children's House whenever you care to." So I told him, "I'd be delighted." Because I wanted to be with my sister and brother anyway. I went down to Snow Hill, took charge of the elementary school and that was another 'blessed community' experience I had. I used to ride with Mr. Simms all through the country to various farms and places and hear him speak to the people. Snow Hill is not so far from Tuskegee. It's not so far from Selma, Alabama. But Dr. Moton still was surprised that I would leave the Children's House and work at Snow Hill. I went down to take charge of the practice school, an elementary school at Snow Hill. Snow Hill was also a private school at that time. It existed from money that was given by people who were philanthropically inclined. But we wanted to get some money from the county. So, I went to the Superintendent and asked if I could visit the surrounding elementary schools. There weren't but two or three schools in the radius of five or ten miles. I visited them, then I recommended that they get transportation and let all the children be taught at Snow Hill elementary school - children in grades one through eight - and that teachers who taught in those schools or teachers whom they planned to put in those schools be assigned to the elementary school that we were running. I don't remember how much money we got from it, it must not have been very much. I don't even remember my salary there because that wasn't important to me. I had one friend, Betsy Mitchell, who came to work there. She taught home economics and crafts. The other teachers always taught the other elementary subjects which were requirements of the county. Betsy, every Saturday, made ice cream. I remember a big old ice cream container. We sold homemade ice cream. I remember how we sold chicken sandwiches and we always wanted to get ten sandwiches out of a chicken. I don't know today how we gotï»¿63 HSK: (cont) ten sandwiches out of a chicken. But always when I met Betsy after that, she said, "Thank the Lord, I don't have to make homemade ice cream and sell chicken sandwiches!" We sold them to raise money for the extra things that we needed, because paper, pencils and anything that we needed, we had to buy. Whatever money was gotten from the county was not even sufficient to pay the teachers that we had there, but they did give them a stipend. Betsy and I lived on the campus. I don't remember about the other teachers (where they lived). But we lived on the campus and were a part of the setup there. Betsy sang contralto; my sister, Mrs. Simms, sang soprano and we had a wonderful choir. That choir sang all around for people. We had a dining room there and the mother who had charge, as I can recall, in the dining room had a little son. I have a picture with that boy and that boy is now a trustee of Tuskegee Institute and lives in California. Also my sister's oldest sonwent there and he was as smart as a whip. He used to get into the tractors and you couldn't see his head. Ride the tractors, break up the ground. All of us would cry because we were afraid Noble had hurt himself. I taught at Snow Hill Institute two years. I dorf tknow why I came back to Tuskegee but let me ... ALT: ALT: HSK: ALT; HSK: ALT: HSK: ALT: Well, let me ask you Oh! I know. I know. Mr. West. Instead of getting rid of Mr. West, I fell in love with him. He kept coming down there and we decided to get married. So we got married in the chapel at Snow Hill. Not so long ago a stout girl came to Tuskegee and said, "Mrs. Kelly, do you know me?" I said, "No." She said, "I was Mr. Edwards' granddaughter. I was the flower girl at your wedding." We had a big wedding in the chapel. My honeymoon was a trip from Snow Hill to Tuskegee. Frank and I stopped in Montgomery and that was our honeymoon. And we came on to Tuskegee. I married in May, I guess, I'm not so sure, it's a shame. But I know in September I went on back to work at the Children's House. How did he feel about that? Well, he never wanted me to work. How did you work that out? I didn't work it out. I walked out. Oh? I walked out. My husband, Frank West, was a taskmaster. I think he was harder than my father. My father was hard enough but Frank West was harder. He often cried; he begged me not to work. I appreciated it, but his salary was $75 a month. Did you know why he did not want you to work? He didn't want me to ... he'd tell me he wanted me for himself. He wouldï»¿64 HSK: (cont) say that, "I want you for myself, alone. I don't want you up there. I don't want you working." I never said anything back to him, but for some reason or another, I knew I had to work. I looked at him and told him I could not live on $75 a month. We lived in the school's house. I said, "Frank, I've never lived in a rented house." He said, "You are not living in a rented house. You don't pay a thing." He said, "You get this house, the electricity, the water, all free of charge," but in cash we got only $75 a month. I told him, I could not live on $75 a month. And I went on to work. Well, Annette was born and I still worked. I worked seven months pregnant with her. In the seventh month, Frank and I were riding out and a car bumped into us. It wasn't serious. We came home ... it was on a Sunday afternoon. I was so sure, I couldn't move and I sent for Mrs. Anna Campbell who was a nurse. I told her, I said, "I really think I am going to lose my baby." She inspected me and said, "'No, you're not but you ought to go to the hospital." So, I went to the hospital. It was in April. It was on the eve of the clinic and the doctors elevated my legs and told me I wouldn't lose my baby. A Dr. Krumph who came here every year for the clinic came in to see me and he said, "Do you want this baby?" and I said, "Yes." Then he said to the other doctors, "Just let her go home." He said have a chair from place to place and sit in that chair and don't walk around too much. School was closing at the end of May and Annette was born on the 29th of May. She came with difficulty, but she was born quite normal. I planned to be away from work all that next year, but somebody was out and they called me back. And that's why I said, I never missed a year teaching, because it was just from April or the last of March to September that I was out. How did you manage that with a young baby and a husband who did not want you to work and yet you returned? How did you ... ? HSR: alt. All the time that I worked, i had very lovely women who came in. I never left home until they got there. They were there by 7:30 A.M. and they never left until I came from work and that was true as long as I worked, up until 1962. I never left my home without leaving a woman there to do the cooking and the cleaning. I think that's one of the reasons why I am so well-preserved. I never did do five or six jobs at once. Ruth and Alphia went to school at Hampton Institute. Arnena was teaching but she did not live with us. Her friends thought that we should have our honeymoon alone, so she lived over with the William H. Carters for a long time and we lived alone. But after Annette was born, Arnena came back to live with us and she really was the mother. Annette was with her almost all of the time. So I left Snow Hill, because I married Frank West and gave up that work and came back to work at the Children's House. But before you leave that, you mentioned that one of the reasons you went back to work was because the cash that he earned was not really enough. How did you work your income into the family budget or did you?ï»¿65 With both my husbands, we always did separate things. I was old when I married the first time. I think I was 30 years old when Annette was born. I had been working since 1915. I had been counselor for married couples who were miserable â who had lost their lives by getting too close to each other, so I never got close to either one of my husbands. My business was my business and his business was his and we decided what each one would do. I did what I was supposed to do, but I had nothing to do with what he was supposed to do. With the Frank West situation, the only thing I did was to pay the woman who stayed at my home, who did the washing, the ironing, the cooking, the cleaning of the house. If I sent things to the laundry, I paid for them. All the cleaning was done by those women who stayed at my house. But I took charge of that. Now all of the other stuff my husband paid for. All the food. That was in the first house. When we went up to the other house, my husband was not so well and would be retiring soon. We had built a house. My salary was larger then. I decided that I would pay the notes on the house. He had made the downpayment on the house. We moved out of the school's house then, and moved into our own. So, I had two obligations; I paid the lady who stayed here and I paid the car bill and the reason I did that was because Arnena was back living with us. She did most of the cooking herself. They didn't want the lady to cook. She did most of the cooking, but the lady did the cleaning, especially downstairs. They never bothered Arnena's room. They didn't have as much to do, because when Arnena came home, she'd take charge of Annette and all that type of thing. So I made the payments on the house and paid the lady who worked with us. My husband was responsible for everything else. So, we never had to discuss, unless there was a lack of something; if the food wasn't sufficient or something, then we'd make out lists together. My children were home economists -they cooked. I never had anything all that hard to do because they lived with us. But we did have conflicts about my going. My husband didn't want me to go to a meeting at the Children's House. He didn't want me to stay at a staff meeting. I taught for a while and then,after Miss Fair retired, I was made principal of the Children's House. So, if they had a meeting, he always said that if you're going from eight a.m. to three p.m. that is long enough and you leave that Children's House at three o'clock. But he wasn't pulling me away to take me home from work. He would take me fishing. I did a lot of fishing. I did a lot of hunting. We used to go hunting early in the morning. There were places all around where he used to go fishing. There were people on the way to Montgomery who had private lakes. My husband made shoes for them. One man, I remember was a doctor, had a lovely private lake. There was a key to the gate and I remember Frank always had to go up to the house to get the key; but we'd ride in and get in that old boat and fish in the afternoon. And then there was the Chehaw Lake. There were fish all around there. Then Abbotts, we had Abbotts Lake, way out. Not this Abbott, isn't that funny. Way out here, there was a deepï»¿66 hsk: (cont) artificial lake that Tuskegee had built that we used to fish in. ALT: HSK: alt hsk alt Hsk My friends couldn't understand why I never took offense when my husband came for me. I remember once, I was having a faculty meeting at the Children's House. Frank came and he said, "I've come for my wife." And I said, "Excuse me, Mrs. Flake would you take charge, I have to go." I walked out and when I looked back, the teachers were all coming out laughing. But I went on to the car and left. I remember, the same thing would happen when I went to council meetings. But, it was out of Frank's inter- pretation of love,and I took it as best I could, relationship. So, that was the type of There's one other question, you mentioned going to summer school and in continuing your education. During this period wereyou able to continue your education, or did it stop while you were teaching at Children's House? No. It didn't stop because we went to school at Tuskegee Institute. Tuskegee has night school and evening schools. Most of the summer schools that I would name to you, I went to prior to my marriage to Frank West. I went to Cheyney State Teachers College, Cheyney, Pa. I went to Hampton Institute.* I went to Johnson C. Smith University in^Charlotte, North Carolina. I went to Winston-Salem Teachers' College summer school. Those summer schools were before I married Frank West. When I married Mr. West, I still didn't have a B.S. degree. Most people here most older people didn't have the degrees then. Most of them didn't have the normal school work that I had. Tuskegee still had night schools and school on Saturday. After we got off from work we went. Frank objected to that, but we went anyway. Arnena and I went to school on Saturday; we went to school at night and I received my degree in 1934. I was teaching at the Children's House when I received my B.S. degree. People were congratulating me. I said, "Well, I finished high school in 1915 and I didn't get the B.S. degree until 1934, I don't need any congratulations." When did you find time to study? Oh, we just used to stay up all night and study. After the class at night ... For the most part. At that time I was principal, and was not teaching at the Children's House. But even when I taught, I still studied at night. Arnena and I would get together and study and we both made very good grades. So, during the time that I was married to Frank West, I always went to school here. I had all of my credits transferred to Tuskegee Institute. But you didn't get much credit because most of those schools were four-week summer schools and the only reason I could get any credit for courses was because at every school I went to I took courses to qualify for teaching education in that state. Many of the older women went and took things that would help them. I didn't care whether they would help me or not. I took ** Hanipton, Virginia. "inston-Salem, North Carolinaï»¿67 (cont) what was required for education by that state. How I knew that so well, I don't know, but I did. Every little point I had came to Tuskegee and was given some credit; but not much because they were short courses. Sometimes it was a half a point, half a quarter hour. I was talking about Dr. J. Max Bond. Dr. Bond came to serve as dean of the School of Education before my husband died. He wanted things changed. He wanted the children to have freedom and experiences that were more creative. And that's very difficult, very, very, difficult. At that time, parents were buying the books. The state didn't buy the books and a parent would have a fit if you didn't teach 'page ten!' And if you want to teach creatively, you can't do so well with 'page ten.' I had been to Winnetka, Illinois, and observed there. The Winnetka school was a public school whose head, Carl Washburn, said, "The progressive schools should not be schools that were just set aside for certain children. The public schools could be progressive schools." So, in the Winnetka system, we had what we called goal cards. The plan went by ages more than grades, two-year-olds together and five and six-year-olds. We had a goal for every age. Every room at the Winnetka was like a library. Each child had his own part of this bookcase (pockets) that was built around the wall. The teacher had the goal card and objectives for that particular age group in that particular subject. If a child was supposed to learn to add numbers and so-and-so by a certain time, then that was there. Somebody had worked it out. So the whole thing you did - well, the child learned that and they could work around with each other more like a library. The child learned that if you put a date out there, you learned this. If you didn't know this, if you were six years old and could not do whatever was on that, then the card would not be signed. But the next year he would go on with the seven-year-olds. His goal card would go with him and that teacher knew that she was responsible for helping him with that. That was the morning part of the day. In the afternoon, all the children were engaged in some kind of activity. They either had a printing office and printing. We had cooking. There were preparing meals, or they were sewing and preparing things for their dolls or for something. In the afternoon, they were in school. When I observed there, a Mr. Logan was in charge. I went there and I said, "I have come to observe the Winnetka plan." He said, "Madam, our plan changes every day - what you have read about Winnetka, you can just forget about it and just observe what is going on here now. Now, at this time ... we are having this difficulty." He said, "At first we went as far as the elementary school and children lived creatively; they knew the skills, but all their cards were just a statement that we summarized from their goal cards. We found that the high school wouldn't accept Winnetka school graduates, so we added a high school. Students went on through high school the same way, by using contracts." Now when you are teaching, you had three contracts. The first contract was something that the child could look at and get from a book. The next contractï»¿68 HSK: (cont) was something he could do; but he couldn't do it unless he knew what was In that book. And the third contract was something creative that he did. He might write a play or he might give his opinion of what he had read. Very few students got to that third contract. Then the children were not accepted in any colleges. So, he said, "I don't know what we are going to do. We've gone through a period of general txaisition and I think we are going to change." Children were smart and we noticed all of them moving all around in there, but pandemonium didn't break out. I also worked in the Little Red School House in New York and it was the same way. All these places I visited before I married. I was working at the Children's House, I was teaching there. At the Little Red School House, they taught the same way. The children knew what they were to do because it was written and they could go on with whatever they were to do. A child would come to school, the teacher might not say anything. They'd come and get what they had to do and start working and another child might help him. I also observed a long time in what they call the Ethical Culture School in Brooklyn. I think most of the teachers were Jewish. Dr. Bond felt that some of the teachers at Winnetka would perhaps help us at the Children's House. So some of the teachers I had met at Winnetka came to the Children's House and we tried to work out some plan that would help the children learn the tool subjects and engage in life-related activities. When we started, the teachers tried and tried. I can't think of a single teacher who was sympathetic with the program. They were angry, first of all, because the women who were helping them were white. They were angry secondly, because they said we were just pampering the children. They wanted the tool subjects taught all day long. Only Arnena understood. We had workshops and we tried very hard, but as soon as we turned our backs, the teachers would laugh and go into the same kind of teaching. When starting a freedom in the classroom, first of all you had to be prepared for it. You had to be sure that you had something that the child could understand and could do without your supervision or without your lecturing, which is very difficult. If you didn't, then pandemonium would break out. Moreover, some teachers called just moving around in the classroom a misdemeanor. If a child was to go to get this over there and get this over here, or go to speak with this child over here, they did not agree. So Dr. Bond and I had a very difficult time and most of it we had to give up and just settle back into the same old way. About that time, we didn't have many years of that. Two years we tried it. Then 1944 came. Frank got sick and retired. He was working with the Air force on communications. He was a short wave communicator, and had a short wave station W4 HAB in his bedroom. He had set up a communications system and he could communicate with, I guess, others who had a short wave or whatever the system was called. He had connected that with my bedroom and I could talk to him; or if he got a woman, he'd ask me to talk to her. He'dï»¿69 HSK: (cont) connect with my room. Frank got sick and I told Dr. Bond, I said, "Dr. Bond, I'm going to stay home now." He said, "Mrs. West, if you stay home, your salary will continue, you've been so faithful." X don't think Frank's illness lasted more than about s ix months and he passed. When Frank died, before he was buried, Dr. Bond came to my house and said, "I'm getting a scholarship, a fellowship for you and I want you to go away. You worked so hard, I want you to go away." I said, "I'll be delighted." He said, "What about your business?" I said, "My business is all straight. My husband made a will, my daughter typed it, they know everything and ..." I said, "I have a daughter too, who works here and lives with us and they can take care of my daughter." And I don't think it was very long. Let's see, Frank died in December, by summer I was gone. I went to New York and I was in summer school when Alphia ... no, Ruth or Arnena, one called me and said, "Mama, in faculty meeting, Dr. Patterson announced the names of the people who had scholarships, and he announced that you had a General Education Board and a Rosenwald Scholarship, that you were with a number who could select any school you cared to attend." Well, I was in New York so I checked on the schools there. Everybody wanted me to go to Columbia or go back to Chicago, but when I heard that, I came back home. I sent for my first grade teacher, Bertie Jones, and I told her. I said, "Bert, I will not be back at the Children's House." Dr. Bond had talked with me and wanted me to take charge of what we call 'rural education.' Now, is this before you had accepted the scholarship or were you still deciding where you wanted to go to school? SK: Well, this was before I had decided where I wanted to go to school, but I knew I had the scholarship. ALT; Oh, I see, and then you So, I came back to Tuskegee so that the teachers would get ready for the Children's House without me. So I told Bertie I said, "Now Bertie," I said, "I know, Dr. Bond told me that he will accept a recommendation. I told him that I think that you would make a good principal." She had lots of experience. She wasn't a good first grade teacher, but I knew she'd be a good principal. And so, I got my things together. Arnena and my other daughters agreed to take care of Annette. I went back to New York and had been accepted at Columbia. When I found out that I could not observe in any of the schools, all my work would be lectures, you know, and somebody told me about New York University, so I changed. I went there and found that I could observe and prepare myself for rural education-supervision. My work was in administration and organizing schools. I enrolled at New York University and I was assigned to play schools, to supervise play schools. There were two Jewish white women, Mrs. Marsela and Mrs. Schumacher in charge of these schools. I was assigned to them.ï»¿70 ftSK: (cont) New York University would assign you to a play school and they would pay you. I was paid a good salary to work as principal of a play school. They assigned me to a play school in a colored neighborhood called "Utopia." I just loved that name, Utopia, because I felt that everybody is always looking for some Utopia in this world. The children came to the play school after school. A play school was not a play school, it was a school. So many people think that the play school meant that you just supervised them outdoors. Uh uh. They only went outdoors for periods of time. In addition, as I said a few minutes ago, to working in the play school in New York, I was given the opportunity to work in some of the other schools in New York. That's why I chose New York University, rather than some of the other universities where all of the courses for administrators were strictly lecture courses. So at New York University, I spent a great deal of my time in the city; in Brooklyn at this school and the other schools I told you about. With Utopia, I was in charge of the play school after school hours. There was very little, very little race trouble there, because as I can recall, all of the children were colored children. I had charge of another play school, P.S. 140 â I'm not sure of the number right now. In this school, in addition to the play school that met after school, I observed in one class. In New York City they did not care for people in education to observe in the schools. But it was explained to me, that there's always one teacher in a school who'll be glad to have someone work in the schools. So I worked in one classroom in one of the public schools and at that time -this was in 1944 I guess, a lot of Negro students had come from the South. A lot of people had moved from the South. In the '30's and '40's, blacks rushed to the North. The connotation of every white face to those black students was somebody mean who made "my parents work on a farm and somebody who wasn't nice there to my parents." So the white teachers could not understand why these little black children who came from the South hated them so. And when they found that I would talk freely about colored-white, about the problems, they were very happy. Teachers told me they were afraid to correct the children. I told them that if they were, they ought to give up their work as teachers because children had to be corrected. "Well," they said, "We can't do it, they'll fight." I said, "Well, they misunderstand you. Let's send for their parents." "No, the parents approve of it." This is one grade now, I only worked one grade. I said, " All right, let's try it. Let's have a parents' meeting with just the parents in these grades. If they can't come, we'll send for them. We can afford it." So the teachers helped me arrange this meeting and we got the parents there. I said, "Let me have charge." I had charge then in the presence of the white teachers ... all the teachers who taught these children. And so, I talked to the parents and told them that I was from Alabama and that I was working in the school and that I had found that it was very difficult to teach the children because they misunderstood any person who corrected them unless that person was dark. I said, "Now, I correct your children and they just say, 'Yes, Ma'am!' and sit down," I said, "But when their whiteï»¿71 (cont) teachers correct them," I said, "I've heard them say, 'I ain't gonna sit down. I ain't gonna do nothing, I ain't studying you,' and all that kind of talk." And I said, "The teachers are afraid to correct them." One after the other of the parents said, we don't approve of that. We believe what you are saying, but our children told us, and I quote, that "These white teachers are mean," that "They mistreat us and say we carry on because they are mean to us, that's the reason we don't obey" and the parents said "Well, we thought that was true." I said,"Well, all right. I will meet with the children." And the teachers felt better because they had no idea that parents did not approve of their children's acts because some of these parents looked like they would kill you dead on the spot. But when they spoke they were lovely. I had all of them tell where they came from and why they came North and how long they had been there. We prefaced it with things like that and then I told them, I said, "Now, you let me meet with the children and I don't want you there." So, I met with the children of this grade. The teachers were not there. Now, these children didn't carry on outside. When they went to the toilet, they had to get a key or something, a pass, and nobody else could go to the toilet until that child came back with that pass. There were principals in the hall. Those children had to go through that hall and it was just like a prison - go through that hall and go and come back. But in the classroom, they carried on with the teacher and teachers could not send the children out. If a teacher taught ... at least this is what teachers told me, they said, the principal told them that if they were going to teach, they had to have discipline. I met with the children and I told them to sing for me. We sang some songs. We sang "Old Time Religion" and "Climbing Jacob's Ladder," things that they hadn't sung since they'd come from 'down home.' We had a good time. Then I shouted around and talked and I said, "All right, now, let's sit down." And I told them what was necessary. I said, "You've got to read and write and spell. If you don't you'll always be picking cotton and working on someone else's farm." And I said, "You can't learn it jumping up and down." "Teachers are mean," they said. I said,"Well, maybe they are." I said, "But as long as you live, you're going to meet somebody who's mean." Well, making a long story short, those things were preparing me for rural supervision work that I had to do, I thought, when I returned to Tuskegee. At the end of the year, I received a master's degree and was accepted into the doctoral program. I stayed on for the summer and thought that maybe I could stay on for the winter because I had applied for an extension of the scholarship. But Dr. Patterson wrote me that he wanted to see me. Since summertime I was still in school so that I could say that I had done some work above the master's degree. He came and invited me out to dinner and he said, "We're having trouble in the School of Education." I said, "Sure enough." He said, "I want you to serve as Dean of the School of Education." I said, "Dr. Patterson, you must beï»¿72 hSK: (cont) crazy." I said, "There, you've gotfiveor six men with the doctorate. You've got women with the doctorate. I don't have my doctorate." I said, "I'm in the program." He said, "We are having a lot of trouble, and I have met with the faculty. They won't accept anybody who is there and when I called your name, those men accepted you." [You remember Alonza Davis. I don't know whether you remember Dr. Cox or not, a big man who was kind of crippled? Those men were smart. Dr. Cox had written a book on conscience and something else about blacks.] I said, "Well, Dr. Patterson, I am so grateful for the scholarships I received, I will try anything that you say." Whoever was Dean of the School of Education was going away to school. I guess Dean Charles Gomillion was. I came on back to Tuskegee then. I stopped the summer school and came back as quickly as I could. The first person I met with was Mrs. Florence Sorrell who also had a master's degree in education, but was a secretary to the Dean. And I told her what Dr. Patterson had said. She said, "I know it." I said, "Well, why didn't you accept it?" She said, "Don't you know they wouldn't ever accept me?" ALT: HSK: ALT; Do you think that was because she was woman ... this was a male role ...? I can't answer that question. I don't think so. You didn't know Mrs. Sorrell, did you? Yes, I know her. Well, 'this is it' with Mrs. Sorrell. 'This is it.' And that's what made the department go because 'this is it.' But I said to her, I said, "Well, honey I don't know what you recommend, but I cannot do it without you." I said, "Now if you're going to do the corresponding for me, I can organize those men so that they will accept me," because I wanted no credit whatever. So she said, "I'll be glad to do it." I said, "Now, you know the files, we want things to go on." I said, "I cannot bring anything new myself, so we'll have to keep it going unless something comes from the faculty." I went to each man individually. I went to Alonza Davis and asked him if he would preside at the meetings. See, I'd worked with the department so I knew all of them, very well. And he said, "Why yes, I'll do that." I never presided at a single meeting. I went to Dr. Cox and I asked him, I said, "Dr. Cox, will you do an evaluation of the School of Education?" "I'll be delighted to do an evaluation for you." it I went to Deborah Partridge, I don't know whether Deborah had her doctorate then or not, but she was here and had started the Prairie Farms School and was teaching in the School of Education. I asked Deborah, I said, "Deborah, will you take charge of the Rural Education Program of the School of Education?" She said, "Yes." I had nothing to do but just go around and smile at the Deborah Partridge Wolfeï»¿73 (cont) others. And the teachers whom I knew, I would talk with them. So, I came back and served as Dean of the School of Education. I spent a lot of time with Deborah, quite a lot of time. Deborah and I went to Grambling College, Grambling, Louisiana, for a workshop. And it was delightful. I had one part and she had the other. Dr. Alonza Davis and I had an extension school in Birmingham. I learned a lot from him. We were teaching the same people. He taught child psychology and I taught educational psychology. People were getting credit for both of these. We went every Saturday. Everybody in his class was failing and everybody in my class was passing. So I asked ... I said, "Dr. Davis, tell me, honey, those people are not that stupid." He said, "Well, how do you teach?" I said, "Well, first of all, I make some assignments from one book and I lecture to them and I make them read that book. Those who don't know it, I sit down in the seat with them and keep on until they do know it." He said, "That's not teaching." He said, "You aren't doing anything but crippling those people. You're sending out people who can't teach." He said, "Now, those are college women." He said, "You have no business to ... you can give lectures if you want to, but you ought not give them from any one book, you can lecture from dozens of books." I said, "Well, we don't have a library." He said, "It doesn't make any difference. They are college people. They ought to find out. They can go and find out somewhere whether this theory is something." He said, "You have no right to sit down in a classroom, or sit down on a seat and try to help them. They are not first grade people." So, when I found out, of course, the time was over. All of my people had made B's and C's and of course I made the average of what they made on the examinations and for their attempts - they couldn't help but pass. A sixth grader could have passed the way I taught it. That was when I learned more about what good teaching is, because I had taught all those years the other way and people called me a good teacher. From then on, I always talked to people about things that were more or less creative and Dr. Davis taught me how. I never had thought what the word "education" meant. "Education is a drawing out," he said, "but you are trying to put in, and you can't put in if you haven't drawn something out." But you can see how I got along with Dr. Davis. I had interviews regularly with Dr. Cox. The other teachers didn't care. They didn't know who the Dean was or didn't care. But there were one or two who were really eligible to be the head of the school. I had meetings with Dr. Cox and Dr. Davis too. At the end of the year, the teachers had a big dinner for me and I told them that Dr. Patterson had wanted the School of Education to have a year to run itself. I told them that they had done very well. They all were tickled. Prior to that meeting, Dr. Patterson had been to see me again. He was having trouble over in the Women's Department and he asked me if I would serve as Dean of Women. I said, "Oh no. I'm not the type of woman to be a Dean of Women." "Yes, you are. You reared a child, and you had step-daughters."ï»¿74 (cont) I said, "But I didn't rear my child." I said, "My step-daughters and my husband did it. I didn't and if you think I can do for them what was done for Annette, that's wrong." And then I thought about it because I was to go back to have charge of the Rural Education Program that Deborah had and I thought about that. I didn't want to do that because she was doing a fine job. I said, "All right. I'll try it. But I want to go back to school." So I went back to school, see, that was the summer I was an acting dean but for one year. So that summer, I went back to New York University, transferred from the doctoral program to personnel and guidance. Now administration in personnel and guidance is not counseling. You don't have as much psychology People always have thought I ought to be a professional counselor. But I wasn't trained; I was trained to organize a student personnel department and to administer the program and those were the subjects that I had that summer. I came back and went in as Dean of Women at Tuskegee Institute. They had a young girl, a very brilliant girl whom I knew very well because we were on the Council together. You see, as Acting Dean of the School of Education I was on the Council and Dean Fairfax was on the Council. But, the year before Dr. Patterson came to see me, we had had trouble. Tuskegee had very very strict rules. They locked the doors and all. The doors were locked because insurance required it. Way back in 1911, we didn't have to lock the doors because a night guard sat at the door. An older woman came and sat at the door all night and we didn't have to lock it. But after we found that we were not able to keep those night guards, in order to keep the insurance, you had to lock the door every night. One night, I understand, the Dean had company. Well, I understand a man was visiting her. The girls thought that they would have some fun, so they turned on the fire alarm and he ran out. Now, he was fully dressed and all, there was nothing questionable. But he ran out of the building. It was about two or three o'clock in the morning (laughter) and she just lost all her, I guess, pride. This is what was told to me, because she was a brilliant girl. When she left here, she worked for the YWCA. But, Dr. Patterson told me that he was having so much trouble that he wanted an older woman. I went in as Dean of Women. At that time, we thought of residence halls as "homes away from home" and we were trying to make the residence halls homes. In fact when I went in, they called the women in charge "House Mothers." We changed and called them "House Advisors." I went to every Deans' meeting. Way back in 1944, I flew to Chicago. I flew to New York when planes would just belch. It almost made you sick, but I did. I went to those meetings. We were trying, way back there to change the title of Dean of Women and have Dean of Students. Student personnel was a different set-up altogether from deans of women. There were not very many black women who attended these; there were about, not more than three or four of us, but there were hundreds and hundreds of white women. The whites had what they call a AWS: Women's Student Organization The year before Dean Fairfax came, there was a Dean Jackson here from California and she started the AWS, Associated Women's Student Organization. And when I came in, I capitalized on it. We organized all the women in theï»¿75 (cont) buildings. We organized every building and we tried to have home-like situations. It was very difficult, very difficult, but we tried. The girls ... we tried to make their work in the residence hall, really a school for living. We didn't do so much inspecting as we did when I was in the school. We were very proud. But whatever we did was through this organization. Every month we had a meeting with all of the girls. They were required to attend the monthly house meetings. I went to the President and told him I did not approve of required meetings each month, that it was really a burden to some of us and it just made the girls angry. I don't know how long we were at Tuskegee Institute before the President gave us permission to have the meetings voluntarily carried on. That's when the meetings dropped down to nothing. The girls had said they would come if they were not required. They were angry anjway about chapel because girls were required to go to chapel. They had to line up every Sunday morning in front of White Hall and the Dean and duty girls had to inspect them. The people thought I was going down the line inspecting. I was going down the line and saying, "Girls, when we start a school we ain't going to have no uniforms." They said, "Whoopee!" I said, "We are not going to march to chapel. Please just march one more time." I wasn't even inspecting. I don't know how the girls kept their things so clean. They were cleaner than I was. Clean as a pin. But we'd get to chapel and we had cards and the monitors would mark the girls' attendance. They would tell the monitor stories and mark girls present who were not there. Those cards didn't mean anything. We worked out a system where each girl could be absent three times without an excuse or without any penalizing. The girls would gang up and say, let's all just be absent this one time. The Dean can't do anything about it because we haven't been absent three times. We knew, you know, but I always had this psychology - if it was something I couldn't do anything about, I never discussed it. If it was bad administration from the top, I didn't discuss it because that's what people are calling for. They want a confrontation on something that you can't do anything about. And so, we ran into a lot of difficulty. Well, Dr. Patterson and Dr. Foster came in and continued the same thing ... required chapel. After a while, it got so that the seniors were not required to come. Then the seniors and the juniors were not required to come. But we were still having them sit segregated ... the boys and girls were not going to sit in their seats. Dr. Foster was out of town. Dr. Derbigny, Vice President, called a Council meeting and he said, "We hear that the boys, the men and the women, are not going to sit in their seats tonight." This was around five o'clock. "Now what shall we do?" One man said, "Let's get the policemen and have them moved." And so the women said, "Don't do that. These are our sons and daughters, don't do that." And so, Dr. Derbigny said, "Well, when chapel starts, I'll just go up there and tell them to move back to their seats." It was Founder's Day and there were a lot of visitors in chapel. So we women said, "Don't do that. It is too late. Just let it go." We dismissed the meeting and Mrs. Bess Walcott was speaking that night. I walked in and satï»¿76 (cont) on the side. I always sat on the side. I went back in the ante-room off stage. I said, "Liz, the children are up to something; you get up there and speak like you don't see anything." Mrs. Walcott said, "All right." I said, "Just go up there and say what you are going to say, don't notice a thing." We were sitting there and we noticed that the girls were sitting far apart. About ten minutes to six thirty, or six or whenever we'd meet ... sounded like a storm rising. I didn't look to the right or left. I don't know whether they knew we knew it or not. I didn't look. I went from that meeting and called the House Advisors. I said, "Don't say a word to a girl; I don't care where they sit or what they do, you just don't say a word. You just go sit where you are supposed to. Don't bother the cards. The girl who has the cards, just let her do anything she wants. Don't bother her. It is too late now." So the House Advisors came in and they sat â they used to have to sit with the students. Each House Advisor had a place to sit. And those men came in and sat with the women. The women were there in their places. Here, Dr. Derbigny came out on the stage and said, "Will you men please move to your seats? Will you men please move to your seats? I ask you a third time, will you men please ...?" And they didn't move. So he walked off the stage. I don't think he ever got over it. He was sick from that day onwards. Mrs. Bess Walcott came out there and spoke and you never would have thought anything about it. Next day, Dr. Foster, the President, was back and he called a meeting. He wanted to know what they could do. And we said, "Well, we can give you the names of every girl who was absent, but we've checked the record and most every girl who was absent has not been absent three times so there's nothing that you can do because they have three unexcused absences. But we can give you the names of the girls who were absent because the House Advisors sat and took the names." The men couldn't do the first thing because student boys had charge of the buildings and nobody knew what boys they were. There were five or six hundred. Nobody knew what boys sat with the girls; they didn't know what boys were absent. So we couldn't do anything about it. Dr. Foster said, "It is really pathetic that I am away trying to raise money and you all are here fighting over sitting in separate seats." We discontinued sitting separately and students came to chapel and sat wherever they cared to sit. I served as Dean of Women for about seventeen years. Seventeen years? Seventeen years. From 1945 to 1962, whatever that is. From 1945 to 1962 I served as Dean of Women. I'd like to tell you one thing that I thought of. I had my daughter come to New York when I was working at the play school and studying. I had her visit my friends, the Robesons, They had daughtersï»¿77 (cont) about her age. Those girls went to the "Y". They could swim. They went horseback riding. Annette didn't know a thing about swimming; she didn't know anything about horseback riding. She couldn't skate. When I saw that, I decided that at Tuskegee Institute, I would see which girls were from the city and which ones were from the country. We did a lot of research on that. We found the girls from the city. We were planning to have them take, maybe on Saturdays, an hour in a cotton field. And so, we got in touch with men who had plantations, and cows and horses and we were going to take them out. The girls that were from the country, we were going to take to Birmingham and Montgomery and we were going to visit the industrial places and all. The Propeller Club had opened at Tuskegee. A big orchestra came. I got a bus and the girls and we went out to the club. We had gotten together a lot of skates. AWS (Associated Women Students) was in charge. I said, "I've got to see the President about this." So I went to the President and put it in my monthly report, this grand thing that we were doing for the girls. Tuskegee is out in the country. I had contacted men with boats; a lot of men out here had boats and we were going boating and fishing. I didn't think of it as a wholesale plan. I thought of it as two or three girls going at a time. We got in touch with families who would receive girls on Sunday nights and so forth. We had two things that happened to us. The President read the report and I went to see him. He said, "Mrs. West, we don't have any insurance for that. You can't take those girls anywhere; if they get hurt, the school would be sued. You can't even let them skate. If they hurt themselves skating and horseback riding and boating ... you can't do that." I said, "Well, can't you get the insurance? " He said, "We have all the insurance we can carry and that's the insurance for just getting hurt in the buildings." And so, I had to stop it. We had to give the skates away. About visiting in the homes - we thought that couldn't continue because we thought that if we used homes within walking distance ... they couldn't ride in the people's cars. We started and two or three girls would go to visit the people in the community. The families would plan for them and cook and whatever activity the girls wanted to have. But it got to the place, not a single girl would go. So that petered out. Then the girls said, we have chapel at 11. If they would change the chapel hour, then we could go to church in the community. They didn't change it right away, but the girls who were not required to go to chapel and the girls who had three excused absences went to church in the community. The next thing that we tried to do was to have the ministers serve as counselors for girls who belonged to various churches. When they registered a card would indicate the church of their choice. We talked to the ministers. There was only one church that responded the way we thought they should and that was the Catholic Church. The sisters came up and they would meet the girls who would come into the living room. They would tell them where the churchï»¿78 ttSK: (cont) was and confession times and so on. The girls were required, if they left, to sign out and to sign the name of the church that they were going to attend. I remember groups of girls walked down to the Baptist Church. ALT: Mrs. Kelly, when we were talking on yesterday afternoon, we ended as you shared some of the experiences that you had while you were Dean of Women at Tuskegee Institute. Was there anything else that you would like to say about that? ISK: Yes. I'd like to complete the statement about the girls who went to the Baptist Church. I told you, at this time, the seniors and juniors were not required to attend chapel. We were hoping that those who did not attend chapel would attend a church of their choice. A number of girls who attended the Baptist Church did not sign out. At that particular time we were obligated to their parents to be able to tell them at all times where the girls were. After service at the Baptist Church, I went to the minister and I told him. I said, "If you will, please say in some way that the girls should sign out." The minister said, "What difference does it make? Nobody cares where the girls are." I don't think I'll ever forget that. It made me mention to girls in meetings that, "You're not signing out because we want to keep up with you, but you're signing out because we want to serve you." It was very difficult to get that over to any girls who attended the churches in the community. Those who attended churches refused to sign out or refused to let us know in any way where they were going. Soon, that requirement was appealed and no more did the University require a girl to say where she was when she was not in her room. In addit ion to that, I think that we should mention the attempts to have a Dean of Students. As Dean of Women, I realized that the connotation of Dean of Women was "a mother who is watching you, a mother who wants to penalize you, a mother who wants to find something that she can use so that the school will send you home." I wanted to see how we could change that, and I thought if we had a Dean of Students and people who assisted the Dean of Students in a way of guidance rather than a Dean of Women or a Dean of Men, we might be of more help to the young people who came to us. There was one young lady in our school who had her doctorate in student personnel administration and she, with one or two others and myself, attempted to write what we thought a Dean of Students would mean to the program at Tuskegee Institute. We also wanted a woman in that position. We had this woman who was on the staff who was qualified to serve in that position. This material was written up and it was given to the President with our recommendations and we were sure that Dr. Ruth Brett would be our first Dean of Students. At that time there was quite a controversy over race â the race question. The Dean of the School of Education, Dr. Gomillion, was being criticized by whites. They were saying that he was very radical. We had a civicï»¿79 (cont) association which did nothing but give information. It didn't tell us what to do and what not to do, but gave us information about what was happening all over the nation, and the world for that matter. But Dr. Gomillion was considered a radical. So we did get the President to have a Dean of Students, but it wasn't Dr. Ruth Brett. As I can recall, Dean Gomillion was placed as Dean of Students. He didn't want that. He was a sociology professor but at that time, he was acting Dean of the School of Education. It had been said by many people that the State Department was going to withdraw its financial aid to Tuskegee if Dr. Gomillion remained in that position. And so, it was done. We did not object, but we did want Dr. Brett as Dean of Students. Dean Gomillion was transferred and this new position came about, Dean of Students. As Dean of Students, Dean Gomillion worked very closely with the Dean of Women and the Dean of Men. We had at that time, a committee called the "Discipline Commitee." There were no students on this committee. The Discipline Committee reviewed cases that were referred to them. We thought from the beginning that there should be students on the Discipline Committee because the feeling of students was that they hear the case and then they send you home and a student on this Committee could understand the student's point of view. Many of the members of the Committee felt that it wasn't necessary to have students on the Committee. Our most serious cases were students who went beyond the Macon County line to buy alcoholic drinks. Macon County was a "dry" county, but the counties surrounding us were "wet." Students who wanted alcoholic drinks went out of the county to get those drinks. For some reason or another, they were reported to us before they could get back to their buildings. We tried to find out where the information came from. We found that when they would go to these bars â I don't think they called them bars, but whatever these places were called outside the city â and bought whiskey and other alcoholic drinks that somebody in those places would call the police. As soon as those students got into Macon County, they vere arrested. At that time, any student arrested was reported to the school because the school was thought of as their parents. Any student having alcohol or drinking it was arrested and reported to the Discipline Committee and we handled it. At that time, offenses were handled in this way: a warning for first offense, two warnings for the second, three warnings for the next offense, and you were sent home if you were warned over three times, or you were put on probation according to what the offense was. The Discipline Committee, to my mind, did not serve the purpose of counseling. I felt that before a student was brought to the Discipline Committee, before the act was committed, a lot of counseling should have been done about the 'whys' of the dispositions that we would have to take in the event that something happened. Even way back before this county was made a wet county, even before we were allowed to sell alcoholic drinks in Macon County, there were those of us who felt that it should be allowed and that the studentsï»¿80 HSK: (cont) themselves would be strong enough to decide whether they were going to drink or not. The other offense that always disturbed me a lot was when a girl was reported to the Committee as being pregnant, she was immediately sent home. It was felt that the school had no place for a pregnant woman. I felt ... and I told the girls that I would like if anything happened that they would come to me first. I had a few cases where girls came to me and stated that they were pregnant. We talked and we prayed together and I asked the girls, "Who is your nearest friend?^ Who can we call?" I don't think I ever heard a girl say, "Call my mother." But we spent hours trying to explain that your mother would be the one who perhaps could take the responsibility, whatever may happen to you afterwards. Sometimes, in a few cases I recalled, it worked out all right. I called the mother and asked the mother if she could come and I would always explain. Sometimes a girl was in the hospital. When the mother would come then she would worry to death about how the father would feel. I remember one or two cases where the description that was given was that the father would kill the daughter or he'd never allow her to come home again. I said, "That isn't true. Let me talk with your husband over the telephone." I want to give you a conversation with one father. I called the father and I told him, I said, "You have a daughter here." He didn't even know his wife was sitting in my office. I said, "You have a daughter here who is in the hospital." He asked, "Is she sick?" I said, "No. She's not sick, she's in the hospital." And I said, "I suspect this daughter is just like you, isn^t she?" "Yes. She's just like me, she's just like me." I said, "Well, she's expecting a baby and I know you will understand." I said, "I don't think that the mother could understand, she really can't understand." He said, "Oh, my God." He said, "That would never happen to my daughter." But this father came and I am thinking of one particular instance; all of them didn't work out that way. I would like to relate more, but this is sufficient to show - the father came and he hugged the mother. They went to the hospital. They didn't want the baby born here in this particular case. That girl was taken away and I never saw her anymoreâ¢ I want to tell you about one other case. There was another girl. I want to tell you about this because the woman whose name I am going to call has had I think, more influence at Tuskegee Institute in the way that I think is important than any other woman ... more spiritual influence.- This girl was a YWCA girl. Lois Reeves had charge of the YWCA and this girl was president of the YWCA and very active. We heard that she was pregnant and I think we sent for her. Cases that came to me first, I managed them. If they went to the administration first, then I went to the Discipline Committee and faced it. But, this girl said that she was not going home. The girls knew that she was pregnant. They knew that she was president of the YWCA. She said that she wasn't going to stop serving as president of the YWCA, neither was she going home. So, I sent for Mrs. Lois Reeves, the director of the YWCA and we talked andï»¿81 (cont) prayed about it and she sent for the girl and begged the girl to come out to her home. The girl went out to her home. She went away and had the baby. She came back and finished Tuskegee Institute. Then she visited us here and worked with the YWCA because she was a National Officer in the YWCA. We don't know where her baby is because when she came back after that, she never would look at me. She did not come to see me. She never talked with me. But Lois and I were very happy. She treated Lois the same way. But we were very happy that this girl could go through it and could be accepted because she was a power. I think that she was able to go through in that way because Lois Reeves handled cases in such a way that her record in the office was not one that people considered at that time a disgrace. I think that as Dean of Women, I was very happy to serve in that capacity although it was questionable as to whether a person could be a disciplinarian and a counselor at the same time. I always felt that a mother had to fall in that category, so why shouldn't I try. I tried and I think in many instances I failed. I remember one particular time, a young man came to the office â the men were freer with me in talking and helping me than the women. A young man came to my office and said, "Dean, the girls say you put on an old black robe and walk all around the campus and catch them and send them home." I said, "Is that so?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Well, I am sorry." I said, "Well, I do walk around the campus," because at that time, I attended everything that I could . When the things were over, I would walk all the way around over by James Hall and come up through a valley, but I felt that I needed the exercise and I felt that the campus was beautiful and there were guards all over the campus. One guard gave me a whistle and said, "If anybody ever bothers you, blow this whistle," I never had to blow the whistle, but I wasn't afraid because I knew the guards were almost within a few steps of where I went. But one rainy night, I was getting ready to go to the movie, and I said, "Well, I better get my raincoat." I looked there and I had a long black raincoat with a hood on it. I put that raincoat back, I threw it away. I never wore it anymore because when the boy was talking to me I thought about what a story those children were telling on me. It did appear that way and yet, I went on and tried as best I could to serve in that dual capacity, but I don't think I was so successful. We were happy here at Tuskegee to have a chaplain and a YWCA director and we tried as best we could to have the girls understand that there were two places where whatever you say to them is confidential and should be. I could not make them that promise and I told them so, I said, "I can't make you that promise. If you don't want me to tell, then don't tell me." But even though I said that, there were many things that I never told. There were many things that I never put into the record and today, forty years after, I am very happy that I didn't; because many of the girls whom I see are doing much better than those whose records would have been perfect. During the time that I served as Dean of Women, I attended many meetings withï»¿82 (Cont) other deans of women and especially deans of women of other races and I found that they were vain for the title and vain for the name. Most of the things they discussed were things that had to do with their own growth in an academic way and what they felt should be required of a woman who would serve as dean of women. I felt in my heart that many "women who had never been to school would serve better as dean of women than those of us who were working for higher degrees because all of our time was given to studying and reading and not necessarily looking in the faces of girls and working with them. I think that I mentioned some time ago, that my first husband, Frank West, died in 1944. When Frank died, I went to New York University and was there a year. I came back and was working at the School as Dean of Women from 1945 to about 1962. In 1956, a friend of mine who had lived here, Mrs. Stewart, came to Tuskegee for a visit, and she was in my apartment. We had breakfast together. It was summertime, so there were no girls in the building and we heard someone walking in the hall and I got up to see, because it sounded heavy, like a man's steps. I walked out and there was a Rev. Charles W. Kelly, a pastor who had come looking for Mrs. Stewart. I had him come in and he had breakfast with us. In the course of the conversation, I said, "You sent my mother a book, A Year With the Bible." And he said, "Yes. I did." And he said, "I've often wondered if she had received it." I said, "Well, next week I am on my way to New York to school and I will ask her if she received it." So I wrote Rev. Kelly a card and told him that Mother received this Year With the Bible and that she enjoyed it very much. He started writing me and started calling me. In the past summers when I had studied in New York, I lived with my nephew, my sister Alberta's son. Noble Simms was at that time teaching in the New York City system. I lived in the Bronx with him in a very beautiful home, a lovely wife. But this time, I went to a hotel down in the Village. I felt that, first of all, I wanted to see the park. I had walked through the park and I had seen so many sad looking people that I wanted to just sit there and I knew I couldn't walk from the Bronx. I lived in that hotel right down at Washington Square. Almost every other night this Rev. Kelly would call on me and talk with me and I enjoyed talking with him and I thought that was all there was to it. I also enjoyed the first few weeks sitting in the park. The elevator man in the hotel saw me going out at night and he asked me, "Where are you going?" I said, "I am going to sit in the park." He said, "I thought you were going to the library. I said, "All right, I go to the library." He said, "But, Madam, anybody can look at you and tell that you are from the South." He said, "Don't go and sit in the park." He said, "No, don't go." I didn't listen that night. As strange as it may seem, I sat in thepark that night conscious of what he was saying and a man came and sat by me, a young man with long hair, very interesting looking. I started talking and then I recalled what the elevator man had said. I was only a few steps from the hotel. I got up and started walking toward it. I told the man to excuse me. He started walking behind me and he asked me how far I was going and I told him that there was a man waiting for me in the EarleHotel and I walked a little faster. I said to someonelater in theï»¿83 (cont) evening, "Well, I guess he thought I was talking about my husband, but I was talking about the elevator man." The faster I walked, the faster this man walked. But when I got to the Ear ]e Hotel and went in and the door closed, the elevator man was right at the door and before I could tell him why I was blowing and rushing so, he said, "I told you so." I went in there. That made me very sad because I'm not so sure that I shouldn't have stopped and talked with the man. But I got afraid and I think that's the way the world goes; you get afraid and those of us who can talk and can be of help, we are afraid because the law of averages shows that perhaps you should be afraid. Well, I spent that summer at New York University, summer of 1955 and then I came home. I don't know why, but Rev. Kelly had called me. I told him when I was coming home. I came home before school opened to get ready for the opening of the school. Rev. Kelly came over the first Sunday. He said, "There is a Civic Association meeting at Washington Chapel and I'd like you to atteixl." I went with him and he began to talk about how much he thought of me. Up until that time I hadn't thought very much of it. And then he took me back home after the meeting. The other part that I think is very significant, there were not many times when we talked that I did not realize that I was very, very much in love with him. His wife had died about four years earlier, about 1952 and this was 1956, the summer of 1956. School was opening. Rev. Kelly wanted to continue to come to see me and this is the sad thing. I told him I was very sorry, that even though I was a woman over 60 years old, that I could not afford to require what I was requiring of the girls and have a young man, an old man for that matter, who was in love with me, come to see me. But, I did visit with him in the home of Booker T. Washington's youngest son's widow. Rev. Kelly and I talked things out and I told him that if we were really in love with each other, we'd have to marry right away and I'd have to move out of the building because I could not put up a sign saying, "I'm 60 and you're 20 - that there are different requirements for the two of us." It happened that Rev. Kelly and his sister were going away. They were going to the Baptist convention out in California, which was good. They went away and we courted through the mail and we decided that we would perhaps marry quietly. He wanted to go to the church, but I told him that the wedding was mine. At this particular time I wasn't a member of a church in the community, but I was a member of the Tuskegee Institute Chapel so we would go into the Chapel quietly and have this marriage. We both had been married and it wasn't necessary to have a big wedding, but we would marry in the Chapel. He agreed to that if I would have Rev. Raymond Harvey, the pastor of the church that he had pastored for 30 years, to stand as the best man. I agreed to Rev. Harvey's being the best man if the chaplain of Tuskegee Institute could perform the ceremony and if my sister couldï»¿84 (cont) stand with me if he was going to have Rev. Harvey stand with him. I knew that there were two groups of people that I would have to tell this. People knew that Rev. Kelly was courting someone, but because we were going to Mrs. Edith Washington's house, they thought that he was courting Edith, so it got out that he was going to marry Miss Shehee. When he went away, he wrote back to a number of people and told them that he was going to get married because we had decided to get married right away. I told my children, my first husband's children, Alphia West Baker, Arnena West Turner and Ruth West Adams. I was over at dinner with them and I told them that I was going to get married. They knew that there was a man, a graduate of the school who came back every commencement, every Founders' Day, and had come out to their house visiting and they were rejoicing. Oh, you're going to marry Mr. So-and-so; that's nice. I said, "No, I'm going to marry Rev. Kelly." They said, "Mama, don't bring him here because you have no right to marry a man who is ill." I said, "I am sorry, I am not marrying his illness, I am marrying Rev. Kelly and I will not bring him here." I had another very close relative that I knew I had to tell. She worked here in the music department and I sent for her to come up to the office and I told her. I said, "Sister Alberta, I am going to get married." "Who are you marrying?" "I am going to marry Rev. Kelly." "No, no. That's a society man. He's a preacher but he's a society man and I'm not sure that he isn't kind of tied up with the race question. His first wife was a very bright woman and you are dark. Do you realize that? You're getting yourself into something." "I am going to marry Rev. Kelly," I said. "We are going to get married." "Well, where are you going to get married?" "In the chapel." "That's fine, that's fine. Now, let's prepare for it. I want to send for Noble. You know he's working in New York City ... he's working in the New York City system and Noble should be here. Ernest is teaching music in Boston; he should be here â he can help us with the music. It's going to be in the chapel and the chapel is so large and we must have it as it should be and with his background in music, he can help us. We really ought to have him play and there's Lillian. I need Lillian because Lillian can help us." Now, at the present time, Lillian is an Appeals Examiner in the Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C. At that particular time, she was here at Tuskegee working at the Veterans Hospital and really the one upon whom my sister depended. She really wanted Lillian to just take charge of the wedding. Robert, at the present time, is Director of Community Relations in Miami, but she wanted him to come also. She wanted her children here to see Aunt Hattie marry a man whom she thought was such a society man, and so well-known that it was the greatest thing in the world. She felt that her sister should not marry him. But since she was going to she said, "Now you know, Sister Rowena has some daughters, we must let them know." At this time she was writing. Allegra, you know Allegra, and Ann were teaching; they were teachers in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Allegra, at this present time, is Supervisor of Libraries in Charlotte.) She was teaching; Bufordine was teaching in Milwaukee, but she had finished Talladega College and had lived with me for aï»¿85 HSK: (cont) summer. "We can't leave Bufordine out and there is Brother Sydney" â who was deceased at that time, but he had two daughters. And she thought ... Betty was working in a school in Baltimore, Morgan College, and Sedella was working in Washington Basic College. Sister Ann was to be the maid of honor and when she got to Sister Ann's name, I said,"Well, I know that Ann will have to come. "Louise, Sister Ann's daughter," Sister Alberta said, "Must come." I did not respond to what she said because she did not realize that I was not going to send out invitations. I did feel that I would have to call my mother; so I called my mother and told her that I was going to get married and I would like for her to come. Rev. Kelly wanted my mother to come, so he sent the fare. Mother said a very interesting thing. She told us when we talked with her over the telephone, "I will accept the fare, but my baby, the next week after your husband marries you,he is going to ask for it back." Sister Esther, who had been secretary to Mrs. Guzman here at Tuskegee Institute,had given up her work some time ago to go live with Mother. She came and brought Mother with her; so they were here for what I thought was a quiet marriage. When Rev. Kelly was away, he wrote to a very dear friend, Dr. Gomillion and told him that he was going to get married. After we married, Dr. Gomillion said he thought of every single woman in the community and named some that he knew Rev. Kelly was going to get married to, he said, but your name was not in the number. Dr. Gomillion and Rev. Kelly were very,Aery close friends. They had started with the Civic Association. The Civic Association was first a men's meeting and then the women talked about them so that they changed it into a meeting for men and women. When the NAACP came into its ascendancy here, the Civic Association began meeting just now and then. Dr. Gomillion was also instrumental in trying to get Negroes to vote. His efforts to get Negroes to vote caused quite a controversy in the county and in the state, to such an extent that many of us felt that those in political authority gerrymandered a number of Negroes out of the city so that we could not vote in the city elections. Under Dr. Gomillion we worked hard. A book, Gomillion vs. Lightfoot, states all about the efforts that he made. I mentioned that because Rev. Kelly worked very closely with Dr. Gomillion and so did many of the other ministers. A few friends knew that Rev. Kelly was going to marry, but we didn't intend to tell them to whom. After people started talking so about the fact that he was going to get married and nobody mentioned me, Mrs. Edith Shehee, he and I talked it over. She said, "I think the best thing to do is just to put it into the newspaper." She said, "It's not a secret and you should put it into the newspaper." So, in the Tuskegee News, we put the article: "Hattie Simmons West and Rev. Charles Kelly will be married at 2 o'clock October ..." the, whatever the date was. So, the public knew it and I think we added that the public is invited and yet, I knew that there would be no one there. I never wanted a wedding march. I never wanted "I Love You Truly" and "Because" and traditional things. But I did want, "God Make Me an Instrumentï»¿86 (cont) of Thy Peace." The Director of the Music Department sang that, and my sister, Mrs. Simms, played. Mrs. Simms, Mrs. McCray and Mrs. Thurston had charge of the affair. Against my will, they made us come and rehearse. When we were rehearsing, they got to the part where we would turn to come out and they said, "Come in this door and go out this door." I said, "That door? That door is to go to the cemetery. I'm not going out that door. We're going to walk down the aisles." So we practiced walking down the aisle. Another very beautiful thing happened. Charles had a friend, Dr. G. Lake Imes. Dr. Imes is the one who in 1919 sent for Rev. Kelly to come to Tuskegee to work in the Phelps Bible School. The teaching of ministers was at a high point at that time and the school had a department, the Phelps Bible Training School. Rev. Kelly came to teach in that school. The day before we were to marry, we looked up and there was Dr. Imes. Charles had told him he was going to get married, had told him when, but he didn't know with whom. I also knew Dr. Imes very well. Dr. Imes, at that time had retired from wherever he had been working, Fisk and Tuskegee and all those places, and was working with Moral Rearmament. I was very, very much impressed. So even on the day before we married, we had sessions in my office for hours on Moral Rearmament. He was trying to impress both Rev. Kelly and me, that we should join with him. And I asked him why. He said, "Well, we believe in the absolutes." There must have been seven. They ran like this: "absolute love, absolute peace, absolute purity." I said, "You know, that's what the Christian religion is." He said, "But you don't practice it." I said, "I can't leave it because I don't practice it. I can continue to try to carry out the absolutes." He said, "You don't believe everything." He said, "If you believe in absolute purity, you cannot accuse anyone. Do you accuse anyone of anything?" I said, "Sure I do." He said, "Well, we can't. We can't accuse anyone of anything." He said, "Another thing, we write down every day, everything we think and everything that we do." I have a book that I started the day before I married Rev. Kelly which I have not kept up, don't want to keep up, don't think it is necessary. But when I started writing everything that I thought and everything I did, I thought it was very helpful in a way, but it would have caused me to withdraw from society. At that particular time, I didn't think that I wanted to do that and I don't want to do it now because it turns into a very, very spiritual thing. It turns you inside in silence and it may make you more like Jesus Christ, but somehow I haven't followed through on that. The day before the wedding, my mother and my sister arrived. They arrived ... and I hesitated hecause I can't think of other relatives. Alphia, my stepdaughter, found out about it. I was going just to not have any man in the family drive me over from the ... from my office. I think I should tell you this. The people on my staff heard that I was going to get married. They saw it in the paper and they all came to see my trousseau. When they came, the week before I married, to see my trousseau, I said, "Well, I haven't washed it yet; as soon as I get these things washed up and freshened up." And theyï»¿87 (cont) said, "All right." They had a shower. And I have now a negligee that they paid $75 or $80 for, and told me that it was on sale. I cried about it and was ashamed to wear it when I married my husband because it was too thin. But they fixed up my suitcase and I was like a bride and they had this big shower and invited the people (which I thought was out of order), but I just have to mention that because it was so delightful. The day of the wedding, they insisted that a hairdresser come and get my hair ready. I had a beautiful short length, cream colored lace dress. They picked that out. I was going to wear a suit. They insisted that my shoes be dyed the color of the dress. They had a friend in town make a hat the color of my dress. It wasn't so wide with tulle around it ... just a beautiful thing. The lady who did my hair tinted it a good bit grayer â I had a little grey hair; but it seems to me that she tinted it a little more gray which made it very beautiful and it blended into the blue and cream color of my dress. When I dressed, I looked in the mirror and I said, "Well, I really look like a bride." Mrs. Thurston was going to ride -up to the front door for me. Somebody called and said, "Leslie, your daughter Alphia's husband, will be there for you." He came from Atlanta and drove me. I felt very, very grateful and very, very, very appreciative of the fact that my son-in-law (as I think of him) would come from Atlanta when I hadn't asked him to come. So I rode over in a large car and was escorted to the back door and we came in. When I looked up, there were two ministers to perform the ceremony. Charles had changed his mind from the chaplain. I had two things that I wanted read from, Gibran's The Prophet: one was on love and the other was on marriage. I said, "Now if you want to do those other things they do that's all right, I leave it with you." Charles did because he wanted the traditional things. He had switched and Dr. Winn was given to read from The Prophet on love and on marriage and Dr. Imes was to marry us. And there I stood with that surprise. My sister Ann came dressed like a queen. I guess the men came in first and then we came in. They came in from one door of the chapel to the stage and I came in from another. My friends, Mrs. McCray and Mrs. Thurston had large baskets of flowers. I still hadn't looked at the audience. I just marched in and was so busy looking at the surprise, Rev. Imes, and wondering what he was going to do. I looked, there was Rev. Harvey and Charles and we walked in and stood there together and Dr. Imes married us. I didn't know what to say because I wanted to say, what are you going to do and Dr. Winn read on love and marriage and it was just beautiful. I think too, that there is one in The Prophet on children that I always thought of because I have one daughter ... my daughter, Annette, and I have to tell this. I wrote her and I told her that I was going to get married. She wrote back and told me what I had always told her. She said, "Mama, if you can't stay single, go on and get married. That's what you always told me." I wrote back and I said, "My daughter, I could stay single, but I am going to get married." So, my daughter, Annette, who was away at that time, (I don'tï»¿88 HSK: (cont) know whether she was in the Philippines or Hawaii), but she was away with her lovely husband who was in the service at that time - in the ROTC Service. After the wedding, I wanted to go to the West house. But my children ... I took them at their word; but I guess that they had changed, because I looked out and in the family pew and there they sat: my sister's daughter, and my daughters and all were sitting there. My first husband's first wife's daughters whom I call my daughters were also there at the wedding. My staff had already arranged to have the after-marriage dinner at Rev. Kelly's house. I did not know that tables were set up all over the house and they had fixed the dinner. Rev. Kelly and I got in a car and rode to Opelika, Alabama, to vist Mrs.....I can't call her name ... but a very dear friend of his and his first wife's. We went to Opelika, Alabama. When we got there, Dr. Imes had beat us there. These were friends of Rev. Kelly and his first wife. Rev. Kelly wanted me to spend the night there and I said, "Well, ay staff told me they were fixing dinner at our house." He said, "Well, we're not going back." I said, "Oh, we have to go back." And so, Rev. Imes said, "Well, I want to talk to Mrs. ... by herself." I can't call her name, bless her heart. And so, we had to come on back. When we came back, the house was filled with people, the dinner was ready and they were surprised that they had to wait so long for us. But it was a delightful affair and there is the story of my marriage to Rev. Kelly. Rev. Kelly had retired from the Baptist Church. He retired shortly after his wife died. He got very sick himself. She died in 1952, he must have retired about 1953 or 1954. When I married him, he was just getting well, but he went back and forth to the Baptist Church and I joined the Baptist Church. The service at our Baptist Church is a service that is planned beforehand, they have a program and nobody is expected to break in. Every Sunday when Rev. Kelly was there, he felt that he had to get up and make his remarks and he would. There were many people there who hardly knew Rev. Kelly because they had joined in the last year. But those who knew that he had been the pastor of that church for 30 years and that he was the pastor when the church was built, were willing to listen to anything he had to say. I personally felt that it was out of order and it may be that I was out of order. Rev. Ford was a very dear friend of ours. He knew how I felt about it and I told Rev. Kelly that the church was Rev. Harvey's and it should be left to him to have it and to conduct the services as he wished. Rev. Kelly should not feel that he has to get up and make remarks after the service is over nor any time during the service. And so, Rev. Ford said, "Well, we'll fix it." At that time, I was going to the Baptist conventions and Rev. Ford worked it so that Charles was made a missionary for the church, to go out to any number of churches on Sundays and expla in the meaning of the Baptist faith and whatever he wanted to say to them about Christianity. We were delightedï»¿89 (cont) and I started riding through the country with him. I noticed Rev. Kelly could never find the church. I couldn't drive, but we'd ride and ride and ask questions. The Negro churches were way out in the woods They'd tell us Sweet Canaan or whatever it was was back down this way and we'd back this way and we'd ride this way and ride back. We couldn't find the churches and I told Rev. Ford. I said, "Rev. Ford, we can't do that. I can't help Rev. Kelly find the churches and we can't get to them, so he can't accept that." Rev. Kelly gave it up. Then he started back to the Baptist Church. This time he would start talking and he would tell the people, "Now Rev. Harvey just came here, all he had to do was hang his hat up. We built the church." I knew that he shouldn't say that whether it was true or not. At least I felt that way. So Rev. Ford and I got together again. He came to me one day and he said, "They need a pastor at Emanuel," a little church that was falling down. It was not so far from here and it was in what I call aj'blessed community." I call it the "blessed community" because as I served as teacher and principal of the Children's House, many of the children that I taught lived on Brick Yard Hill and they were grown and had children. I loved them very much and I just knew that would be a wonderful experience if Charles would accept it. The deacons came and asked Charles and he said, "No." And I heard he'd said "no" and I told him I was very sorry, but that if he didn't go, I was going. He said, "Well, if you go, I'll go. I don't want to go out there, but I'll go if you'll go." He said, "I thought you wouldn't want to go." I said, "Oh yes, I want to go so much and I am sorry I didn't tell you first, but I didn't." He went back to the deacons and Rev. Ford went back to them and told them that the Rev. Kelly would accept it. So we had a very, very delightful experience at the Emanuel Baptist Church on Brick Yard Hill. Now they call it Greenwood Heights. But that little church was falling. There were about two deacons in that church who had jobs. Charles wanted the church renovated and I personally didn't see how he could do it, but he made arrangements with some company to renovate the church. He went to the Buildings and Savings and Loan to borrow the money, and thought he had the money. He had the contractors renovate the church and cover it with white siding and make it all over, all over on the inside and new benches and all; it was a beautiful little church. When the Buildings and Loan told him that they could only give him half of what he had asked for because they didn't have sufficient security and only two deacons had anything that amounted to anything, it like to have broken his heart. The men had done the work. He went downtown to borrow the money from the Alabama Exchange Bank. The man at the Alabama Exchange Bank told him that he could not involve his property without asking his wife. So Mr. Parker called me and said, "Rev. Kelly is very much disturbed. He's been down here to borrow money and we can't let him have it unless you sign for it because it means that the house will be involved and we just don't do that unless the wife signs."ï»¿90 (cont) I said, "I'll be delighted." He said, "Well, you may lose the house ... these churches can't pay the bills." I said, "That's all right, it is Charles' house. I'll be delighted." By that time, Charles was coming in the front door and I called him. I said, "Come and sit down, Charles," I said, "Now your church is renovated and it is very pretty and we love it." I said, "If you want to involve this house, it is all right with me." He said, "I don't believe it. They told me at the bank, I could not sign for my own house unless you sign." I said, "I'll go right back down there with you and sign." So I went back down with him and signed the note against the house for the church and that meant that this house was mortgaged in addition to what the two deacons owned. The other people did not own their property and their signatures didn't mean anything. About two years later, I guess, couldn't have been more than two years, Charles began to get sick. We had been married about six years before he began to get sick and I noticed it. He began to get so that when he preached he wandered a lot and to keep from wandering, he'd always take something to read and I knew that wasn't like him. He got so that he couldn't carry through with a sermon unless he read something so he read quite a lot and I watched him very carefully. Then he began to withdraw and he stopped going to the church altogether which I told him was all right, just don't bother. There was a young man who came to see him often and this young man was ordained and I'd always tell him that Rev. Kelly called him although he declares that God called him. But Charles was very happy when this young man would go to the church and substitute for him. When he began to get sick we found that we'd have to send him to the hospital for the type of treatment that he needed because they sent for a doctor from Atlanta, I think. But, anyhow, they said that he had an aneurysm, whatever that means, and he had to be very quiet. While he was in the hospital, a policeman came to my door and said, "We've come for Rev. Kelly." I said, "Yes, what has he done?" "Well, he signed this note on three counts for a young man and we've had the trial and the young man didn't appear." I said, "How much is it?" "Three counts â four counts, at $500 each, four counts and he'll have to pay it." I said, "Well, Rev. Kelly is in the hospital." They said, "Well, we'll go to see him." I said, "Oh no. You won't go to see him. In the first place, Dr. Eugene Dibble is not going to let you see him, he's done so well." I said, "How long do I have?" He said, "Well, it seems to me, you might have a week to get the money together, $2,000." That was a lot of money to me and I prayed about it and I decided that I would just go on and pay the money. Then something told me ... it said, you go to ... I went to the parents of this boy and the grandparents and asked them to please have the boy come back because Rev. Kelly was not able to pay the money and if he'd just come back to the trial, maybe he'd be freed. They said, "We don't know where he is, we can't get him."ï»¿91 (cont) Something told me, just go talk to Attorney Fred Gray. I went up and I told Attorney Gray that I was about to pay this $2,000. He said "Well, let me see about it." I told him the boy's name. I said, "Well I only have a few more days." He said, "Well, I'll see." After'two days, one night at ten o'clock, Attorney Gray called me and said, "The boy may be guilty, but they don't have sufficient evidence. They arrested this boy because he has a reputation of stealing and he is supposed to have stolen, but they can't arrest him on this. I am bringing the papers to you and you need not worry about it anymore." I went out and I told the mother. We shouted that night about eleven o'clock. We shouted all over Brick Yard Hill, ... so glad that the boy was cleared. And they said, "Oh, we'll write him now and tell him to come back home." They don't know to this day that I remembered that they had told me that they didn't know where he was. About the next day, the deacons came to see me. They thought that Rev. Kelly was worrying about the fact that they were not keeping up their notes. I didn't know that they were not keeping their notes up on the house, but they had notes at the bank. They had half from the Building and Loan Association and half from the banks. The notes were very heavy and the members of the church were not able to pay and they thought that Rev. Kelly was worried about that. I told the deacons, I said, "No. Rev. Kelly has never mentioned it." I said, "If he has lost the house, I don't think he'd care." I said, "I could move back on Washington Ave. I have a house over there and Sister Pearl, Charles' sistei; and I can move over there. It'd be quite all right. I'd like for it to be paid for." I said, "I didn't buy this house. I haven't put one penny in it and I think Rev. Kelly would be glad to know that it went for the church." They said, "We'll never let it happen." This Rev. Moore, who had been called by Charles to preach and who says he was called by God, was substituting in Charles' place. Rev. Moore was married to a girl who ... her last name was White ... owned a very beautiful home way out by Mount Nebo. The Moore family had lots of property. I don't know how much money they had, but when the deacons told Rev. Moore, he said, "We're going to do this without asking Rev. Kelly. We're going and transfer that note from the bank to the Federal Savings and Loan." He said, "If I sign it, they'll give you any amount of money you want." Rev. Moore and the deacons went to the bank and had that note transferred to the Building and Loan so that there would be just one note that they were paying; brought the papers to me and said, "Come one, let's go tell Rev. Kelly." I said, "You can tell him." I said, "But I don't think it makes any difference, I'm telling you now." They were so disappointed when we went to the hospital and I said, "Charles Charles." I said, "Did you sign a note for a boy?" He said, "Oh yes, I signed a note." I said, "Well, he didn't come." He said, "Well, that's all right. You go on and pay it." I said, "How much was it?" He said, "$500." I said, "You signed it on four counts." He said, "No. I just signed it on one." I said, "No, I saw the papers." I said, "Well, it's all over. Attorney Gray cleared the boy." He said, "Did he? That's all rightï»¿92 ttSK: (cont) There stood the deacons. "Brother Kelly, here are the papers; you don't have a note on your house now." He said, "Note about what?" "The note you signed for the church." He said, "Well, that's all right." They said, "Well, we paid it and transferred it." He said, "Well, all right" and he turned over and went to sleep. It was really a beautiful experience because he was rational. He lived a long time after that, I don't remember how long. But the deacons were sure that with those two things off his mind, Rev. Kelly would get up and come home and be well. I knew that it was a physical thing. I knew that if it were not all together in his mind, he wouldn't be such a clean man. All the time that he was ill, everything had to be immaculately clean around him. Everything he put on, he would say, "Baby, send this to the laundry. I don't want it done here. Send this to the laundry." The linen had to go to the laundry. His shirts had to go to the laundry. When I did them, I wouldn't iron them, I'd just put them in the washing machine and wash them and tell him they were clean. "No, I can't wear those." But he didn't want to see anybody and I think that the thing that made me very happy was that one friend of ours, who is a friend now, would come to see him and he would say, "Don't make Rev. Kelly go out if he doesn't want to go." I had other friends who came to see him and he didn't want to see them because they'd say, "Charles Kelly, you know you can get up from here and come out." He was fully dressed, neat as he could be; he sent his clothes to the cleaners and if he came out, it was, "How do you do, will you please excuse me?" and he would leave the room after he spoke to the people. So I got to the place where if anybody came, I'd go and tell him. He said, "I'm sorry. I don't want to see anybody." Then I would tell the person. "I am sorry, Rev. Kelly is resting now." I think that in working with him it gave me a feeling that when you work with people, listen. The word, listen, ... listen to what they are saying. Listen with your heart as well as your ears. It was a liberal education for me to live with Rev. Kelly because we were very different. Rev. Kelly and my first husband were very different. My first husband wanted me to himself. He didn't want me with anybody at anytime for anything. I remember once, a very sad experience about my first husband. My mother was visiting with me and there was a chapel service. Mama was standing there, waiting to go to chapel and Frank said, "I'm sorry, my wife can't go to chapel tonight. I am not going." Mama said to him, "You kept one wife home and killed her, you're going to kill another one." That was the only time I've ever seen Frank West cry. He started crying and said, "I didn't kill her. She never wanted to go anywhere." Mama said, "This wife is different, she wants to go." He said, "She's not going." I didn't go. I think my sister and Mama went to chapel I didn't go and I was very happy not to go although I didn't think it was fair to me. That's just one example of how this husband felt and never changed other than when I would threaten to leave him or when I would leave him and he would say, "You may go where you please and do what you please." But Rev.ï»¿93 HSK: (cont) Kelly wanted me to go. He wanted to go. When I married him, he had a car and we started going. We motored to Lexington to a Baptist, convention. We motored to Chicago, we motored to Fayetteville, North Carolina,and perhaps some other places and he was driving. When we cama back home one week, a friend came in and said to me, "Please don't tell Rev. Kelly I told you, but they've arrested him downtown." I said, "Oh, why in the world would they arrest him?" He said, "Don't you know he hasn't got a license to drive a car?" I said, "What! We've been driving all over the country and he doesn't have a license?" "No, He doesn't have any license." I said, "Well, take me to jail and we'll go get him." "No," he said, "I don't want Rev. Kelly to know that I told you." I called all the jails and I couldn't find him and I just had to wait. About seven o'clock â we usually ate dinner at five thirty â he would always come in and eat dinner - but he didn't come. I couldn't find him, so I decided just to stay and wait and he finally came home. I made up my mind before he came that I wouldn't say anything to him if he didn't tell me. We sat down to dinner and oh, he was so happy and oh, "Baby, this is delicious. We are having the nicest time." I got madder by the minute and he was happier by the minute. And I said, "Charles, where have you been?" "Where have I been, Baby? I've just been riding around." I said, "You've been in jail." "Who told you that?" I said, "Let me see your license." "Oh, Baby, I can beat the man driving who gives the examination, but I got a little piece of paper in here." He showed me the paper. It was about two years old. He must have gotten it when he was getting well, dated about two years back. Before I looked at the date, I said, "That gives you permission to drive if somebody is in there with a license." I had a driver's license which my first husband bought, but I couldn't drive. "Now you can drive that car if I am in there with you." Then I looked at the date. I said, "This isn't any good. You've got to go take ..." "Oh, Baby, I can beat the man driving who gives the license." "Well" I said, "I am not going to ride with you anymore." So he started going down attempting to take the driver's test, but he couldn't pass. He got so mad with the man there; he said the man was mistreating him, that he could drive. The man told him to go to Montgomery. He went to Montgomery and he couldn't pass. One day he came in with a permit to drive and said that he had passed the test and his license would be here soon. I said, "Who drove you down there to take the test?" because Rev, Ford had been driving for him. "Nobody. I drove myself down there and got my license." That was Charles Kelly. Charles didn't care where I went, he wanted me to go. When I married him, I was, getting ready to retire. They had just passed a law that at 62 ... I had hoped that I could make it until I was 65 ... but they had passed a law that at 62 you could retire. I was in summer school the year before I married and I decided that when I became 62, I would retire. So I was getting ready to retire. Rev. Kelly was so proud of the fact that I was Dean of Women, he bragged about it. He was married to the Dean of Women,ï»¿94 HSK: (cont) so-and-so and I began to get angry with him. I felt that he had married the Dean of Women and not me and I never got over it, but it was a secret and this is the first time I've ever told it to anyone. I never got over the fact that he would brag on my being a Dean of Women. I stayed in until I was 67 years old. But I stayed in for two reasons. First, when I became 65, I'd almost convinced everyone that I was going to retire. I had said it for fifty years; and at 65 especially if I were in a high position. I was going to retire because I felt that young people will never have a chance to get into these positions if older people did not retire. But at 65, Dr. Foster said, "Well, I have nobody to take your place." I took one more year. At 66, "We have no one to take your place." I said, "I am sorry." I saw the handwriting on the wall. I knew that young people had to have ... it's got to be the President of the School, Dean of the College ... they've got to get out to someone the fact that change must come and you're not letting it come fast enough and you were in the way. Although I felt by the few children, young people, men and women who knew me ... I felt that they loved me. I felt that the connotation of that job at age 65 was that "you were in the way." I stayed on until 67 and then I retired from Tuskegee Institute, but not from life. I had lived in Snow Hill where the president of the school had retired. He and his family lived on the campus. Mr. Harry Simms, who became president, was hampered in his work because the people who had worked with the former president always felt that things should go on as they were. He was a very innovative man. He was a man who wanted a college that was different. We felt that Tuskegee Institute was different, but Snow Hill Institute was even more different than Tuskegee Institute, if he could carry it out -the things that he believed. At Snow Hill Institute he was fortunate to have a wife who sang. They traveled, they sang, they raised money for Snow Hill Institute. But I could see what happens if a person in the family who had been in a position continued to be a part of it and that family continued. So, from that lesson, I said that so far as I am concerned, I'll be no part of Tuskegee Institute other than trying to interpret what I felt the mission of the university really was at that time. So, I joined myself very actively with the Baptist Church in the community, although I was reared in the Methodist AME Zion Church. When I came to Tuskegee in 1923, I joined the AME Church, had charge of the Epworth League of Christian Endeavor ... whatever the children's group was called, and worked in the church. I felt that since my husband was a Baptist, that I should join the Baptist Church. I also wanted to be baptized. Charles' sister, who was much older than Charles, I don't know how old she was at that time. If I was 60, she must have been in her seventies. (By the way, this joining the chapel was very early in our married life, so I think I must be backing up, but I do want to tell this, it has just come into my mind.) Sister Pearl and I decided that we were going to be baptized. I knew that if the people knew we were going to be baptized, it would be nothing but a show. So, we decided that we would ask Rev. Harvey, the pastor, if he would baptize us on a Wednesday night. Rev. Kelly objected to ourï»¿95 HSK: (cont) going into the Baptist Church. He said his mother was a Methodist, his father was a Baptist, but he went to the Baptist Church because of his father. His sister and the other members of the family went to the Methodist Church with their mother. I knew that there were things that I felt about the Holy Spirit and about the church that I wanted to do through a church that my husband was a part of. I asked the pastor and he said, "Yes, you can join the Church, be baptized at the same time on Wednesday night." I had been attending prayer meeting and I knew that it was poorly attended. I knew that there wasn't now another Sunday, so the pastor could not announce that we were going to be baptized that night because I told him ... I asked him on a Monday and on a Wednesday night, S ister Pearl and I got ready to be emerged. I had been sprinkled in the Methodist Church aid I thought maybe the water was cold, so I put on a lot of clothes, put on the long white dress that they told us to wear. I put on a swimming cap and tied my head up with a towel and we went to be baptized. They baptized me first, down in the water and up. Then they baptized Sister Pearl. The men were there and the women to bring us up. Coming behind me, Sister Pearl was pulling on me and said, "Sister Hattie, did your dress go up in the water?" (Laughter) We went down. I didn't know that the ladies were going to undress me because we dressed ourselves. The ladies began to undress me and I looked and I had on a garment that was my color; it was a rubber girdle that had -rubber turned dark in the water and I didn't know it. I said, "What is that dirty thing?" The lady said, "What's this you got on?" I said, "When you are being baptized, the water is to go to you." I put on a panty girdle of rubber, it wasn't tight, but when it was wet -and so, I had to pull all that thing off in front of those ladies. They undressed me and they dried us off and then we had to put on our clothes and go back in and the pastor talks. There weren't more than twelve people at prayer meeting that night and I was very happy because I didn't want it to be a show. I wanted to be baptized because I feel that communion and being baptized or sprinkling or kneeling when you pray or standing when you pray are outward signs of how you feel within. If you don't feel that way within, I can't help it, but I believe in going through with those things. I've got a little funny story to tell about Frank West vhen I say outward signs. I always took my Bible to church because my mother took her Bible to church. I always took a little Bible to church and when a preacher preached, I opened the Bible and I would mark the place because I wanted to read it and I wanted to see how he developed it. One day I was going to church and Frank West said to me, "Why are you going to carry that Bible?" I said, "Well, I don't know, but I mark the Scripture." "Why do you kneel down and pray when you go to church?" In my church, when we'd go in, we'd kneel down and pray. He said, "Why do you kneel down and pray when you go to church?" He said, "And you cry, why do you cry when the preacher is preaching?" He said, "Hat, you must lave been a mighty big devil in your day to kneel down and pray every time you hear a sermon. You start crying; you go to church, you kneel down and pray^ you take your Bible to church. Iï»¿96 (cont) repeat," he said, "What have you done in your past life that makes you cry, makes you take your Bible, makes you kneel down calling on the Lord asking Him to help you?" From that day ''till this, I don't carry my Bible to church and if I do, I put it in my pocketbook. I have no tears when the ministers preach and I don't think that ... I can't recall it, maybe I cried a little bit, but I used to just weep. I used to, when a song was sung, or a preacher said something that I thought was glorious about love and about the things for which Jesus stood and the things that we are doing now in the world, something would run up and down my spine and I would cry. Even if a preacher connected it with welfare, child care, dependent children, old age pensions, I always thought that those things that were once carried on by the church, are now being carried on by the government and even the people who administer them may do wrong, but I kind of feel that nobody can suffer if they make their need known and it made me almost weep when I'd hear it. But now, I can listen without weeping. I was not weeping because I was necessarily thinking about the wrongs that I had done. Every wrong that I committed that I think is a sin, I don't wait, I ask God immediately to forgive me. If I mistreat anybody and I know it, I go to them and tell them I am very sorry that I didn't mean it that way. If I know a person who thinks something about me or they think that I am mistreating them, and I know it, I try to act in such a way or say something that will let them know that I love everybody with all my heart. I feel that everybody is made in the image of God. I feel that we separate the person from what he is doing, even if what he is doing is a sin. Wrong and right have very little . . . though those words are hardly in my vocabulary, but good and evil are. I feel that sin separates one from God and the interpretation of it must be given by the individual. When my first husband met me, I was a woman who cried a lot in church. I was a woman who knelt and prayed. I was a woman who took a Bible to church. I am glad he mentioned it, so now I don't take my Bible. I took my Bible Sunday, so I'll have to take that back. I take my Bible, but I take a bag big enough to put the Bible in, whether this is right or not. Now, back to Charles Kelly. I think I told you that Charles Kelly wanted me to go, he didn't care where I went. He didn't care where I went, just that I came back. I think I was loved by two men who were very different. I think that both of them had to do with my training. As Dean of Women, I can remember how if Frank West said anything to us â and he always required that we eat in the dining room. I never saw Frank West eat in the breakfast room, in fact, we just discarded it. We never ate in the breakfast room. We ate in the dining room and I think that the way he questioned me, "What did I say? What did I mean? What do you think I said?" â it prepared me to be Dean of Women. Without asking that question over again,ï»¿97 HSK: (cont) I always said to a girl, "Now what did we agree upon? What is it that is different?" I think of one particular something I want to deal with which happened very recently. My granddaughter came to live with me four years ago, and a niece who was the daughter of my sister Rowena's daughter, a grandniece and a granddaughter; there were girls here all the time and I felt that I wanted to communicate. I wanted to communicate with those girls, so each time when they'd come, when they were sitting around the table, I'd go join them. I remember once, they said, "We just can't communicate with old people." I said, "Why can't you communicate?" Because I really had a false impression of myself. I had boasted that I could communicate with young people and I thought I could. So I said, "Why can't we communicate?" They said, "We just can't communicate." I said, "Well, what is it we can't communicate about?" "We can't communicate about sex." I said, "Well, what is sex?" They said, "Sex is the extreme expression of love." I said, "All right, I think you are talking about looking at a beautiful picture and there's sex, admiring a beautiful ... " "Oh no, ha ha ha," they said. "That's what we think about you old people. You don't know what sex is." I said, "Well, you're talking about sexual intercourse." "Yes, we thought that that was understood." "The definition, you see, of sexual intercourse, is the extreme expression of love, like a kiss or something." "Yes ma'am, that's what it is and that's all we mean." I said, "Well, no wonder we can't communicate." I said, "You know what we old people thought and what I feel?" I said, "I thought sexual intercourse was your attempt to reproduce your kind. Well, with any kind of animal, with any kind of people, I didn't think that sexual intercourse was used to express love. I thought it was an expression of love, but that you were trying to have a child." And they laughed and laughed and laughed. And I laughed too. But, you know, they converted me, they made me see that we can't communicate. Now, I tell any child, I say, "You're sixteen and I am eighty. But I am going to listen to what you say and you listen to what I say and I'm not going to reprimand you, but don't you reprimand me." I have a little story that I tell to people who start differing. I said it's like this: Montgomery is about forty miles from here. If you had gone in an ox cart 100 years ago, it might have taken you a week, because you might have stopped in the grass or stopped at a cabin or cut down the trees across the road. You haven't been back, you went 100 years ago. Somebody else went 70 years ago in an ox cart. It might have taken them all day long. They haven't been back, here they sit. Somebody else went in a horse and buggy. It took them a few hours. They haven't been back. Somebody else went in a car and they got here in an hour and they haven't been back. But, here comes a young person who flies from Montgomery to Tuskegee airport in two minutes and we all sit and fuss. I tell you, you can't get here in two minutes, it will take you a week. Trees are all over the place, grasses and the water. Your horse can't get through, your ox is slow. I said, "We can't communicate, but we can understand that each one has seen things at different times." They taught me a lesson that I thought I knew. But I have begun and I am sure if that was just four years ago, I must have been 76, I was converted.ï»¿98 (cont) Back there, when those two girls came to live with me, I almost didn't know what to do. I said, "I have a living room." I knew that they had begun at various universities to allow boys visiting in the girls' bedrooms and all. I never objected to it other than, if there is a living room, entertain in the living room. If there is a kitchen, cook in the kitchen. If there's a dining room, eat in the dining room. If there's a bedroom, when you get ready to go to sleep, go to the bedroom. I felt that with all my heart. I explained to the young people, if I had only one room, you would cook, you would wash, you would iron, in that one room and sleep in that one room and you'd entertain in that one room. If you stay at my house, you entertain in the living room, you cook in the kitchen, not in your room. You bring your food to the dining room and you eat in the dining room. Breakfast is at a certain hour, dinner is at a certain hour and we will have lunch at a certain hour and I expect you to come. You cannot do well, you can't do your work unless you eat right. For a year I tried that and they pretended to try. I could tell they were running and I was working myself to death trying to keep the hours and trying to see that you don't go back there, that's your bedroom. The most serious thing came when the society was at its height about marijuana. Somehow the use of it never disturbed me so much because I thought about when we started using tobacco and how people thought to use snuff and tobacco, that was the end of the world. I know how people talked about smoking but then finally everybody accepted it. But somehow the law: the law of man to me was almost as important as the law of God because until now I have not been able to really separate the laws of God from the laws of man. I have to stop and see. But there came a friend of mine, a white friend of min^ who was a nurse who lived in a building right near me. She came to see me often. She wasn't here but a year and she came to me crying and saying, "I have not been asked to return and I love Tuskegee and they will not tell me why." I said, "What is your guess?" she said, "There's a young man who comes to see me, who really peddles dope, I don't know what he's connected with." She said, "But I enjoyed him very much and I allowed him to come over to my apartment." She said, "Mrs. Kelly, I don't use any dope, but I ride around with him and I don't know what he's doing. I ride ... " It happened that I knew the man. I know his brothers and sisters better than I know him because he was in the service. When my husband, Charles Kelly, was pastor of the Emanuel Church, this boy's mother and all the sisters were members. The sisters were little girls and were members of the little girls' meetings that I had here. I knew them very well. She left the house. When she left, the fellow always came around to my house and he had on pants and no shirt. He'd come around to see my girls. I don't know which one he was coming to see. So I decided, I said, "I won't take that girl's word," I went to the officials of the school. I said, "You have got to let that nurse stay in." They said, "Mrs. Kelly, we had to do that." I went to two officials who had to know that she was not asked to return. I said, "That girl is a good nurse. Why, you need nurses over there and she wants to stay." "We had to do it. She rides around with a man that we cannot touch. We're afraid. We think he's connected with some type of ring andï»¿-99 ftSK: (cont) that he's the one who distributes the dope through the community, through the school." I said, "I see." I called my girls in. I was sad that I had taken it upon myself because I had told them it didn't make any difference to me. Anybody wants to come to my house, my door's open. Just entertain them in the living room, that's all I ask. I had to tell them that I was very sorry. I said, "Now I am not going to call a name but I want you to listen. I'm not calling any man's name but any man who is known, oh yes, I knew more than that." These girls way back there had told me that this boy, the boy who lived downstairs in this same house, had told them that this man was a dope peddler and they had laughed and told me themselves, that he was a dope peddler and they knew it. I said, "Any man who peddles dope can't come to my house. I'm sorry and I mean it." There were some friends who were very dear to me and I had to tell one man what I had done. He put locks on my door. He said, "Mrs. Kelly, sleep in a room where you can lock the door, because that's pretty dangerous." I said, "I'm sorry, but put them on there." So he put a lock on both of the doors, to the room that I had moved into and I stayed in the room. I said, "Well, I'll take his advice, but I am not afraid." The next morning the girls came in and they said, "Grandmother, we're going to move on the campus because this young man can't come to see us." I said, "All right." I said, "Call your mothers and tell them it's all right with me for you to move on campus." So both of them moved on the campus. I went up and paid their room and board on campus. They said, "We want to eat out here," I said, "Oh, no. You can't eat at my house. If you're going tp live on the campus, you live up there." I paid the room and board for both of them and I said, "Tell your mothers now. I am paying your room and board." So when they called their mothers, both of the mothers talked with me and said, "Well, if it's all right with you, Grandmother, it's all right with me." And I told them why. "Well, if it's all right ..." I didn't put them out. About a week later my granddaughter came back and said, "Grandmother, please let me come back. Please let me come back. Men are in the bathrooms and I just can't stand it." School had started, we had student government. We had students on the council. Students wanted students in charge. Even when an adult was in charge, they were afraid, just as the friends were afraid for me. There weren't but two friends, however, who knew what I had done. But I wasn't afraid. And I said, "Adrienne, come in. I haven't put you out. You can stay here as long as you want to - but a peddler of dope cannot." Now, one young man who was a friend of mine came to see me and he said, "Mrs. Kelly, I understand that you said anybody dealing in marijuana couldn't come to your house." He said, "Go look in the drawer in your front bedroom." I was sleeping in that bedroom. But it had been a guest room. He said, "Look in that drawer." I looked in the drawer. He said, "You see that, you see that? That's marijuana." Well, there had been my grandson, my grandnephew; there had been other boys who had stayed here in the house;ï»¿100 (cont) I don't know who all. I said, "Just close the drawer. I thank you very much but I have not said anything about anybody who uses it." He said, "It doesn't matter." I looked in that drawer and there were four hundred and some odd dollars in that drawer and I don't know where it came from. I'm saying this to say that sometimes you have to be converted by seeing something in your own house. The young man who came and showed me this is very dear to me. I have never tried to find out from the men who visit my house who put it there and who didn't. I don't know when it disappeared but it did. It disappeared from those drawers and where it went, it doesn't matter. Since that time I have turned all of it over to God. If anybody wants to peddle, if anybody wants to use it, I hope it's between them and their God. I don't try to find out. I don't try to know. Whether that's right or wrong, that is the position I have at this particular time. I think the fact that those girls came to live in my house, perhaps means more to me than any experience I could have had, that prepared me to live as a woman 80 years old with people whom I meet. At the present time, I have this feeling, people older and younger cannot communicate because they do not try to talk things out, to listen and dare to be different. At the present time, I dare to be different, but I do not dare to make other people different. I feel that that is impossible. I feel that the most important thing is to have people to be themselves. I think the other thing that I ought to mention is that I was brought up to feel that to go to a church or Sunday School was required by God. That to join a church of your parent's choice was obligatory. And that's what I did. I was in the Methodist Church until I married Reverend Kelly, then I went into the Baptist Church. I grew up believing that, and I tried to impose it on girls when I was Dean of Women. When chapel was required, I tried to tell them that you go and listen. What that chaplain says to you is like a class;you're not at home with your denomination so chapel service is non-denominational, so - go and listen. Whether you believe or not is your business. When my girls came to live with me I was surprised. They too had been brought up in a church but they didn't go. My grandchildren were Catholics. I had always bragged that a Catholic, wherever, even if he's traveling, he'll stop at his church. But my Catholic children didn't go to church. I didn't know so much about my grandniece but she didn't go either -other than when the young man who played for the church, asked her to go with him and then she would go to church with him. I began to think seriously about the church. I had joined six different churches but all of them were Methodist churches. So I didn't feel there was anything I had missed there. I just felt that I ought to be in church. I have grown to feel, grown to study more about a definition of a church which I knew. I've always known the church was a group of people who getï»¿101 HSK: (cont) together because they have certain interests, spiritual interests, in common. Now I'm perfectly converted to that. Just last year, I joined a church where there are just a few members. I can't pick out more than a dozen members. This church pulled out three years ago from another church. I didn't join them because it was a church. I joined with them because the pastor of that church is President of a school in town that we call Southern Vocational College. I don't know how he happened to ask me, but he asked me to serve as trustee of the school. The first year, this was last year, he asked me to teach English; I was to teach grammar. I was to teach nurses, L.P.N.'s, girls who were studying to be licensed practical nurses. I was interested in the school because I had heard so many people criticize Tuskegee Institute, and say that we ought to be doing what Booker T. Washington did and I knew that Booker T. Washington would be doing something different if he were here. But this school had called in students who hadn't finished high school many of them, some of them had children, were not married, and would not have come to another school if they could have. We were teaching them to take the high school equivalency test. This experience I called working in the 'blessed community' for the first few months that I was there. I thought the L.P.N.'s should be interested in visiting the hospital, John Andrews Hospital, the Macon County Hospital, the public health department, ... in visiting the nursing homes in the community. The assignments I made, and all our lessons centered around that, until one day the girls told us that "We want our lessons to center around the lessons that our nursing teachers are giving us." I thought of it and got the books and attempted to teach them the dividing of words into syllables, defining, prefixes, and affixes to the words that were used in medicine. Shortly afterwards the President called a meeting of the nurses and he told them every nurse in his school would pass. I knew from those two experiences that I could not continue working in Southern Vocational College, although I approved of the girls that they had. To me, those nurses needed experiences and not preparation for examinations. So at the end of the year, I told the President I'd be glad to remain a trustee but I could not continue to teach in his school. I'm also chairman of what they call special services. This is funded by the federal government. It is connected with Southern Vocational College. These young people are enrolled in special services and are paid to attend. They are given lessons by the teachers who teach at Southern Vocational College. An attempt is made to give the students marketable skills. At Southern Vocational College, I was surprised to find one trustee, a Southern white man in Tuskegee who owns one of the buildings in which we were working, would always wait for the rent for that building. There were two other men... In fact the speaker who was introduced last week at the commencement, was introduced as a millionaire, he's a farmer. He and his wife are very lovely people. I mentioned that because there are people who feel that when people get to be millionaires, that there's very littleï»¿102 ttSK: (cont) they can do to communicate with people who are very poor. But this example at Southern Vocational College is a rich experience and although I refused to continue teaching there, I feel that it's a 'blessed community' and I will continue working with these trustees and with the students who are enrolled there. aLT: Mrs. Kelly, since retirement years, have you been affiliated with any other institutions of learning, any other type of employment, or was retirement truly retirement for you from an active point of work? HSK: When I retired, I knew that I felt that I was retiring to life. I declared that I would not work in any situation that called for a hierarchy setup. Quite some summers ago, two people came to Tuskegee, Mr. and Mrs. Stein. They came from New York City looking for Hattie West Kelly. Someone told them where they would find me and when they came I asked them how they knew me. They said they were trying to find somebody in New York who knew the play school situation and who would come South and help them in establishing play schools all over the South. They went to play school headquarters and a Miss Marslow told them, "You have a woman at Tuskegee who worked in the play schools in New York and who knows all about the situation." So they came to me. They said that Ethical Union would furnish the teachers but there was an "in~kimd" service that would have to be furnished by every community. Every community had to have a sponsoring organization and they had to furnish room and board for the students who would come. Some came from Yale and Harvard, wherever they could find students who wanted experiences in the South. They were brought into these situations and placed wherever the young people felt they would like to work. After they talked with ,me I was intrigued because this seemed to me another 'blessed community' alt'tasagh I had to follow the outlines that were given to me. I thought that the sponsoring organization would be the Council on Human Relations which at that time was very active here. The President in Auburn, Mississippi, Grace Hooks, was our key person here and we asked her if she would co-ordinate the work of the particular groups and I would serve as the person who would supervise those who were working. The play school situation would be as it is supposed to be because a play school is not a play school; it's a real school in which children work creatively even though they may consider it play. That year we were very succesful. We not only had five play schools: one at Shorter, Alabama, and four schools in Tuskegee, but we had another one that they hadn't told me about. That was with high school students with special talents who were ranking low in their schools, or whom the teachers felt were not being given the experiences that they should have ... we put them in touch with high schools. I guess about two dozen young people were selected and persons worked with them. They worked primarily in the literary area. That year the play school was partially successful. There were many things that we didn't like but we did the best we could; the Ethical Culture part was carried out. We had difficulty in finding places for the young people to stay. They wanted to live with people whose children were being taught, and not on the Tuskegee Institute campus; not in the motels,ï»¿(cont) not in homes that were selected because they had special rooms. So it was a little difficult, but we did find places. The second year, we asked the Federation of Women's Clubs to sponsor a play school and our work was a total failure. Each club was to interview parents and children and make recommendations. There were five clubs and they were to recommend at least 12 children to attend these play schools. We had difficulty. We thought we had some churches ... almost all our churches have education departments. We thought we had some schools. We thought we had the children and when we opened the schools we found that our recruitment program had not been good and that many of the children who were supposed to come did not appear - children whose parents we had interviewed. So we just had to go out on highways and hedges and get any children we could find to attend. We had it one other summer. We tried to work very closely with the play schools in Auburn which are still being carried on. Nancy Speers, a supervisor of Headstart in Auburn, worked with us and worked with the people in Auburn because I felt I could no longer take the responsibility and find the people to help and get the "in kind" service that was required to continue the work. These experiences, when I tell you what we did, were considered quite rewarding to me for those two years that I worked there. I think I heard you mention a curriculum laboratory? The other experience was in the curriculum laboratory just last year at Tus-kegee Institute. After the play schools I decided again, and felt that I was led to say that I would never work in a situation where somebody passed down to me what we had to do. Play schools it doesn't seem would be like that. But it was like that. Because Ethical Culture could not and would not do their part; unless we did ours. Another reason - back to the play schools before I go to this - another reason it was discontinued was because there were many blacks who felt that these whites were coming into the community to help our children when perhaps it was needed in the town of Tuskegee more than at Tuskegee Institute. Mr. and Mrs. Stein had asked that the young people who had come â most of them were white, there were always two or three colored but there were dozens of them, must have been 24 or more; two or three of them were colored â asked that they be exposed to some students who were considered very radical. So I asked a young man to select two or three students, as many as he cared to, to come in and meet with them. To my surprise, communications were one-sided. The young people had planned to ask questions but before they could ask questions, the colored students who came in - all of them were either in college or graduates of colleges - told these young people and Mr.and Mrs. Stein that they should be establishing schools in the white community, that blacks had used whites as images for years, that blacks knew how to work with whites but they needed now to know how to work with each other. I think that had a lot to do with discouraging Mr. and Mrs. Stein who were trying very hard to have an experience that would get whitesï»¿104 HSK: (cont) and blacks together. Last year at the alumni meetings - and I attended them religiously and I do attend alumni meetings - the question of our participation in deciding who faculty members should be came up. Many of the graduates of the school present felt that at Tuskegee Institute we were working too fast with getting white faculty members and most of the administrative jobs were being held by non-blacks. They brought up one in particular. They were trying to get a committee to go to the President to say that the Dean of the School of Education had made remarks in a faculty meeting; had said to people that he would not hire a black, neither would he hire a Tuskegee Institute graduate to work in the School of Education. I tried to say that ... and ask if maybe that was taken out of context and maybe the Dean had had a Tuskegee Institute graduate who was not doing his work and that he was irritated so he said, "I'll not hire another one." And it may be that someone had questioned him about the number of whites who were in the School of Education and he may have said, "Well, I'll not hire another black or Tuskegee Institute graduate ... " But that didn't help. And I understand that these professors at Tuskegee went to the President and were assured that this Dean of the School of Education, if it was proved that he had made these statements, would not be asked to return. Shortly after those remarks were made, the Dean called me, a Dean whom I don't think I had seen before. If I had seen him, I'd seen him but once and that was in a public place ... called me and asked me if I would come in and help them in the curriculum lab. Without taking a second thought, I said, "I would be delighted." Then afterwards, I thought, "I wonder why I did that?" I found that I wanted to know the man that said those things so I went to see him. Went to his office to be sure that he knew me and he knew I was black and that he knew I not only was a graduate of Tuskegee Institute, the normal school, but that I had received my B.S. degree from Tuskegee Institute. He knew that. And said that was what he wanted. I told him I was. And I told himvhy I was saying that. He laughed and didn't say he hadn't said what he was accused of saying, but said he appreciated my telling him. I worked all that year in the curriculum lab, enjoyed the books, enjoyed the young people who came in. The curriculum lab was not to take the place of a library. It was to take the place of a counseling program for education students and a depository for books that faculty members either owned or felt that if there was just one copy of a title, that those books should be in a central place for the students whom they were teaching. So I had the privilege of talking with students who were interested in particular areas and with professors. I found that the students were very fond of the Dean of the School of Education. I found that he was working toward what I thought the School of Education should be, that education was a drawing out of the student, what was in him and taking what you had seen and helping him to interpret what his contribution to the world should be and how it would be. The curriculum lab, began exhibiting whatever our theme was for a particular period; exhibiting books and having films and anyoneï»¿105 HSK: (cont) who passed by could come in. Mainly, I felt that my association with this Dean was very rewarding. I knew that there were others who felt that color made no differences, that books were not the most important thing, that they were only used as a means to an end. That was the story he was trying to get over. The work ended. I spoke to the faculty many times and one particular time - since faculty members did not come into the curriculum lab as much as I cared for them to - there were only five who had reserve shelves ... the others very seldom came in. I described the curriculum lab as the heart of the School of Education. The Dean, the teachers and the professors as the brain and the head, and the students and our public - whether they were parents or other people - were the hands and feet and that one could not get along without the other. I don't think I got to the first base in that 'blessed community.' And this year when they asked me if I'd be back, I told them "No, I would not be back, my 'blessed community' had moved." The only two ... I called them jobs; they were almost jobs that I had, because when I went into the curriculum lab, I thought that I was to take charge of it and do as I cared to. As soon as I looked around, I decided that almost all the books should be taken out; they were work books and they were old books. I got another room and the old books were not to be thrown away but to be used as references. All the work books were either to be sent to schools to be torn up and to be used,if they could be used, just for making puzzles and games. I found that there was a doctor in charge of the curriculum lab. That was her headquarters. She was teaching curriculum building and those workbooks and things were used by her class. They were making ... I wish I could remember the name ... making all sorts of things, but cutting paper and showing how they were working with them. So that was a workshop for that professor. Instead of trying to carry out some things that I thought, I began to work with her. It was delightful, but it wasn't what I envisioned at first, but it was a delightful thing. The man who worked with her ... I don't want to call the two names ... taught, well anyhow, he did everything. He ran films for everybody all over the campus. The students took audio-visual aids. At the beginning of this year, Tuskegee Institute gave them a building that was once the administration building. The curriculum laboratory will have a whole floor and will be able to spread out and render a larger service. When I was working at the curriculum lab there, I went to the curriculum lab in Auburn and found that evidently thousands of dollars were spent there and some of the studies they made and what they did was rewarding too. Those were two experiences that I had that guidelines were given to me and as I worked with them. I found more guidelines than the name suggests, and I wasn't particular about returning to work. Alt. Mrs. Kelly, the other day when we were talking about the purposes of the interview and the aspects of your life that we might touch on, you showed me a list of organizations to which you belonged and it appeared to me that just reading the names of these organizations would in itself show some dimension or show the breadth of your experience and involvement. If youï»¿106 ALT: (cont) would read that list ... when you get through if you want to comment on those in which perhaps you've had some leadership role or which have been significant to you for any other reason, I'd like very much for you to do that. HSK: I have listed these organizations because I have been trying to see how, at age 80, I could be of a little more service. These are organizations that I am now actively engaged in. Some of them I have been in for a long, long time. The first one I want to mention is the Tuskegee Women's Club. The Tuskegee Women's Club was organized by Booker T. Washington's third wife, Mrs. Booker T. Washington. The presidency of this Club has been held by local women. I think that you will be pleased to know that we are interested in this Club because it was started, perhaps nationally, in Boston when women saw that children and women were being mistreated and they felt that more attention should be given to women and children, that they should rise up and take their places. The local club saw wayward children being placed in jail, so they started what was the Girls' Industrial Home in Mt. Meggs, Alabama. Mrs. Washington became President of the State Federation of Women's Clubs. That Federation kept that home for girls until about five years ago, maybe longer than that, but the state took over. After the state took over, we sent clothes and went to the home, but the state paid the teachers. Just recently it has been integrated and that school is no more at Mt. Meggs, Alabama. The entire school is a school for boys. Our Club is interested primarily in scholarships for young people who otherwise could not get them through the federal government or through a school. We have young people in several universities ... young people whose tuition, board and lodging, we are paying. I am vice-president of this Club and working very actively in it and hoping that we can do more to show that we are interested in the problems of our town and county and state and the world. I'm a life member of the National Council of Negro Women. The history of the National Council of Negro Women is very, very interesting. Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune was President of the National Association of Women's Clubs and when she became old, they wanted to change the National's President. She did not want to give it up and so she started what you call the National Council of Negro Women. The National Council of Negro Women is different from the Tuskegee Women's Club in that she envisioned having representatives from all the churches and all the clubs to have a representative to come together and call it the National Council of Negro Women. There was not to be individual dues. The missionary society or the sorority or whatever club which sent a representative to become a member, was to pay $10.00. Mrs. Bethune raised money and built the headquarters for the National Council of Negro Women; but before she died she was asked to withdraw and another young lady became President and is still President and very activeï»¿107 HSK: (cont) in the organization. By the way, this young woman (Dorothy Height) has raised money, and a monument to Mrs. Bethune has been built in Washington D.C. It's the only monument to a Negro woman. I told you that Macon County PTA has always been very active from the time I worked at the Children's House. But somehow we could never get parents to understand that 'page ten' was not the most important thing for the child. I was teaching at the Children's House which was perhaps, if we use the word "progressive," as progressive as any school in the United States. People who visited there said so. Children who went from the Children's House to other schools, for the most part as near as we can recall, ranked very high tecause the ... people in the School of Education supervised the work at the Children's House ... and any group of people, whether it was in psychology or whatever they called it, the Children's House was the first place that they came and worked and observed. But for some reason, the members of the PTA were more involved with May Day, making paper dresses; they were more involved with the prizes that children should receive for one thing or another. They were more involved in criticizing teachers who didn't give all A's. They, and some of the teachers were more involved with, "This is a doctor's child, this is a preacher's child; this child lives way out." And although Tuskegee Insitute was loved and respected, secretly people felt that favors were given to those connected with it and with the Veterans ' Hospital which was really built the year before I came here to teach. So I think that it happened, I can't describe to you our May Day programs and our commencement programs because they were so elaborate. On May Day, money was spent for the strings for the Maypole. Material was gotten and cut up. Dresses were made for the children and I think they were vying ... children were elected to be the May Queen and I'm not so sure how they were elected. I'm almost sure it was the prettiest girl and the brightest girl, I'm not sure of that. I've always not approved, not appreciated myself for not entering things that I do not understand. I think any fool can detect a mistake, but it takes a wise man to correct it. And if I couldn't correct the mistake, the only thing I would say .... I wonder, I always wonder whether the money that was spent for these things and for these days, could not have been used for other purposes. However, I had to rationalize in some way. I arrived at this conclusion: that those who were making the dresses were artists because they were beautiful things. If the teacher wanted to have a game about rabbits, those children looked exactly like rabbits. If they wanted to have something about queens, if they wanted to have a fairy tale ... But you know, I never remember anybody having a unit on Africa and the children dressed as Africans. Until, as I worked as rural demonstration teacher at Mitchell's Mill. For some reason I wasn't working that summer, I was to have a demonstration school at Mitchell's Mill. I decided I'd have the 'blessed community.' There were blackberries and plums all around the place. I took the children out and we gathered plums. Our home economics class made jelly. Blackberries ... everything we used we madeï»¿108 HSK: (cont) and had them for lunches. At this time, children were straightening their hair and we thought that was the thing to do ___ wash your hair, straighten your hair. When I taught in the school in North Carolina, a supervisor who was white came to the school with a health nurse. She said, "You know, I haven't found any lice in the black children's hair. Over in the white school, the children's hair is full with lice." She said, "Why is that?" This was in 1923. I said, "You know, I never thought of that, but with the comb we put through our children's hair, no lice could live." So at this rural demonstration school --- if I did it now, I wouldn't do it again. I had one room where the children would go and wash their hair and a beautician from Tuskegee would come out and press their hair just a little bit. You had little stoves that you put the combs in 5 the beauticians heated the combs. One day in that room, we had about three children, their hair was being straightened. I looked out and the State Superintendent of Education was coming. The teachers started to run. I said, "No, I'm sorry." In one room, the children were writing about the hair: how to wash the hair, how to straighten the hair to keep it from burning and how the beautician could do it only once and they would keep it up. I said, "Lord, don't desert me now." When the Superintendent came, the very first room, our library, was the beauty parlor, (laughter) I opened the door, it was full of smoke. I said, "Sir, this is the way we keep the lice down." I said, "No lice live on our children's heads." It came to me all at once from North Carolina. This was in the '40s, 20 years ago, that this white woman had said this to me and we had plenty of fun talking about it. He looked, he had never seen people straightening their hair before. It would not be new to white people now because they use as many irons, I understand. alt: alt: ALX. SSK; Why did you do this at the school1! ^SK: x wasn't at the school. I was out at Mitchell's Mill. I had a demonstration rural school in a big building out at Mitchell's Mill. But this was a school session though where they were actually washing and pressing their hair? This is the way I felt that the lesson should be. So in one room, if a child came with dirty hair ... I see. I see. ... I'd send them into this room. The older girls would wash their hair, but I would never ... As a learning experience, I see. That's right. Keeping clean. Then the hairdressers - there were always hairdressers who would volunteer to come out and dry the hair with a straightening comb.ï»¿109 ALT: I see. HSK: In those days, you dried the hair wet and there was always smoke. So he came in that room. I said, "Now come in this other room." In this other room they were writing sentences about the hair. The children were making up sentences and having lots of fun. The teacher was so embarrassed and I was delighted. I said, "If you don't understand, I'm sorry." He looked and they were writing sentences on the board, they were making up stories. That group was making up stories about the hair. I took him into the kitchen. The children had been out early that morning picking blackberries. They were washing the blackberries and they were going to eat these blackberries raw. But the plums, they had boiled and were mashing them up and running them through a cloth, squeezing the juice through a cloth. He said, "What are you going to do with that?" And the teacher told him how she was going to use a cup of juice and a cup of sugar and she was going to make jelly because the children loved jelly. We had other things. The blackberries were mashed to make blackberry juice. They were making juice, getting ready for lunch. They were making bread. They were making light bread,and the yeast for the bread we made. We made the yeast, so there were long pans of yeast that we had made. We had bread in the stove. We went to another group of children and they were writing about how they had been to pick the blackberries and what the blackberries were going to make and so on. I said that to say this, that Superintendent went back and I guess I was known all over the state when I thought I had disgraced the School of Education. I was representing the School of Education at Tuskegee Institute. But it's way out, Mitchell's Mill, Mitchell's Village. I don't get it confused with Mitchell's Village. This was Mitchell's Mill. Mitchell's Village is a place where they had the airport; my husband taught communications there. Mitchell's Mill was there and this superintendent, every teachers' meeting, he talked abut this school and how the schools ought to be. I saw teachers laugh about it. They laughed. Thought how foolish it was. Saw no connection with it. But our spelling lessons were centered around them. Our reading lessons; we found stories in books. We made booklets; they made their own booklets and used their own conversation about the things that we did. I recall the names of some of the teachers because I had some teachers there who felt the same way and who had grown up on a farm and knew things that I didn't know. At that time, they had not cut down all the plum bushes and the blackberry bushes. I remember when I married Reverend Kelly, back of our house, was just like a jungle but the plum bushes and blackberry bushes ... we had apple trees. I had a man come in and clean off the back because I was afraid that snakes would come in. When I looked, all my plum trees were cut down, all the blackberry bushes were cut down, and this has happened all over the woods, because you didn't have to go out so far to pick them. But that experience I thought of when I thought of the Macon County Teachers' Association because the women who were working for degrees had to do theirï»¿110 HSK: (cont) observation here. At that time, we had a department called Rural Education. And Deborah Partridge who is an almost world known figure now, I know she's nationally known, had charge of our Department of Rural Education. ALT: How did that differ from just education, just straight education? HSK: You know, a long time ago there was a separation. If you were going to teach elementary education you were trained to teach elementary education. If you were trained to teach secondary education, you were trained to teach secondary education. In the rural ... we had one-teacher schools. I remember an old school we had. We had one-teacher schools and you taught all the children in one room. Although there were very few teachers who abided by it, we felt that to bring children up as fast as possible ... the lessons should be woven around the things that they knew. When I went to New York City and worked and observed in the schools there, I found that those children knew all about the Brooklyn Bridge, they knew about the library, the museums. They knew about those things. When I taught in the South ... when I went to school in North Carolina, for instance, that's a tobacco state. Today I don't know any more about tobacco than a person who's never seen it. And although I lived in the town and didn't see it growing in the town, I knew it was a tobacco state, but nobody taught it. When I came to teach in Alabama, right near Washington Public School was a lumber mill. There were cotton mills all around. Our children knew nothing about cotton. And when you attempted to teach them that, because parents bought the books, you couldn't teach 'page 2,' that "Jack and Jill went up the hill," you couldn't teach "the three blind mice" or whatever was in that book. You couldn't get to that. So teachers who wanted to do it were hampered. If you took the children on a field trip, you had two mistakes that were made. One was that the teachers K>uId take them on a field trip, come back and never say any more about it. If they did, they told the story, then forgot it. They didn't do what we were taught to do. If the children in the first grade were talking about home, they were supposed to write their story in their own words, on the board, transfer it to a big chart. Those children could read from that chart and didn't know one word from the other. And parents got angry. They didn't know what we were leading to. Now some people stopped there. You didn't stop there. You cut that chart into long pieces and put them up and askedthe child to go and find "My mother washes the dishes." They could find it, but it was a picture. Go find, "My father left home this morning." And whatever they said, in that story, they'd find. It didn't stop there. It was supposed to be cut into phrases. And the child was supposed to get on the floor and put those phrases together so they'd make sense. Teachers who followed through, those children could find the picture of "My mother washes the dishes at my home." Whatever it was, they could put it together. Now they didn't have to put it together as they told it but they had to put it together so it would make sense.ï»¿Ill HSK: (cont) That wasn't the end. You were supposed to have them put their own story into words. And have them take those words and build those words. And they could build those words like pictures. Then that wasn't the end. They'd cut those words into alphabets, and they were to take that, if they found a T, what would fit that T? If they found an A, what would fit that A? They didn't go back to that. People began to criticize us so and say we weren't teaching the ABC's. When I was in school, I had to sing the ABC's back and forth. And I had to do it until I learned it. It took me to the year to do that. But I couldn't read until I could say the ABC's and right now if you asked me where G is, I'd have to say "A - B - C - D - E - F - G" and I'd find G, there it is, because that's the way I was taught. We call that progressive education; this is just one phase of it; teachers would not do it. They would not. They didn't see. They said, "Oh no, we must teach ABC's." All right. Those children ... sometimes they were asked to find all the A's, find all the C's. At that time we were changing the way we teach phonics. I have some books that I would like to show you of how we taught phonics. We found out that the older ones of us who knew phonics would spell and pronounce words "Phil-a-del-phi-a, p had the sound of f ..." but we had memorized a lot of stuff and we didn't take it in context. All right, now if a child said, "cow", then how many other words sound like "cow"? And the child could name a whole lot of words that sounded like "cow". People said we were not teaching phonics because we were teaching it in this sentence. You see? Take one word from a sentence. How many other words sound like that to you? If a child gave one, we would give one. We didn't get to first base with that. And right now I have people tell ... now, you must remember that I had advantage over most people because we had talked about progressive education and individual difference. I didn't understand it at first. I thought every child had to have a teacher. And I thought that they meant let's just have fun and do as we please. But that wasn't true. I went to New York and observed at those schools and I went out to the Winnetka school and observed at the Dalton school that uses a contract system and I wished I had time to tell you about that. Then at Shady Hill, that school had six grades. ALT: Where is Shady Hill? HSK: Shady Hill is out from Boston in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Dr. J. Max Bond, whom I have mentioned before, had come to Tuskegee Institute to serve as dean of the School of Education. He wanted the Children's House to give children the freedom to be creative. But it was difficult for us to know how to do it. He had visited many schools that were called at that time the progressive schools, and people were trying to cause a change because they found that the older people had been educated to memorize and to accept, but otherwise it wasn't true. But at Shady Hill ... they sent me along with one of the teachers. Theyï»¿112 HSK: (cont) had a house for every grade. There were just six grades. In this house, there were two big rooms. And the children in the grade were divided into two parts. I understood after I was there a while, and after I saw the parents and worked with the parents and found out who the parents were. I found that those children were from very wealthy homes. You wouldn't have known it, they were dressed like paupers. I found that at the Shady Hill School they were doing just what Dr. Bond and two or three others had talked about. Those children spent a lot of time writing and talking about their experiences. Not only their experiences at school, but travel. Many of them had traveled extensively, and they talked freely, even the little first grade children talked freely. It was not until then that I learned that the word Alpha, ... the word Czechoslovakia, if a child had been there, was as easy for a first grade child to see and learn as the word "cat." You need not spend all that time with cat and rat, if the child had never seen one, as you would on whatever the child had seen and whatever he had talked about. In addition to where they had traveled, they talked about how they lived. They talked about their mothers and fathers and they told the most intimate things about their mothers and fathers, but the teachers would go right on and write their stories up or the children would write their stories. Some of them would say, "I never see my mother. She's always away. There is a lady there and the lady just does this." "What does the lady do?" and the child would tell all about what the lady does and "I love this lady, but I don't know my mother. My father comes home on the weekend. He leaves in an automobile," but whatever. In addition to that, they talked about the things they did at school. The play hours were really work hours although they called them play. I was there for an entire summer. The children would take their shoes off and leave them under the desk or under the seat or under the table in the classroom and go out for play. They would play with no shoes on their feet. They played games, many of them I was not familiar with, throwing darts and throwing rings. I knew about marbles and baseball and things, but they would come back in and write stories and talk about those games. Moreover, what is very important is that they talked about the game before they went out. The teachers went through the rules of the game and the children who were to be in charge would see that those rules were carried out, would learn what was to be done and what was expected of them. Just recently when people were talking about "You couldn't pray and read the Bible in the schools," I thought about my visit and my stay at Shady Hill School and I thought about how those children never felt that there wasn't room enough for all. They never were allowed to play the games unfairly. I think that is what prayer and the Bible means. They also talked about what they were going to eat for lunch and how it was prepared. The lunches for these children was prepared by older children. That's a little overview of the children and that to me was a 'blessed community' and I was glad to have that experience. There were many books in every room, but I never saw the children take any books home.ï»¿113 HSK: (cont) I think I ought to say a word about the teachers. We were with the children in the morning and we took turns to stay with the children in the afternoon while numbers of us were with the - I don't know what we called them - supervisors or somebody - the ladies who went around and were in charge of the program. And in those meetings, we worked hard. We criticized each other; they criticized the way you looked. Even teachers who were in the room working with the children pulled off their shoes. They worked without shoes. They worked in sleeveless dresses and at that time that seemed a little queer to me because I had come from a situation where teachers wore long sleeved dresses and long time ago we were just sure that the dresses,were not too low neck. In the work period with your supervisor, they smoked. The girls smoked. The supervisors smoked. They drank. They kept all sorts of drinks around and those who wanted them, drank and refreshed themselves and I don't know why I didn't. When they asked me to participate, I wondered and I asked them, "Who is going to pay for them; after I leave, who is going to pay for the cigarettes? Well, you're not communicating." And I stuck to it. I don't know whether I should have or not and I don't know whether I would now if I went. I might just go on and pretend to be smoking. I don't know, but I know I didn't. I said all this because I had had experiences that made me want to at the Children's House have this 'blessed community.' But the parents were our first enemies. Parents insisted that we do page and page. They would come to the meetings and say, "These teachers are not using these books. These teachers are not giving home assignments." When we had been taught that unless a child wanted to go on and continue what he was studying, that whatever was assigned in the classroom, the study should be supervised and he should have time to work it out and that the home life of the child should center around his home life and his living with his parents and his sisters and brothers. We didn't get so far with that. I was saying that in connection with my work with the Macon County Teachers' Association and the Macon County P.T.A. I was a member of what we call the Y.W.C.T.U.jthat was the Young Women's Christian Temperance Union. There was quite a lot of drinking at that time and I was very, very familiar with it because my half brother Victor, was a heavy drinker. He would sleep a lot. He worked, but I would go to his room when I knew he had been drinking; I would see that he would eat. When he was drunk, it was a pitiful sight. I was always interested in being a member of the Young Women's Christian Temperance Union. We had it here. ^ We met. We are working now through a woman in Birmingham. We cut out the "Young", the W.C.T.U. We were called the Women's Christian Temperance Union and our definition of this was teetotaler. At the present time, the Sunday School books - and we ourselves say that temperance means not too much of it - and so the ladies who are members of the Women's Christian Temperance Union are trying to be temperate with what they think. When I came to Tuskegee in 1927 from Snow Hill, we organized a Needle and Art Club. The Needle and Art Club is still going on and I am still there but the ladies don't do much needle and art. When we organized it, we madeï»¿114 HSK: (cont) many things and we had exhibits. Now we socialize a good bit and talk. The ladies are doing needlepoint; they are altering things and using directions that are very expensive. They're altering designs that have numbers on them and tell you what color. That wasn't the reason the Needle and Art Club was organized. We were organized because there were women who were good in drawing and art and doing all sorts of things and sewing and doing needlework. We still have women who can do that, but we don't do much of it in the Needle and Art Club. We have an organization of retired teachers. I am a member. It is true, I retired from the Macon County System in 1944, but the teachers always think of me as a retired teacher. I didn't retire then because of my age, but I retired because I was going into student personnel administration. I am a member of the Red Cross and chairman of what we call Volunteer Services. I've just come back from a Red Cross workshop. The work of the Red Cross represents our obligation to veterans and servicemen and their families and to people in case of disaster. But there are many other things that the Red Cross may promote that we classify as permissive. We have mandatory and permissive services. Right now, one of the permissive services, and I am very much interested in it, is that of having clothes of all sorts, instead of being thrown away, brought to the Red Cross Center. Most of the clothes that are brought there are clothes that nobody could wear. The poorest people wouldn't wear. We have a group that meets at two o'clock at the Red Cross Center and we are interested in ripping up those clothes. We've ripped them up. We've washed them. We've sent them to the cleaners and we've made lap-robes. Last year, three dozen lap robes were made for the VA Hospital and about four dozen were made for the nursing homes. In the wintertime, the older people are cold; their knees are cold even if they have on long gowns; and they enjoy having something thrown over their laps. We also have cut the material into blocks and we have made beautiful quilts. Where these quilts are sent and how they are used, I'll tell a little later on. But the service of the Red Cross is a 'blessed community' to me. I am a member of a group called Greater Tuskegee. Back before we had a black mayor, the community was interested in just doing more. So blacks and whites were meeting together and we called ourselves, the Committee for Greater Tuskegee. We didn't get to first base because blacks were expressing themselves so vividly that the whites who were inclined toward being liberal just dropped out one by one. Andnow the Committee for Greater Tuskegee is all black and I seldom attend it, but I am a member and whatever we can do, we try to do. We have a National Association for Retired Federal Workers. I have never worked for the federal government, but my second husband, Charles Kelly, was part-time chaplain at the Veterans' Hospital. When this organization was formed, the members insisted that I become a member. I like the magazine. I was Chairman of the Program Committee. As Chairman of the Program Committee, we circulated a list to find out what the people would like to do. I found out that they just went there and talked and fussed about their insurance andï»¿115 HSK: (cont) the things that they wanted to lobby about in Congress. Some years ago, a Golden Age Club was organized and this Golden Age Club continues to exist. We meet regularly and we are more interested in having old people talk about the things that interest them and the birthday party. Every meeting we have a birthday party for people born in that month. There are other things that many of us would like to do, but many of the people who come are interested in that big cake and singing "Happy Birthday to You" and going home. The Model Cities started here, I guess ten years ago,and I am connected with the task forces. The city was divided into ten neighborhoods and our neighborhood was called the Greenwood Neighborhood. This Greenwood Neighborhood group met regularly and committees worked out what the needs of our neighborhood were at that time. These things were sent in and compiled. I think mos t of you know that a few cities throughout the nation were designated as Model Cities. The attempt was to give money so that a city could more nearly do what it was supposed to do. The transfers were to be made as early as possible and the cities would take full charge. It was very hard to have people understand that. But we worked at it and many of us who meet regularly in our neighborhood â I live on a street that I don't live on, it's called 100 Chambliss Street, but I don't live on Chambliss Street. The house I lived in in Booker Washington's time was moved back into the woods and a big building which now stands was erected there. My husband and I were always disturbed because people couldn't find us. It was called 100 Chambliss Street. So when the task forces worked, one request I made â and I am sure that it was five or six or ten years ago â was that either this be Chambliss Circle or Chambliss Avenue or Kelly Circle or Kelly Drive. About three months ago, my neighbor called me and said, "You're on Kelly Drive." I said, "Is that so?" I looked up and the name "Kelly Drive" was written up there and I am the only one who lives on this street. I have a house on Bibb Street and the water did not extend there. There were big tanks in the back and I can't remember what we called them. But in Model Cities, they arranged so that the line would go all of the way down, down Bibb Street. It is true, it cost us, but Model Cities was interested in getting that and many other things. In sections where there were no roads and no streets, sidewalks were being built. Model Cities has a group called Senior Citizens. These senior citizens are taken on trips. We have been to Montgomery, to the theatres. We go to ^ Birmingham; we have been to many places. When we first started, I didn t know that there were that many senior citizens in all of Alabama. Sometimes there were five big buses. There were hundreds of us who went in those buses. But I had traveled so much that I said to the young woman in charge, "Please excuse me, because you have a sufficient number of people to go." But the last thing held was in connection with the Bicentennial. They had asked senior citizens who would ... now you can't just go into the senior citizens' work ... if you are a senior citizen, you must call in and tell them your age and they send an outreach worker, a person investigates you andï»¿116 HSK: (cont) you have to be 65 - so these people were over 65. I decided that I would represent Phillis Wheatley. Two hundred years ago, Phillis Wheatley was a leading black poet. She came from Africa as a baby and so there is only one picture that appears as Phillis Wheatley. If you ever see a picture, you see her with a white bonnet on, sitting at a desk with a quill in her hand. So a friend of mine, Billie Mitchell, I went out to her. She has a workshop, a place, a club. She made a white bonnet for me as near like that as possible and a big white collar and the dress I was to wear was a dark dress. I dressed as PhdllisWheatley. The women who won the prize were women who wore dresses. One woman wore a dress that was over 100 years old and it was interesting to know the turn. I was the only person who represented a real woman, a black woman. Most of the women were dressed like, I thought, white people dressed 200 years ago. But it was beautiful and their costumes were old; they were very old. But that, I enjoyed very much. There are one or two other things that Model Cities has had for senior citizens that I have not attended. All over the community, throughout the country, we have what is called a Homemakers' Club. I am a member of the Homemakers' Club. The Homemakers' Club is the outcome of an effort by Community Action. Macon County Community Action had outreach programs. There are many of them. But in discussing what our needs were, when they first organized it - I was on the board. We said that there are people throughout whole Macon County who make things. They gave us as the objective of the Macon County Community Action Program -to do away with poverty in Macon County. We all were to think what could be done to do away with poverty. A group of us felt that if we could market the things that were made by people in Macon County that that would help to do away with poverty. We organized what was called the Homemakers' Clubs and in every community in Macon County, we have a Homemakers1 Club. Once a month, representatives, the President or someone whom she appoints comes to this meeting. The Homemakers decided that just meeting was not enough. The Community Action people started out with trying to show people how to use commodities. I traveled throughout the county with a young woman who was trying to show homemakers that commodities could be used. Those people would not eat meat that came in a can - canned meats that I thought were delicious. Canned meat was like Spam and canned chicken and canned turkey. They had butter. And so this woman would come to the Homemakers meeting and demonstrate. It was not so long before they found out that the meal and flour was being thrown away; that many people would not call at the place to get the things and weasels and bugs had gotten into them. So the government phased the commodities program out and added the stamp program. But the Homemakers said, we need a place in town where these things can be sold. And we worked with names. There was a young white man who was with one of the programs, one of the outreach programs. He was working with us and we worked out "Made in Macon." In town you'll see "Made in Macon." People over the county were invited to make things and put into this shop and they did. They made quilts, they made bonnets, potholders. All sorts of things that we thought could be sold were put into this shop. When it started, we were very happy because if a person put something into the shopï»¿117 HSK: (cont) and the thing was sold, he'd leave ten percent of the money for the shop to keep it going and the owner of the goods would get the balance. People began to criticize and say that things were poorly made; that quilts were not well made and the bonnets were not well made. So we started a workshop ... federally funded, to get women from the county. One woman from each Homemakers section would teach her how to make things well in the hope that she would go back and help the women who were making things. The other thing that we did: we became a corporation. It was the first time I had been closely connected with a corporation. I went to the courthouse and got a copy of letters of incorporation and I found out that there were about 12 women who had signed that and that's the way it had to be. Twelve women signed it. We could sell anything we wanted to without being taxed. But, there were certain prerequisites. The only persons who could put things in the shop were persons who were members of the Homemakers' Club whether they were men or women. That was not the original plan and the women don't understand it. We had a price and selection committee which meant that some things had to be returned. They could not be accepted. The women have never understood that and so they are still fighting it. Our "Made in Macon" shop has never amounted to what it could because after we had these letters of incorporation, there were certain guidelines that we had to follow. But it is there and I had hoped that we would make smaller things. I had visited Berea in Kentucky. In Kentucky, Berea had the same type of shop. It is not necessarily connected with the school but it's there. I went to Berea to a workshop. When we visited it, they made small things like bookmarks. They made wooden paper letter openers, any number of small things and everything was marked "Berea". It was always in the back of my mind that if we made small things, we might be able to do better. I'm just a member of the Greenwood Homemakers' Club. I cannot qualify for putting things into the shop because we have another requirement. The person must be a low-income person and if you're not classified as low-income, even though you're a member of the Homemakers' Club, you cannot put things into the shop for sale. We meet regularly. I am not only a member of the Greenwood Neighborhood Club which is not as active as it should be, I am a member of the Harris-Barrett Neighborhood Club. At Harris-Barrett we meet in a schoolhouse that had been discontinued after they integrated the school. The property belongs to a Miss Beulah Cooper. She allowed us to meet there free of charge. Booker Washington in collaboration with Hampton Institute felt that if people were given 40 acres of land to buy and to till,that they would become people who could take care of themselves and so, this land was called "The Forties" and divided into 40 acres. People built homes and lived on them and tried to farm them. This school, Harris-Barrett, was on that property when I came to Tuskegee in 1911. There was a Mr. Chambliss who had charge of "The Forties" for Tuskegee Institute.ï»¿118 HSK: (cont) It was found later that the land was poor. People couldn't make a living on that land. In 1923, the hospital started and people began to work at the hospital and to move away. Mr. Chambliss bought the land because the people couldn't finish paying for it. He became a very wealthy man and when he died, he gave Tuskegee Institute a building called the Chambliss building. He gave the school in which I taught, Chambliss Childrens' House. He had seen those children in the building called the Childrens' School. But when they went to assembly, they had to stand. They didn't have enough seats for them. He said he wanted to see those children in a school large enough so that they could be seated when they went into assembly, so that there would be sufficient classrooms for cooking and sewing and so forth. So he gave money for that. He died and these things were left in his will. But this land was given and one of my Homemakers' Clubs meets there. The Homemakers' Club which meets in the Harris-Barrett Schoolhouse is a very active one. They make many things for the "Made in Macon" Shop and so do many of the other groups. I also belong to a group called the Helping Handers Club. This group was organized just recently. We had a disaster about two or three miles from here and a friend of ours named Anita Adams went out with the Red Cross people to give food and to get information about the people who had suffered, and to be sure that they had shelter somewhere. After they had provided for the people whose homes were destroyed, Anita went out and found that there were a number of old people, living alone, many in one room; some of them were not providing things for themselves. They had no way to take care of their food. They were not able to cook their food and so she called a number of us together and asked if we would assist her in taking food to these people. She tried to find out whether they had relatives, friends, or whether they would qualify for welfare, but we were almost sure that they would not qualify. Most of them had children in the North. Most of them received checks, but they just didn't seem to know how to use them. So we met together. There must be a dozen of us, and we started paying a dollar and a half at each meeting. Anita cooks the food and takes it out. I went out with her and I told her that she was doing an impossible job, that we would have to report it to Community Action, that even if she continued it - she took out one meal a week, that one meal a week wasn't sufficient. We went to the mayor of the town. We went to the Director of Community Action. She did most of the going. I followed after she went, and talked with them about families in need of some help. My statement was and is that churches should take care of those old people, prepare their food, clean their houses and so forth. Anita is a very strong and outspoken person and had more influence about that. She believed that it was a county's responsibility. The assistant to the Community Action Director wrote a proposal. That proposal gave us an amount of money which I cannot recall. The meals are being prepared at John Andrew Hospital. They are being taken out by the outreach peopleï»¿119 HSK: (cont) from Community Action. Miss Adams has been going out with them and she is very happy. At the other meeting, she said, "Those people don't want to eat that food from the Hospital; it isn't the kind of food that they want," and she thinks that something should be done about it. We told her and we try to make her understand that's with the people in the hospital. We tried when Model Cities started, to have Meals on Wheels, but we could not find a sufficient number of old people in the city. Model Cities is a city project. Community Action is a county-wide organization. We couldn't find sufficient people in the city who said that they wanted their meals brought to them. So, instead of having that, we have transportation. We had those free cars for anything in our town, but now, if you sign up with Community Action, and you're over 65, they will come to your door and take you to town to do your shopping and take you back home. They'll take you to your doctor. That was funded. But now, this feeding program is funded and we are hoping that other people are being added. We have this problem. Many of the people whom we were feeding - three or four of them I know - were dropped from the program because those women were young enough to do better than that and they needed guidance. Just having something for free. One woman was living with a man, living in one part of the house and neither one of them would cook for themselves and so forth and so on. We found older peole who had relatives in the North, who, when we got in touch with them said they were trying to make the mother come and live with them but she wouldn't. And we have had young people come from various parts of the state to see about their parents. So, we still have a problem even though it is funded. We are still paying that little dollar and a half and Anita still feels that she has to fix that big pot of soup; that big whatever she fixes and take it to those poor people which we think is a wonderful thing. I am a member of a sorority, the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. I was not interested in sororities because in my undergraduate work, we didn't have sororities in our school. But when I became Dean of Women, the AKA's and the Zetas, and the Deltas felt that I should belong to one of these sororities. There were many people in the Dean of Women's programs and the counseling programs who felt that no person in counseling should join a sorority or social organization because of all of the young people - you'd be partial to some. I felt that if I were a Baptist, I wouldn't be partial to Methodists. If I were a Catholic, I wouldn't treat the Episcopalians mean - and that was one thing that made me go on into the sorority. I went into the Deltas because they pushed me. I didn't make a choice. It didn't make a difference which one I went into. I found that the pledges that you make and the vows that you make when you join sororities - and there are people who call them social organizations - are more serious than the vows I made when I joined the church. I also found that they were not being carried out. In the undergraduate chapters particularly, they still have hell week. At black schools, it was just started and they were very mean to the people who were on probation.ï»¿120 HSK: (cont) In the meantime, I'm interested in the mental health program. I'm on the Mental Health Committee and have been since the '40s. We are interested in our own mental health, the well-balance of people who are supposed to be well, and we are working with the VA hospital and with people in our hospital who need help. We have an A.A.U.W., American Association of University Women. I'm on the International Committee. Last year the International Committee had a program and we centered it around African customs that are particularly thought of as American. I had charge of food. Another person, Miss Lexine Weeks, had the music, African music. Another person had African dress. It was one of the most beautiful programs that we have had. For years I have been interested in the foreign students that come here and we've tried through the years to understand foreign students and to make them feel more at home. I'm also a member of Church Women United. A.A.U.W. and Church Women United are the most integrated programs that we have. Church Women United had a workshop just the other day in Montgomery and I attended. It was interesting how their outreach was far beyond what we consider the work of the church. We met here in the Episcopal Church just the other day and our discussion centered around a meeting of the Regional Church Women's Association which will be held here in October. We are holding it at the Holiday Inn. Plans for it are being made. The highlight for me is the fact that I am in charge and Chairman of what we call The Church Woman. The Church Woman is the official organ of Church Women United7~ Sunday, I had this to say to them, and I've said it every year since I've been in charge of it - as church women we have present here women from all of the churches in Tuskegee; we try to get them throughout Macon County because it is a county-wide organization and we're succeeding. We have women there from almost every church, but we are not satisfied with that. The Church Woman connects us with women, not only in other parts of the United States, but in other parts of the world. Those of us who cannot travel, who are interested in reading ... I called their attention to articles in The Church Woman. One article was by Dr. Deborah Partridge, a woman whom all of them knew. Another article was by a Chinese woman and the other article was by the National President of Church women United. Church Women United ... the last sessions had as its President a Negro woman for the first time. She happened to have been the wife of our minister's brother, Mrs. Harvey, who served for a term as President of Church Women United, a black woman, and we thought that was something worthy of mentioning. I am a member of the Welcomers' Club. It is a local club at Tuskegee Institute and every year we get ready to welcome the wives of the new professors and the new professors. We are quite integrated and we are getting ready for a meeting in October at Colonel Vernon's home in town. The hope of our town, when it comes to race is the fact that many of the families, the non-black families who are working at Tuskegee Institute, are buying homes in the town. As a member of the Welcomers' Club I have metï»¿121 HSK: (cont) in many of those homes on Main Street and I told them that I had been in and out of Tuskegee since 1911. It was not until last year when I became a member of the Welcomers1 Club that I visited in homes of people who were not black people. My friend whom I mentioned also, Sally Robinson, lived on Main Street and worked with Shorter School and I visited with her a lot. In the Welcomers' Club, my main duty is to keep them informed about Tuskegee Institute and its history. They always seem to be amazed that I attended Tuskegee when Booker Washington was principal, that I was in the class to receive Booker T. Washington's signature in 1915, and that I worked with all of the Presidents, Dr. Moton, Dr. Patterson and Dr. Foster. When they talk about the present situation, however, I tell them I am guilty of what all old people are guilty of. I live in the past, and if they want to know about the present, ask somebody else. We have a good bit of fun. There is a Mr. Guzman here, who has collected pictures of old Tuskegee right on up to date. I think he has pictures of every important person from any place who has ever been here. Every year, I have Mr. Guzman come in and show those pictures and talk. Mr. Guzman is a Puerto Rican and he has never changed his way of talking and it is difficult for us to understand, so really, I'm an interpreter for those pictures. Every time he says something, they say, "What did he say?" And I have to say it over again. The Welcomers' Club is most rewarding. On the committee that I will be meeting with, Miss Koons, Miss Vernon, Miss Hickerson are white. The colored woman with whom I will be meeting is Mrs. Exbuoma who is married to an African and lives right up from me. I have to say, "Hello darling," when I see her, I can't think of her first name. She's not an African but she is married to an African. This is the community committee that is planning an October meeting for the Welcomers' Club. I belong to the Tuskegee Local, Regional and National Alumni Associations. I have taken it as my duty unofficially to tell the objectives of Tuskegee Institute and to try to help people understand. The old ones think that *e should be doing what Booker T. Washington did. They don't seem to realize... Even those who were here when I was here, and who were with me ... declare that Tuskegee Institute was not a high school. They think it was a college hecause we did do college work in the high school, but it was a high school. Dr. Washington was principal; he was not a president. Dr. Moton was principal until about 1924. Somewhere in there we added two years of college. So when I travel into other towns where we have alumni meetings, they want to know, "Do you still have a shoemaker? Do you still have a harnessmaker? Do you still make hricks? All of those things are so fine." I said, "What did you say you specialized in?" "You know I was a shoemaker because I worked in your husband's shop." "Do you have a shoe shop?" "No? What are you now?" "I am a lawyer now." This is true, this is not a joke. I know Lawyer Sampson in Chicago. You know Edith Sampson's husband in Chicago? They'reï»¿122 HSK: (cont) divorced. He's sick now, but the last time I was in Chicago, we went out a lot. He took me out to dinner and he talked. He was unhappy because Tuskegee had changed. I said, "Do you know that I feel that every president and the people who worked with these presidents are trying to meet the needs of the people and the times in which they are living. If Booker T Washington lived now, I don't think Tuskegee Institute would be as it was." I said, "You know, Booker T. Washington's book that I like best - and you need to read it - is My Larger Education." He has other books about Tuskegee Institute that show the change that has taken place. I belong to what is called The City Federation of Women's Clubs. We have five women's clubs in Tuskegee. The City Federation is composed of represen tatives from these five clubs and from the Youth Club. We are interested in scholarships for children who cannot receive scholarships. We are interested in yard beautification. Each club has objectives and interests of its own. I have here listed something else I'd like to tell you about. The doctor, who is a woman, who is interested in the guidance and counseling programs of Tuskegee Institute called a number of us together and said that she was interested in the psychic experiences of young people. We started reading more about E.S.P. and Transcendental Meditation and we found that there were people there who had had all sorts of experiences. I heard them review a book on Edgar Cayce. Someone had written about Edgar Cayce, a man who is dead now. It seems that he had cured hundreds of people and people would tell him about cases. He'd go to sleep and then when he'd wake up, he would tell you exactly what to do and he didn't even need to see the people. People told about experiences of how they felt certain things and how those things occurred. I said, "You know, that doesn't sound strange to me." They said, "Why?" I said, "When I joined the church, I heard them say that Jesus Christ said he was going away, but he would leave the Holy Spirit to guide us." I said, "Everything you say without training, I have always said I was guided by the Holy Spirit." But I have noticed that my Christian friends have smiled and laughed. I have a friend ... when I said the Holy Spirit guides me, she says that's nothing but the devil. ^T: Mrs. Kelly, in leading into the discussion of some of your experiences, you have used such words as "and it was an honor for me to have been invited to do certain things and I was wondering if there are other honors that you have received that you would like to mention. I'm embarrassed to mention these honors, because really, I don't think I'm worthy. The honors that I'm going to read, I'm embarrassed to read but I am going to give them to you quickly because you asked for them. One of the first honors I received, back in the 1940s was called Queen of America, by Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, not by the local chapter but by the national Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. I have a bracelet, a gold bracelet, and it has an attachment called Queen of America. I asked them, I said, "Why would you give this to me?" They said, "The National Association sent to all the Deltas and asked them to send in the name of a person whomï»¿123 HSK: (cont) they thought could be listed as their Queen." They sent my name in and I received that. And ever since then, the older ones think of me as Queen of America. I am sure that was in the '40s. When I first went into Delta Sigma Theta I was Dean of Women. Another honor which came to me which I think was greater than that, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority listed me as Woman of the Year. It seems that Zetas all over the country do that. They invited me to a meeting. They had me speak. They gave me a gift. Every year when they have one of those meetings they invite me back. Zetas don't just give it to their women but to any woman whom they would like to honor. Another award was called "A Meritorious Award for Leadership in Community Activities in Support of Tuskegee Institute's Alumni Program." This was given to me by the Tuskegee Institute, South Eastern Region of the National Alumni Association, and they gave it because of my connections with the Association. Since there were others given by the alumni I won't comment on that until I read you that. Another was an award for "Significant Service to the Community as a Senior Volunteer." This award was given me by the Retired Senior Volunteer Program of the United States. Most of us call it the RSVP program. In addition to having volunteered at John Andrew Hospital and the nursing homes, I have volunteered at the V.A. Hospital at Tuskegee. The Retired Senior Volunteer Program is one that has been very helpful to us. A person who enters that program must agree to give volunteer service somewhere. It may be the place of your choice or the place where you are most needed. The most important thing to me is that we have a meeting once each month. And at this meeting, we talk about the problems of older people and the problems we find at the places where we volunteer. Another citation was called a "Citation of Merit for Outstanding Participation in the Volunteer Program for Older Americans," from the Tuskegee Senior Citizens' Program. This program is connected with Model Cities. It runs differently from the RSVP program in that you are not required to give a service, but you are asked to tell what the needs of older people are and attempt to meet them through the Senior Citizens' Program. Another was a "Certificate of Outstanding Service to Veterans Through Active Participation in Veterans' Adminstration Voluntary Service Program, V.A. Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama." At the Veterans' Hospital, they have signed a special service program and they have a number of people who meet with the Director of what I think is called Special Services. We meet once a month. And at this program we talk about the community's responsibility, our organization's responsibility to the VA. I served as representative of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and now I am serving as a representative from Macon County Tuskegee Red Cross Chapter. Another award was given "In Recognition of 25 Years of Service To a Public Service Sorority." The Grand Chapter sent this from the Delta Sigma Thetaï»¿124 HSK: (cont) Sorority when I had been a member 25 years. Another award for "Service On the Board of Directors of Tuskegee, Macon County Chapter of American Red Cross." Another was a "Certificate of Merit in Recognition of Outstanding Service, Leadership and Achievement in the Fields of Public Service, Social Welfare and Human Relations." It was given by the Booker T. Washington Consistory, Number 115. Another award was an award, a $500 scholarship in my name for "Civic and Educational Leadership." It was given by the Tuskegee Branch of the American Association of University Women. This scholarship is given by our national organization and, along with other scholarships named for people who were of service to the organization, is used to pay scholarships for students. Another was a "Golden Anniversary Certificate of Honor in Appreciation of the Loyalty You Have Exhibited Since You Graduated, And in Recognition of the Faithful Effective Service for a Period of 50 Years." After a person has finished Tuskegee for 50 years, they receive an award of this sort and when 50 years passed for me, I received this from the Tuskegee Institute Alumni Association. I received a plaque and a listing in "Community Leaders and Noteworthy Americans." It was a bicentennial effort. Someone sent my name in and wrote what they thought were my accomplishments, and a plaque was sent to me. And then a big book was sent to me with what I have read on it. My name, and those things listed were among the names of those who were considered community leaders for 1975-76. It was put out by an editorial board of the American Biographical Institute. Another honor was a "Citizenship Award for Acts of Public Service to Humanity." That award was given by Tuskegee Institute at its Founders' Day Program. The other certificate was a "Certificate of Honor as a 60 Year Graduate from Tuskegee Institute." I finished in 1915 and 60 years from that, 1975, I received the 60 year award. Many of the classmates who returned could not hear, one could not see, one could not walk, we had difficulty with some going up and down steps; they had difficulty communicating, but they were here. I was very thankful that I was able to help them and drive them around, even drive them around in my own car. I have here something that I have not mentioned, and I'll mention it this time. I wrote a book called - a science reader - it was called Adventures of Jerry. I think I mentioned way back there that our children knew very little about the soil and about the trees and things around them. And so I started listing all things, especially birds ... these were the birds and plants and doodle bugs and things that we could see around us and children could see. I myself didn't know so much about them so there was a science teacher here called Mr. Romn. I listed all those things and I asked Mr. Romn to give me the true facts about them. So in this little science reader, I wrote theï»¿125 HSK: ( cont) things that were true. I realized, because I was principal of the school, that these things had to be written in the vocabulary of some age children. I decided that I would write this little reader for third and fourth grade children. There was a Miss Georgia Poole here at that time who was a reading specialist. She had just come here from Atlanta although she was born here and her people lived here, but she had worked in Atlanta. So I told her what I wanted to do, gave her the word list. She deleted all the words that were not on a third and fourth grade level, added words but did not change the sense of the reader. That reader was circulated throughout Macon County because at that time I was President of the Macon County Teachers' Association. The teachers didn't know how to use it. So I started writing a pamphlet that would show how this reader should be used. At that time, my first husband died; I was sent away to school ... (Laughter). When I returned, I did not go back into education. I went into student personnel administration. I had planned to write a guide for *-be use of that book and I had listed plants that were common around us; I guess I had hundreds of plants listed. I had been Professor Carver's student and I knew how important those plants were. I planned to write a little reader about those plants. But it wasn't my intent that those little readers should be just read as reading books. They were to go out and find those things and have fun about them. A few months ago, to be exact, in March of 1976, I was called by the Public Relations Department of Tuskegee Institute and asked if I would talk to somebody about Booker T. Washington. I said, "You know, I was just here from 1911 to 1915. I knew Booker T. Washington then but you have girls here who were born here. I could name you a number of girls who were born here. Why don't you have them do it?" "We want you to do it. We don't know of any other person who knew Booker T. Washington and has worked since with all the other presidents." So I agreed to do it. Sometime in March, they came and told me to come up to Booker T. Washington's study. I was to go to Dorothy Hall because the interview was to be done at the monument. It was raining very hard on that day. So I went to Dorothy Hall. I was at Dorothy Hall ... this building across from the monument, on time. And for a long time nobody came, and after a while, someone called and said, "Is Mrs. Kelly there?" And the people with lights and all sorts of things ... a Mr. Cunningham, a very pleasant man came and said, "Are you Mrs. Kelly?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Well, because of the rain, we'll go up to the study." Walking up to the study, we talked and laughed and when we got into the study he asked me about Booker T. Washington and I didn't realize the importance of it, but the persons who asked me to do it said, "You don't have to do anything but just tell them your impressions of Booker T. Washington." The answers to the questions I gave were my own honest impressions of Booker T. Washington and of the school between 1911 and 1915. There are those people who say they saw me on the TODAY program on March 5th, 1976, when Alabama was being featured. It seems that all the states of the Union were featured. When they came to Alabama they felt that Tuskegee should be ... and at thisï»¿126 HSK: (cont) same time, Dr. Foster - Dr. Foster was President - and the black Mayor of the town of Tuskegee were questioned, pictures were shown and I was shown as an 80 year old woman who knew Booker T. Washington. Shortly after that there came a Mr. Rubin Hensley and another lady to Tuskegee and asked me if I would appear on an ABC program. I asked them what it was that I could do and they said, "We just want you to answer questions about Booker T. Washington." They came, the first group I think was entirely white, all of them were white, but these interviewers were a colored woman and a colored man and the woman was the one who asked me questions about Booker T. Washington. This interview appeared on ABC one Sunday afternoon and they called it "Two Hundred Years of Black History." There were other blacks who were interviewed and gave important statements, but the questions they asked me caly pertained to Booker T. Washington. ALT: Mrs. Kelly, you have listed a mumber of honors that you received. Did any one of these mean more to you than another and if so, why? HSK: The one that meant the most to me, I don't think I even mentioned here. Just a few months ago I received a letter from the Concharter Council of Girl Scouts. Concharter Council has headquarters in Columbus, Georgia. I was a member of the Concharter Council for a long time. I was also active in Girl Scouts here. But this letter said as part of our bicentennial celebration, we are honoring women whom we call "hidden heroines." A car came for me one night and we journeyed to Columbus. Out from Columbus is Fort Benning. At Fort Benning we went into this large hall, this large building. I never saw so many children. The audience ... if you looked out, you would have thought all of them were white but the ones who came from Tuskegee were mostly black. But they were mostly Girl Scouts from the local chapter. With every group there was a Girl Scout Leader. The Girl Scout Leader was dressed in Girl Scout Uniform. On the stage there were women whom I knew particularly well because I had worked with them with the Council. At this particular time I had resigned from the Council because I felt I could not drive to Columbus to the meetings and I didn't want to ask other people to drive me. So I resigned and I hadn't seen those ladies in a long time. But we had been to Girl Scout meetings in Atlanta. I had slept with and roomed with those women and when they saw me such hugging and kissing and how they missed me. I had also been to Camp Concharter and at that camp for a long time there were only whites and it was just recently that our girls had been attending. But the women who had been to that camp greeted me. The program ran on in this wise: the girls marched in with flags of every state. They sang many of the songs. They marched in-and then one lady took charge and we sang songs from the community. Then all of us were called ... the "hidden heroines" were called one by one from the various chapters. And when they called me, I was thrilled. There were two of us there from Tuskegee, a Mrs. Grain who is more active in the local chapter than I am. She and I were honored at this time. I think more of thatï»¿127 HSK: (cont) honor than any of the rest of them because I liked the word "hidden." I have a beautiful silver tray, that I would like to exhibit at any time, that was given to me. Written on there, "To Hattie S. Kelly, a Hidden' Heroine." Now it seems to me that from that time on, I say, it may be hidden but whatever the word heroine means, I want to be a heroine. So that meant most to me. ALT: I remember, maybe it was a day or two ago when we started talking about the years of your early childhood, you mentioned, I think, when I asked the question about your relationship with your father, you used the word "respect" and then you said, "That was my attitude at that time, but later on I will tell you about the change." I was wondering, was there a change in your attitude? Do you remember about when it occurred, and why? Would you want to talk about that? HSK: Yes. I came up in a home --- I guess all of us thought that it could not be improved upon. And I think the times had something to do with it. But the way my father moved and acted, created in me a fear - a fear for wrong, a fear for making a mistake, a fear for what people would think. I don't think I can get rid of that but it's gone from fear to concern. I don't fear anything or anybody, but I have too great a concern for how people feel and what they think. My father embedded that into us. What he said was law and gospel. Didn't make any difference what we thought - what he said, that was it. At that time, that was the fear everywhere. What your parents said was it. I don't care how you felt within about it, you don't express it. You don't talk back to grown people. Asking a question was talking back to grown people. Unlike some of the families, children in my family did not have to wait. I don't remember a time when we had company when we didn't sit at the table with the company. We were not allowed to talk; you sit there but you don't say a word. You don't have anything to do with the conversation. I remember in Council meeting - when I was on the Council at Tuskegee Institute - so often they would say, "Mrs. Kelly, what do you think about this?" I would want to say, "I don't think nothing." All my life, early life, people gave me stuff to memorize and they gave me people to follow. So don't ask me what I think. I feel that perhaps I don't think my father could have been different at that time, because I think that was what we said and there are a lot of people who say they're going back to it now. When they stopped beating in the schools - saying people couldn't whip children in the schools - I was very happy because I always said why are you going to beat a back for what you want the mind and soul to do? Why do you beat the back? My father would whip, but I made up my mind I was going to watch him and do everything he told us to do. We had to have good manners: "Good morning, Father." We had to call them by the names "Mother" and "Father." He never addressed us without calling our names and now, people say, "Yes," "No." I can't say that. I have to say, "Yes, Miss Thompson. Yes, Miss Mary. Yes, Miss Sally," or so and so. Those things may be good.ï»¿128 HSK: (cont) They're good because those are things that you ought to do; but they are not good because somebody made you do them. You grow up following in a pattern and never being able to be as creative as you should be and it is not until now that I venture. And when friends describe me, I don't think I venture very much. I think I am venturing in my heart, but I don't think I've changed very much from that. I think I still feel, "What would you like to do? What would you want?" "This is what I want, but it doesn't make any difference, you'll do what you want." That's the way we were trained and that's what we thought was good. After my father died, my mother said very little to us with her voice. She ruled us with her eyes. If we did something our mother didn't like, she wouldn't talk to us, wouldn't say a word. We were not allowed to come home with little boys. If she saw any little boy had come down the street ... she'd go upstairs and look - she knew where to look. If we came in the house, she would just look at us and we'd say, "Oh, Mama saw us." We knew that she saw us. When I was grown, and teaching at home, a young man would come home with me. My mother would come to the front door and say, "You don't stand out there." After she found that I wanted to do what she wanted, she'd only come and walk around the front room. So to tease her, I would say, "Mama, I heard a 'haint' walking around the house last night." She'd say, "No, Baby. That was me." She said, "Don't stand out front," and to this day, I can't stand out in front of the house and talk to a man. I'll say, "Won't you come in? Come in, please." I don't know how to say how my mother's religion influenced me. She was a churchgoer and she was a person-helper. She wanted to help everybody. She went everywhere helping people and that's a lovely comment. But, we went to Sunday School and church school because we were made to go. Never was there any discussion about why you are here; would you like to go, would you like to stay home and meditate? I have changed now, but people who live in the house said I didn't change immediately. It had dawned upon me; I didn't change when I was Dean of Women. That was it. You go to chapel; it is time for chapel and I believed that you ought to go because that was the law. In fact, I lived under the law and that's what I was taught. But now, with the young people who live in my home, they go and they come as they please, but that's just been in the last two years. I have just left a big church to work in a small church. I'm sure my mother wouldn't approve of it. But when I married Rev. Kelly, I left the Methodist Church and joined the Baptist Church. I don't think my mother would approve of that. I'm not so sure that before I die, I may not be in any church. I'm not so sure. I told people ... at one of the Sunday School meetings we were talking about churches and I said, "I didn't come to this church to join the church; I joined a group of people in this same building in 1924; this is '76. I came because I knew this, that many of the teachers and many of the students who attend some vocational college come to this church. Many young people who attend Tuskegee Institute come to this church and I think my presence communicates something and as a Trustee of the Southern Vocational College I am here." But I'm not so sure what the future will be.ï»¿129 HSK: (cont) When my son-in-law retired as lieutenant colonel from the Air Force - I knew that that entire family were Catholics - I didn't think they were going to live at Tuskegee. I did not know. But I had decided, if they came to live in Tuskegee, I was going to the Catholic Church with my family. Strange as it may seem, the young daughter who came first, before they moved, she came a year before they came, never went to the Catholic Church, never even cared to go with me unless I insisted that something was happening. She went with me once or twice. I said, "I didn't know Catholics were like that." I thought they were one group of people who went to church, even if they were riding through the country they'd go to church. When I found that they were moving to Tuskegee, I found that my daughter was very eager to play for some church. She had played for churches on the bases and she wanted to play for some church. Finally, I don't know how,but the Episcopal people called her to play for the Episcopal Church. So I decided, I'll stop and go to the Episcopal church, X went there once or twice and I found that after the service, they had choir rehearsal. She didn't want me to walk home so she would run out, take me home and go back to choir rehearsal. I said, "Well, that's not the place for me." ALT: Thank you. Mrs. Kelly, I noticed that as you have talked about races, you have used words, "Negro," "colored," "black" interchangeably. I also have noticed that in each phase of your life, in each activity, you have attempted to effect a change in education, in the church, and yet you lived through a time when there was no Civil Rights Movement; there were signs that said "colored," signs that said, "white." It was the law. You traveled extensively; and I have not heard you say whether or not you attempted change. I'm wondering how did you accept segreation without attempting change. So my question is, first, do you consider yourself Negro, black, colored, or is there a difference? Second, how did you accommodate to the laws of segregation? I can sum up the question by simply saying, what does it mean to be black? Or to he however you define it? SSK: I'd like to talk to the point of using the words "Negro," "black," and "colored," I lived through a period when Negro children and adults would fight you if you called them black. I'll give you illustrations. When I served as Principal of Children's House, we had children who were as white as white children. One family, the white father lived in the town, some of his relatives are living here now. His boy was as white as he could be. We had another family just as black there. I remember this black boy coming down the hall saying, "They called me black, I'm going to kill them. I'm going to kill them. They called me black." I took him in the office, told him that black and brown were beautiful, I had a picture of a little black boy and a little white boy on my wall. I said, "Both these boys are heautiful," And he went out, out from my office, smiling. The teachers were all angry with me. They said I should have whipped him. "Took him in there and petted him; he was coming up and down the hall cursing and saying bad words." But I never heard that boy object to being black again. Then this white colored boy was crying, "They called me old peck. I'm not white, I'm not old peck." I said, "Come in here, come in here,Louie."ï»¿130 HSK: (ccmt) And Louie came into the office. I said, "Don't you ever let me hear you getting angry because people call you white. You are white. There's nothing wrong with being white. Just tell them you don't know the meaning of old peck and that your name is Louis. That your name is not Peck." And Louie went from the office laughing. My first husband was a very dark handsome man. My daughter was a very dark, beautiful girl. But one day she came home from kindergarten ... I was combing her hair and she was standing before the mirror, "Mama, why am I so black? They call me little Black Sambo. " I said, "Well, look at me. I'm black. Your father is black. You don't want to favor us? I could have married a white man and you may not have come, but somebody would have been a little brighter." "Oh no, I love my daddy." I took her to my closet and I had a black evening dress. I had a brown evening dress and I had a white evening dress. And I asked her, "Which one do you like best?" I said, "Don't tell me because I want you to always feel that all colors are beautiful." I said, "Now, next time anybody calls you little Black Sambo, or black, you just say, 'my name is Annette West' and you smile." I don't recall her ever showing that being black meant anything ugly. I heard her say a very beautiful thing. "Mama, I'm a substitute teacher, and one little white child came up to me and rubbed my arm and asked me if that would rub off." And she said, "I took that child. I said, 'Come on, let's go over here' and washed it and washed it and washed it. I said, ' That doesn't come off.' I said, 'That's my color.'" She said, "That doesn't come off. That's my color." And I thought that was beautiful. Prior to that time, when she was in high school, I was working in New York. I sent for her to come to New York to visit with me. I made arrangements with the people downtown. I made arrangements for Annette to work in the play school office. But I did it because she had never worked around white people, never been around them. At Tuskegee, these children had come up sheltered either by all blacks or by whites who were trustees or visiting. All the people in that New York office were white. I asked her one day how she enjoyed working with people, all white. She said, "Mama, what do you mean?" She said, "They seem just like any other people to me." So those are some of the experiences we've had with that. Now growing up black has been an interesting thing because those of us who were minister's children and doctor's children were never sinned against, other than we came up in segregated situations. One question that was asked me - not on the Booker T. Washington program, but on a program at Tuskegee Institute - a young man asked me if I felt that I would have been better educated if I had come up in an integrated situation. I told him that there was no way in the world for me to answer that question because I came up in a segregated school and I had not been exposed to any other type of school other than on the graduate level, I cannot answer whether or not I would have been better off it I had not been segregated. Because I always lived among people of other races,whites ... As a small child the only thing I remember is that the whites across the street were just like anybody else. I knew they were white. I don't think these are good points to make. Andï»¿131 HSK: (cont) with young people, it makes them very angry because they know that we should have known and we did know that in Congress, in the House of Representatives, they were all white. They know that if we went to school that we had read about Reconstruction days when, immediately after slavery, there were blacks in Congress. They know that we knew about Frederick Douglass who fought segregation. They know that we knew about Uncle Tom's Cabin and other books and William Lloyd Garrison. We knew about people who had worked and did not approve of slavery. So we could not say that we came up not realizing. But there is something that I think you ought to know. I don't think there was any period that blacks were not feeling that these things would change. If I have not mentioned it, I'll mention it again for emphasis. Dr. Benjamin E. Mays spoke here at the Baptist Church. And he said, "Both Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois were partly wrong. Booker T. Washington felt that if you did what you were going to do as best you could you would be accepted. DuBois felt that people with the best brains, they'll be accepted and let the rest of the people just follow along. But we see now at Tuskegee Institute ... we see people who have good minds who are not accepted. You can't even run for President of the United States," and so forth and so on. Well, we knew that. But somehow we were trained that this will change and it will only change by being calm. We had run through the time when books were written that showed what was done by slaves and how they fought to free themselves and how they ran away. We knew that when the ships came over, many of the slaves jumped into the water and drowned themselves rather than coming over as slaves. But we also knew that slaves were sold by blacks. We knew that slavery has always existed. Those of us who went on with the study of history know that other people have been slaves. There are those of us who have always known that Africa might have been the center of civilization. I can't recall the time when we didn't see exhibits of things that were made by Africans that were unique. But we still felt that the change would come without the fight that did come. The fight that came was the only thing that has made things better for black people and I'm sorry it had to come that way. But I think Dr. Mays was right. He said, "Nobody will get off your neck until you knock them off." As a Christian I hate to believe that. In my heart I don't believe it, but I see it. In the 1960s when those children fought to open the doors of restaurants, when they just went in and sat and were arrested, when they went on the trains and the cars, went in seats, things were not changed until then. Shortly after the law changed my daughter Annette was getting married. It must have been about 1950, I guess. But whenever it was, they passed the laws that if blacks were going from one state to another, they would sit anywhere on the train or bus. We were going to Atlanta. I knew we were going from Alabama to another state, so when I got on the bus, I sat in the front of the bus. When we got to Opelika, the conductor came back, he stopped ... some white people came on, he said to me, "Will you please move to the back of theï»¿132 HSK: (cont) bus?" And I said, "Oh 110, I'm not going to move." And he said, "Well, you must be from the North." I said, "No, I'm from Alabama but I'm going to Georgia." He said, "Well, you have to move." I said, "I'm not going to move." I said, "Evidently, you don't know the law." He said, "There's no law governing the people in the South." I said, "I'm not going to move." About a week before that, some woman had been beat up, I think she sat in the wrong seat on the bus and Annette knew it. Annette started crying and carrying on so I said, "Come on, I'm not going to move back." So at Opelika we got off the bus. But when I was going off, I looked up at the bus driver's name. And I got my notebook and I was writing his name. He said to the people in the bus, "Please give me your attention. Give me your attention. I want witnesses that I'm not putting this lady off the bus. She is getting off because she wants to." I started to go back and sit down. Annette started crying, so I got off the bus. I was going off to get the train. So I got off the bus and went over to the train station, thinking some train was going to Atlanta. There wasn't a train going to . Atlanta but another bus was going. So I went back to get on the other bus. Annette like to have died. I said, "It won't be the same driver. He is not going to bother us" So I went back'to the other bus and sat down in the front. That was one experience. I think I ought to mention two or three other experiences. I donjt know the time that I have not gone on ... I remember way back there, I'm sure I wasn't Dean of Women, I was teaching, and I was going somewhere. Maybe I was going to Cheyney, Pennsylvania, or somewhere, but I was going from Alabama and I asked for a Pullman. I wanted a berth and I didn't want a lower berth. When I got on the train, they sent me to a drawing room. I had a whole drawing room to myself. I didn't fight it or contest it. Now I think I should have. I should have called attention to the fact that my ticket called for a berth. "I don't want a drawing room." A drawing room was much more expensive but it was all right. I went back to eat. Unlike most people, I was trained to wait, and if there are people to seat you, wait till the people seat you. So I had the experience of being taken back behind a curtain. And I sat behind the curtain and ate. I don't think I should have done that. That was way back. Way back. But you see, I sat there and I prayed that this would change. Because all in front of the curtain were whites. When I got off the train, I went through the waiting room where it was marked "colored," I saw water marked "colored." I didn't want any water. I didn't drink it. Did you sit in the waiting room marked "colored"? KSK: Yes. ^T; Did you? HSK: yes, then I did. Later on, when the law was changed ... I am a law abiding citizen. ^T: J see. I see.ï»¿133 HSK: When the law was changed, my brother Sydney was visiting Tuskegee. I remember two occasions, maybe one when I went to the Opelika station. I don't know what I was doing there, but I had a niece who was with me. I think then maybe the law wasn't changed, I don't know about that. I know: I went into the white waiting room and sat down. I don't remember so clearly why I did that. But later on after the law was changed, my brother Sydney was here, and we went to Montgomery to see him off. My sister was with me, my older sister. S.B. and I went into the waiting room. There were no marks "white" up there; the marks were all down then. We went into the waiting room that had been marked "white." My sister had lived in Montgomery. She knew the station. When we looked around, she was going all around the station saying ha, ha, ha, humming. And we said, "Come on." "Oh, no. I'm not going in there." We went in the white waiting room and sat down. Now you asked how I felt. I don't know why I have never felt inferior to anyone other than when I would talk with Professor Carver. I'd say, "Oh, my goodness. Why is it I cannot see in the plants and in the birds, and in the soil what he sees? He is so superior." When I listened to Booker T. Washington talk about simple things, about time, about respecting your parents, about taking what you see and making what you need ... I wondered why I could not see those things. When I would see the people sing, when I'd hear my sister sing and play, I would wonder why I couldn't do those things. I always felt inferior to people who could do things I could not do. But I can't think of a time when I have not accepted myself to do the simple things that I do. Even now, I laugh and tell people I think the Lord put me in this world just to look at people and smile. You know, sometimes I think that's all I'm good for. I'm sorry that I can't, even now, feel a difference. Just Monday, I had a picnic in my yard that was beautiful. The neighbors next door, the Hickersons, have four children. They are white, Caucasian. Two of the cildren are Caucasian, the other two children are brown-skinned children. I don't know what they are. I never asked them. But they are colored, good and colored. When I heard those people were leaving, I had this picnic in the yard and it was just a delightful thing. There were white friends and colored friends and others who were visiting there, and we had a grand time at the picnic. I feel that whites and blacks are doing more to solve the race problem when, if they have problems of interest, or activities of interest, they meet together. I see no need of my going to eat in a white person's house or their coming to eat in my house just to solve the problem of race. But I do feel if we are studying about the schools or the community or children or older people, and a number of people whether they're white or black or red or blue, that they ought to meet together and communicate. If I had my way though, I would do research on " the stages of love." I think people ought to be taught to love. I believe that, and I believe that when a child is born, he loves himself. I think somebody ought to love him as much as possible so the child will be taught to love the person who feeds him or the person who gives him that affection. I think a childï»¿134 HSK: (cont) then should be helped to move from that stage to love children of his own sex because it seems natural for them just to love children of their own sex. Little children their own age, when they go to school, they don't want to sit with a little girl. A girl doesn't want to sit with a little boy. But many parties should be given for children of both sexes. If you don't, I think that there are some men and women who still are in that stage. They're not homosexuals, but nobody helped them to get out of the period when they were loving people of their own sex - to help them get out of that into another stage that's normal; when little boys begin to love all the little girls, and little girls love all the little boys, and so many people say then, "They're flirting." We used to flirt, used the word, "flirting" ... I don't know what they use now. I guess, "shopping around." I don't know what it is. But that is a stage when a boy just loves all the little girls. In that love period, I think there ought to be lots of parties and workshops and things that they're interested in so they can get together. Then if the boy or girl is helped to grow up, they will begin to love one particular person. And I think when they select that person, everybody ought to do what they can to see that those persons are together as much as they can be because the things really, really, come to fruition. I usually describe it as a negative and a positive light. Now that doesn't mean that one has to be negative and one positive. But the little electricity that I know, if you put two wires together that are positive, you won't have a light. If you look - and the wires looked just alike to me - if you put two wires that are negative together, you won't have a light. I think too that people, parents and all of us, when we get to that stage, we begin to select a mate. Society selects the mate for people. "That's a fine young man. You ought to go with him." "That's a fine young lady." The boy begins to feel that "I want a girl that people say is a pretty girl, a girl that's not stout." And I think because of that, the family situation is changing. Many people are marrying because of the way the person looks, because of what somebody else said about her. Many people living in the first stage; they don't love anybody but themselves; nobody helped them to grow out of it. Many of them are in the second stage; the only people they love are people who are giving them something, whether it's love or clothes; they don't love anybody else. Many people are staying in the category of peer loyalty; don't love anybody but their peers, whoever they are. And many men are still loving all the women they see. They don't think it's important to study themselves and see. I think those who reach the highest point, really are the most mature. If I could, I'd like to study a little bit more about the growth of individuals. I would like to work with people who are interested in helping us to grow up. I feel, however, that spiritual growth is just like physical growth. If I want to grow and be strong and live long, I've got to eat right - there are certain things which I must eat, certain things that my body must have. I feel that the spiritual life must be fed. Andï»¿135 HSK: (cont) I think it's fed by loving other people, by doing for other people. I say Jesus Christ is the most perfect interpretation of God to me because I've never lived in any other culture. It may be that if I had lived somewhere else, I might feel that Mohammed was, or 'Zoroaster was. However, I have seen no need to change. I have had Indian students, East Indian students tell us about what they believe. I haven't seen any need to change from how we feel about denominations. I have been in Evanston, Illinois, and in the Temple. I've seen the Bahai's Temple. I've had them explain that every 2,000 years a prophet comes and Jesus' time is out. A new prophet has come for the next 2,000 years. I don't see anything wrong with that. The Seventh Day Adventists say Sunday is on Saturday. It doesn't make any difference to me. We don't seem to realize that man decided the names of the days, decided the hours that would make a day ... for convenience. So if Sunday is Friday and Friday's Sunday and Monday's Tuesday, it doesn't make any difference. Why do we talk about that? I feel that it's important to have some idea about your spiritual growth, and because I believe that, and because I believe the things that they say about Jesus ... that love, doing the best you can, and helping people who can't help themselves are important, I see no reason to change from saying, "I am Christian." ALT: Another question, Mrs. Kelly. Much of your experience, education has been through a period when there were many who thought that the woman's place was in the home. There was no women's liberation movement during that time to which you might have gone to help you achieve. So I am wondering what are your views of this movement and how it might relate to your life, if you have ever thought about it. HSK: Yes, I've thought about it. And I've always felt that people who live together ought to sit down and talk about the responsibilities of living together. I was 30 years old when I married and that was an old woman. I had been teaching since 1915 and I didn't marry until 1927, so I had a number of years as a grown person when I lived in houses with other people. I always felt that I had a responsibility. I always wanted a child. I felt that whatever any other woman could do, why I could do, especially bringing a child into the world. I grew up feeling that that was our main responsibility for being. I felt that every woman who could have a child, should have a child if she wanted to. If she didn't want to, that's all right, but I wanted to. And so I felt that when I married, I would have been happy to be a homemaker because to me that's a profession. I would have been happy to have been responsible for my child and my home; not because I was a woman, but because one of us ought to do it, to stay home. If my husband could have brought in sufficient money, I would have been delighted to stay home. Even though I was accused of being a professional woman, I worked because I felt I had to. I had never lived in a rented house. When I married, we moved in the school's house. I told my husband, "I'm sorry. I couldn't live there. And we started buying a lot. We wanted ... at least I wanted to purchase the house that we were living in. The treasurer of the school was a friend of myhusband's ar*d he said, "Frank, you don't need to buy that house. You get your water and your light all free of charge, your rent free every month." But his salary was $75 a month.ï»¿136 HSK: (cont)We couldn't buy a lot up near the school, so we bought the first lot we could find and we had difficulty paying $10 a month. For that reason, I had to keep working. I felt that I had to work. So, it was not a matter of choice whether women worked, whether women stayed. It was a matter that if I stayed home and kept my house and looked after my children, I could not have bought a home of my own, and it was instilled in me that all persons purchase a home; that's your duty. I knew that. And so, I worked. Now, I feel this way about it: I feel that people ought to study themselves and their situation and if the things you want cannot be gotten unless you go out and work, then you go out and work. If you're going to live in the house with someone, I don't care whether it is a man or a woman, you ought to sit down: "What are you going to do and what am I going to do?" If it means that the only way I can shoulder my responsibilities is to go out and work, then I'll go out and work. But if we say now, you keep house and you do the cooking and the washing and the ironing, to me, that's a profession. My mother never worked outside of the home, but she worked very hard. She had a garden. I feel that the women's liberation movement was necessary because there are so many areas in which women could be of service and I don't think it should be, " A woman can't do this. A man can't do that." People are about to accept it; I don't know all of the terms of the liberation movement, but I've had it explained enough to know that it would liberate the men. Some of the things that we are advocating will make it more difficult for us because a man can sue us for alimony and there are other things that he can do. In some states, I don't own my property.I can't sell it without my husband's consent. There are some places, you can't open an account without your husband's consent and a number of simple things that we don't need to go into, that would make me feel that the liberation movement should be. Now the reason I think it isn't necessary to make such a fuss over it is because I think we ought to take the Constitution of the United States and go by it. There are things in there that free everybody, that don't say man, they don't say woman. A person asked me a long time ago about blacks and whites. I said, "You know, I realize that the Constitution didn't have Negroes in mind when they wrote it, but they didn't say white." It says, "If you are born in the United States, you are a citizen." It says, "If you are a citizen, you can't be denied the right to vote." You can't. And then we have an Amendment that has already given the woman her rights. I think that it's going to be an individual thing, that individuals, industry and professions must study to see what is needed and they must accept them whether they are man, woman or child in different areas, and I think we are just about to reach that. I think when we sit down to look at Congress and hear some of the things that they say, some of the things thatï»¿137 HSK: (cont) they do, we know that those men should not be there. I think people have got to be honest with themselves, I think it has got to be worked both ways. I think we have got to study ourselves and say, now listen, I cannot do that, but there is something I can do. I believe the whole world is like your body: it takes some of us to be the toes, some of us are strands of hair, some of us are fingers. But the world is upside down because those of us who are feet are saying,"I ain't going to walk no more, I am going to think." You weren't made to think. A lot of people, who could get into their offices and think things out and direct our feet and our hands how to go, are getting angry and are saying, those ain't doing nothing but walking. I'm not going to think any more. I am going to let the feet think. I want to tell you about Community Action. When we started, I asked what it was that we were trying to do. They said, "We're trying to eliminate poverty." Last year, I went back when the evaluations were being made. I said, "Have we eliminated poverty?" I asked It of the homemakers. But when I went back to the people in charge, they said, "You know, Mrs. Kelly, we have changed and now we are trying to find out the cause of poverty." Isn't that interesting? I said, "That's very interesting." So now we are working hard to find the cause because you can't eliminate it if you don't know the cause. A lot of people are what we call poor. I saw a definition. It said, "The poor are not those who don' thave, but they're those who want more." I memorized that quotation because I thought it was beautiful. Now, we are not working with the poor. We are working with the people who don't have, when we ought to be working on the people who want more. It's interesting. ALT: Mrs. Kelly, I have one last question for you. I have listened to you say in connection with most of your experiences, certainly throughout your working career, your adult years, that you were searching for a 'blessed community'. Sometimes you found it and sometimes you didn't. Very recently, I heard you say, "Life begins at 80" and I am wondering if that means you have now found another 'blessed community' and I would like very much for you to share with me what is behind the statement, "Life begins at 80." HSK: Well, the last few months, I have seen signs - things that might mean that life might end at 80. But it doesn't disturb me any; it makes me look to see, is there anything else I can do. A strange thing, I have found that my home is a 'blessed community' and that I don't have to leave it. I haven't gone very far. I went to Hawaii and I saw the beautiful flowers and I came back. I wished I had them in my backyard. Friends have given me flowers and flower seeds now. I went to Nassau and I saw people in the streets making things, like baskets and things, and I am encouraging people to do that right in my own home. But, the open door, with my grandchildren and their friends coming and going has made me very happy because I find... Like the man who went out in search of the Holy Grail; he felt that it was lost and he searched and he searched and he came back and found the Holy Grail right at his door. And so I think I have found it at my door.ï»¿138 HSK: (cont) I want to recite a poem that I learned in the third grade, it's good for me and it runs like this: Once when the good Saint Peter lived in this earth below, He walked about it preaching just as he did, you know. He came to the door of a cottage in traveling through this world Where a little woman was baking cakes in the ashes on the hearth. And being faint from hunger, for the day was almost done, He asked her, from her store of cakes, to give him a single one. So she looked at him and said,"My cakes that seem so small Are yet too large to give away" so she put them upon the shelf. Now, the good Saint Peter grew angry because he was hungry and faint. Surely such a woman was enough to try a saint! So, he said, "You shall build as the birds do, and get your scant food by working and working all day in the hard dry cold." So, up through the chimney she flew, not speaking a single word, And she lives to this very day, working and working for food. Now this lesson teaches, live not for yourself alone, Lest needs you will not pity, may someday be your own. That's my motto and if there is need, I give ... but the'Blessed Community' is within me. ALT: Thank you very much, Mrs. Kelly. This is September the eighth, 1976. When we began this interview, I made a mistake. I referred to this as Chambliss Street In walking about I noticed and you called my attention to it earlier, that the name of the street was changed to Kelly Drive. So we are ending the interview on Kelly Drive, 1976...
