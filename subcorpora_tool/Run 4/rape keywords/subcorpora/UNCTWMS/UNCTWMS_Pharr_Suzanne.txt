 Jennifer Donnally: Good afternoon. This is Jennifer Donnally, and today is May 27th, 2010, and I am in downtown Knoxville in the St. Oliver Hotel. I&#8217;m interviewing with&#8230;would you like to introduce yourself? Suzanne Pharr: I&#8217;m Suzanne Pharr. JD: My first question to you is boring. Where did you grow up and what was your childhood like? SP: Oh, my, this could take the entire interview. [Laughter] I&#8217;ll try to make it short. I grew up in a little place called Hog Mountain, Georgia. Hog Mountain is about six miles out of Lawrenceville, Georgia, which is about forty or forty-five miles northeast of Atlanta. I&#8217;m the youngest of eight children of parents who were dirt farmers, which meant that they plowed with mules and horses. Weren&#8217;t very mechanized, very small farm. Might seem a little bit larger now, but very small in terms of real farms that create enough to sell in a broad way. We raised a little bit of cotton, but mostly things like butterbeans for market. We had a huge garden. We raised wheat, corn, provided all of our own food, and were basically [pause] poor. I was born in 1939, and our lives were socially organized around two things. One was around the school and the other was around church. I guess if there was a third, it was whatever community that lived very close to us, and close would be sometimes a half a mile away or a mile away. So those were my two points of reference. And family, a very, very large extended family. Church was very small but very closely connected, and then school, where my father and mother were involved in both school and in church, in lay leadership. It was a very solid family and very much as a family of the times. Almost everybody was a Yellow Dog Democrat, [states rights], but during the civil rights movement they were, [pause] we still remember the legacy of the Civil War. You know, &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell us what to do.&#8221; Not the Civil War so much in the slavery, but in terms of who owns us, who&#8217;s going to make laws for us; who&#8217;s going to take our land; who&#8217;s going to march through Georgia. Though racism was involved in that, but it was also in that larger picture of state&#8217;s rights. So, I worked in the fields. Went to school, worked in the fields, ate extremely well. Never had much sense of being really poor because I lived among other low-income farmers. [Pause] Had early, confrontations about gender, but didn&#8217;t know probably until I was way grown, maybe in my fifties, [laughter] that there was more about gender than being a lesbian. For my time, I was always a very, very independent child, and all my life my family would describe the children. But they had three girls, four boys, and Suzanne, and I was really quite up in age before I stopped to think, &#8220;What does that mean, three girls, four boys, and Suzanne?&#8221; So the battles that I had with my mother were primarily around gender, in that she feared for me out in the world. She knew that I wasn&#8217;t exactly [pause] a feminine, traditional daughter from the time I was really, really little. I loved to wear my little [pause]&#8230;this kid down the road, his hand-me-down clothes, and fought. She made all of my clothes, and every time that we engaged in that, that was a hard thing for us. So that was my childhood. They were Democrats. They were community involved. My father was in a very dreadful mill accident when I was two. Our family had a corn mill that had been in the family over a hundred years, and he was trying to knock ice off it in an ice storm and was caught in that, in the mill wheel and was taken to the hospital; taken, actually, to my mother first. It was such a, a Southern story. My grandfather ran the mill. My grandfather couldn&#8217;t hear very well; the machinery was running; he knocks the ice off. As soon as gets cleared, it begins moving. A teacher from my little elementary school, Sonny Hill, lived out so far from the mill, who then something, quote, &#8220;told him that he should go down to the mill.&#8221; He goes down and hears my father screaming, that my grandfather can&#8217;t hear, cuts off the mill wheel and saves his life. They put him in the back of the car bleeding profusely. He&#8217;s cut from all across his neck, his lungs crushed. His leg is broken, and many other cuts, so he&#8217;s bleeding all over the car. They go to get my mother, and she&#8217;s helping the next-door, the woman down the road, have her baby. This is such a story of rural life in the South. She goes with him down the six miles to the town to our family doctor that we&#8217;ve known forever, and he says this: &#8220;Nothing I can do for him. I&#8217;ll try to stop the bleeding.&#8221; They put him in an ambulance and took him to the VA hospital; he was a World War I veteran born in 1896. Then he spends six weeks there with my mother sitting at his side, waiting. [Pause] They tell her that he&#8217;s going to die. All of us kids are at home, and the older ones take care of the little ones. Then he lives and she comes home, and he can&#8217;t farm, so he works for a sawmill. My mother takes the oldest of the brothers, who is probably twelve, and they worked the fields. My mother farms and does the house at the same time. So, it&#8217;s a great, great story of courage and endurance. Then my father eventually, though always disabled, was able to return to the fields and farm. My father is a man of tremendous character, and so was my mother, but my dad had universal respect as a person that could always be depended on for truth, that could always be depended on to be engaged in community, though he was one of the most reserved men and didn&#8217;t talk a lot. So, that was my childhood. I grew up as a lesbian kid in a place where [no one] had never heard a word like homosexual or gay or queer or lesbian. No language whatsoever for it. JD: How did you begin to discover that you were a lesbian in this context? SP: Having man-crushes on my brothers&#8217; girlfriends when they were in the sixth grade and seventh grade and eighth grade, and I was [laughter] in the first and second. Loving boys&#8217; clothes, being--I mean, I didn&#8217;t know what you called that. But, at school I played both with girls and boys. We didn&#8217;t have [pause]. We had a red clay basketball court and we had maybe a couple of bats and a couple of softballs. But when we were in the first and second grade, if you had little cars, you would run them up and down the dirt, red clay. So I&#8217;d do that with the boys and I would go play in the woods with the girls and then--. It was that kind of thing. It was poly-sexual, I guess. More than bisexual, just being attracted to, in terms of activity as well as in terms of being drawn to people, both to boys and girls. Then I became a little bit of a basketball star. I started playing basketball in the sixth grade and played basketball in the little elementary country school for three years. Then I had a couple of my hot-shot teammates, when we went to the high school in town, in Lawrenceville, we became first-stringers right away because we had had such experience. Then I fell in love with a cheerleader. So, I also dated the guy that was the captain of the football team, the quarterback. So, it was all of that sort of thing, and was in church. Lost belief in God at a very early age, early age being like third grade, but still at the church. JD: What church was it? Was the denomination&#8230;? SP: Methodist. [Pause] Yeah. And my dad was committed in the sense that never having made any money, he always tithed ten per cent of everything. Not the net, but the gross. He and my mother would clean the church. My mother provided flowers for the church. We fed the preacher. At my dad&#8217;s funeral, one man told about how when the church was suffering so much for lack of money, my dad would walk across fields, going to people&#8217;s houses to ask them to give fifty cents or a dollar or whatever. He also taught Sunday School. My mother was part of the WSCS, Women&#8217;s Society of Christian Service, which is now United Methodist Women, so I had a great [pause] model for being in the community and being in a relationship with community, but all in a very rural--. When I say Hog Mountain, it had a store and a voting, a concrete voting building in the community that was around that. And then there was Lawrenceville, where I went to high school, which had about five thousand people, where I lived for basketball. JD: What was it like growing up in the Jim Crow? Did you have any interaction with the black community growing up? SP: Almost none. There was a small black community in Lawrenceville. Of course, we&#8217;re getting toward northern Georgia. At one point, we were unable to get our butterbean crop in and my dad hired several black men from town who worked for a short time, like maybe a day or two, and really hated the work. It was very hard, bending over, and not that there was anything wrong with them not wanting to do that, but to have to transport themselves or be transported six miles and then do that. I&#8217;m sure my dad wasn&#8217;t paying much. So, it was about the only real contact I had. Of course, didn&#8217;t go to school with anyone who was black, not in high school, not in elementary school, not in college. Freshman year in college was when I saw my first Klan event, when they rode through the streets of Millidgeville. JD: Speaking of college, what inspired you to go? It doesn&#8217;t sound like it would be assumed that you would be going, but--. SP: Well, there&#8217;s a history of women going to college in my family, which was a little bit of an odd history. There were eight children in my father&#8217;s family, and his father decided to educate his girls and not his boys. The reason he did, is he felt that men could always support themselves, but he wanted his girls to be able to support themselves. Now, this man was a patriarch, but he wanted his girls, that if they didn&#8217;t marry or if they were divorced, to be able to be self-sustaining. So it was unusual for the times. But, my grandfather, at the same time, was somebody that--I mean, he adored his wife. He called her &#8220;my dear,&#8221; but was also very aloof and always wore a white outfit, like white work pants and a white work shirt. Never cursed, never--I mean, everybody was pretty scared of him, but he was committed on this thing. So, my oldest sister went to college, and she&#8217;s eighty-eight now, about to be eighty-nine. Two of my sisters went a little bit. One of my brothers, the brother that&#8217;s closest in age to me went to college and became an engineer. But when I came along, my mother really urged me to do what girls did then, which was go to Atlanta and take a secretarial course and become a secretary. Underneath that was also the sense that this is the way you met someone to marry. And I didn&#8217;t want to do that, but it was very clear with her that I didn&#8217;t want to do that, but that&#8217;s what she kept urging me to do because they didn&#8217;t have money to send me to college. They felt that you shouldn&#8217;t urge anyone to go to college if you couldn&#8217;t support them to do that. And they were so hard-working. My mother, this was forties and fifties in the South, and we were still killing hogs and rendering fat and doing all those things. She made everything I wore, everything except underwear. It was such hard work. We canned and all that stuff. So, when I went to college there was not money available. I was kind of a bad girl, so independent and rebellious from the time I was born, and a kid that loved animals more than people, that loved being outside more than inside. I had a life inside my head and didn&#8217;t have people to play with until I went to school. I was very thrilled to go to school because my brothers, they were, before them, they were older than I am. They were their own unit, and so I played with them and I loved that, loved the farm and still love to farm. I still do it. So, they didn&#8217;t have any money. One of my little bad girlfriends and I, we had our first-ever college day, where the colleges come and promote their schools. We had never had one; it was 1957. Very interesting. The same year that Little Rock was integrating, after Clinton, up here, had already integrated, which was the first school in the South to do that. JD: (18:32) SP: Excellent. JD: She&#8217;s done interviews with all the black students who (18:39). SP: Oh, great. It was a beautiful film on it. JD: Yes, and she&#8217;s working on the historic memory of it as well. SP: I didn&#8217;t know about it until I came here, and I grew up in the South. JD: It&#8217;s whatever thing, is that Little Rock&#8217;s overwhelmed it&#8230; SP: &#8230;Little Rock totally&#8230; JD: &#8230;and Little Rock was not the first. SP: And this story, the film is one of the best organizing models. There is so much to learn from that film. It&#8217;s a great, great film for use for a lot of things. JD: I&#8217;m working on all those interviews, too. (19:08). SP: It&#8217;s so great. It&#8217;s excellent. So, it was in the Methodist church, and she and I were going to slip out the back door, and go do whatever we were going to do. I don&#8217;t know, probably go down to the drugstore and have a Coke and a hot dog. I mean, I don&#8217;t know what we were going to do. This very lovely man was coming down the stairs, and we were such bad girls and such good girls. You know that duality that kids can have. So the good girl in us--he looked at us and said, &#8220;Oh, you were coming up to see me?&#8221; We were within feet of the door, taking off, and we said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So we go back upstairs with him, and he offers us each a little hundred-dollar scholarship to the Women&#8217;s College of Georgia down in Millidgeville. At that time it was Georgia State College for Women, and when my aunts had been there it was Georgia Normal. So, we go. It cost six hundred dollars a year, which is exactly--I had to beg my father. I had to work on him for weeks to get him to fill out the forms so I could try to get financial aid. Well, it turned out that that was what he was netting a year, so that gives you a sense of the two things. So I go off to this college in the heart of the Confederacy, Millidgeville, and a girls&#8217; college, set up basically to create teachers, basically for the daughters of farmers and shopkeepers. It&#8217;s like the schools I went to. I mean, class was not so much on your mind. Class was such a small gradation of difference. You know how it is in the South, where, in the thirties and forties, it was so important for white people to feel like they were what was known as &#8220;poor white trash,&#8221; which was, at that time, conventional term in the South which meant basically that you were junk; you didn&#8217;t keep clean and didn&#8217;t go to church. These were the people that had junk in their yards and didn&#8217;t go to church. It was a very class-based statement and the depth of feeling in the folks that were at that class level to be above black people. You know, to be differentiated, and then for white people who are at the same income level to be differentiated from poor white trash and black people, so that was always at play. Then there was only one other line above that, and that was people whose parents maybe had a shop. So, the gradations of class were the terrific poverty of African-Americans, who at that time were, prior to the civil rights movement, sharecropping, working as servants, working at the most menial pay; what was called poor white trash, who were scrubbing trying to make the living the best they could, and people who basically made the same income but had some land ownership and could run a little farm and still be impoverished, but had those gradations of class working. But no one, of course, had class analysis who were in those communities but had class prejudice. People like (23:12) do a great job of writing about that, how those things were at work with African-Americans and white people and the ways in which white people learned to establish class and power over that kind of thing. JD: What was your college experience like, your college years? SP: Well, as I said, I was right there in the heart of the old Confederacy, in a red-brick college with white columns in a town of many homes surrounding the college with white columns and then poor people living out. It was where, outside of the church, [the] first time I encountered anything even close to progressive politics. We had a great woman who worked for the Y. I can&#8217;t remember her last name; her first name was Izzie. She did a tremendous amount with those of us who were rebellious, and those of us who sought out the Y for whatever reason, in raising consciousness around civil rights. [Pause] Had great teachers in the English Department. I went there ignorant, ignorant, ignorant. I&#8217;d never been very academic in high school. I cared so much about playing basketball and running around. As my family used to say about me, &#8220;Well, she doesn&#8217;t make great grades, but she makes up with it with personality.&#8221; [Laughter] Is that a compliment? I&#8217;m not sure. (25:14) I had dreadful teachers in high school. For three years, I studied the Reader&#8217;s Digest educational supplement for English, which was little packets. They had little pieces in them from the Reader&#8217;s Digest, and you sat in class each day and read those and answered questions. Well, I sat in the back of the class with my male friends and caused trouble. [Laughter] It&#8217;s turned out that some of them were the smartest folks that came out of there. Three out of my graduating class of sixty-six, three went to college, three or four. I&#8217;m not certain exactly about how many, but it wasn&#8217;t a great number. So, a lot of people sat in class and read from textbooks to us. It was pretty mind-numbing, and I came from a family of great readers. We fought over things like The Saturday Evening Post, my brothers and I. Vicious fights, threatening fights. We had books; I met the bookmobile down the dirt road that we lived on to get my books. I couldn&#8217;t wait for it to come. I read books constantly when I wasn&#8217;t in the field or wasn&#8217;t having to work. This little litany of my household was whosever name it was, it was, &#8220;Stop reading and come,&#8221; do whatever, set the table or help cook, and the answer always being, &#8220;Just let me get to a stopping place.&#8221; [Laughter] At night, my brothers and I lay on the floor in the living room. My mother and dad sat in chairs and we lay on the floor and read. That&#8217;s what we did every night. That&#8217;s what we did for entertainment; that&#8217;s what we loved. We were all voracious readers. Fortunately, in that way, I was prepared to go to college, and had my brain activated to a certain extent. Then I go, thinking, &#8220;Oh, what am I going to major in? Maybe PE because I love basketball so much. Maybe psychology.&#8221; And I run into the great English teachers, great lesbians, not out; beautiful minds, committed to all of us girls. I suddenly realized that what I had been doing all those years was connected to English. I had no idea that novels were connected to English. I discovered romantic poets; I discovered T.S. Eliot; They basically took that narrow--I mean, I barely stayed in college my first year because I was so rebellious. Coming off a farm with all the freedom I&#8217;d had and suddenly I&#8217;m in this little school for working-class kids where there are lots of rules and I&#8217;m queer. They had threatened to expel me way more than once. I sat in front of the dean of women way more than once. Had the president, whose name was Robert E. Lee, [laughter] who lived in a mansion&#8230; JD: &#8230;How fitting&#8230; SP: &#8230;give me special attention more than once. I worked every day as a secretary to a teacher and as a waitress at night in order to pay my way through school, and had faculty members who put anonymous twenty-dollar bills or fifty dollars into my mailbox. A family that&#8217;s trying to do its best by me. It sounds a little bit unrealistic, doesn&#8217;t it, when you think of people paying forty and fifty thousand dollars a year now? [Laughter] Or thirty thousand dollars a year to go to school, but I went for six hundred a year. JD: But six hundred back then was a lot of money. SP: Given what I was paid to be a secretary and to be a waitress, yes. So anyway, that began busting up some of my ignorance. It was also where I was first accused of being a homosexual, first heard the word. JD: I was going to ask you, you mentioned that you had lesbian professors that inspired you. Was there a lesbian community that was underground on campus? SP: Um-hmm, among the faculty. JD: Among the faculty, but not among the students? SP: Hm-umm. JD: So can you tell me a little bit about that and then talk to me about the first time you were accused of being a homosexual? SP: About the lesbian faculty? JD: The lesbian faculty, and then I&#8217;ll ask you a little bit more about that first incidence of someone charging you. SP: Well, the first clue was there were a number of unmarried faculty in the English Department and the PE Department and several areas. Then you suddenly observed that there were women faculty who shared apartments that were on the campus. There were all these stories that explained how these people happened to be single, like she lost her fianc&#233;e in the Second World War, or she&#8217;s living with this older woman because they had been in a car wreck together and she felt responsible for her. There were all these kinds of things. Then I discovered, by getting connected to one of those faculty members and suddenly realizing everybody was connected to everybody and that information was passed around that I had no--it wasn&#8217;t sexual information that was passed around, but all your activities of any sort were watched. This was all linked. All the great dangers of closeting. It&#8217;s damaging in so many ways. And I actually can&#8217;t remember now what led to the thing in my freshman year. I don&#8217;t know what I was up to when someone called me a homosexual. We had suites, two young women on each side with a bathroom connecting. It was my roommate. It was the last year I had a roommate. They accommodated me for the next three years to let me in a room alone. I asked for it and they gave it to me. I don&#8217;t know of anybody else who roomed alone; there might have been maybe two or three somewhere else. JD: Do you think it&#8217;s because they suspected that you were a lesbian or of &#8230; SP: Oh, no, they knew. I think it came from the lesbian underground. [Laughter] I mean, I had suitemates, but I hated having a roommate, just despised it. But anyway, all I remember is the emotion of it and badly bruising my hand by hitting the bathroom door. I was young and impetuous. JD: When someone charged you, did you deny it? Did you even know what it was? How were you feeling? SP: I can&#8217;t remember. I was enraged, you know? I felt like I had been downed in some way. I didn&#8217;t have any framework for--. I mean, I knew what I was up to was something, you know? [Laughter] JD: Something rebellious, so to speak? SP: I knew it was something that I didn&#8217;t want anybody to know. I had that much to know, but I didn&#8217;t hear people talking about it. So anyway, I spent the first summer after college being a full-time farmer because my dad couldn&#8217;t work, and I spent the next two summers being a camp counselor. No, the next summer being a camp counselor, which was a great women&#8217;s haven, then the next two summers after that, waiting tables in resorts in North Carolina to pay my way through school. JD: At this point in time, did you watch the civil rights movement? Did you express any desire to become a part of it? SP: I always call myself on the periphery of the civil rights movement. What we organized was what you would think of now as very much around class, race privilege. The organizing on campus was part of organizing throughout the state by not huge numbers of people, but to keep the schools open, and any with desegregation because the threat was to close the whole school system down. So, we did some rallies. We went to a huge place where you got to testify. I don&#8217;t think it was in Millidgeville; it was probably in Macon. Our people testified. It was probably four or five hundred people in the auditorium. The Grand Dragon of the KKK testified. There were all these people who were organized to testify, either for or against. It was like you would think of political things. It was a good thing to keep schools open, but that might have been more of the motivation than desegregation was the motivation. Though we certainly talked about the necessity for African-Americans, that we didn&#8217;t call African-American at that time, to be able to go to school. But the larger motivation was to keep the schools open. JD: For whites? SP: Probably, yeah. JD: You mentioned earlier about your first run-in with the Klan when you went to college. SP: Seeing it, seeing them ride. Seeing them ride through Millidgeville carrying their torches, wearing their--. They were on horseback. JD: What instigated them to run through Millidgeville like that? SP: I don&#8217;t remember anymore. I don&#8217;t know. JD: But was it a terrifying sight, or what were your&#8230;? SP: &#8230;It was scary, yeah. It was tremendously forceful. I mean intimidating [pause] for everyone. But, you can, as a white person, when I say for everyone, I can&#8217;t even begin to bridge the idea of how intimidating it was for African-Americans. It was designed to be--it worked. It was scary when the Grand Dragon of the KKK was at the other meeting. And I was worried. We worried, &#8220;Were our fathers a member?&#8221;and , that we didn&#8217;t know. That we didn&#8217;t know, because it was all secret. Was the guy that served you at the drugstore? Was your banker? Was your preacher? JD: And you just didn&#8217;t know. SP: But I didn&#8217;t think about that when I was in high school. It was when I got to college and began to get some sense of the civil rights movement. I heard my parents talk about the civil rights movement with distaste in high school, but most of us were, I mean, I was so brainless. [Laughter] Like I say, it was all about playing basketball and running around. Most people who do the social change at work come from much more outstanding academic backgrounds than I do. So I came alive in college. JD: Well, and then you went off to pursue your M.A. in Louisiana. So how did that happen? SP: Well, I first went to Buffalo. JD: Oh, that&#8217;s right, M.A., and then the Ph.D. was in Tulane. SP: Yeah, yeah. JD: Oh, my gosh, what was that, a cultural shock to go up to Buffalo, New York? SP: Oh, it was huge. It was enormous cultural shock. I had never been north. I had barely been out of the state. It was in the civil rights movement, and here I came as a white Southerner, deep southern accent, as a teaching assistant, teaching white, mostly Polish-Catholics and white kids. Totally integrated classroom, and teaching among other teaching assistants, all of whom were white, but who were way more political than I was. They came from such better schools and way more political. They were hard on me. Students were hard on me; my co-workers, the T.A. folks were. I was challenged at every point. I remember reading the first papers. There were also a large number of Jewish kids, and I was reading these papers with god not spelled out. (39:49) I was marking them as typing errors. I mean, that level of ignorance. So, it was my first time in any kind of multi-cultural scene and I was twenty-one years old. But I was challenged by the black kids; I was challenged by the Catholic kids; I was challenged by the Jewish kids. That was pretty much the sum of who was in the class (40:19) and in those groups, and very much challenged. Malcolm X came. It was also during the time in which the House Un-American Activities Committee was going. We were fighting the [pause] whatever it was called, setting up the law that if you taught at a state university that you had to sign an oath of [pause]&#8230; JD: Loyalty. SP: Loyalty, disavowing that you were a communist and we fought that fiercely. So that was going on, and the civil rights movement was coming there and I remember very vividly hearing Malcolm X talk. One of my interesting memories in all of that--I mean, you can imagine the growth curve was--. [Laughter] Just the academic part was a growth curve. The way I got there is, the English faculty said, &#8220;You should think about going to graduate school, because you&#8217;re smart and there&#8217;s some possibility for you.&#8221; My oldest brother, who&#8217;s now deceased from asbestos-related lung cancer says, &#8220;You should think about this new Peace Corps thing.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll apply for it and I&#8217;ll apply for graduate school and whichever comes through first, I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221; And this was after my first vote, which was for Kennedy. So I applied to two schools because I thought they both had--I was really interested in [the] modern novel and modern poetry, and I applied to Oregon and to Buffalo. What was I thinking? It was brainless. So I get accepted at Buffalo first and I go there. JD: So no Peace Corps for you? SP: No Peace Corps for me; it would have been a great thing for me. It would have been a fantastic thing for me. JD: But you learned so much at Buffalo. SP: I learned more than I would have ever dreamed of. But anyway, what I was going to say, one of my favorite memories there is one of the people who was most antagonistic toward me for being a Southerner and for being ignorant in all the other things, did two things while I was there. One was I had-- the great writer Flannery O&#8217;Connor? JD: Um-hmm. SP: Well, I waited on her mother and her at the restaurant where I worked. JD: Oh, wow! SP: Night after night at this place called the Sanford House. They would come to eat and I would wait on them. I was also part of the Literary Guild, which was this little club for English majors. Now, that&#8217;s where a lot of lesbians were. [Laughter] If they had been any connection, there were a lot of them in that, but we didn&#8217;t know at the time. JD: (43:41) SP: Or not acting out. JD: (43:45) How did you form relationships in a closeted--? SP: You became really good friends. Intellectual friends or whatever. JD: Were there any cues to indicate if someone--? SP: Well, they didn&#8217;t talk about boys. [Laughter] That would be one. So anyway, once a quarter or so, everybody would go out to Flannery O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s home, Andalusia, which is right outside of Millidgeville. We would go out there and have a little literary guild out there. There were all the peacocks and Flannery O&#8217;Connor and her mother. I have such a history of ignorance. That&#8217;s why I have so much sympathy for people, and I have made a pretty good organizer in my life. It&#8217;s like, if I can grow as much as I did on a daily basis over the years, anybody can, so I never think anyone is too stupid to&#8230; JD: &#8230;To learn. SP: To learn or to change consciousness or that kind of thing. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Yeah, I remember that.&#8221; The reason I love teenagers so much is that I haven't forgotten that. [Laughter] I haven&#8217;t forgotten how stupid I was and what it meant to have all those hormones and not enough brain to work with them. So anyway, so everybody would sit around and talk to her. Not me. I&#8217;d be walking out on the grounds, looking at the peacocks, talking to my friends. Totally wasting the moment, and I was so convinced she couldn&#8217;t be great even though the teacher said she was great. I was convinced she couldn&#8217;t be because she was a Southerner. Isn&#8217;t that sad? So one of the guys that really gave me such a hard time about being a, quote, ignorant Southerner, he told me, he said, &#8220;Do you know Flannery O&#8217;Connor?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, yeah. I don&#8217;t know her, but I waited her table at night and used to go to her house.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Oh, the last time I saw her, we were dancing at something, something, something.&#8221; I realized what an imposter he was because she had lupus, and all those years that he was talking about, she was on crutches and so suffering from probably the steroids. She had that moon face that you get from steroids, so I knew he was lying. And then, the other thing that happened with him is he and his wife gave a party at one point. We all went to each other&#8217;s party. It was graduate school. I didn&#8217;t know the way to their house, and so I called and they hung up on me. I called another time and I would say a few things like, &#8220;I&#8217;m just, is this his name and his house?&#8221; And they would hang up on me. I finally got directions from somebody else and showed up, and they were telling this story about this black person who kept calling them, and they were so suspicious and it was me. Me, with my southern accent. It was such a profound moment to me to recognize the way in which people can lord it over folks in terms of their politics. I&#8217;ve seen it, of course, all of my life or since then, but he was so self-righteous with me. Here they were, not a white person in the crowd, and identifying me by my accent as being black, then showing that fear and rejection. So anyway, those were great growing days for me. Somewhere there, I dropped out. I went to Young Harris College and taught for a year, a little junior college up, a Methodist College in north Georgia, and left there and went back to graduate school and got my Master&#8217;s. I started going to Tulane in the summers, then I went to teach at Mary Washington College and started going to Tulane in the summers. Then I expatriated. I thought I was expatriating with my girlfriend that [pause] to New Zealand because she and I had been discovered by her father for being in a relationship and he had put detectives on us. It was all within Mary Washington. So we decided we would pack up and leave, ignorant as sin. I mean, again, didn&#8217;t know what we were doing, but somehow we thought it was more like instead of being the equivalent of Scotland or Ireland. We thought it was some country that needed help being built. [Laughter] We had that in our minds that we were going to be going in as teachers and really helping to build the country. Of course, we found out there that it had ways and systems and history that went much deeper than the U.S. [Laughter] We stayed a couple of years, and King was killed and Bobby Kennedy was killed, and it was too hard to be in a place that was so far away and so isolated, so we came back. JD: And this is in Scotland you said? SP: No, New Zealand. JD: New Zealand. Oh, okay. SP: Yeah. JD: Oh, but still a beautiful place to have gone for a few years. SP: It&#8217;s gorgeous. It&#8217;s gorgeous. JD: Did you teach at a local college in New Zealand? SP: We both taught at a high school. Edgecomb, which was in a largely Maori section of New Zealand in the North Island, but in the southern part of the North Island. Then I became a lecturer at Christchurch. And at that time, when you bought your ticket, you could go from Atlanta to L.A. to Hawaii to Tahiti to New Zealand. On the way back, you could come for the same price, and go in the opposite direction and go to Australia, Thailand, anywhere as long as you kept in a forward progression. So we basically made about twenty-five-hundred New Zealand dollars each and we saved one of our salaries the last year we were there. I don&#8217;t know what we were thinking about doing with it, but then, when the deaths occurred in this country, we took that money and headed home and had a little around-the-world trip. We were profoundly affected by being in Calcutta. It was the combination of those deaths and seeing the level of systemic poverty there that gave me a particular commitment that I was really going to give my life to social change in a way that I hadn&#8217;t before. I had done some things, but not any consistent things. Then, we flew into this country in 1969 and stepped off the plane right into the women&#8217;s movement. Now, how nice is that? [Laughter] JD: Yeah, you you left for New Zealand in 1963? SP: [19]67. JD: [19]67, there for two years. SP: That was a couple of years. JD: So you missed a lot of the really--you were coming at the end of the big social unrest. SP: That&#8217;s right. JD: So then, what was your entrance into the woman&#8217;s movement then? What was the first sign of things that had changed or things that were arriving? SP: Well, see, I had decided to go to Tulane to finish up my Ph.D., and so I take off to New Orleans and everybody&#8217;s organizing. I jump right into the middle of the women&#8217;s movement and right in the middle of the anti-war movement. JD: Did your girlfriend accompany you to New Orleans or did you--? SP: Not at first; she came a year later. JD: Okay. SP: Yeah. And it was fierce on all fronts. It was totally, totally invigorating and electrifying. So I moved into both the levels of organizing that I had always loved. I was a big organizer of not always good things in my high school. [Laughter] Some good things. JD: That&#8217;s where a lot of organizers begin, though, we have to admit. SP: And the fact the teachers in my high school would ask me, give me jobs to basically organize the students to get me to stop organizing in other ways. JD: Smart teachers in some ways. SP: Yeah, very smart teachers. So I was one of the organizers of the first conscious-raising group. There was a women&#8217;s center being organized. I was the organizer of the first Women&#8217;s Living Co-operative there, or housing co-operative. I was one of the, I wasn&#8217;t the founder; I was one of the editors of the women&#8217;s newspaper, Distaff. I mean, there was thing after thing, doing street theater, doing protests. Then, with the anti-war movement, being involved in all the rallies and engaging with so many of the guys who were up in that and taking over buildings and all of that stuff. So it appealed to both my organizing, my sense of rebellion, my sense of injustice, which I had finely tuned since I was a child. I think that comes from being the youngest of eight, always looking to see is that pie cut exactly in the--? Am I getting exactly what to the--? Who knows what that comes from? All children have a keen sense of injustice, and some lose it and some don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s always a great thing to foster in children. JD: So, you said you had a moment of commitment to social change in Calcutta, but you came back in all this radical moment. Did your politics change or your politics already there or--? SP: My politics grew and now one of the things I had taught and one of the things I had concentrated on in my studies was nineteenth-century American literature, and so I was very engaged in reading about the women&#8217;s--the first wave of the women&#8217;s movement, reading about and teaching about the suffragettes, both through novels and through the kinds of writings. I was very involved in that whole period of looking at the literature of the war and the post-war. So, that was already opening and then a great co-worker who&#8217;s now been at Duke for a very, very long time, Liz Clark, who was a professor with&#8230; JD: &#8230;Okay. SP: You know Liz? JD: Um-hmm. SP: She&#8217;s a dynamite feminist. JD: Yes, she is. SP: She helped to shave off a lot of my ignorance. [Laughter] We both taught at Mary Washington together. JD: Oh, okay. SP: Yeah, yeah. So I meet Liz and I find someone who reads the New Yorker, who listens to Beethoven all the time, and I&#8217;m still this rough kid from the South. JD: What were some of the things that you discussed in your CR group? SP: Let me go back. So Liz was introducing me to books like Betty Friedan&#8217;s and that kind of thing. She was bringing a lot of that in, plus I was at a women&#8217;s college, so that feminism, that part was rising. With the war, I had this increased repulsion about the war. Basically, in some ways, it was because it was more to go and have a relationship and be free, but there was a secondary piece of feeling like I was through with this country, and that was more about the war than it was the women&#8217;s movement or the civil rights movement. I was really, really appalled [pause] because I don&#8217;t know why that should have been, but the women's movement was small. Then, I can&#8217;t even say the reasons that I wasn&#8217;t in the middle of the civil rights movement. I continue to be in very, on the edges of it, never doing that direct action, never that kind of thing. Also I spent so much of my twenties struggling. Struggling, struggling, struggling with what it meant to be a lesbian, living in such terror of my family having so much pride in me for being a teacher, of being a college teacher. JD: What if they found out? SP: Well, the terror of losing family and community and church, even though I didn&#8217;t believe. Those had been the way my social concerns were. It went around those two, those poles of school, family, church. So I learned terrifically from that because I was so intent that I was going to be free and here I was imprisoned, and worse, living against my values of honesty. So, imprisoned and seeing myself as a person that I was not in any other realm. Bad kid as I had been, I was never the kid who was full of lies and deception. I was full of rebellion. When I&#8217;m in the third [grade] or my mother won&#8217;t cut my hair, so I go home and get her sacred sewing scissors and chop it all off. You know? That would be a little early-age sense of rebellion. But here I was, lying every day. Every day, everywhere I went. If it came out at college where I was teaching, I would have been fired. I thought if I came out to my family, all those things that person after person went through at those times and people still go through now. Hopefully, fewer and fewer, with less pressure to be protective. So, coming home, coming back to this country, I simultaneously come out publicly, and the place I come out was in that first consciousness-raising group, where the two things clash by wanting to be authentic and truthful, and my wanting freedom and women&#8217;s freedom. Those two things were like (1:01:00). I&#8217;m sitting down with a group of, I don&#8217;t know whether there might have been eight of us at first, and we&#8217;re, that first meeting, we&#8217;re telling our stories, and I had this stark terror. I mean, I&#8217;m an organizer, me and another woman, and a stark terror that, on the one hand, if I don&#8217;t tell them who I am, I can&#8217;t stay there. If I do tell them, I might lose it. Either way, I feel that I might lose it, but the most compelling thing is there&#8217;s no reason for me to be in this group if I don&#8217;t talk truthfully about my life. So it was like this tremendous trepidation, tremendous fear, that I say to them, &#8220;I am a lesbian.&#8221; They say back to me what every person should say when people make revelations. [recorder is turned off and back on] JD: Was it a sigh of--? You said it was a shining moment. SP: I describe sometime way, way, way back when I was writing about it that it was truly like having the world fall off your shoulders. You know, of being that moment of Atlas, like this had that weight of [pause] secrecy, of conflict. I mean, what a terrible, terrible conflict to think of yourself as an honest and decent and good person, and to be a liar. So, all of that falling away. So then, there was also, of course, a radicalizing moment. There&#8217;s nothing getting a little taste of freedom, a little glimpse to begin to realize what&#8217;s possible for you and for everyone else. JD: Was the women&#8217;s movement in New Orleans friendly to lesbians? Because in some areas, women&#8217;s movement wasn&#8217;t particularly--. SP: We thought we were the women&#8217;s movement. [Laughter] Okay that more of us were lesbian than not. NOW was not friendly to lesbians. It purged lesbians, and many of us were involved in that. There were many people--NOW served a great purpose in that way, in particular, that it offered a front for--. I don&#8217;t mean front in a bad way, but that you could go to it and be a lesbian and be engaged in women and feminist politics and what not, and meet other women who were also interested in those kinds of things. But it was a pretty dreadful organization [pause], certainly on lesbian issues. JD: Didn&#8217;t they start switching position against lesbians in the nineteen, took them a long time, 1980s (2:05). Betty Friedan finally&#8230; SP: &#8230;Took them a good while. JD: Did she actually apologize? I can&#8217;t remember. SP: I don&#8217;t think so. JD: She just suddenly accepted--. I don&#8217;t even know if accepted is the right word. SP: Yeah, she was pretty limited in some of that thinking. What&#8217;s so sad is that she failed to recognize the dynamics of race and class and gender in a pretty profound way. She also failed to recognize the extraordinary leadership that was already coming from and could come from lesbians and women of color who were lesbians. Where race and gender were&#8230; JD: &#8230;Race, class and sexuality all&#8230; SP: &#8230;it was all up in their meeting. So, I credit the lesbian feminist movement. There was a women&#8217;s movement and it was the lesbian feminist movement. JD: And you&#8217;re a part of more of the lesbian feminist movement. SP: Oh, yeah. We think that we put the left politics into[laughter], into the whole mix. JD: So, what characterized the lesbian feminist movement? What did they bring to it? You said the left politics. SP: Endless processing. [Laughter] Not always with the most effectiveness, but a belief that we should oppose racism, very strong politics around class, a belief in cultural revolution of music and art. There&#8217;s a very, very long list of things, a lot of analysis around power and control, and particularly, sexuality in power and control. That was displayed most publicly in the battered women&#8217;s movement, domestic violence movement, which had great, great leadership of lesbians. A lot of environmental leadership around environmental issues, around living independently, thinking about the politics of dependence, both within same-sex relationships as well as opposite-sex relationships. It goes on and on. If you could go back and trace outstanding leadership of progressive organizations, you would find a long, long history of lesbian feminists. JD: I think that historians have started to find that. [Laughter] SP: Yeah. JD: Some really interesting (5:30), of course, in a long time your sexuality history is gay men sort of took front and center of it now. SP: But, lesbian feminists--. Gay men never had a movement to politicize them the way the lesbian feminists could be within a women&#8217;s movement and politicize in ways that ere never given to gay men, unfortunately until the HIV- AIDS crisis, and then it was both politicizing and taking them away at the same time. Very, very dreadful. For example, I never, in all of that, thought of myself as a queer organizer. My current work is the first work I&#8217;ve ever done that is specifically related to queer organizing. JD: (6:29) and you did work with the Washington County Head Start, but this is after Tulane, so your years in Tulane were very much&#8230; SP: &#8230;I dropped out&#8230; JD: &#8230;part of radical organizing. SP: Um-hmm, and I dropped out because I wanted to be on the street. I didn&#8217;t want to be an academic. I was, like Ph.D. JD: I can understand that urge. [Laughter] SP: I want to be an organizer, and then I wore myself out doing it. I mean, I really exhausted myself. JD: I was going to ask you about burnout because there are so many early feminists that it seemed inevitable burnout was going to happen at some point in time. SP: I did too much. I really did. I don&#8217;t think I thought of myself as burned out, but I thought--. I had met a couple that owned a farm up in northwest Arkansas, so I thought I would go up there for the summer and write the great American novel. Then I got there and I stayed for twenty years. Not on that farm, but in Arkansas in general. JD: How were you able to keep your first girlfriend from New Zealand? Did that relationship experience stress? SP: I don&#8217;t think it experienced stress but it did end. [Laughter] As many did. JD: Yeah. Whatever relationship, heterosexual or homosexual, many of them experienced stress in the late 1960s. SP: Ours was the stress of not knowing how to do a relationship. Neither one of us, had much of a clue, but we remain good friends and then she&#8217;s very much a part of my history in later years. We could talk about that later, but we broke up in the early seventies, and she lived in New Orleans and then she lived in New England for a while. Her father and many people in her family had a rare familial disease called Marie&#8217;s Ataxia. It&#8217;s where the cells of the cerebellum die off and so the messages that go through the nerves to your muscles; they don&#8217;t go. She and her brother knew. Her father was diagnosed when she and I were together. She and her brother knew that there was a fifty-fifty chance that one of them would be diagnosed, and so at some point in the late seventies she was going to Mayo&#8217;s because she thought she was beginning to show symptoms. Her current girlfriend wouldn&#8217;t go with her, so I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go.&#8221; You can&#8217;t go to something like that with such a huge thing hanging out there. So I went, and she was diagnosed with it, so we made a pact that when she could no longer live alone or didn&#8217;t have a partner or someone to live with that she would come and live with me and finish her--because you die with it. There is no cure. So, in [19]84, I guess it was, she moved to Little Rock and at that time she was walking with a cane. It was a cane and then it was little crutches on her arms and then a walker and then a wheelchair and then a scooter. I went to Oregon in 1992 to work on the (10:20) campaign, which was the anti-gay and lesbian campaign--that was against the anti-gay lesbian ballot initiative called Ballot Measure 9. After I finished with that, I went back to Little Rock and I said, &#8220;We have no services for you here. Do you want to move out to Oregon and see where--. I have a network of people there and we can get amazing services so you can have more independence?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go look at it,&#8221; so we did, and moved out there and I stayed there until she died five years later. It was a very amazing relationship and friendship and profound commitment and love and challenge, a great, great gift to me. She was a strong feminist. She had brought terrific feminist programming into the public library in New Orleans and then again in where she was living in New England. Then, after she became so disabled, she was an activist for ADAPT. They used to do things like close down, put their wheelchairs out around Health and Human Services and close it down. Great, great direct action, organizing to get the People with Disabilities Act. JD: What a wonderful relationship. SP: Oh, yeah. Yeah, tremendous gift. JD: Do you want to go back to Little Rock and tell me--? You moved out to the farm and then just stayed? SP: Yeah, but could we take a break? JD: Yes. [recorder turned off and back on] JD: Okay, back to the farm in Arkansas. SP: Okay, that was not in Little Rock. That was in northwest Arkansas in Madison County, which was about thirty miles out of Fayetteville, Arkansas. JD: Okay. SP: Okay. So I was on that farm for about four years and then I went into--I decided, &#8220;Oh, my goodness, I&#8217;m getting up around thirty-six or so years old. I believe you need to get back into the work force.&#8221; [Laughter] And this was the time of the great lesbian migration when I was on the farm. There were lesbians traveling back and forth across country. There was such a huge development of lesbian feminism then. People were buying inexpensive land and setting up land trusts in women&#8217;s communities. There were singers coming through, the ones that people now think of as the Olivia singers, but Holly Near would come through; Meg Christian would come through. That was a very racially mixed group of people that came back and forth across country. They&#8217;re playing little venues that would be twice the size of this room here, and you&#8217;d be as close as you and I are. JD: Listening to amazing music. SP: Yeah, listening to amazing music by amazing lesbian feminists, so it was very politicized music, terrific artwork that was happening, and then there were people who were on the move. They&#8217;d come up and they would find you in Lesbian Connection or something, and show up with their backpack and their dog. You say, &#8220;Oh, no, we can&#8217;t have a dog here; we have goats.&#8221; [Laughter] There were so many land trusts and Fayetteville had at that time--I went to a reunion there. Not a reunion, but a conference-reunion several years ago. I was giving a talk and I said, &#8220;In the mid-seventies there were probably, I counted fifteen or sixteen co-ops.&#8221; And then, whenever that was, 2004 or 2005 or sometime, there were none. There were co-ops and collectives and it was that whole movement of &#8220;back to the land,&#8221; anti-war, feminism. All that stuff was moving. JD: When you are talking about someone, some historian, so many people have covered so much of the New Left politics or whatever you want to--New Left would be a (2:40) but very few have talked about the movement to the co-ops in the seventies. It&#8217;s the &#8220;co-op movement&#8221; across the country&#8230; SP: &#8230;That was being--. Now people are trying to&#8230; JD: &#8230;waiting to happen because it&#8217;s--. Almost every major leader you think of, even local leaders, it&#8217;s so hard to name a single one that didn&#8217;t spend time in a co-op. At some point, either as leaders of the co-op and leading other movements or going to a co-op to somewhat recover energy or&#8230; SP: &#8230;Yeah&#8230; JD: &#8230;It&#8217;s a story that needs to be told. SP: Yeah, and all of those collectives. They had a women&#8217;s health collective, they had a collective to help people go through their dying, art collectives, there was a pottery collective. There were so many of those things. When I was living on the farm, one of the big political activities I was involved with, it was engaged with a lot of men doing was we were fighting the spraying of what was called 2,4,5-T on the land. It was really quite violent and we were threatened terribly by farmers, and did a lot of organizing and activities regarding that. That, of course, now, is Agent Orange. We had so much evidence of children being born with terrible deformities, but it was really, really hard to get a hearing. But people were very political, and I would say in the last ten years, so much of what people feel like is new discoveries, were the counterculture---discoveries of the time. I mean, there were all kinds of people who, in that movement, who talked about where we would be with fossil fuels at this point. Talked deeply about organic gardening and about pesticides and loss of our original seed and grains, that they would become patented by corporations. This vision into the future of what it was going to be and asking people to position themselves against it. But you had the great roar of capitalism instead that silenced that. JD: So then&#8230; SP: &#8230;Then I moved into Fayetteville to be a director at Head Start. Ended that, that was when I was out as--because I was out as a lesbian. There was a major attack and organizing against me by two women who were sisters whose names I can&#8217;t even remember now. One was directing it and one had hired me to be director of Head Start. It was pretty rough. It was highly organized among the Head Start programs throughout the county. Probably the worst of it was they had a hearing about it at a public venue in an auditorium in the city, and I wasn&#8217;t even allowed in it. [Pause] I didn&#8217;t do a great job of working with community on it. That&#8217;s one of my regrets, that I didn&#8217;t work to organize the community, for whatever reason, I don&#8217;t know. (6:28) think a lot more about it, about why I chose not to do that. I may have been afraid that I&#8217;d bring the whole structure of Head Start into a terrible place. But anyway, I got through it, basically by being really out. By saying, &#8220;You fire me for being a lesbian, and I&#8217;ll put it in every newspaper in the state. There&#8217;s nobody that I love that is going to reject me on the basis of this. You can&#8217;t hold me hostage [pause] through those I love and respect and what not.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think they realized I didn&#8217;t have a legal leg to stand on. There was no law; there was nothing to protect me. But that also was a great, great time in my life because I worked with ten or twelve other people to develop the first battered women&#8217;s shelter there. JD: I was going to ask you, going into domestic violence, not necessarily the women&#8217;s violence, but domestic violence, but before I do, I want to ask you a little bit more too. Were these two sisters who were part of the progressive feminist movement, or were they conservative? SP: No, they weren&#8217;t conservative; they were&#8230; JD: &#8230;Were they just scared of lesbians? SP: I think they were--yeah, it was challenging to their own sexual identity. JD: Okay. SP: Anyway, we started meeting about&#8230; JD: &#8230;Domestic violence. SP: I had worked a lot around rape in New Orleans. There was a woman named Francis Woods, a great feminist in Fayetteville, had gone--I can&#8217;t remember where she went to school now, somewhere in the Northeast; I think maybe Rutgers, but I&#8217;m not sure, but she had studied there. This was 1976. In getting her degree, she had studied domestic violence. It was being brought up then in an academic and a public way, mainly out of England. And so she came back and she pulled a bunch of us together and she said, &#8220;There&#8217;s this thing that&#8217;s happening around that country and it&#8217;s been happening forever. It&#8217;s that women are getting raped and beaten within their own marriages. We were like basically, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; I mean, it really was such a&#8230; JD: &#8230;It was an unspeakable crime. SP: Yeah, and we had gotten rape and understood rape, but gotten the idea of that and had a lot of politics around that, but this was so hidden and so unspeakable. So we started organizing together and the group of us developed this battered women&#8217;s shelter, and there were three women who were academics at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville who took out the loan to buy us a house. We ran it off volunteer workers and CETA, and I became the chair of the board as an out lesbian. So, it was an interesting time, because to do that, it meant that we had to deal with homophobia. Any time women organize on their behalf, that&#8217;s one of the methods that used to stop them. JD: To call feminists lesbians. SP: Yeah. JD: The threat of lesbians would pull them in line. SP: Exactly. JD: It continues to happen today. SP: Exactly. You wouldn&#8217;t think so, would you? You would think we would be so much farther down the road from that, but we don&#8217;t seem to be. JD: It&#8217;s particularly used against young girls who are starting to (10:38). SP: Right. JD: (10:42). SP: Yeah, it really is. It&#8217;s terribly, terribly sad. So, to be organizing on behalf of ourselves and other women who had experienced violence, and to be challenging basically the structure of ownership in marriage led to my even being increasingly marriage resistant. [Laughter] At all points, it was like you were a bunch of lesbians over there, and we would say, &#8220;Some of us are; some of us aren&#8217;t.&#8221; Then we decided we wanted the county to buy us a place, to buy us a shelter. We knew that that was going to be the major argument that they used against us, and we got, we took all the county commissioners; we assigned, each of us, a person to take out to lunch. We persuaded them and got them to give us the money to do that, and it ran pretty much as a collective for years. It was one of the very progressive (12:08) battered women&#8217;s shelters. JD: I have two questions. The first one is did you have any issues, [be]cause I&#8217;ve done interviews with other women who founded domestic violence centers and one of the things that they talk about with the county commissioners, and they get the backing of the county, which is a big step, but there&#8217;s also a problem because people want to take ownership of the center, in ways that, shows the lack of education around domestic violence. They want to put a sign out front saying it&#8217;s a domestic violence shelter, where this is where--? SP: Well, it is actually a piece of a larger problem that happened with the battered women&#8217;s movement. It started out as community based, community organizing, for the most part, and in order to get money to make it happen, you had to basically somehow make it palatable to the community. So in the long run, that led to moving from bake sales to trying to get grants or trying to get county commissioners or whatever, and it moved it more and more toward a professionalized movement. So, by the time you got to the early eighties and you have a crisis in social work, where there were not enough jobs for people. Then social workers, and some of the greatest people in the battered women&#8217;s movement have been social workers, and some of the most dreadful have been, but some of the most brilliant minds, especially in the beginning, so it becomes more and more professionalized. Suddenly you&#8217;re getting government money and it requires instead of maybe a former battered woman from being the director, it requires a person with a social work degree. Then you move to getting men on boards and then men as chair of the board and then men as directors. So you get a woman that has done such extraordinary good but hasn&#8217;t really made quite the dent in ending violence and ending murder that you would have hoped, because it is basically the Violence Against Women Act. I mean, all of those things came at a tremendous cost, and you often have shelters that are big enough that they&#8217;re run like corporations. You actually have directors called CEOs. You have pyramidal corporate authority with the people on top having the most power and the most money, and those who work most closely with battered women having the least power and the least money, and most often being women of color. So it&#8217;s been a really hard road, and at the same time, there&#8217;s still some of the strongest, the greatest strongholds of feminists are in some of those domestic violence shelters still. But it&#8217;s a lot of young feminists have gone there seeking a place to work. Where can you work and be a feminist? It&#8217;s been pretty heartbreaking because there were not very many points of entry or points of moving forward or making much money or having many benefits. So now, there are fewer and fewer places that you come out as a young feminist and have a place to live those politics. But the domestic violence movement still provides a great deal of that. JD: What&#8217;s lost? I mean, this is in the interest of many. If you had a former battered woman as a director in the domestic violence center, what were ideas and programs that she was bringing? SP:What&#8217;s always lost when you don&#8217;t put people who are most directly affected by the issue, that you don&#8217;t put them at the heart of the organization and the leadership of the organization, enormous things are lost. You get closer to charity; you get closer to doing for rather than, &#8220;We are,&#8221; rather than, &#8220;We&#8217;re all battered women,&#8221; the identity, and the person might be one minute off or one day off from being a rape victim. You often lose connection to community. The biggest failure of the battered women&#8217;s movement has been our failure to organize women who have come through a shelter. A lot of that has come from a failure to identify across class and across race. JD: The movement of de-centralizing the women themselves, it loses a political edge, which the statement &#8220;We are all battered women&#8221; is in some ways very political; it has political ramifications that would not otherwise be the case if that statement is not (17:31). SP: Right. [Pause] It&#8217;s a huge thing. I mean, it is a very strong political position of whether you believe this is a difference in movement-building that is progressive or left at its best or movement-building that is mainstream. That would be the position that I hold, that those who are most targeted should be at the center, both in terms of providing the stories that give us the information, but also providing the leadership. So, it can be a combination of people, but it has to be with keeping that targeted group at the center. So, if you have mainstream, middle-class white women leading a movement, you are going to get, if you&#8217;re not careful, a doing for, which relates to power over, even though it might come from compassion and sympathy and those kinds of things, you&#8217;re going to get the idea of providing jobs for, as opposed to how do you look at the whole of people&#8217;s lives? That is, lives are not just economic lives; they&#8217;re also family relationships; they&#8217;re also community relationships; they&#8217;re also a number of things. You get to a Reaganesque situation where you de-fund everything that supports families and then you decry the loss of family structures. JD: I was going to ask you to comment a little bit more, you&#8217;ve done some work talking about--. [Pause] I don&#8217;t know what words to use because words are loaded. You talked a little bit earlier before the interview began about this concept of the New Right or what you described as fundamental, it&#8217;s a return to fundamentalism, or how you&#8217;re organizing domestic violence and participating in that women&#8217;s center, but in the meantime, something else was rising that you were watching. You even talked about the rise of fundamentalism and--. SP: Yeah, should I get to the Women&#8217;s Project though? JD: Yes. SP: At some point? JD: Yes, because&#8230; SP: &#8230;Because I--. [Laughter] JD: Yes, that&#8217;s a selfish question on my part, so let&#8217;s get to the Women&#8217;s Project. SP: I can tell that as part of the Women&#8217;s Project story. JD: That&#8217;s the ideal situation. SP: Yeah, so--. JD: I do lose track of time, so that&#8217;s one of my faults. SP: Yeah, we&#8217;re at about 4:30. JD: Yeah, so we need to wrap it up soon. SP: So, after working for Head Start, I worked as a (20:35) for a couple of years, and one of the things that gave me was a small income and the ability to work on--at that time, you could work on pretty interesting things because it wasn&#8217;t as politically shut down as it became during the Reagan period. So, one of the things I wanted to do was travel around the state and talk to women and see what was needed. Out of that, consider this idea of doing a women&#8217;s organization that worked both on sexism and racism and consider those, both equally and also as interlinked, and that other oppressions were connected to that and linking. So that became my life for, [pause] I don&#8217;t know, nineteen years, until a few years ago, until, I guess, about [19]99. An extraordinary organization, it had very strong principles, a belief that, first of all, about that and linking. We chose to narrow our work to focusing in on economics and violence. We thought those were the two places where women can make the most common ground with one another. But in terms of the internal organization, we believed that whatever you do within an organization should mirror the world that you&#8217;re trying to work for, which is a pretty radical belief, especially in the non-profit world. So, we paid everyone equally, no matter what their level of experience was. We believed that equality in terms of race was not having an equal number of people of color, women of color, to white women, but that to change the historic racism you had to tilt it toward people of color. So, we always had a majority of women of color on staff, a majority of women of color on the board. We were grounded in the grassroots on our board and on our staff. We never required a degree of anyone. We believe that when you pay people equally that that&#8217;s not enough, that you also have to give them equal decision-making and access to information and resources, because who makes the decision about what resources you&#8217;re going to go for and how you&#8217;re going to use them is really about how power is distributed within an organization. People don&#8217;t believe that power is the same if you&#8217;re making an unequal amount of money. And they don&#8217;t believe that power is the same, as they should not, if you&#8217;re not part of the decision-making. So, we never called ourselves a collective, but we basically worked as what would be a collective. We had a very fervent belief in the interconnection of oppressions, felt that people had to be able to bring their whole selves in. We thought that our job was to keep a radical edge alive in the state of Arkansas, and that what we would do is the things that other people were reluctant to take on or to confront, that we would do that until we could build enough people or find enough people that had courage because of what we had done, or connected to what we had done, that they then could take it on and then we would move on to another issue. So, we created the State Domestic Violence Coalition, and then we moved on from that. We were the folks who first began talking about incest in a political way and do training on that. We&#8217;d send film out on buses into rural communities for people to be able to do their own training. We did non-traditional job training for women and did that in a politicized way about economic structures. We were so under attack by the right wing that we began to become pretty knowledgeable about it. We were first attacked--we were under the umbrella of the United Methodist Church for about the first five years, because United Methodist Women had been such supporters. Also, when I first went to the head of the Arkansas--went to the Rockefeller Foundation in Arkansas, a man named Tom McGray, who was the director of it, said to me in 1980, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should get a 501(c)(3).&#8221; He said, &#8220;You should go under the umbrella of a church because we&#8217;re in these times where we&#8217;re seeing this coalescence of fundamentalists and right-wingers.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Do you know anybody that you could, any churches you could get that to happen?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, when I worked at the shelter in Fayetteville, the district superintendent of the United Methodist Church and Methodist women were such supporters.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go ask them if they&#8217;ll do it.&#8221; So I went to the superintendent and asked him if he would do it, if the church could do it and then he said yes. They fought for us, but we were attacked first by the Good News Methodists, which is the right within the Methodist Church. Those women went to conference after conference. They have their annual conference, and took that attack and turned it back year after year after year. It was fantastic. Then we realized that no one was monitoring the far right in the state, so we took that on, went to Klan rallies and monitored all that stuff, and were affiliated with the Center for Democratic Renewal in Atlanta, which was the old anti-Klan network, to keep information with them so they would know what was happening there. It was like the Klan; it was the skinheads, the Posse Comitatus, it was all of those groups. JD: How did you do that as a majority black organization? Well, I shouldn&#8217;t say majority black, but--. SP: Well, they went&#8230; JD: &#8230;Was it white members who&#8230;? SP: &#8230;They went to some things, but there was a great obligation on the part of white people. JD: Okay. SP: It was a great learning period for all of us too, to figure out how to interact in terms of race and what the role was of white people. So we monitored them. We also began prison work, working with women in prison and on violence, which was our way to get in the prison, then working on developing a women&#8217;s library and those kinds of things. You always had to weasel your way into prisons. The United Methodist Women then became volunteers to transport the children of these prisoners. We did a survey and found out that an enormous percentage never saw their children because the children didn&#8217;t have transportation to get there. We thought what an addition or an unjust punishment that is. So, these white United Methodist women organized to bring these kids, many of whom were white and many of whom were black, and from places all over Arkansas down to the prison in Pine Bluff to visit their mamas--phenomenal. They found out that if you didn&#8217;t have money put in your account, you couldn&#8217;t get toiletries like shampoo and lotion and toothbrushes, so they organized these enormous contributions from United Methodist women around the state and delivered those down to the prison for the women to have. It was a very, very outstanding program. So, as we worked with monitoring the--I&#8217;m a little bit jumping about here, but I do have a train of thought, monitoring the right, the far right, we came increasingly to recognize that that wasn&#8217;t what people were most concerned with. We found that what people were most concerned with was the everyday acts of racial and gender injustice and homophobic violence and religious violence. So, we created this thing called the Women&#8217;s Watchcare Network, which was funded by the United Methodist Women out of New York, which was a nice thing. So we were going to monitor all of the sexist violence and that, of course, was impossible. We couldn&#8217;t monitor all the violence against women, so we ended up monitoring just the deaths of women--hundreds. So we would document them, and we monitored extreme acts of racial violence and homophobic violence and religious violence and we held meetings around the state, where we would put people who had experienced religious violence and sexist violence and homophobic violence in the same room and talk to each other. What people discovered is their experience was very, very similar. They could, out of that, bring analysis, understand the connection of that violence--racist, sexist, homophobic and religious. What was probably the most transforming for us was the sexist violence. We asked people to organize in towns and to send us clippings out of the paper. We knew we were going to be challenged on everything. So we wanted it some place, like, it had to be a flyer that had been put on your car from the KKK at Wal-Mart or a clipping from your paper, not something you heard or that kind of thing. So we got all this stuff and we kept a document, and once a year we published a little booklet that listed everything. It would be about this much on women, and this much on people of color, and this much on LGBT folks, and this much on Jews and Catholics. We also monitored against Catholics in the state of Arkansas because there was this anti-Catholic thing. Of course, what we discovered is that for the LGBT communities, they didn&#8217;t want to report violence because it meant coming out. The Jewish community didn&#8217;t want to report violence because of a fear that it would lead to more attacks. So those were the hardest, in terms of getting information and tracing things down, like where people are going and spray painting Jewish cemeteries, or knock the gravestones down. But, in the women, there were so many women killed, and you could pick up themes. We would list who was killed, where, how, if we knew by whom, whether the children witnessed it, whether there was a sexual attack, and how this had been dealt with legally. We saw, increasingly, that it was [pause] not just domestic violence. Many, many cases were domestic, but so many of them were stranger violence, so we began to argue that violence against women should be considered a hate crime. That was a pretty explosive idea around the country. Our theory was always to take our local work and move it nationally, not to be engaged in national down on anything, but take what we knew right here on the ground and then move analysis out of that. So that&#8217;s how the book on homophobia came to be, was doing the work on racism and homophobia and the domestic violence movement. While at the Women&#8217;s Project, that&#8217;s how I worked to get women included as targets of hate crimes. It was quite a journey when you think about the arguments that we used against it, why race could be a category, and even anti-religious violence could be a category. But why women--even the queers could be a category, but not women. The biggest argument was they know the person who does it, which is not true, not always, but that it&#8217;s familial in some way. It&#8217;s a boyfriend or it&#8217;s whatever. The other was that there were too many to count, and I felt that was the most incredible statement that anybody could make, that we can&#8217;t deal with this because the violence is so great. Anyway, we did that for some years. I forgot what I was going to circle back to that you asked me earlier, about the right. So, through being attacked by the right over and over and over again--we were particularly attacked for having lesbians there, being feminist and being pro-choice and all that. We took on lots of issues that were really tough issues, like when a group of black basketball players raped a white drunk girl in Fayetteville and they were the stars. The basketball team was going to keep them from being able to go to the tournament. We were slammed, both by the black community and by the feminist community because we took a position on both, that it was wrong and also a position about what it meant to be in the state and have your--to be black and basically to be honored academically only for your bodies to be brought into the university, so we rubbed both ways. We were so viciously attacked by the press. I mean, it was enormous, the copies of the articles that were written in relation to us, and the threats that we got on that. But we thought that it was both the issue of race and gender, and that we should have the courage to come up with analysis. They brought both of those in; they brought class in, that with all of that brought violence against women, brought violence against black men. So, we were attacked, but&#8230; JD: &#8230;Why do you think people were so resistant to the idea of both being present or an intersection of&#8230; SP: &#8230;It was so hard for people. Either she was a little prostitute or else they were animals. It had to be either&#8230; JD: &#8230;Or&#8230; SP: Yeah, as opposed to &#8220;This is a dreadful situation that has been set up in this particular way.&#8221; So we&#8217;re going along and we&#8217;re monitoring this and we&#8217;re involved in the prison; we&#8217;re under attack for various things. Not all the time, but pretty regularly. You always can feel the right circling us, and particularly the fundamentalist right. We knew a good bit about it but didn&#8217;t know as much as we learned as we went along. We had been in great opposition to things like the Family Protection Act and all the changes that were coming with the Reagan administration. We were very vocal about that, and we saw the rise of the fundamentalist right, but we didn&#8217;t take it seriously enough. I mean, we saw the Good News Methodists; we saw the way it was under attack in terms of LGBT issues, in terms of women, in terms of choice, in terms of sex education. But, in the South, we had lived all of our lives among fundamentalists, and all of our lives among conservatives, so it wasn&#8217;t like as much of a new phenomenon to us as it was to people elsewhere in the country. We often made fun of them. It was like, oh, my god. It was the way people were about the Tea Party last summer, [laughter] except it&#8217;s moved a little faster. But then, in 1991, I went to a Creating Change Conference, the big LGBT conference, and two people from Portland, Oregon approached me with a video, Donna Redwing and Scott Nakagawa. They said, &#8220;We know you&#8217;ve been looking at the right and talking about it. We want you to take a look at&#8221;--and I&#8217;d been making a lot of public speeches about democracy and violence and all of those, linking lots of things together at that point, a lot of speeches around the country. And they said, &#8220;We want you to look at this video called Gay Rights, Special Rights.&#8221; No, I guess it was an OCA, Oregon Citizens Alliance video. It was focusing on this whole notion of gay rights, special rights. So we went down to the basement in some hotel that we were in, where we could set up the video and they showed it to me. I looked at it and I said, &#8220;This is so much bigger than it appears to be. This is not just an attack against teachers and against, you know, LGBT teachers and against the gay community. This is very much about democracy and very much about an attack against the civil rights movement.&#8221; So they asked me if I would come out to Oregon and work for three or four months, working with them to build this idea of this being an attack against democracy and there was a growing right wing that was doing this. So the Women&#8217;s Project was in bad financial situation at that time, and so I said, &#8220;Yeah, I will come if you will pay my salary for the Women&#8217;s Project.&#8221; So they did; they gathered the money up to do that, so I went out and started meeting with folks and talking about the right. We did a huge amount of work. We started the Rural Organizing Project in Oregon, which is a great, great organization. We began bringing churches in and bringing different kinds of groups together and talking about this whole issue of democracy and what did it mean to start redefining civil rights and what did it mean to start amending the Constitution, that kind of thing. I wasn&#8217;t going to be part of the campaign, and I came back to Little Rock and a bunch of people said to me, &#8220;Are you nuts? You did all this work and you&#8217;re not going to be part of the campaign? So I went back and was part of the campaign for two or three months. That was really getting to see the right shifting, seeing them pick up the language of David Duke and talking about special rights, seeing the fact that they were doing a campaign both in Oregon and in Colorado, Amendment 1 there, that it had come out of meetings of the Christian Coalition and those folks, seeing how it had a design to it. In Arkansas, when Phyllis Schlafly came through, fighting against the ERA, I was up in northwest Arkansas at the time, and we were all going to head down, and people didn&#8217;t much want us to come because they were afraid of our being out as lesbians, and then that focus would happen and what not. So she bused in all kinds of people there, and we went down and said, &#8220;No, no, we will not be closeted for this.&#8221; So we&#8217;d seen that organizing and we&#8217;d seen all of that and been really involved in the ERA stuff, but it took us a while to--. For me, at that point, I started running with people who researched the right and getting engaged with them from having been in that campaign. I had been talking about it a good bit, but that was when I really began to be able to put together taking this incarnation of the right, beginning with the Barry Goldwater campaign and bringing it up through understanding the seventies, of the development of the fundamentalist right as an organizing base before putting Reagan into office. And for taking on the things connected to women and connected to queer folks that would help to forward the whole idea of taking down the social contract and defining family in such a particularly authoritarian way that you could begin to move people to have tremendous fears, not only around what they perceived, white people, as they perceived as their losses from the civil rights movement, the so-called &#8220;white picket fence&#8221; time of the fifties, which never really existed, but that they could organize not only those white people to make a voting base through the family values, but could begin to organize black people as well. But particularly through the idea of Bible, the same that they used with white people; the sense of Bible, the sense of family, the sense of home, the sense of &#8220;our communities are falling apart,&#8221; those who are organized for liberation actually are threatening who we are as a people. So, farm workers threatened that, LGBT folks threatened that, to cast all of those who seek freedom and seek liberation and seek a true democratic process as being both un-American and a threat to the very fabric of the country. So, that&#8217;s when I became much more of a researcher of the right. It was unwilling, [laughter] unplanned specialty. Then in [19]96 was when I wrote In The Time Of The Right. At that time, people said to me, in 1996 they said, &#8220;You have exaggerated this so much. It&#8217;s like a conspiracy theory,&#8221; and now people say, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t go nearly far enough.&#8221; Now everybody knows about the right, but in [19]96, not very many people were talking about how complete it was, and what I argued was it basically had taken over the country. JD: Just like those people you thought-they claimed the right, George Bush, Jr. (45:55) with the election of Obama. SP: Right. [Laughter] Yeah. JD: Sometimes wishful thinking can take over as part of who we are as humans. SP: Exactly. JD: Very intelligent, for calling the end of the Reagan (46:10), and this whole group of conservative forces that Obama had defeated them all. [Laughter] SP: So, then, the rest of my life is, after Ann died in Oregon, I had another partner that I had met in the campaign and I very much wanted to move back south. I had never wanted to be anything but a Southerner. All my life, I&#8217;ve loved and hated the South, but I love it more than I hate it. I am committed to this land, this people, to this environment, these birds, these flowers. The people of the South are extraordinary and it&#8217;s where my people are. I could hardly bear it in Oregon that I didn&#8217;t have songbirds. I mean, I missed the South in so many ways. I loved Portland; it&#8217;s a wonderful, wonderful place, but I miss the food, the smell, the feel of it, the cultural exchanges. I could never figure out how to work in terms of race with white people in Oregon. I loved working with African-Americans there and other people of color, but with white people, the veneer of liberalism is so across the board. I mean, we know where we are in the South. We&#8217;re not so often in a very good place, but we know, those of us who grew up here at least. I don&#8217;t know about everyone else. JD: It&#8217;s not sugar-coated. SP: No, and I so miss the relationships of across race that are in the South and the history. So anyway, I moved back. I had been on the board of the Highlander Center for quite some time. Right as I was trying to figure out where to move back to--I wanted to move to the mountains somewhere, my aunt and uncle--I had a beloved uncle in Florida and they had quite a dreadful accident, and so Renee and I picked up and moved down there for a year to be next to them. Had a great year in Florida, still working for the Women&#8217;s Project. Then the director of Highlander left and they persuaded me to be the interim director and I have never in my life ever wanted to be a director of anything. I really identify as an organizer and, I guess, some as a writer--much less. So I ended up taking the job and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it for five years and I&#8217;m out of here.&#8221; So I worked at Highlander and tried to bring the same values and politics of the Women&#8217;s Project. While I was in Oregon, I worked a lot with youth, so I continued to do that at Highlander, but particularly afterwards. So now, I work part-time for the (49:30) Foundation and I work with twelve groups around the country that are either people of color, where people of color are autonomous or they&#8217;re multi-racial and led by people of color that are engaged in a movement-building program, and I coordinate that and support that and advise that and work with them on a daily basis, so it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s really phenomenal work. I was also, in the nineties, one of the six lesbians that--six lesbian feminists; three black, three white, who founded Southerners On New Ground, which is now a great rip-roaring organization in the South led by two of the finest young lesbian feminists you&#8217;ll ever meet anywhere. So that&#8217;s a summary. JD: Well&#8230; SP: &#8230;It&#8217;s quite a long one, but&#8230; JD: &#8230;I know, but I usually ask if there&#8217;s anything you&#8217;d like to add at this point in time, but&#8230; SP: &#8230;I&#8217;ve told it all. JD: What an amazing life. Thank you so much for the interview this afternoon. SP: Well, I&#8217;m a very, very fortunate person. I don&#8217;t believe in mentorship; I really believe in co-mentorship, and I have been co-mentored so well, both by older people and by younger people, and I&#8217;m really, really fortunate at seventy-one to still be able to work, have the opportunities to work across age and across class and across gender and across race. It&#8217;s a tremendous gift for one&#8217;s life. I live in East Knoxville on two-and-a-half acres of land that&#8217;s like a little--. I work two or three hours in the yard every day. I have a garden that&#8217;s fifty feet wide and a hundred feet long. I have flowers and plants and animals and it&#8217;s like a little farm. JD: I was going to say you got to go back to farming. SP: I did. I did. When we thought we would like to move to the mountains, that was the idea. It was get a little ten-acre farm and we started exploring, and you find that those are in white communities in Appalachia, and we didn&#8217;t want to live in an all-white community. So, here we found this little, this place. It&#8217;s as much as I can handle. I can have my tractor and it&#8217;s like this is plenty. JD: Well, thank you. SP: You bet. You bet. I appreciate it...
