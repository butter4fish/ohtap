 BRITTANY DESGAGES: My name is Brittany Desgages and I am interviewing Comlie Leeper today. We are sitting in the conference room at the Smith warehouse building at 114 South Buchanan Boulevard in Durham, North Carolina. It is Thursday, July 3ml around three pm. So ï¬rst think you for being here. And can you start off by telling me a little bit about where you were born and where you grew up? CONNIE LEEPER: All right. So again my name is Comlie Leeper, and while I now live in Durham and have since about 2008, I actually grew up in a very rural company town near Charlotte here in North Carolina called Karmapolis. And Kannapolis was a mill town built up around textiles, and I grew up in a very segregated community and went to segregated schools until I was in the seventh grade when history caught up with little Karmapolis and anti-union basically a bedroom community now of Charlotte, but at the time it was all things King Cotton. So thatâs my experience growing up in the paternalistic company town where one family owned most of the land. They were the larger industry in addition to the hospital and controlled history and the community. BD: Okay. So is most of your family from Karmapolis also? CL: Most of my family is from Kannapolis. All my family for the most part are from the South. A lot of my aunties and uncles were part of the great northern migration, the second wave. And so Pageland, South Carolina is where my grandfatherâs family was Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. from, on my paternal side, and also my maternal side as well. But Kannapolis was where I was born, is where my parents were born. And so thatâs home. BD: Yeah. CL: Yeah. BD: Can you tell me a little bit about your family background and your childhood experiences? CL: Sure. Well, I would want to be really frank, and Iâll probably use some language that is passe and outdated, and thatâs okay. Iâm fifty-seven. So I was born in 1956, the fourth of sixth children. So I have five other siblings. And my parents, my mom was really, really brilliant and decided, and was the valedictorian of her high school class and decided to get married. My father was a handsome fellow, and so she chose him versus going to college. And there were nine siblings on one side and about ten siblings on the other side. I grew up in a very large extended family. We grew up what we would consider poor. Thatâs some of the language that Iâm talking about. In a marginalized community that was almost a hamlet to the actual domestic workers who had mill houses in a time when people of African descent, African Americans in that area could not work in the mill at all. So a lot of our community folk did agriculture, had farms, owned their own little small businesses and worked as domestics to the working class white folk who were the rank and ï¬le, not in a union term of the mill. My grandfather eventually did work in the mill at some point, but he was a shoe cobbler. And my grandmother, we did what one would call now local food sourcing. I mean itâs rad and popular and bougie now, but growing up it was a way of life. So we had our own gardens, and my mother and my grandmother had green thumbs. So they raised plants in addition to things in the garden that we would eat. And my uncles and great uncles raised livestock, either pigs or Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. hogs and so I grew up with my dad being a fisherman, a hunter and a gatherer. So I grew up outdoors. I grew up in the great outdoors on all those trips that my dad would let the girls go on. But I grew up in a Christian family. And the Christian denomination that my father was Baptist, good old fashioned Southern Baptist. But my mom was Lutheran, Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, and itâs important to make that distinction in terms of Lutheranism and the Evangelical Lutheran Church or the Lutheran Church of America that eventually emerged and the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod thatâs a very conservative denomination opted not to do that. And so it is a denomination that to this day does not ordain women as ministers while other more progressive Lutheran sects do that. And so I grew up with this sense of really internalizing that to be a girl child was not the best thing to be, not so much in my family because my mom did not really ascribe to gender roles. We all had responsibilities and duties. It wasnât girl, boy work based on gender male and female. But in my own congregation growing up I always wanted to be an acolyte. And girls couldnât be acolyte. BD: Whatâs that? CL: So an acolyte are the kids that come in before the clergy and ministers, the deacons, the elders and light the candles, put the liturgy books up, the Bible and prepare the service in a very sacred way. And you got little training in that. It was really, to be an acolyte you wore a little robe along with that and you carried and the bible and other liturgical materials, but you also had what I thought was this really cool apparatus that lit the candles and put them out. So an acolyte are the kids in my congregation who did that. It could only be boys. So I never was able to do that. I mean it has changed now. I also grew up in a congregation that got started during reconstruction. So rather than the Lutherans go to parts of West Africa or East Africa to do missionary work, they may have done that, but they also came south. And they started a lot of Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. black churches that generally had white ministers and for the most part got subsidy from the larger Missouri Synod to pay for those pastors, and it was called a subsidy, but it was basically church welfare. And as long as we accepted that subsidy we were under the thumb and the rules of the district that we were in, which was the southeastem district. And then more importantly though it was a process where race was the deciding factor on who was in leadership in this Missouri Synod. So African American men who were ministers could not serve in hierarchical leadership positions in this particular body. And so I grew up in an environment with a mom and lots of women in the church who as a teenager I was able to be a part of my first coalition. And this coalition was to address issues of power in the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, but this power was about black men being elevated as ministers to positions of presidents and Vice presidents of various boards and departments in the infrastructure of the church. And so as I was active in that process, Ibegan to do my critical thinking and to say well what about women being ordained or being able to serve as elders, which was impossible. And I grew up in an environment where women couldnât even vote in the church. So I would say that my own feminism and womanist tendencies started out of being a child being denied the right to fully participate in a body where it was okay if I tithed and offered. It was okay to be confirmed and baptized. I was baptized as an infant and confirmed as an adolescent in this body. But that was the level of height that I could reach. That was my glass ceiling as a kid and as a young adult. And it helped shape for me what weâll talk about at some point Brittany, and that is the intersection that I walk in. So once I got the critical analysis around women being excluded and Iâm participating my own marginalization as a woman and when I started questioning my sexual identity, the issue of queemess and same gender loving people being involved in a Visible way in the church wasnât Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. even on the table at all. So I found myself participating in a process that used a racial lens to elevate black ministers who were men to positions of more hierarchy and authority and the pay that came along with that. And then that meant I had to make myself small as a woman and as a queer person and focus on making sure that black men were tall. So that helped me shape quite early on as a young person the intersections that we talk about now, the transformations organizing that we talk about now that I didnât have language for then but shaped how I wanted to walk in the world. And the way that I wanted to do that was not to cordon off a part of myself and be a part of any movements that lifted up a single issue while the rest of me, the wholeness of me had to take a back seat. So thatâs how I framed both my intellectual curiosity, my critical thinking, my intersectional organizing lens and my ability to work to bring my whole self into the work that I do no matter what that work was. So in summary I grew up in a Christian poor and working class African American community, segregated from the rest of the maj ority population in a mill town that was extremely paternalistic with siblings who and an extended family that absolutely adored me and let me know that I was pretty and smart, and not just pretty and not just smart, but pretty and smart and capable and had the opportunity as a teenager to get involved in coalitional politics and cut my teeth before I was eighteen in that environment that allowed me to understand that as I work for justice, I am also working for my own freedom and that I am not to be excluded from the work that I do. And that in order to be authentic and whole, I need to bring my whole self to this particular work. And so I was always the one talking about gender equity, not just racial equity or inclusion for queer people or making sure that if young people were involved that it wasnât adultism that kept them from leadership positions under the premise that youth are our future. But I grew up an environment where I was afforded the opportunity to be a youth leader Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. now not when I got in my twenties or thirties. So that helped shape my own world View around transformation and intersectional work, which is why Iâm so thrilled to be a part of the Pauli Murray project because of the intersections and because of the legacy that the Reverend Doctor Pauli Murray leaves for us as someone who also ended up of course being an Episcopal priest as a same gender loving woman, we know biracial but of course considered of color and the legacy of working for peace and for justice. BD: So it seems like you went to a church that was very supporting of patriarchal systems. CL: Thatâs correct. BD: But what role did religion play in your own household? CL: Well, my dad was more of a drinker than a prayer. And in my own household we were all members of a choir from the angelic choirs as a kid all the way to the adult or chancellor choir. We were involved in all the pageantry of Christmas and Easter. We were involved in Sunday school. I grew up with my grandfather, my paternal grandfatherâ-his name was Hezekiahâ-being the superintendent of Sunday schools. So I participated in vacation bible schools every summer in June when school was out. So in my own household we often hear the phrase everything I needed to know I learned in kindergarten, from the famous book. Well the golden rules that I learned in my own household around how you treat people like you want to be treated. And to seek first to understand and then to be understood. In my own household it was pretty Christian. But it was with a mom who in another time and era wouldâve been considered a feminist and who fought for womenâs suffrage within the church and eventually became Vice president of the congregation that I was in and who led by example who was an aVid reader who probably read every book in our local library and was on a first name basis with our local Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. librarian who probably had the job from the time she got out of college until she retired. Miss Settlemyre was her name. And so in my own environment it was a day to day way of life. We said our grace before we had meals. We said our prayers before we went to bed. And we tried to walk in very good and stalwart ways. We tried to tell the truth (fast), and as a kid you donât get caught lying, and my mom raised us with if you come to me with the truth, then any consequences for screwing up, if you own it and take responsibility for it then the consequences wonât be as great if you get caught in a lie. So those values and principles that come out of some Christian tenets around honesty and thrift and all of those was way of life. So I didnât know any different because thatâs what the whole neighborhood demographic was. The denomination changed but we hopped, like kids hop from camp now, from camp to camp during the summers. We hopped from vacation bible school to vacation bible school, and it was staggered by the different churches. So we could spend the first month of summer a week of vacation bible school here regardless of denomination and so on and so forth with all the kids in the neighborhood. The other thing is we lived near a high school that we couldnât go to. And we had to walk much further to the segregated high school, George Washington Carver High School. And but the fields that the athletic fields that A.L. Brown High School, that was the white school we used it as our playground. And so the tem1is balls that got hit over the tem1is fence or the softballs that got left in the field or got over in the kudzu that was drop off to our community, we foraged for all those things and played kickball and baseball and softball and made our own go carts and were outdoor kids. This was long before the Xbox and the technology that we have today. So my environment was one where we were encouraged to be outdoors. And you had rules about when it got to be dark, when to come home. And my mom had this rule if she ever Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. came to the door and called us and she had a sing-song way she called us she started from the oldest down to the youngest that we could all imitate when we got separated from one of our siblings that they were trying to shake us. We could come to the house and call out all the siblings names and my mom had this rule when you heard that you came rumIing. So we used it to our advantage. When my sister would start courting at thirteen and fourteen and didnât want me around, and they would trick us and shake us. I'd go home and call out the little sing-song, all my siblings and everybody would come rumIing. And then I'd be stuck like glue from then on. So it was that [close knit] childhood, and I didnât know the poverty that we lived in until I got into I'd say middle school when I saw the differences. And when I got into high school that was integrated when I saw the differences of kids getting a car when they turned sixteen with a big bow, and it was like what in the world. Those kinds of things, so it was all comparative. But we had all that we needed and wanted and because my father was industrious and loved to hunt and gather and fish. And we gathered all kinds of berries and nuts, and my father dried fish, and my grandmother made her own soap and carmed foods from the garden. Things that I go to a farmerâs market now and pay top dollar for. I wish I had learned that skill although I have all the Foxfire books and things that tell you how to can and how to store and how to do all that. I wish I had paid more attention of course. We all say that in retrospect. As a young girl tending the fire or bringing more wood as my grandmother was boiling the big pot and sticking the green beans down in there or canning the blackberries and all the things that she did. And she made her own wine as well. BD: Thatâs amazing. My mom is into that stuff too. CL: Yeah, cool. Some things I can do but some things I leave it to older relatives and go to the farmerâs market. Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. BD: I feel you on that. CL: I often tell people that it feels like irrespective of the politics that I lived a pretty charmed life because I was the baby girl with two older brothers and two younger brothers who were extremely protective. And we might have fought with each other, but the rest of the community couldnât fight with us because we rallied. It was six of us so we werenât like an only child or two kids. We were our own little gang. We were our own little gang pretty much, and all of us were very athletic and always involved in extra curricular activities in school. So I learned to play basketball at a very early age because our segregated high school, George Washington Carver that I mentioned, did a summer program where they opened up the gym and you could come and you could play basketball or do all kinds of arts and crafts. And there was this one system where you had a couple balls and everybody was on the court, and you had to fend for yourself. So every time I would finally get a ball and I start dribbling some kid would take it away from me. And I was determined, dagnabbit, that I was not going to continue to be dissed like that. My little self esteem was really struggling. So I practiced and practiced and worked really hard and ended up being a star athlete and going to college on a basketball scholarship. And that was my only belief that I would go to college once by my junior year the coaches had made sure, and my parents made sure I got out of the track, the general track course to college prep course and was able to go to college. But that was because of my athletic prowess. And it so happened that I was honored with deanâs list and whoâs who and those kinds of things because weâve read a lot growing up. My mom read to us. She read a lot and thereâs this whole body of knowledge around reading that is literally fundamental that helped shape my love of English and my understanding of how to conjugate a verb and use it in all of its tenses and Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. ways that you learn through reading before you even get into a classroom that you absorb. Youâre inculcated with that formal writing, reading that you do and thatâs been done to you as a kid. So that was part of my love of language and stories, and I traveled all over the world before I was six and never left the house. Pippi Longstocking, that was me. I donât know if you know who Pippi Longstockingâ BD: Yes I do. CL: Well, you know Pippi Longstocking, that I wanted to be Pippi Longstocking for sure. So that was me. BD: So at least for part of the time when you were in school the ciVil rights movement was going on. Do you have any memories of like the desegregation process? CL: All I can remember for the most part are vague tensions around the schools integrating and what I was hearing from the adults how the white high school for a couple of years beyond the integration laws still had the power to keep integration from happening. I donât have a conscious memory of that. Itâs all in retrospect by looking back and now hearing and reading some of that particular history. As kids we were shielded from that. And it wasnât until I was an adult working as an organizer with a group called Piedmont Peace Project, an organization that is now defunct but an organization that was about the peace movement but looking at kitchen table issues water and sewer and really looking at the federal budget thatâs spent on military and what could be going to schools and buses and teachers and all that thing. It wasnât until I started working with some of those women who were a part of the organization and on the board of the organization that I started hearing the stories of what was happening in my own local community around the ciVil rights movement. BD: How old were you when you first started becoming involved with that organization? Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. CL: It was in 1989. So thatâs all Iâm going to say. [Laughing] BD: Thatâs fine. CL: Itâs now 2014, and I got started as a volunteer and this was long before the Motor Voter bill, and the Motor Voter bill basically made voter registrationâall that stuffâs been turned back now--but had made voter registration easier for people. What we had to do then and I was a part of the Democratic caucus, the black caucus that was the arm of the black, of the Democratic Party in our particular area. But you had to be sworn in by the board of elections to do voter registrations, and they called them voter registration commissioners. And so I was one of those persons because of my involvement in the community and because of my own familyâs political involvement and activism. You inherit generation to generation of credibility. And so I started working as a volunteer, and this organization that was maybe three or four years old at the time saw me being involved in that, and I got recruited to become an organizer. And let me tell you, I didnât know there was such thing as a paid organizer. I'd been doing activism organizing as I said through the racial equity work for men and in my church setting, and it was something that you did to make change happen. So now I am a part of what we call the nonprofit industrial complex that we donât have time for me to deconstruct and talk a lot about, but a lot of work is stymied in the movement because weâre too busy fundraising and playing politics and donât really have a lot of time to be on the ground. But thatâs neither here nor there. So the story that I want to share about that is there was a woman on the board whose name is Estelle Wylie who ironically is being funeralized today, and I wasnât able to go to that funeral. It was originally Saturday, and I found out last night it had been changed to today, and I had all these things to do including this interview. Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. BD: Iâm so sorry. CL: Iâm going home for the holidays. So Iâll get to pay my respects and go to the gravesite and be with family and friends. She was in her nineties and a rock of the community, someone who we all made sure that she was able to go to the ï¬rst Obama inauguration. BD: Wow. CL: Itâs a long story. I wish I had time to share that. But Miss Estelle worked at a dry cleaners, and during the ciVil rights movement she said that one of the Klan groups, the Ku KluX Klan groups brought in their robes and cone hats all to be dry cleaned and that she refused to dry clean them. BD: What time period was this? CL: This wouldâve been in the [19]60s. This wouldâve been early [19]60s. BD: In North Carolina. CL: In Karmapolis, North Carolina. The Klan brought in their uniforms to be dry cleaned and in this Laundromat it was mostly African American women. This was long before the change in demographics in the community with lots of immigrants and immigrating from other places. Like right now itâs been replaced a lot with Latino, undocumented labor thatâs being exploited. But then it was mostly African American women, and then all the supervisors were white of course. So Miss Estelle organized the whole, all the women so no one would do that. So they couldnât fire everybody. So the concept of someone who is for all intents and purposes grew up as a domestic worker working in a laundry taking a stand and organizing all the other women to take a stand along with her so that no one can be retaliated against--. One of those acts of resistance that you wonât read when you Google the ciVil rights movement and all the names come up and all the stories come up. Itâs one of those stories that you wonât ever hear about Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. because those kinds of things, those individual day to day acts of resistance that havenât made it into the annals of the ciVil rights history were happening in the community. So people were, according to my mom, resisting going to the back door to buy things in the different restaurants downtown. And then at the height of the sit in movement thatâs when all this was happening locally. It was never a real organized it was people taking a stand. BD: Were there Violent repercussions because of that? CL: No, there werenât. The only Violent repercussions that have happened in Karmapolis ironically was not in the ciVil rights movement. It may have been in Cabarrus County individual things around misogynation when black men who were in relationships with white women and then the white woman got caught and hollered rape, and then thereâs an individual named Rom1ie Long whoâs in jail, has been for the past twenty-five years in a situation like that that came from the [19]70s. But it was more Violence around the 1934 general textile strike because this is an anti-union town, and it wasnât until the mill was threatened not to receive federal grants or federal contracts for the textiles that it made that it opened up the mill for black workers. It was under duress that that literally happened. But as far as there were always gatekeepers in the black community who were ministers or who were teachers or who were the buffer zone. There were younger people who wouldâve wanted to be more active in the ciVil rights movement around the sit ins and stuff, but the gatekeepers would definitely prevented that from happening. So no there wasnât Violence, but the owner Charles Carmon of Cannon Mills during the general textile strike was friends with the governor and was able to get the National Guard to come into the town to prevent union organizers and walk outs from happening. And there were lots of beatings and Violence around that. So there was more Violence around anti-union work historically in my community than Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. there was knowledgeable about ciVil rights. Thereâs a film done by Judy Helfen and George somebody out of UNC who is an emeritus professor there called The General Strike of [19]34 [The Uprising of â34 by George C. Stoney, Judith Helfand and Suzarme Rostock] that documents that southern story. And it wasnât until they started working on that that I learned that history, and I was, letâs say, still working at Piedmont Peace Project after 1990, and this happened in 1934, and it was very hush hush and people still wouldnât talk about it in the white community. BD: Do you know if any of your family members who worked in the mills were involved in that? CL: I donât know, in the general textile strike, no because there werenâtâthere were of course always a few black men who were able to do the dirtiest jobs in the mill like open the big bales of cotton. But for the most part masses of black people did not work in the mill at that time, at all. It wasnât possible at all. So no, there were no one in my family who, there were family members who were a part of subsequent fights to get the mill unionized, my mom being one of them, uncles, aunties. So from probably the [19] 70s on there were every few, every decade there was some union trying to organize into a union shop. And it didnât happen until the [19]80s with Unite Here. And shortly after that well, the mill was sold and too much information. BD: Yeah. No, thatâs fine. CL: No, I realized I was getting ready to go into some detail thatâs neither here nor there for this particular interview. I come from a history of troublemakers you might say. Troublemakers in the sense that you fight for whatâs right and you fight for justice and you do that not with Violence, but you do that in organized ways that protect the community. And so another example would be someone wanting to fight for a pay raise in a small hosiery mill where everyone gets organized to do a petition and sign that so that they canât fire the whole shift. They Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. canât fire everybody. So from organizing principles that I was able to watch growing up and even into a young adulthood on how you made a stand and how you tried to protect yourself. Now suffice it to say there were lots of retaliation during union fights and a lot of people were fired and eventually fought to get their jobs reinstated through the legal process, the labor rights process. But yeah, there was some retaliation but only around economics but not around, to my knowledge, Violence except for when it came to black men having relationships with white women. BD: Okay. I want to go back a little bit. Since you grew up in a household where Christianity was really important and at the time being queer in a lot of places was dangerous, when did you first realize that you were queer and how did you navigate that? CL: Well, I didnât have language for feeling different as a kid, and that I was socialized and under a lot of peer pressure to date guys in junior high. Ironically my first two boyfriends ended up being queer as adults. BD: Wow. CL: I donât know what thatâs about. Thatâs a whole ânother story. Yeah, exactly. My third grade boyfriend and my seventh grade boyfriend are all in same gender loving relationships with men. BD: Thatâs funny. CL: It is funny. It is a study of its own. What do you see in each other when you are young thatâs of like mindedness that you find solace and protection. I didnât realize. I might have been a senior in high school, and I realized that there was this nagging attraction that I had to other women, but I suppressed it and ran away and ended up getting pregnant my senior year of high school. I have a son and three grandkids. Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. BD: Wow. CL: Amazing family that it had to happen that way. It was supposed to. But I bought into the rhetoric that the way to cure lesbianism is to find the right guy, and I didnât want to be, we called it funny growing up. And there was this little sign that people did, sheâs furmy. BD: Yeah, I've seen people do that still. CL: Yeah, exactly. So I didnât want to be funny, and more importantly I had been raised under the rubric of Christianity that I had internalized that to be gay was an abomination and that not only was I going to die, but I was going to die and go to hell. So the ï¬rst time I realized that if I were to name myself in any way as same gender loving that I was in trouble. Existentially I was in trouble. So though on some gut instinctual level when the option to be married once I was pregnant was presented to me by his family and my family, I automatically knew that thatâs not something I wanted to do. And as great as my father was, my father was an alcoholic, and there were times he was MIA. There were times when he was extremely Violent. And so my opinion of marriage as the model that I was able to see was, I didnât want any part of it. As great as my mom was, she had made myself small so my dad could be tall, big. And it wasnât an institution that I had any interest in whatsoever, even to this day. I understand the gay marriage issue and I will march and fight for the right for people to get married, and I understand the legalities behind all of that. But itâs not something I ever would want to do as an institution at all. But back to the question at hand, it wasnât until my freshman year of college. Well, let me back up. So I grew up in this nuclear family but a great extended family as well. When my son was one month old, my grandfather died, Hezekiah who I spoke about earlier, died. And a tradition of our family you go to the house where the death is and youâre there until after the funeral or whatever. And so my son and I went to my grandmotherâs house, and my grandmother Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. was my champion. Long story short, she said I want you andâmy sonâs name is MarcusâI want you and Marcus toâMarcus Reshad. We call him Reshad. I was getting ready to say his nickname, but they grow up and they want to be something different. But I want you and Reshad, Marcus, to come live with me. I want you, youâve lost your scholarship to Fayetteville State University. No, Elizabeth City State University. youâve lost your scholarship because you got pregnant because at that particular time you had to come out of high school. This is 1970- something. BD: And you still played basketball in college, right. CL: I did. Still had a basketball scholarship, yeah exactly. But I didnât get a chance to play my senior year but by my junior year already had my grant in aid scholarship to attend Elizabeth City University. It was a college at the time. My grandmother said, âI want you to move in with me. You and your mom are having some issues,â because what I wanted to frame earlier was my mom had chosen not to go to college. So she had put all her hopes and her dreams in one of our kids going to college. Iwas the first of my siblings to go to college. And my other brothers had gone into the military. My sister got married blah, blah, blah, blah. My grandmother said, âLook, itâs not the worst thing in the world to have a kid at your age. Youâre eighteen. I want you to go back, finish high school. I want you to go to college. And Iâm going to help you raise your son.â And so when my grandmother freed me up to realize that all was not lost. And my shame that I was carrying around, all of that, when she soothed all that away, it was at the same time that Ibroke off the relationship with Reshadâs father whose name is Bill and decided that okay, Iâm going to explore this thing. It wasnât like linear thinking. It was something that evolved. So Iwas a little older because I had to go back to school. So most kids when they get into school, theyâre eighteen, nineteen. So Iâm nineteen, almost twenty. Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. And then I get on campus, and itâs a whole ânother world. So I started exploring, and thereâs an open secret in the African American community that you keep. You donât do anything to embarrass the community. Like you donât get caught butt naked on a ï¬oat in a parade on CNN. There are things you donât do. And itâs open secret. We know youâre funny, and we know you know youâre funny, but you donât say nothing about it. I wonât say nothing about it, and weâre going to love you anyway. I mean thatâs prolific in the African American community. So the reality though, Brittany, is for me learning all what I had tried to frame earlier about the intersections and being holistic and authentic, I still lived my life very openly. My partnerâs helped raise my son as I was in relationships as he was growing up. Family reunion I brought my girlfriends home. Events for family I showed up with them. But we didnât talk about it. And so for me that invisibility began to gnaw at me in a real depressing way. And so as true with many of us who grow up in small rural communities, Christian, come to terms with our sexual identity, substance abuse happens. And so I was trying to drink away, smoke away the feelings of shame and guilt and the image in your mind where youâre going to be abandoned and rejected by your family if you donât play along with this secret of silence, the open secret around being silent. And then ultimately I started doing therapeutic work, look at some post-traumatic stress stuff from watching fights in my own family where my dad would binge and come home and raise hell. And that whole experience left a real dark mark on me, but once I decided to do therapeutic help I had to do some anger stuff. I was angry, and I was ashamed, and I had internalized the homophobia that I had learned. Like we internalize the race issues or the gender issues, the whole less than, the whole matrix of domination stuff. So I started doing therapy and I started doing some Virginia Satir work, who is a therapist, but Elizabeth Cooper Ross was this amazing woman who did a lot of work on death, dying and transition. And death and dying is not Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. literally always, but the death of an innocence or the death of a way of thinking in life or the loss and transition that one has to make and was fortunate to have some serious intensive work in group therapy with that process and had a chance to meet Elizabeth Cooper Ross. And then my therapist basically said, âyour issue is coming out. Youâve got to come out. And letâs do this in waves.â BD: And how, Iâm sorry, how old were you when you started going to the therapy sessions? CL: Oh I would say that I was in my thirties. BD: Okay so that long. CL: Yeah. That long. So because I really literally thought I could live my life and to hell with, Iâm going to live my life. Iâm going to show up like I am. But what I didnât know was how that gnaws at you from the inside around feeling like a fraud, not being authentic, not being whole and holistic. And so I started this process quite frankly of, the therapist met with my parents, well with my mom. And long story short I started, I literally started with my grandmother who basically said to me, âBrittany, is that why youâve been shut up in your room and not going to church,â and she held me. She said, âYou have a right to the tree of life. Youâre not sharing anything with us that we donât already know.â And I said, âWell, Grandma, if you already knew why didnât someone say something?â She looked right in my eye and said, âWeâve been waiting on you.â Same with my siblings, same with my mom, same with my dad. Same with the board, I was out with the staff but not the board, the organization that I was. What I began to struggle with though being out was, I didnât get abandoned by my family. I got abandoned by the other folk who were in the closet who by association with me as an out woman, queer woman now by default meant that they were queer also. So that was the most Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. painful piece of losing my circle of friends who we could get together in clandestine ways. But they didnât want to have a public presence with me because they werenât ready for the process that I had been to. So it was a long struggle. It was a long struggle and a long time coming. Did I answer most of your question? BD: Yeah. Yeah. That was really good. CL: Yeah. It was painful, quite painful. BD: Iâm about to start crying. CL: Well, I donât cry anymore, I've told it so many times. But if you water up, Iâm going to water up. Yeah, my son and his friends they were, all his little friends, I mean, these were the same kids I taught to play basketball. Same boys I taught to play basketball and they were like sixteen and seventeen before they could beat me in a one on one game. I mean it was like beating me in a one on one game for my son who was sixteen before he could do that and his friends was like wim1ing some super bowl and going to Disneyland, Disneyworld. I mean they made a big to do out of it, like celebratory. BD: So you were really good. CL: I was very good. I pre-dated the WNBA and if had the WNBA been a franchise coming out of college, I wouldâve been first round all American. I mean itâs true. BD: Iknow. CL: Iâm not even going to even get caught up in the boasting or the bragging. Iâm stating the facts. BD: Yeah. CL: Without a doubt. I worked hard. I worked hard on that. I mean, my whole history of athleticism from junior high to college was I either captained or co-captained every year of my Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. squads all the way through, and I didnât play my senior year of course. But yeah, I had game. Now the old mare ainât what she used to be. I canât take a charge, but I can still pull up and shoot a three-pointer or--. BD: Jump shot. CL: For sure, without a doubt. But I had a debilitating illness now, rheumatoid arthritis. And so it prevents me from being as active. Thatâs why when I was teasing you when I was reading that and I was like uh, sound mind and uh, the body partâs not so great anymore. BD: Yeah. CL: Yeah, exactly. For sure. So did I answer what you needed from that? BD: Yeah, that was perfect. I've barely been using this actually. CL: Well, I've tried to frame my story so that you can go back and from this tape and look at your questions and see how I've answered. I've tried to weave my story not in a linear way but to talk about how I have arrived at being a feminist and someone who always advocates for an intersectional analysis and whoâs always lifting up and fighting for the rights of women and queer people in addition to looking at issues of class and race. So I canât give a pecking order. Itâs not a hierarchy of those. Itâs a fusion in my own way of walking through the world. And so if I had to choose right now an oppression, how much time? BD: I think that I actually need to put this on the charger. CL: Okay. BD: Okay. Itâs still going. Okay so my next question that I wanted to ask you about. It seems like you had a lot of feminist ideas at a very young age, but didnât have the language to express it that way. When did you actually realize and identify yourself as a feminist? Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. CL: It wouldâve been certainly in college. And it started because even going to a historically black college that was majority women, the athletic programs were very different. The menâs program had all the money. They had several different uniforms. Theyâve got all kinds of shoes. They got sandwiches and juice after practice. They went away to away games in a really cool bus and got to ï¬y places, and for the womenâs program I tease and say it was the original uniforms from the late 1800s when the school was founded. The reality is I had an advisor who took me under her wing and told me about Title IX and the gender equity fight. And I was able to organize not just the womenâs sports programs but also other women and men on campus to really fight for gender equity in the program. And it was through that process that I realized that I was becoming a feminist. Not because I was reading about it but because I was doing things that were lifting up the equality of women in an equitable way. I would say by my sophomore year of college, and that wouldâve been in 1977 that I began to see the language, and then in my womenâs feminine studies once I got language for a lot of the things I was already experiencing. And then I went for a while battling between the feminist movement that was single issue and not really concerned about race and class, just gender, of following the movement of black women like Alyce Walker who were coining a language around womanist that resonated, and now I reclaim feminist for sure. It was a while before I knew thatâs what I was. But certainly I call myself a feminist today. BD: Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about your career aspirations, your goals that you had for your career while you were still a young adult and also your work history? CL: Okay sure. Well, believe it or not I had career aspirations to be in law enforcement. BD: I saw that on your resume. Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. CL: And it didnât take me long to become uninspired by that debacle. And then I wanted to be an educator for sure, which is what led me to Highlander this whole concept around participatory learning and popular education and participatory research and culture as a Viable lens for doing community education. And the history, I donât know how much you know about the Highlander Center and the history that comes out ofâ BD: I know theyâve done a lot of grassroots programs and ciVil rights. CL: Right, exactly. So and a great legacy that theyâre still standing on. Highlander still gets the royalties from the song âWe Shall Overcome.â Any time thatâs used in any movie or film or documentary or whatever it is, they get a royalty, and they have a fund called the We Shall Overcome Fund that they give money out to community groups doing culture work. So thatâs an amazing program that from that legacy of a lot of that ciVil rights work. But your question though is about my career path and what I aspire to be. And certainly I wanted to be policewoman or detective, all that. I found that fascinating. BD: And what changed that from you wanting to be in law enforcement to community organizing because I saw on your resume that you got your law certificate I think it was. CL: Basic Law Enforcement Certificate. BD: Yeah. And then you went to community organizing. So what caused that shift? CL: So what caused the shift quite frankly was being a company police officer for Carmon Mills, the same place I was telling you about, being in management, being a sergeant and literally having as a job description to prevent union organizing. And to be in those strategy sessions that squashed the right of employees to vote for a union. And all the tactics and things that management had to do to discourage the employees from voting for the union, all the tactics that as the police officer for this company, which means I was a company police officer, that I Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. had to do that didnât feel good. To when we had all these cameras all over the plant and had a control room and if I get a call, there was somebody leaï¬eting in the parking lot. It would be union organizers putting their ï¬iers and stuff on cars. My job was to run them off and to keep them off. My job was not a good feeling job when it came to that. The other thing that I got a chance to see was we had great relationships with the Karmapolis city police because when they had a warrant for someone, we had to escort them to that department or bring that person out to them. So they hung around our control room, and I went to rookie school with several of the officers. And so certain nights, like Friday night, Saturday night, the guys who were on patrol would come by the control room, have some coffee, eat with us, and they would be waiting on the clubs to let out. And then they were going to go set up so they could try to get as many DUIs as they could. And so it felt like are you serious. Are you serious? And then I realized, okay this does not fit with my own principles and values. And so then I left that and became a private investigator. I thought okay. I could take, because Iwas doing lots of investigations and lots of stings, buying drugs and whatever. It was a huge plant. I could go to another area and they wouldnât know I was Sergeant Leeper, and I could be a chameleon and get lots of information. Iâm invisible. Basically I was invisible as a woman and as a black person. And I could get information a lot of other people couldnât get because I was telephone pole. You see me and you donât. But anyway, then Ibecame a private investigator and what I discovered Brittany was, it is Brittany right? BD: Yes. CL: Okay. All my cases, so Ibecame licensed in South Carolina and a provisional licensee in North Carolina. Itâs two different processes to become fully licensed in both different states, different requirements. And so what I found out, I was working for a firm called Salin and Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. Associates based out of Coral Gables, Florida, but we had an office in Charlotte. And I was going all over North and South Carolina doing cases, and it hit me at some point because Iâm always doing critical thinking was all my cases are people of color. And all my cases involve workers comp, somebody who a 10 g fell on them from the logging truck or an accident, some woman fell getting off an Amtrak train and so or an accident that someone had, and they had listed their quality of life and how it had diminished, and they were waiting on a settlement. Insurance companies were hiring my company to try to find some dirt on these folk with the assumption that because they were people of color they were lying. So it took me about a year and a half to put all of that together. Iâm like okay, all right. Okay, this sucks. Okay, this is not the Magnum PI thing I saw growing up. This is not cool. This is not happening to me. And so having to do surveillance and look at peopleâs records in the Clerk of Court around any liens that they might have, like thereâs an assumption that youâre lying. And trying to find things that would prevent someone from getting a fuller settlement. That was my job. And so this is what I know about being an African American woman needing to make her way out of no way. And that is this. IfI had an accident in my knee and Iâm incapacitated in any way, and itâs three oâclock, in the morning and my grandmotherâs sick and she calls me and she says, âIâm scared I need to go to the hospital and you need to call an ambulance,â whatever. Iâm on it. Iâm hobbling. I forget my cane. I've been asleep. I didnât put my collar on, whatever. Itâs an emergency, and Iâm going because thatâs Grandma. So what I know about the African American community is you rise to the occasion. You sacrifice yourself in a selï¬ess way. And so what would happen then if Iâm doing surveillance on me when I do that and I catch me without my collar or without my cane or driving when I said, I canât shift or whatever, then that means it doesnât matter why Iâm doing it, what matters is you are construed as having lied. So you donât Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. get, so you may get penance on what you wouldâve ordinarily gotten. So when I realized that you canât look at paper and tell someoneâs story, and that my job was to screw well deserving people out of compensation to pay for a lifetime of suffering that could happen from a particular injury I was like oh no. So about the same time though I started doing volunteer work in the community, and I was also concerned because my son was getting to the age where he could manipulate my grandmother. I've done my homework, whatever. And I was traveling so much, and I was like okay, okay. This children think because Iâm not here heâs, oh no. So it was a perfect storm of needing to have more hands on. Itâs Grandma. Grandma called him lamb chops. He could get away with anything. Lamb chops, Lamb chops. So I needed to be more based out of home. Couple that with oh no, I left this job because it didnât match up with my principles and values. Now here I am working to further marginalize a population of people who, yes thereâs fraud. But it ainât, it wasnât these people who were doing it. It was other people, other demographics who was doing it that we were all paying for on our insurance policies, to compensate for that. So bottom line was I was already doing some volunteer work in the community on the voter registration and was still doing activist work. I was still involved, at some point went back to church and stayed involved in the coalition. And then realized that I needed a job that lined up with my values and principles and working for a nonprofit on justice issues met that criteria. So I got recruited to be an organizer and then I have been in that ever since. Now I've had different kinds of jobs in the nonprofit sector. But always working with justice based organizations, not service based organizations. I've always asked the question, âWhy are the babies drowning?â or âWhy is there no food?â or âWhy versus a band aid approach to giving the service and not looking at how do you prevent the need Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. for the service.â So thatâs how I got there from, by accident, from not wanting to do the corporate thing. The other thing is I started locking in 1990, which I was like a second person, the only person living in the county locking at the time. Now youâve got to remember this is 1990 now. And I got more ï¬ak from African American women on the board because I was going to perm my hair, and I was into wearing more authentic African clothing, and they wouldnât to putâwhat do you call it when you get a certain clothes that you canât wear. BD: Dress code. CL: They wanted to put a dress code around African attire, and I had one brother of a member of the board who basically came to me as I was locking to say, âCom1ie, you are a pretty girl. Will you please straighten your hair?â I had to say to him, âJoe, I donât tell you how to wear your hair. And you canât tell me how to wear my hair. You donât have to like it. You donât have to like it but you canât ask me to go backwards.â And then I said, âThis is part spiritual growth for me. This is part accepting my own standard of beauty and rejecting the blond haired blue eyed standard of beauty. And Iâm happy to talk more about my own process of getting my hair straightened and by the time you get to the front then the backâs already because itâs thick and course. I mean how I can no longer get in the water. I canât swim. I canât move because Iâm going to sweat my hair out and then the perm, the burns in my hair. The scabs, no! Iâm not doing it anymore.â And who knows what I ingested through my scalp from the chemicals that I was putting in my hair or how it could have contributed in toxic ways to my RA. I donât know. All I know is when I started locking, it was a scandal in small town Karmapolis, North Carolina. But saying that to say that nonetheless though it fit my value system for fighting for justice. And then when I left PPP, Piedmont Peace Project, I went to Highlander because I had always worked in my hometown. So I wanted to knowâokay, so Iâm grown nowâhow will I do Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. outside the state in an area where I donât have all the safe houses. If something happens, I canât stop or somebodyâs going to pick me up. Girl, I've got somebody to tow your car. Donât call no Triple A. What you mean calling Triple A, that whole thing. BD: And Highlander is in Tennessee. CL: It is in New Market, Tennessee right outside of Knoxville in a small farm, well, I guess you want to say small. I donât know. Lots of acres. And so I worked there for a couple of years and a half, and I was trotting all over the South doing popular education and adult literacy work and a lot of the tradition. And then I realized my grandmother died and then my father died, and it was the first time I had experienced a family death of someone so close from far away. I'd always been rooted in community. So getting three days off and going back and then the grief that happens when youâre not with your people. It was unmanageable. It was unmanageable. So I was going home every weekend I wasnât working and ï¬ying up and down the road from Tennessee to Karmapolis, North Carolina. And then I realized that I wanted to work in North Carolina. Iâm a Tarheel. BD: I go to UNC. CL: Iâm a Tarheel, right. Iâm a Tarheel. I need to be back in North Carolina. This is where I want to work and I had opportunities. I've traveled abroad a lot through all of my jobs. I've had opportunities to work in other states, and I choose to stay in North Carolina totally. I will retire in North Carolina for sure. So that was my path. One of thinking I wanted to do one thing in a very male hierarchical line of work, doing that, and then to have integrity in my work I had to do what my job description was, what I accepted the paycheck to do. And then that wasnât feeling good. Now I didnât really lose a lot of sleep over it. Just quandaried, just inquired, just this doesnât feel right. Then do something about it. And thinking that okay, Iâll go do the PI Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. work, and then oh and then stumbling into organizing as a paid professional from work in the community. BD: And can you tell me also a little bit about your work with NC WARN? CL: Sure. BD: Promotes clean energy and climate change. CL: So I was working with the Southeastern Regional Economic Justice Network, and I got laid off in January of 2011. But in April of 2010 I had gone to this conference called Whole Communities with an outfit out of Vermont who was be gimIing to really look at whatâs happening in conservation movements where it was mostly white and middle class and upper middle class, single issue. They cared more about the polar bears and owls than people. And working and then looking at in order to have whole communities how do we bring the social justice, social change arena into the environmental justice or the environmental justice into the environment and merge those two. So I had done that, and it was done amazingly well. And I had plarmed to see that I wanted to work on the environment, and I wanted to dispel the notion that people of color donât care about the environment that weâre too busy trying to eke out a living that we donât have time to care about climate or environment or whatever. When indeed, thatâs not true. So that was already in the back of my mind. And then I had peers and colleagues who knew about NC WARN, and a particular colleague who I had known since my early days in organizer who worked at another organization who was now at NC WARN. Three people sent me that job description. It was a perfect storm. By the time I go the third one I was saying okay, the universe is saying pay attention. So I called Pete MacDowell who was the person I mentioned. And I said, âIâm thinking about applying for Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. this job,â blah blah blah. He says, âI've been looking for you. I want you to apply.â So I started working as an organizer with NC WARN that April of 2011. Iâm still there now, and my work is about several different things. But the most important thing is NC WARN has a theory of change that basically says that when youâre working on an issue like mitigating climate change and trying to get Duke Energy to change its business model from fossil fuel plants to more renewable energy and that would include wind and solar and something else thatâs called co-generation. But itâs combined heat and power and you use the leftover energy from that to do more renewable energy. And energy efficiency and conservation. And to do that by targeting, the theory of change is if you want to mitigate climate change and if you want, you go after the biggest boy in town. And Duke Energy is the largest electric utility now in the world since they merged with Progress Energy. They have a business model, because they are a regulated monopoly, that allows them to get up to an eleven percent return on any investment that they make. So itâs in their advantage to build more fossil fuel plants where thereâs coal or gas. Itâs in their advantage to try to build more nuclear plants, and itâs not in their advantage as the bottom line to try to harness the sun or wind because they canât make a proï¬t like they can from that. And so my job is to get people to reduce their demand for electricity so that we donât have to have so many power plants built. The justice piece to that has to do with not everybody can afford renewable energy. So and then energy justice isnât the lens that people are looking at or impacted by climate change. The food we eat and how far it has to be trucked in and how nutritious it is. The transportation, our greenhouse gas footprint, the carbon that we use. The health disparities, the asthma all the things that happen from the power plants. So looking at jobs, greenjobs. Looking at how to impact communities particularly front line communities that are ï¬rst and most impacted, when Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. Katrina happened, when storms happen, when weather disasters happen, there are some of us who have another house some place else. There are some of us who can get out. There are some of us who have the insurance and savings and portfolios so we can bounce back very quickly. And then there are some of us who not only get impacted ï¬rst but get impacted the most because of racial disparities, class disparities. So my work at NC WARN is to work with frontline communities on the justice lens and connect climate to the impact to their communities around needing jobs or health or housing or food. And to do that by working to yes reduce our demand on fossil fuels but also to take on the greens, the bigger greens who are single issue focused on energy and not the other impacts of climate for the most part. So I do a lot of training. We have a signature workshop called Our Energy Future where weâre looking at energy production in North Carolina and connecting with that environmental justice issues. So NC WARN started out doing a lot of fighting landfills and waste incinerators and toxic dioxins in an environmental justice way. And in the past ten years have been looking at more closely the planetary crisis weâre in because of climate change and trying to do a lot of education and awareness around resilience. Like so how do we adapt, and how do we become more resilient, and resilience isnât, âHow do you bounce back to the same BS that youâre in?â Resilience is moving, is bouncing forward in less oppressive systems. So a lot of racial equity work, a lot of getting people to come out and speak at rate hike hearings, not being advocated for but speaking for themselves. But not just about the pocketbook issue. The pocketbook issue, the cost for people is very important, but we care about it not because our bills go up. We care about it because our planet is going to hell in a hand basket and we want to make sure that the health disparities that happen to people living around coal plants. This coal ash piece, weâre dead slap in the middle of the coal ash fight because some groups are fighting for moving the coal ash to Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. landï¬lls, and we know historically where these landfills are. And so weâre fighting for a solution that addresses where the coal ash is, the transportation to where it goes and where it lands so that no one has to bear the burden of accepting that in ways that being the poorer communities across race and communities of color regardless of class get stuck with having to breathe that and eat that and leak into the water. So in summary Iâm doing climate justice work. SP: And are there ways that you see the work that you do with NC WARN align with the work that the Pauli Murray proj ect does? And what led you to start working with the Pauli Murray project? CL: Well, it had nothing to do with NC WARN. The Pauli Murray project certainly is about the intersections of who we are and how we walk in the world and using the story and the legacy of Pauli Murray who was many things as a biracial woman who ultimately became an Episcopal priest and did that despite her gender and despite her sexual identity and her own ciVil rights work and her own justice work. So the parallels have to do with fighting for justice across the intersections where itâs not an either or, or a zero sum, but itâs a both. And so I didnât know. I had Proud Shoes before I moved to Durham. But I didnât know I was supposed to have read it. Someone gave it to me. An older woman gave me two books. One was an autobiography of Lillian Smith who was a white woman who was a lesbian in the South. The [19]40s, [19]50s, [19]60s who was fighting for ciVil rights and marginalized because of her queemess. Amazing story. If you ever get a chance to ever run across Lillian Smith I'd say you should check her out. And then it was someone who was accidentally mentoring me and I didnât know thatâs what they were doing. But and they gave me Proud Shoes by Pauli Murray, and it sat on my shelf. And it wasnât until I started seeing these murals around that it and then reading something and coming, I came to something at the library or somewhere that the Pauli Murray project had done and got Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. to know Pauli and some, I mean Barbara and some of the folk from being at things. And part of it was being a part of the Friends of the Library, the humanity council and the things that were being done through that arena. And then somewhere I did something about same gender loving that got used on the website because I described myself in one of those events as same gender loving. And Barbara liked it and she adopted that language. It turned out that was the firestorm for the Pauli Murray family who had a Visceral reaction. They said you probably know the story about that. SP: Yes. CL: Okay. All right. So then we needed to have some conversations, and Sterling Freeman who has been in the leadership of the Pauli Murray project and works for a group called Open Source Leadership and myself were recruited to design and have this conversation with the family and the Pauli Murray project. And then moving forward I said I'd rather be a part of the program and not be a consultant for that. And then joined the leadership team through that process. So thatâs how I got here. SP: And I my final question to you is how does Pauli Murray inspire you? CL: Well, for the most part I've been a nomad in Christianity for a long time. And getting involved and understanding the Pauli Murray who she was as a Christian and not rejecting that Christianity. For me I took the parts that served me and the parts that didnât I dumped them back. But what it has done it has had me reexamine that as a career woman back to what my grandmother said I have a right to the tree of life. As a career woman I can integrate my Christian faith thatâs been on the back burner some place and that I've been participating in perfunctory ways, funerals, weddings, baptisms, confirmations, high holidays in the church, Easter, Christmas, that I donât have to throw away all that I am and learn to be in my family of Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. origin. So it has helped me reconcile that the literal translation of the Bible, fuck it. That if Pauli can reconcile then I can reconcile. If Pauli can be loving a woman and doing her fight for justice and ciVil rights and still worship, I can too. I can too. If Pauli can leave a legacy of bridging the intersections and contradictions and the complexities of her life for me growing up in a biracial family having biracial grandchildren, trying to embrace culturally being a southemer, all of that with who I am the race, the class, the gender, the sexual identity, the region and be healthy and whole, Iâm there. Iâm there. So thatâs what it means for me is how do you embody who you are and how you walk in the world and you do that in more than culturally appropriate ways or ways that a particular historical era dictates for you. And then more importantly though in retrospect itâs a story that I needed to know about, and I was actually going to come to Saint Titus last Tuesdayâ SP: It was this Tuesday. CL: This past Tuesday, right, I was going to come to that but the history of drags was at the library. I donât know if you knew the library was doing the history of drag. And Iâm trying to work on some of my thinking and language around transgender female to male and what I see as the disappearance of butch women or the making butch women invisible and the misogyny in what I see as male privilege in addition to sexual reassignment. Those issues aside thereâs stuff that we canât talk about in the transgender movement around the misogyny that Iâm witnessing from young females to males who disdain all things women and all things female that is irrespective of gender reassignment or being in the right body. Thereâs a male privilege that is being experienced that means that us butches got to make ourselves small so the M to F5 or Fs to Ms, I always get them twisted up, can feel not just nondiscriminated against. I donât want discrimination for any particular group, but Iâm having to find some language on that whole Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. body of work, and I wanted to look at this whole history of drag both drag queens and drag kings. And it turned out to be mostly about drag queens. So I shouldâve went to the Pauli Murray thing because I thought it was going to be a little deeper than what it was. So I didnât want to go to church that night. I wanted to go to the library. Yeah. SP: Itotally get it. CL: Exactly. Exactly. SP: Well, is there anything else that you feel like people never ask you thatâs really important to your story that you would like to add? CL: Yeah. SP: Anything at all? CL: People never ask me itâs more like what you do but how do you be? I would like to talk about the things I do that sustain me, that keep me walking forward even when society and this current legislature with the Amendment One that passed. Iâm a gourd artist and Iâm a percussionist and I love music and without those things I donât want to live. And so the beauty of my being able to when Iâm physically able to drum, djembe and conga, all kind of hand percussion. But more importantly I used to grow gourds and I do gourd art so I carve and I paint and I sculpt, and I do all kinds of things with gourds both for beauty and for utilitarian purposes. And I gift and I thrift. So I repurpose and reuse and Iâm always trying to find how to repurpose something. So my second home are thrift stores because Iâm always looking for that one painting that people donât realize itâs very important. Romare Bearden collage that was in somebodyâs basement, and they moved and donated everything. Treasure hunting I guess one could say. I get a big thrill out of that, but more importantly the thrift of repurposing in a consumer culture really Interview number U-1056 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill. matters to me although my partner has put a moratorium on me bringing anything else from the thrift store until I go on Craigslist or eBay and sell some of the things I've gotten for resale. But yeah, so what makes me tick are the things that I like to do including reading that sustains me when Iâm feeling down or the hell with it. Iâm going to be a greeter at Wal-Mart. Yeah. Gourd work helps me to see that thereâs something I can finish in my lifetime. Social justice, social change work we often talk about generations to come will benefit from that particular work. And what has happened in North Carolina in the turn back against the voting rights and all this, the rejection of the Medicaid expansion and unemployment, everything the things weâve fought for are being overturned with the Tea Party or Republican legislature. Even the Democrats are turning it back so itâs not to me in a partisan way. But I have to do things if I write some music for the drum is something I can finish in my lifetime, and I can play it and play it over and over and over and teach it to other people. And so itâs my legacy, the things that I create will be here long after Iâm gone when the justice that Iâm fighting for will be overturned at the political whim of any legislature or Supreme Court for that matter. So thatâs it. SP: Thank you. CL: Youâre welcome...
