 ERIN WEST: Today is June 30th, 2014. This is Erin West with the Southern Oral History Program interviewing Senseney Marshall for the Moxie project. So would you just like to start speaking about your childhood and any experiences you think were important? SENSENEY MARSHALL: Sure. I think the fact that I grew up near Washington, DC in a suburb of Bethesda, Maryland probably helped involve me in politics or made me very aware of it. My parents talked about politics or argued about politics. I went to public middle school that was right across from my street, and that was very nice. And then for high school I went to a girls&#8217; private school in DC. So I think growing up near the capital and being aware of in some way politics and what was happening had an influence on me that was something that I would follow and be interested and involved in some way the rest of my life. EW: Absolutely, did you have any awareness when you were a very young child, when did that begin? SM: Awareness? EW: Political awareness, activism? SM: I think only in the fact that politics was important for my parents, and I would hear them discuss it. They would read the news, there were two newspapers in Washington, DC at that time, the Washington Post and the Herald. And they both had different views. They would argue about that, and they would talk about politics. My grandfather was involved in politics also. So I would see them go to charities, raising money, and they would go to inaugurations and things like that. So it was always important I wasn&#8217;t involved but I was watching and listening as a child. I remember getting stuck in a snow storm when John Kennedy was going to his inauguration and knowing that his inauguration was near, and I was in the snowstorm and they were on the TV. We watched the TV and it was all part of my life. It wasn&#8217;t anything I ignored or would want to ignore, but as I've gotten older I've realized that some people live in different parts of the country. They don&#8217;t care or they&#8217;re not tuned in to national politics. So but that wasn&#8217;t my experience. EW: How did the television and media inform you? SM: I&#8217;m not sure. I know that we would watch news, and when I grew up not everybody had TVs. And you got a TV and then it was like the whole family was glued to it. Or you weren&#8217;t allowed to watch it, but you went down to a friend&#8217;s house next door or down the street and would watch it there. And when the assassination happened I was in high school. We were sent home. This was John Kennedy&#8217;s assassination. And everybody was in shock and we watched, it seemed that we watched TV for days. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s really true. But we did watch a lot. And I watched opinion shows. My parents did too. I remember Walter Cronkite and I remember Face the Nation and political shows. We would just--, something we watched. I don&#8217;t watch those shows that much these days but I do watch some. EW: Did that--? Hmm. SM: I was going to say I like MSNBC, but I kind of feel like we&#8217;ve gotten so political and everything&#8217;s spun and, you&#8217;re not getting information. You&#8217;re getting viewpoints, and whether they agree with you or not you sometimes feel like it&#8217;s filtered too much, even though you&#8217;re choosing the filter you hear your news through. Now and then I'd like to get just straight news and be able to think and figure out what how I feel about it. I already know what my prejudices are. So I feel doubt about that. EW: Do you feel that the TV then wasn&#8217;t as pointed in their opinions, it was more fact based? SM: I do. I feel like they were telling you what was happening, and I do feel like it wasn&#8217;t as emotionally charged or spun or filtered and that you didn&#8217;t just get viewpoints. There were shows where it was clear it was as viewpoint of this person or that and they were talking about opinions and analysis. But I felt like there were TV shows where they were just giving information, not telling you how to think about it. EW: That&#8217;s interesting [whispered]. So you mentioned you went to a girls&#8217; high school. SM: Yeah. EW: How did that shape your ideas? SM: Well, it was a private school and it was a hard school. You had to pass tests to get in it. Let&#8217;s see, the number of students in my class was something like sixty. It was small, but they had students from around the world, and they had a boarding school. I wasn&#8217;t in the boarding school, but they had the girls from different parts of the country. So all that was interesting. I think it was serious study; it was challenging; they pushed you. And I really liked it. And they taught you--, somehow they taught you to be independent thinkers, and they pushed you in a way that taught. Somehow you learned to be strong or felt you were strong by the way they made you work. So it was a very good experience. It was tough, but it was a good experience. EW: Is that where you started your activism? SM: No, I don&#8217;t think so. I think I was more concentrating on homework and getting things done and meeting deadlines. I had studied violin in elementary school, but I dropped it because there wasn&#8217;t time to do it plus the homework. So I wasn&#8217;t active then. I was aware, and again it was in Washington, DC, and at home I was hearing a lot about what was going on in politics. But I wasn&#8217;t active or even thinking about being active. EW: Oh, how did that form later? SM: I think it was after college. I was in college while Vietnam was going on. So the campus I was on was divided about it, whether we should be in the war or not be in the war. So I paid attention to that somewhat. But I wasn&#8217;t involved. I was just more an observer and listener. I didn&#8217;t do anything one way or the other. I&#8217;m not sure I made up my mind, and there was a lot going on in civil rights, and I saw that in Washington, DC. I saw it when I came home, I think I was still in the Washington, DC area. If I wasn&#8217;t, I came to Washington DC because my grandparents lived there. And I saw the police on the corners with guns, and I was hearing about the buildings burned down in Washington and nearby. And I knew about the riots, and I knew about Martin Luther King, and I think I was still just somebody who was watching it happen and not thinking that I should be part of it or how would I be a part of it--, maybe I still just thought of myself as a child that was in the background watching and not knowing. And thinking it was scary, and I wasn&#8217;t sure what to think. Washington, DC was very segregated. There were northeast and southeast, that&#8217;s where black families lived. And then northwest and northeast white families lived. And you would see each other and you shop together and you would ride the busses and all that together, but you went your separate ways. So it was segregated and it still is to a degree. But in that era I worked for the federal government, and it is very wide open. So I had black coworkers; I had black supervisors. So then it was no big deal. I had black friends and I traveled with them. And when I got close to them, some of them would tell me what it was like to be a black person and they raised my sensitivity. I thought I knew stuff, but conversations with them made me much more aware of what living in our society meant to them. I was active by 1983. But I&#8217;m not sure before then. I was in a conscience raising group in Washington that one of my friends found through the Washington Post. I think NOW started it. And they were bringing women together and they gave them questions to answer. So when we met and I can&#8217;t even remember where we met, probably some public space. We met; we had our list of questions. I went with a roommate. I was in a group house near Georgetown, and Kathleen and I went to it, and then we met three or four other women. So we went through the script and we talked about what we should be doing. We wanted to rotate to each other&#8217;s houses and they gave scripts. So I think that helped a little bit but really very quickly turned to a social group. And we would sometimes, we did discuss the things like, &#8220;How does your boss treat you?&#8221; and especially if it was a male boss. &#8220;What was your relationship with your father? How do you see yourself as a woman in the workforce? Do you think you&#8217;re discriminated against?&#8221; and stuff like that. So we did talk about that. But as the group evolved it was more about our boyfriends and families and other things. We got very close because originally we didn&#8217;t know each other, and we shared our history and who we were and how we felt. We were all in relationships and were coming--. I think one woman was married. The rest of us were out there going through good boyfriends and bad boyfriends and used each other as a support group and were very close. So that was very neat. I don&#8217;t know how I got active. I think I decided I should be doing some volunteer work. Or I wanted to do some and I chose the abortion issue because to me it was just so black and white. I didn&#8217;t see any nuances to it. I had been in college with women who didn&#8217;t come back because they had an unwanted pregnancy and they didn&#8217;t come back to school. I'd missed my period and I was lucky enough not to have an abortion. But I knew what that meant. And my mother would tell me stories. My mother was very good. She said, &#8220;If you ever get pregnant, come home. We&#8217;ll take care of you; we&#8217;ll take care of the baby.&#8221; She was very good. But she would tell about friends of hers who weren&#8217;t so good to their daughters or things that happened that shouldn&#8217;t have happened. And you heard stories about botched abortions and all that. So anyway, somehow I found this Virginia organization, Keep Abortion Legal, and just volunteered. They would have volunteers come in sometimes stuffing envelopes; sometimes it was calling people asking for money. One thing I did remember is we decided we were marching on the Supreme Court&#8217;s tenth anniversary of Roe versus Wade which is in January. January in Washington is miserable. It&#8217;s cold. It&#8217;s dark. We used real candle lights. I think I was the one who got the permit. We got a permit to march across from the Supreme Court, and we either did candles or flashlights with paper around them to make them look like it. And I don&#8217;t think it got too many people. I don&#8217;t&#8212;but of course [some of the?] wonders why we thought nighttime celebration or protest was the right thing. Nighttime in January downtown Washington. But we did and we had thirty to fifty people walking around a circle. And I&#8217;m sure we did some chants and stuff. But anyway, since then or as the years passed, I've always wanted celebrations that are indoors, or somehow I don&#8217;t know how much attention we got. That&#8217;s the thing when you do those things you want them to be on the front page of the Post or something else, but you can&#8217;t ever control that. But those were some of the things I remember doing with vocal, but a lot of it was doing the mailing, doing the phone banking, not sure. I don&#8217;t know if we did letters to Congress representatives or what. The other thing that I always did was, I was a Democrat from early on. And I do remember voting for the first time. I was eighteen. At that point I was living near Middleburg, Virginia. And it was a very small building, and I had grown up in a city or a suburb, and I couldn&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re all, I think it might have been in a church. To me that was just such a strange experience. I hadn&#8217;t expected I was used to people standing in line and being in a school building or something like that. But it all worked and that was fine. It was just, got more of an awareness when you moved out of Washington things happened differently in the countryside in different places. So I did start--, not campaigning but volunteering again at Democrats, at people running. In northern Virginia where I lived there were mostly Democrats. So we almost always won. So that was kind of nice. A lot of times I remember being in campaign sites on Halloween because Halloween was right around the corner from the first Tuesday in November. And I always had a lot of candy and it was always very--. In northern Virginia people were very active. I mean it was just a noisy room filled with phones and a lot of people and you were just calling people to urge them to vote, offering them a ride. It was before early voting so you weren&#8217;t telling them. They didn&#8217;t have too many choices of when they voted. So that was exciting. It was fun. EW: So going back to your mom, it sounds like she was very supportive. Did that play a role in your education and thinking that, &#8220;Okay, feminism is something that seems important to me that is available to me?&#8221; SM: She is a strong woman, and my friends when I was older, I was in my twenties or something, and would later call her the admiral. So I was raised by a woman who ran her household, ran her husband, and I guess I was always encouraged, I was encouraged to have a career. And my private school encouraged--, I mean it was women. A lot of our teachers were women. The headmistress was a woman. I saw a lot of strong women around me growing up. So feminism did come naturally. It wasn&#8217;t something I ever questioned. So it seems at this vantage point I never questioned. I don&#8217;t think I ever did. And when I was in the government there were a lot of women there, and the field I was in there were women in it. So I didn&#8217;t have a problem there. The harassment we all talked about and we all knew about it and it did happen. I was lucky I was never harassed seriously. But if you were, we were traveling on the job and people drank too much so things happened. But my saying no always worked. So that was good. I didn&#8217;t have any awful experiences. So yeah, somehow feminism just was the way it should be, and I was just being articulated at that time and the pill changed a lot of things. I was lucky the time I came along that I think things weren&#8217;t that hard for me. I was lucky I had a college education. My first job didn&#8217;t work out, but I lived with my grandmother. I only had car payments and she had a cook so it was very nice. Then I eventually did find a government job that trained me in information technology and computers, which was an up and coming field. So I was lucky. Some of my friends probably influenced me more than I realized. I found a group house in near Georgetown in Washington, DC. And the woman who interviewed me, she interviewed me like it was a sorority or something. But we had two other women in the house. One was a phantom because she always stayed with her boyfriend but her parents had a phone number to call and it was our house. And another one was an ex-nun and then there was Kathy [O&#8217;Meara?] who was a very strong woman from Ohio, very smart. And I think it was strongly influenced by her and her politics and her [feminism], and so I think I absorbed that from some of the women around me. And it helped me and influenced my thinking and helped me realize what issues--, I think sometimes you have to be, it has to be pointed out to you when you&#8217;re being manipulated. You don&#8217;t always see it. And so I think they helped me and I can be truthful about this. I went through a mild depression so I worked with a psychiatrist and part of my issues were with my family and boyfriends and things like that. And he made me see things to know when I was being manipulated or was fooling myself or I wasn&#8217;t standing to be assertive--, that I wasn&#8217;t standing up for myself. So I think the combination of the strong women friends, the psychiatrist who was very good, and the politics or the era I was living in, helped me be the woman I became. EW: Interesting. So were you seeing positive displays of feminism around you or were there negative connotations around it? SM: I think it was a mix. I do remember something that was pretty negative, but I remember thinking, I can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s telling me this. I was being interviewed for a promotion and it was very good. But there were other people being interviewed. And a guy said to me, you&#8217;re single and he has a family to support. And I can&#8217;t remember whether I got the promotion or he got the promotion, but I could not believe this was civil service. This was the federal government. You weren&#8217;t supposed make decisions but he was saying it out loud. This person has a family and you&#8217;re single. And he was sort of saying I made, I can&#8217;t remember how it worked out, but I got my promotions along the way, but this, that was one really blatant thing I remember hearing. Other than that I did pretty well. So and career wise, and so I&#8217;m not, if you gave me more specifics or something maybe I could, it would trigger something. That&#8217;s what I remember. EW: Maybe seeing Gloria Steinem or Betty Friedan, were they on TV? SM: What&#8217;s that? EW: Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, did you see them on TV or did you hear them speak? SM: I don&#8217;t remember seeing them much. I think I saw them at marches but that was later. I met Gloria Steinem. She came here. She did a fundraiser for this NARAL chapter and that was exciting. And since I was a volunteer I was working the event, and so someone in the audience wanted to meet her. And this woman felt like she couldn't just walk up to her. So she sort of grabbed me and said, &#8220;Can you introduce me to her?&#8221; And I did. So that was kind of neat. So I also shook her hand. It was great to be with, see her in person and talk to her. I'd read articles and I'd seen her in magazines. And I think she just turned eighty or something. So but she was dynamic and she was very down to earth, but she really talked to the audience as if we were all in conversation in the living room. So that was pretty neat. So that&#8217;s one memory for her. EW: I found that that&#8217;s very common when very well-known speakers in this movement just make you feel right at home, like you&#8217;re just talking to someone you&#8217;ve known forever. Have you found that? SM: Yeah. I haven&#8217;t had that many experiences, but Cecile Richards, from saying her name right. She came down for Planned Parenthood within the last month, and since I volunteer there, I was lucky to be invited to this luncheon. And she talked to the group. Well, she&#8217;s of course very concerned about the upcoming election. She was in North Carolina to help Kay Hagan. But she talked about politics in general, the issues of our day, and what&#8217;s going on and Congress and things like that. She was incredible. Of course I know she was Ann Richards&#8217;s daughter, the governor of Texas. So I know some of the stories. And I've seen her on TV. I've seen her on the Rachel Maddow show and some other shows. And she was great at that luncheon. And she just, I don&#8217;t know. She was taking notes of what we were saying, which I thought was very interesting. I mean I thought it was flattering that she thought what we were trying to give her some feedback and talking about upcoming election and what issues and how we could reach out to people and stuff. And she was taking notes. And I thought that was great. EW: Have you found most of your activism, your involvement has been in the political sphere? SM: It&#8217;s been both. I've always worked for a pro-choice group, and when I moved, I found NARAL and I started working with them. And then when politics, election years and sometimes the primary years, I would get involved for that period of time doing phone bank. And sometimes your pro-choice groups would set up phone banks. They have their rules. They have to be careful. I guess, I don&#8217;t think they get involved in primaries. But anyway seems to me NARAL did set up some phone banks for some people and I would help work those. And sometimes I would--, like in North Carolina Elaine Marshall was running for Senate against Burr a few years ago. Of course we all wanted her and we wanted her to get in. So I worked specifically for her campaign. And then when Barack Obama was working, I would go downtown and work at his headquarters mostly phone banking. And so I usually would pick who I would work for. But if NARAL, and then Planned Parenthood did phone banking and got, was get out the vote phone banking, I would work with them. And then there&#8217;s another group that I actually was their administrator, part-time administrator--, can&#8217;t call them a political group. They&#8217;re nonprofit. They&#8217;re an umbrella group and they would set up phone banks and I would help them. That was Blueprint North Carolina. Have you heard of them? EW: Um hmm. SM: They&#8217;re very neat. So I would say year round I try as much as possible to work for my pro-choice groups because reproductive rights and the access to abortions and access to birth control right now is way under attack. We just had a Supreme Court ruling, Hobby Lobby, today that&#8217;s just incredible. So I&#8217;m definitely going to keep that up because it&#8217;s so critical, and I mean just think it&#8217;s awful how women&#8217;s rights and their autonomy is being chipped at in every way especially in states that have Republican legislatures. But now the Supreme Court has come out just this week with two decisions that are very detrimental and have long lasting effects. So that&#8217;s how I see using my time. EW: Did you anticipate that the climate would continue to be so hostile or would maybe even increase any time soon? SM: No, I never did. Long time ago, and I mean a long time ago, probably in the [19]80s when this woman said, &#8220;This is going to be a long battle.&#8221; I had no idea what she meant. I had no idea that twenty, thirty almost more years than that, and I never thought it would keep getting hostile. I kind of felt like the more educated people are and the young people--. On the gay issue, that has really swung and we&#8217;re now, that&#8217;s getting more and more positive. But on the abortion issue it&#8217;s not. I guess part of me believes, and I don&#8217;t know this, but it&#8217;s very determined minority that is making everything negative for everybody else. And that when they do the surveys most women and men who support women believe abortion should be safe and legal. And then but I also think a lot of people, and I think a lot of young people think, it&#8217;s always, ever since I&#8217;ve been born it&#8217;s been safe and legal. What&#8217;s the big deal or that there&#8217;s no problem out there and there are a lot of people, at that age of your life, you don&#8217;t get involved because there are too many other things. You&#8217;re starting your career, your families, too many other things going on in your life. And it&#8217;s something that doesn&#8217;t pull at your shirt sleeve. And I think they&#8217;re completely unaware how dangerous that the way they&#8217;re chipping away and how that someday it might affect them. So I think it&#8217;s very scary. And I&#8217;m really shocked. I sometimes hope that maybe the pendulum is about the swing the other way, but I don&#8217;t know that. I think because abortion is a religious issue for a lot of people they --I know from phone banking there are some people that&#8217;s the only issue, they&#8217;re a one-issue person-- and if the person is for abortion they won&#8217;t vote for them. If they&#8217;re against abortion and that&#8217;s their litmus test and that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t know what you do about that people. And I also realize we don&#8217;t--, a lot of people don&#8217;t even vote. So the low percentage of voters and I wish our country would change that. There are other countries in the world where people are either rewarded or maybe --I don&#8217;t know that they get-- they&#8217;re required. There&#8217;s some requirement that they&#8217;re supposed to vote. So they get more than fifty percent. We never get near fifty percent of voting. So I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to change. I really don&#8217;t know what will change things. I&#8217;m just hoping that the different pro-choice groups can educate people and wake them up. I think it&#8217;s a wake up that&#8217;s needed. And I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen to make people wake up because it&#8217;s, I think there are more than&#8212;I don&#8217;t know my numbers, but I think there are more than twenty-six states that have really restrictive abortion laws, and I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to change that. ( ) where it really matters where you live and that&#8217;s true for education and health and abortion rights. And I really think there should be national laws. Well, we have a national law. It&#8217;s supposed to be safe and legal, but there are, I guess you know the Western Abortion Clinic has just been shut down because of the laws the North Carolina legislature passed. So I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s very bad. EW: Femcare. SM: Huh? EW: Femcare. SM: Yeah. EW: In the western part of the state. SM: Yeah. Yeah. EW: So you say that you&#8217;re not really sure what that wakeup call will be. Do you think part of that part of the reason that it&#8217;s not so real is because people my age, people of my generation [and] I guess a little older than me, haven&#8217;t experienced--, they don&#8217;t have the memory of a friend going and getting a botched abortion and never coming back? SM: I think that is a large part of it. I mean they have movies out. They are movies people don&#8217;t always see about and one was in a foreign country. But yeah, I think they have their birth control. They probably most of them don&#8217;t know--, or if they know someone who had an abortion, she had an abortion and everything was fine. So I think they&#8217;re unaware of these legislative acts that will curtail it and it doesn&#8217;t affect them. And so I think that is a large part. Their consciousness in this area is not raised. They&#8217;re not threatened and they don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s happening. I mean most of us don&#8217;t pay attention to politics and legislation. I mean this last bill was, that was attached that was going to affect the clinics, abortion clinics, was attached to a motorcycle bill. It&#8217;s just kind of outrageous. But yeah, I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on. But I think the groups, I know NARAL-North Carolina is trying to reach out to younger people, but they have, I mean when I was their age, you have so many other things pulling you in other direction. I think it&#8217;s very understandable you wouldn&#8217;t get involved. You&#8217;re trying to find jobs in an economy that&#8217;s not friendly. So that&#8217;s rough. There&#8217;s another thing we used to say but this was before it was legal. It was legal in certain states before it was finally nationwide was, rich women or well off women have no problem. They can fly to another country if they want to. Or they can fly here or there. It&#8217;s your single moms; it&#8217;s your poor women; it&#8217;s people who don&#8217;t have a lot of resources. They&#8217;re the ones that hurt. And then when they put obstacles--. I mean I just hate the twenty-four hour rule and think about it. It&#8217;s exactly like some of our buttons and bumper stickers say, respect women. It&#8217;s no respect to tell a woman, &#8220;Oh I really think you need to spend another twenty-four hours thinking about this decision.&#8221; Like she hasn&#8217;t been thinking about, that hasn&#8217;t been weighing on her. She hasn&#8217;t discussed it with people close to her. And you&#8217;re telling her, &#8216;Think about it twenty-four more hours. Spend a night, spend your money on a hotel here because you&#8217;ve had to travel six to eight hours to get here and the doctor won&#8217;t see you until the next morning. Why don&#8217;t you spend another twenty-four hours and think about it?&#8221; Just so outrageous. It&#8217;s just so disrespectful and to me, and to I&#8217;m sure a lot of people, you&#8217;re treating her like a child, like she doesn't know her mind, that she needs guidance in this area and it&#8217;s outrageous. So I don&#8217;t know what will change it. EW: So has that been part of your work with NARAL consciousness raising? SM: I do whatever they need me to do. When I walk in whatever they want me to do. I update databases. I don&#8217;t make phone calls that much but I do sometimes. But I get they do, I haven&#8217;t been involved in where they go to events and sign up people, and they go to public events, musical events, gay pride events all sorts and they have their table and they do tabling. I have done tabling but not recently. And they get the names and that. Well, I&#8217;m the one who keys it in and tries to read their writing and gets updates and emails addresses and stuff like that. And then I&#8217;ll sometimes update the donor database and stuff like that. But I do what they want to do and, but I have in the past been involved with some interesting things. Plan B, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of Plan B. Well, Plan B became legal and anyone eighteen, I think eighteen or over, I guess I don&#8217;t--. I&#8217;m not positive of my facts. But we wanted to know which pharmacies carried it and which ones knew the rules. So a bunch of us, and it was through NARAL sat at a table for cell phones. We had a list of pharmacies and called and asked the pharmacist, &#8220;Can we get Plan B?&#8221; Over the phone they don&#8217;t know. I could be getting it for my daughter or my niece or something like that. Anyway we did a survey and we found out which ones totally ignorant, which didn&#8217;t carry it, which refused to carry it because they were family owned private pharmacies. And we were able after we got all our numbers and everything and statistics--. It was Amy Woodall who worked for NARAL put pressure on a large chain, and they changed their policy because we gave them the results of our survey. And they, being a business they should be, the customers want it and it&#8217;s legal. So that was pretty neat. So we&#8217;ve done things like that now and then. So it&#8217;s not always just data entry but a whole lot of times it is. EW: Do you find that data entry is fulfilling in its own way? SM: I think anything I do for this cause is fulfilling. I&#8217;m just really glad because that&#8217;s adding to the people. They have, what is it CAN, Choice Action Network. So I&#8217;m adding it to the Choice Action Network database, and it&#8217;s a database they share with national, and then so when they send those emails out, they&#8217;ve got more people send it to. So yeah, I always tell them I don&#8217;t care want you give me to do. It&#8217;s fine with me. And sometimes they&#8217;ll apologize, oh this is boring we&#8217;re having you stuff envelopes. I say it&#8217;s fine. My mind can be all over the place and I can usually get the job done. So it doesn&#8217;t matter. EW: [whispers something] What kind of support have you had or not support&#8212;friends, family partners? Have they supported you in your activism? SM: Yes, definitely. My husband takes care of things when I go out for the evening or the afternoon. I mean we both do chores, but he is supportive if I&#8217;m going to spend a day or a half a day away or right now we&#8217;re in the middle of packing and he&#8217;d rather have me home packing. But he respects my need to do this and that also I was saying good bye to people today. So he&#8217;s been very supportive. I can&#8217;t usually get him to come out and be on the line with me. He did--, we were living in Alabama. We went over to Florida to campaign for Obama. So he&#8217;ll do the political stuff now and then, but otherwise he&#8217;s just my back up. He&#8217;ll take care of the dogs. He&#8217;ll do this. He won&#8217;t give me grief for not being there to do all my chores. So he&#8217;s very supportive and he definitely is pro-choice. He shakes his head at it. I mean and we both, politically we both agree and thinks it&#8217;s crazy. EW: Absolutely. I want to go back to your professional life, your work with the government. What were you doing? SM: I was a programmer. I was a data programmer. I was trained to be a programmer, and I think I worked on the CDC machines. But I did coding, and later I did some analysis and I wrote the requirements for the programmers, and I was, I did, I was involved with electronic filing project for IRS. I was involved with the pilot program with that. So that was kind of exciting. And in my last job at IRS was, I started out on mainframes and I ended up doing programming on PCs. So that was kind of exciting. It&#8217;s a good job. It was a very good job. I traveled with it and had made good money. That was fun too. EW: How has your travel been? SM: Excuse me? EW: Have you traveled to any, involving your activism involved in work or fun? SM: Not really. No. I mean no, I would go downtown Washington. I was in the suburbs. I have, yeah, I travel from Alabama to Washington to be in the women&#8217;s march, and I can&#8217;t remember what year. But a whole bunch of us did and we met in DC. But most of the time I've not traveled. I&#8217;m hoping when I&#8217;m back in DC to do more of the marches. But that&#8217;ll be easy. I live there. EW: What was that march like, the women&#8217;s march? SM: It was wonderful. It was --since I lived in DC and my friends and I would go down for the NOW marches or the pro-choice marches-- this one seemed a lot bigger. I mean we were really wall to--. I mean you were pushing yourself. We were staying together and we knew how to catch up later if we got separated, but it was--, we were on the mall. I forget where we marched to and then you always end up back on the mall and then, or a lot of times you have your speakers. It was wall to wall. It just seemed larger than any other march I had been in. It was very exciting. It was good to see that, see all the women out and all the numbers. It was nice. I wish I could remember who the speakers were that day but I can&#8217;t. Susan Sarandon was one of them. I&#8217;m sure, I do remember her. So that was neat. EW: Have there been any speakers that have really stood out and affected you personally? SM: I can&#8217;t think of any one. I always love what they say. I love how articulate they are. It&#8217;s fun to see them raise the crowd or get the crowd motivated. I mean a lot of us who work on it week to week hope that some of these people will end up volunteering the following week. I've always had mixed feelings about that. I feel like some people go to these marches and these demonstrations and then they go home and think, &#8220;Well I did my part.&#8221; Unless they sit down and at that point write a letter to their congressman or go online. Now it&#8217;s easy. You do online; you do an email or you go to their website. I always feel like I like the publicity that I get because I do think it&#8217;s important. I do think it wakes up some other people to read about, well, &#8220;Why are these people protesting? Maybe something important is going on that I should pay attention.&#8221; And I like to think that they go home and say well, I&#8217;m going to write a check to that group or I&#8217;m going to write my congressman or something. But I always worry that a lot of them go home and say, &#8220;Oh I did something today.&#8221; In my book they did something, but they didn&#8217;t do that much. If they spent two hours there, it would&#8217;ve been better off spending two hours writing letters to the editors or to their congressman or something like that. I love it when some of our congresswomen come out. Unfortunately I can&#8217;t remember her name. It was a recent rally. I was in Washington, DC. It was up near the Supreme Court. And it wasn&#8217;t a big turn out and I was unhappy to see that. But a political woman came and she was in Congress, and I can&#8217;t remember her name. But she was so articulate and she was so good. She was just a strong speaker. And I had a lot of respect that she was there and that she spoke so well. I admire people who can. We see a lot of trite stuff and same phrases over and over. She was just very good and strong, passionate. That&#8217;s what I felt from her: passion. EW: Yeah. What are some examples of the stuff you&#8217;ve heard over and over? I&#8217;m interested to see if that&#8217;s changed. SM: It&#8217;s our chance, our bodies, our lives, our choice. And that&#8217;s all true. It&#8217;s just when someone speaks to you, you want them to make it personal or tell you what she told you what was at stake now, what the political climate was, what was happening now. She made it very to the point and very current. And she was very serious. I love some of our sayings and our chants. But there is a right time and a wrong time. It&#8217;s when someone&#8217;s speaking to me, I don&#8217;t ever want to hear every vote counts. We all know that. Stuff like that--, I can&#8217;t think of real examples but yeah. EW: Have you found in your time doing the phone banks that people are very resistant when you use phrases like that? SM: When I&#8217;m calling about a pro-choice candidate or something, most of the time they&#8217;ve chosen people already on our side. But every now and then I do get someone who hangs up or says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re calling me,&#8221; and some people are really rude. But most of the time I think it&#8217;s the phone banks they choose because they want you to spend time on people--. They have a way of filtering the data of the phone calls and people you&#8217;re calling to pick people who vote often or don&#8217;t vote but are with us on this issue. So most of the time it&#8217;s a good experience. And now and then you get someone who says, &#8220;Oh thank you&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m with you and I&#8217;m out and blah blah blah.&#8221; So that&#8217;s always good. You learn to not take it personal what&#8217;s happening on the other end of the phone. It&#8217;s always possible you&#8217;re going to get a nutcase. EW: Has that happened? SM: Well, you get someone who wants--, yeah. You get people who are crazy, or --I guess I&#8217;m not very charitable-- anyone who doesn&#8217;t believe like I do. But they&#8217;ll either tell you their opinion or they want to change your opinion. You don&#8217;t want to spend time. You&#8217;re not there to spend time. And then it&#8217;s sort of sad. Now and then you get someone who&#8217;s just lonely and wants to talk. So you kind of recognize that. But you get ones who are crazy. EW: When did you start doing the phone banking? SM: I would say probably the eighties, political phone banking? EW: Yeah. SM: Definitely the [19]80s. Maybe earlier. Yeah. EW: Was that one of the first ways you entered the sphere of volunteering? SM: I&#8217;m not sure whether I got involved with vocal or politics first. I&#8217;m not really sure. Yeah. I've always cared about politics and always followed it and knew about it. But I&#8217;m not sure when I started with vocal or whether which one came first. EW: Okay, let&#8217;s see. Is there anything else you feel like you need to share, anything about current events or something that happened in your life that we haven&#8217;t gotten to? SM: Can&#8217;t really think of anything. I&#8217;m kind of amazed at our Supreme Court and our politicians. I can&#8217;t really think--. EW: Oh, I do want to ask. So the Supreme Court now compared to the Supreme Court when Roe v Wade was passed, what is the culture that is, how is that different or can you remember? SM: I can&#8217;t remember. I've read about them; I&#8217;m not that good of a student of what it was like when Roe versus Wade was passed. One of the things I've read was those Supreme Court justices part of their rationale was privacy act and stuff like that. But the other thing is they knew the statistics. They knew how many American women were dying in back alley abortions. They knew how unsafe it was. And they knew the numbers and they knew how scary it was. And I think their attitude, or some of their attitude--, I&#8217;m sure they did it based on legal privacy making personal decisions. But part of it was [that] women are going to have abortions one way or the other. Why would you want to keep them from having safe ones and legal ones? And I do agree: &#8220;safe but rare.&#8221; But you have to back that up with sex education in the schools, contraception, birth control is easy. You don&#8217;t pass a rule that says that your insurance won&#8217;t cover birth control. And it&#8217;s always amazing. I&#8217;m sure you know. Most people know it. Same people who don&#8217;t want a woman to have an abortion don&#8217;t want sex taught in high school or anywhere. So that&#8217;s kind of amazing. This Supreme Court, yeah, I guess we all know. We knew when Justice--is it Salino [Scalia]; is that how you say his name? We knew when he was elected that was bad and was going to be bad. I don&#8217;t think we knew how bad. I&#8217;m just hoping somebody retires and Obama can appoint someone else. Yeah, it&#8217;s a very rigid court. The only thing I can say good is they did let the Affordable Care Act; they didn&#8217;t try to stop it through a Supreme Court decision. I can&#8217;t remember the details, but thank God he didn&#8217;t try to stop it. But yeah, it&#8217;s kind of amazing. And they&#8217;re in there for life; so that&#8217;s kind of scary. It&#8217;s very scary. I&#8217;m hoping, I guess, yeah, I don&#8217;t know what the strategy is. I guess you have to work at the state level because the state controls a lot. And we have to work at the federal level, and I guess we have to work with a combination. EW: So you mentioned sex ed. And you went to a private school so I guess that&#8217;s a little different. But I was wondering what your experience was when you were young if you even got sex ed. SM: Yeah, I did. And I got in public school. I don&#8217;t know if it was fifth or sixth grade. And I remember they separated, I&#8217;m pretty sure I remember this. They separated the boys and the girls, and we both got different booklets. And I think back on the playground--I don&#8217;t know if we shared them, but we all were looking at them and we took them home. And again I was lucky. I had a mother who wasn&#8217;t afraid to talk about it. So that was good. I wasn&#8217;t ignorant. But I got it in public high school, public elementary, sixth, fifth or sixth grade. Yeah. EW: Is that mostly like mechanics and what body parts are? SM: Yeah, I think. I think yeah, they had pictures and diagrams. Yeah, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t remember ( ). I do remember that we all looked at it and we took it home. I don&#8217;t know if we had to have our parents sign it or anything. I doubt it. It wasn&#8217;t that big a deal. I mean it was something that they taught you. EW: [Whispers something] How did you learn about contraception? SM: I really don&#8217;t know. I think, I don&#8217;t know if I learned about it in college or knew about it. I don&#8217;t know. Probably word of mouth, probably from other peers. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know. I mean too long ago. EW: Yeah. It was a while. Okay. All right. Is there anything else? SM: I can&#8217;t think of anything else. EW: No. All right. Thank you so much for doing this. Yeah. SM: Oh you&#8217;re welcome. It&#8217;s very nice...
