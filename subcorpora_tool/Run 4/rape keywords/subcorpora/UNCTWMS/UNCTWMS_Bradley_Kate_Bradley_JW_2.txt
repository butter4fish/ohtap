 Evangeline Mee: Well. Ok, well I&#8217;m going to start this the formal way. This is Evangeline Mee, and I&#8217;m here at the home of the Bradley&#8217;s in Wartburg, Tennessee. And it is August 11th, 2012. So could you say when and where you were born? J.W. Bradley: I was born in 1930 in Petros and delivered by a coal company doctor. EM: And what did your parents do for a living? What did your parents do for a living? [JWB leans in to hear] What did your mom and dad do for work? JWB: Oh. Daddy was a coal miner. My grandpas on both sides were coal miners. Momma&#8217;s daddy and daddy&#8217;s daddy were both coal miners. And daddy went in the mines probably about eleven year-old. And he was helping support his family. And he worked in the mines, and he was working in the mines in 1948, and those mines had just started up. And he got me a job there when I turned eighteen. I went to work at the mines at Rosedale at eighteen. And worked there till the strip mining shut it down. They started strip mining around the mountain and dumping their coal in the mine tipple. People had to contract for the coal because it was so dirty they cancelled the contract, and the mine shut down. And I worked around in another mine at Monterrey, and then finally got to go to K-25. I worked at K-25; daddy was working at K-25, and he got me a job there in &#8217;52. And I worked there till &#8217;56, I guess. And then they had a layoff, and I left and went back to the mines and worked till &#8217;64, I guess. And I wound up with a total of about seven year work in the mines. And the rest of it was industrial plants &#8211; K-25. EM: And what about your mom? What did your mom do? JWB: My momma--. Of course, the coal mining industry wasn&#8217;t too viable at that time, when she was raising us. In 1937, we a bad year the year before &#8211; &#8217;36 &#8211; and she didn&#8217;t have the money she wanted for Christmas presents and stuff, so she went to Knoxville and took a beauty course. And then she worked in the beauty industry on up into the &#8216;40s, I guess. Kindly helped subsidize the income of the family. EM: And did you have brothers and sisters? JWB: I had two brothers and two sisters. EM: And did your brothers work in the mines? JWB: No, they never did have to go to the mines. They got other jobs. Course, I bought a truck when they were real young &#8211; they were in their teens &#8211; a coal truck. They helped haul coal for a while, but that was all the mining experience they had. They never had any underground experience. During that time we had a rather viable coal industry in this area. And in &#8217;51, they built a Kingston steam plant, and TVA begin to dabble in strip mining because it&#8217;s a cheaper way to get coal. And of course it was a cheaper coal. And so they--. When they built the plant it was supposed to operate about thirty year, I think. And they built a sediment pond to last fifty years. And before that time was up, why that pond was full, and they had made another one. And then in two double o eight, because the waste that they was getting in the coal, they had a spill. A ash spill. And because TVA is the size it is, there&#8217;s nobody that&#8217;s got enough nerve to attack the real reason for all that. But somewhere in the &#8216;70s, I couldn&#8217;t understand how that strip miners was making so much money selling their coal to TVA when it&#8217;s such poor quality stuff. So I did a little research and found out that they were layer-loading the coal. And they was sending it to the plants in Oak Ridge &#8211; K-25, X-10, and Y-12 &#8211; cause they all three had steam plants. And in 1975, why, they was going hold some oversight hearing in the Senate. Oversight hearing in Washington on the TVA and what TVA was doing. And I found out about it, and I went to Senator Randolph&#8217;s people. He was the chairman of the Senate Public Works committee. And Howard Baker was a co-chairman, but I know&#8217;d it. I didn&#8217;t have any chance with Howard Baker. So I just ignored him. And so when it come time for the hearing, I went up there with a testimony about what was going on, about the layer-loading and stuff. And they informed me that I couldn&#8217;t testify. And I had made provisions with the chairman and his people, and I had prepared myself for this hearing. And then when I got in Washington, they told me I couldn&#8217;t testify, but Senator Fred Harris from Oklahoma had a bunch of people that worked close with us. So they got me a hearing with a Senate subcommittee. And they was holding hearings on the power companies &#8211; Georgia Power being one of them. And we had video tape of the way they was loading the coal, sending it to TVA. And the guy &#8211; one of the guys &#8211; at Georgia Power asked me; he said, &#8220;Would you all go to work for us?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, right now we&#8217;re busy!&#8221; But fortunately, when we got back from Washington, I found out that there had be thirteen railroad cars of coal &#8211; serial number so-and-so-and-so-and-so &#8211; loaded in Anderson County going to Georgia Power. So at that time we had our own lawyer, and I had him to contact Georgia Power and tell them to check them cars &#8211; them specific cars &#8211; when they come in the yard. And they did. And we heard later that they cancelled the strip miners contract and told them that they would be responsible for disposing of the stuff that they had sent down there. But TVA, they never did do anything. We got Channel 10 in Knoxville to do a story on it, and we got the Knoxville News Sentinel to do a story on it. And we got the FBI involved. They was one of the special agents of the FBI was a good friend of mine, and I told him was going on, and finally, talked him into helping us. And he--. I don&#8217;t know what he done, but anyway, they sent him in to investigate. And he took some pictures of them layer loading. And from that, TVA, they--. The FBI got out in the woods and filmed layer loading. And they was supposed to take an eighteen hundred feet videotape -- part of it from the ground and part of it from a helicopter &#8211; of this layer loading. And we had all this information that we&#8217;d gathered, and then TVA&#8217;s lawyers decided that they wanted to work with us because we was able to get this information. And so I took some of their lawyers in the woods and showed them how this layer loading was going on. And when I was working with them, why, they would tell personnel at TVA to take special samples from special trucks &#8211; the ones that we was filming that day. And so their samples proved that what we was claiming was true: that it was trash that loading and sending to TVA. And so we had the Knoxville News Sentinel, Channel 10, Save Our Cumberland Mountains [SOCM], the FBI, and everybody that had this information. And we was able to get it brought up in federal court, and the Judge Taylor was the federal judge in this district. And he had never ruled again TVA, regardless of what it was. And so they took the information we give them and put it under a six-month investigating period of time. And they didn&#8217;t do anything about it. So the coal companies that had been afraid to layer load the coal and send it to TVA, found out that you couldn&#8217;t be prosecuted for it, so then it become a widespread thing that everybody was layer loading and sending TVA. So they was never anything done about it. But that&#8217;s what caused that spill in two double o eight, was the fact that they had increased the amount of trash that they was sending. EM: That was that spill in Roane County? JWB: Huh? EM: That was that spill in Roane County? JWB: Uh-huh. And they later found out that ash is very toxic. It&#8217;s got heavy metals and stuff in it and mercury and different chemicals that is hazardous to the health of the living creatures. Probably, in the near future, there will be signs of health problems that&#8217;s caused from it, but it takes such a long time for this stuff to enter to the system and do something to it, that they&#8217;s not anything been done yet. EM: Where you still working at the mines when you found out that all the layer loading was happening? JWB: No, uh-uh. I was working at K-25. EM: Ok. And why did you stop working in the mines? JWB: Oh, they--[chuckle]. The last time I left the mines was because I saw that they was going to shut them down, and I needed to get a job at something else. So I volunteered and quit the mines &#8211; the last mines I was working at &#8211; to take a job in a different industry. In fact, I wen to work at the paper mill in Georgia! I had to leave the state to get a job. I was down there a couple of years, and they was a--. K-25 was running ads in the papers &#8211; even in the state that I was in &#8211; wanting workers [laugh]. And finally, I went by their employment office one day and asked them why it was that people that lived in the shadow of TVA couldn&#8217;t get a job there. And they said, &#8220;Do you want a job?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting one every since I got laid off!&#8221; And they said, &#8220;All right.&#8221; So a few days later, they called me and told me, if I wanted a job, come to X-10. And I come back and went back to work in the area where I lived. EM: So can you tell me about the seven years that you were a coal miner and what that was like? JWB: [Laughter] Uh, coal mining is a very hard work. And it&#8217;s very dangerous. But a lot of people accept all the dangers and hardship because it&#8217;s in the area where they live, and they don&#8217;t mind it. I didn&#8217;t mind working in the mines. Like I say, it was hard work, and it was just a thing that is just an occupation that people accepted because their ancestors had done the same thing years before. And the deep mines was very dangerous, but it was more dangerous because strip mining was taking their jobs. And TVA got involved in promoting to strip mining. They imported a shovel into this area that was so large that the mountain couldn&#8217;t hold it up. They finally scrapped it. I don&#8217;t know how much money TVA spent on it, but they got that shovel in here, and then they wasn&#8217;t able to use it because the mountain couldn&#8217;t support it. But they got by with that without any repercussion form the public about how they was spending their money. And when they had that spill down in Kingston, they &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d find out the information. The gallons of diesel fuel they were using a day to reclaim that &#8211; or try to reclaim that area. TVA just increased the rate-payers price, and so TVA was able to pay for it through the rate-payers. So we was paying for the coal that wouldn&#8217;t burn that they had bought, and so we was double charged: we was charged with coal to start with and we was charged again with the stuff that was in the coal that wouldn&#8217;t burn. We was charged with getting rid of it. EM: So why--. Well, what did your mom think about you and your dad doing such dangerous work? JWB: [Chuckle] Well, they just accepted--. See her daddy was a coal miner, and in fact, he was a mine foreman. It was just an accepted occupation at that time. And it wasn&#8217;t too awful bad. I mean, it was just an occupation that you could make a living, a cornbread living at, and stay in the area where you was &#8211; where you&#8217;d been born. EM: So why was strip mining so bad, so much worse than the kind of coal mining that you did? JWB: Well, strip mining was so bad because it&#8217;s time in the early &#8216;70s, they claimed that they was only ten percent of the total coal in the United States that could be recovered by strip mine technology at that time. And so to go after ten percent of the coal production and do the amount of damage that they was doing just didn&#8217;t make sense. In fact, in &#8217;75 I believe the Department of Labor showed that they was more people in killed in the strip mine industry, at that period of time, than they was at the deep mine industry per ton of coal that was produced. Took the strip miners a while to get adapted to that type of work. And what they was doing--. The men in the deep mines, they was a hazard to them but not to their families. But strip mining, was a hazard all their families. In the area that the mining was done in, there was a lot of people killed by strip mine related accidents: flooding and things of that nature. EM: So that&#8217;s when you started being active against strip mining? Was when the layer loading--. Is that what--. At what point did SOCM fit into that? JWB: Well, I lived in Petros all my life there, and we had a creek, and it was beginning to be filled up by strip mining waste. And I tried to get the people in the community organized to do something about, or get something done about it. But they wasn&#8217;t interested. They didn&#8217;t figure that they could fight the industry, and so they didn&#8217;t do anything. But in December &#8217;69, we had a snow on the ground and they come a rain and melted the snow. And they was a flood come through Petros and washed out some people&#8217;s houses and was very dangerous to the community. So the next day, people begin to come tell me we need to do something about it. So this was happening in all the counties around us here. And so they was a group of kids from Vanderbilt, that was working in rural health programs, and they told us; they said, &#8220;Ya&#8217;ll have got some problems. You need to organize and fight these problems.&#8221; And so we decided to try to get an organization, and we got thirteen people out of five counties to go to Nashville. Because some of the land that they were strip mining wasn&#8217;t on the tax books, and there wasn&#8217;t taxes being paid on it. And so we went to Nashville, these thirteen people did, and asked the Department of Revenue to tax this land according to its actual value. And they said they would. And when we come back and reported that the state people had decided to try to get some more money in the county by more taxes from the land that wasn&#8217;t being taxed, somebody said; well, said, &#8220;You got other problems.&#8221; We did have schools and health and everything, roads. And so they said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just form an organization?&#8221; And I was speaker at that time, and I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what we&#8217;ll do.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Next month we have our next meeting.&#8221; I said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll organize an organization,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll give five dollars to the person that names the organization. And we&#8217;ll all go together and try to do something about it.&#8221; So we started from that, and then we run into some people from Washington D.C. &#8211; the Environmental Policy Center people. And they told us that they needed us in Washington. We was at a meeting in Kentucky, and I asked them when. They said, &#8220;We need you now.&#8221; So I went around and got several people, and they agreed to bus us to Washington and put us up while we lobbied against the strip mining industry. And so we did, and we become pretty successful working with the Environmental Policy Center. And we helped form a coalition of people across the United States &#8211; everywhere that there was coal &#8211; while we had people belong to this coalition, and we&#8217;d meet in Washington. EM: What was the coalition called? JWB: Uh, it was Environmental Policy Center Coalition of people in the mining areas. And so Senator Ken Hechler, from West Virginia, had a ban strip mine bill, and we was supporting that ban bill. And Senator Hechler was, he was a pretty good friend of mine, and his bill, they thought, might be a little stringent about the phase out time. And they asked me to write him a letter and ask him to lengthen the phase out time to make it more acceptable to the industry. And I did, and he wrote me back and told me that he was disappointed that I had done that. That he felt like I was a stronger person than that [chuckle]. So then we began to work--. The Environmental Policy Center began to realize that they couldn&#8217;t get a phase out of strip mining, so they called us all to Washington and wanted us to compromise on the strip mine bill. And I told people that we wasn&#8217;t ready to compromise. We felt like to phase out strip mining was the only sensible thing to do. And the time frame could be worked out, but strip mining needed to be stopped because it was after such small amount of the total coal reserve. And so in 1974, I guess, we forced the Environmental Policy Center to continue to fight for a phase out. And the next year they did the same thing, and we voted them down again. And in 1976, I guess, when Carter was running for President. Gerry Ford, they had given him a strip mine law, and he vetoed it. And Carter made a statement if he&#8217;d been Ford, he would have signed the bill. So the industry started right then to weaken what they had proposed to Ford, and when the bill was brought up in &#8217;77, it was very weak and there was only about two good clauses in it. One of them was that you could take land that was better &#8211; had better use than strip mining and declare it unstrippable and unsuited for strip mining. And the other part of it was that they was charging a tax on all of the coal that was mined &#8211; strip mined and deep mined &#8211; to built a fund to reclaim the areas that had been strip mined before the law went into effect. And two double o four, I guess, this bill was set to some date [chuckle], some down date was set on it. And that was to expire in two double o four. And we thought that it was important to keep bringing that money in to the states where there was reclamation that needed to be done. And we couldn&#8217;t get much help. I finally wrote Jimmy Carter and told him; I said, &#8220;Mr. Carter,&#8221; I said, &#8220;since you that had signed that federal strip mine law, we think that you ought to help us get this extended and improved.&#8221; And he just wrote a note on the top of my paper, and said that he felt like they would do it but with no help from the President or the administration. And so he sent that to me, and I wrote him back, and I told him, &#8220;You can&#8217;t wash your hands of this that easy.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You was the person that signed bill, and,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to hold you responsible for it.&#8221; And I never did hear from him anymore. But they waited two years before they reinstated that clause, and so we lost all that money and didn&#8217;t get any real improvements on the way the money was to be redistributed. EM: Did you have anything to do with the Poor People&#8217;s self help committee? JWB: We did have anything called the Poor People&#8217;s, but we had poor people. Working with Vanderbilt students, they had formed a student health coalition in the late &#8216;60s. And they&#8217;d go into areas to furnish free healthcare for rural areas where they didn&#8217;t have adequate doctors, and so we began to work with them in Petros. And we was able to raise enough money to build a clinic in Petros. And they was two more clinics built close to where we was at, so when we got ready to get federal help &#8211; the health service corps doctors &#8211; we didn&#8217;t have the population, so we had to go together and form Mountain People&#8217;s Health Council. And we had three clinics that was combined together that would share a doctor. And this Mountain People&#8217;s Health Clinic went on till, I reckon, this year. It expired this year. But it stayed into effect from the early &#8216;70s, till now. EM: Well, I kind of want to go back a little bit to growing up in Petros. So what was your school like in Petros? JWB: [Laugh] The school was pretty poor. And the building--. Finally the building got to the point where the windows wouldn&#8217;t hold regular size panes of glass, and they&#8217;d have to put in larger panes of glass, and the bats got in the attic of the building. And so the ceiling had come down in places. And bats carry bedbugs, and bedbugs was falling out of the attic of the school building on the kids. And so they asked me to president of the PTA, so some of the people that had been working for years trying to get a new building, and the county wouldn&#8217;t do anything for them. And so after I become president of the PTA, I had the county school superintendent and the school board to write the Department of Health and ask them to condemn the building &#8211; if they wouldn&#8217;t build us one. And they wouldn&#8217;t do that of course. So I guess in the early &#8216;70s, we had a guy that was running for school superintendent, and he come to me and he [From other transcript: And so I tried to get him to close the school down. And there was a guy that was running for superintendent of schools, and he come in, and he said, &#8220;JW,&#8221; he said, &#8220;If you help me get elected superintendent of the schools, I&#8217;ll see about helping you all get a building built.&#8221; So after he was elected, I waited a couple of months and invited him and the school board up there. And they come up there, and I took care of what business we had and turned it over to him. And he said, &#8220;Well,&#8221; said, &#8220;Actually, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s time to go before the county court and ask for a bond issue to build a building.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Mr. Galloway, we didn&#8217;t invite you out here to ask you what your opinion was. We invited you up here because you said you&#8217;d help us get a school built.&#8221; So I just ordered a petition from the floor and said, &#8220;We [38:38] signed citizens request the school board and the superintendent go before the county court on Monday (that was Thursday) and ask for a bond issue to build a building.&#8221; And so they did and it passed. And some of the JPs, when it passed, they cussed and said if they&#8217;d know&#8217;d it was going to pass, they wouldn&#8217;t have voted for it.] And so they decided that what they&#8217;d do was sue the school superintendent and the school board and refuse to give them the money that had been voted for the school building. And John told me about it, and I said, &#8220;Well, would a lawsuit help you?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;It would take some of the pressure of me.&#8221; So I called a lawyer in Knoxville and explained to him what was going on and asked him if he&#8217;d take to court a case against the school board and the superintendent, and he said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And he did. So when our lawsuit was formed, why, when they tried it out at the courthouse, they was forced to continue to give the money for building the school. And so they had decided that they was going to have to go in with another community because they didn&#8217;t have money to build two buildings and so we picked a neutral piace of land and called it the Petros-Joyner School. And we combined the two schools together. And I guess somewhere around 1975, they completed the building and it was the only fully air conditioned/heated school building in the county. And so it&#8217;s been operating ever since. In fact, I&#8217;ve got two grandkids are going to it now. EM: So when you were a kid did you play outside a lot? JWB: [Laughter] Played out every time they&#8217;d let me out! EM: What did you like to do? JWB: Oh, I stayed in the woods as much as I could. In fact, I helped build a couple of cabins in the mountains for kids &#8211; for us &#8211; to camp in and stuff. And I tried to work with the foreman. The boy scout troup always liked to work outside and always worked with kids. And I helped train some kids before little league was popular. We just had kids that needed some help, and we had some excellent athletes in this area. In fact, one boy that started in school with me and finished high school &#8211; the only boy that went to primer through high school with me &#8211; was Harold Long. And he at one time was voted the highest-ranking Caucasian in karate in the world. And he was from Petros. EM: So you liked to play in the woods a lot? JWB: Oh yeah. EM: And did you build things when you were a child? JWB: We built cabins and take springs and fix down to where you can get drinks out of them &#8211; drinking water. And were a --. I went to a guy that owned a piece of land &#8211; I own about fifty acres of it now &#8211; and got permission from him to build a cabin on his land. And so we built it, and it was called Jaybird&#8217;s cabin. And the kids for years enjoyed going up there and camping. It&#8217;s about two mile from town. And we go up there and stay two weeks at a time. EM: So why did you take charge of the strip mining? JWB: [Chuckle] Well, there&#8217;s two reasons: they was destroying our mountains and destroying our jobs. EM: But why do you think you--. I mean you were such a leader, why do you think specifically you were the one that was the leader? JWB: [Chuckle] Well, it was because I told them that my daddy didn&#8217;t raise to smart of boys, but they wasn&#8217;t afraid of nothing that wiggled or walked. And most people was afraid to attack the industry, and I wasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d go on Sunday, when the strip miners was off going to church and trying to build up their name in communities, and I&#8217;d get serial numbers off of their equipment and take it to the tax assessor. And tell him to assess it: &#8220;They have this piece of equipment.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been attacked a few times, and I&#8217;ve been assaulted once. And it was over strip mining. In fact, it was--. We had a park here, it&#8217;s about seventy-five year old now, and it&#8217;s Frozen Head State Park. And they started strip mining in that area, and because of the clause I the &#8217;77 laws that said that any land that had a better value than strip mining could be declared unsuitable for strip mining. And we got a petition up and got a federal water hearing about that piece of land. And so when we had the hearing, one of the strip miners had banned together, and they had done &#8211; made their brags &#8211; we&#8217; didn&#8217;t know it, but they made their brags they was going to get rid of us. And so the sheriff wouldn&#8217;t even send any officers to the meeting that night. And it was a federal meeting because of the water quality. And so after the meeting, why, one of the mine owners come up to me, and he said, &#8220;Well, ya&#8217;ll may have won the debate, but we&#8217;ll see who wins a fight.&#8221; And so he hit me a couple of times. And some of the others began to hit and throw SOCM people around in the courthouse. And they tried to beat us up. It wasn&#8217;t very successful, but they had us outnumbered. And there was so help for us; the sheriff&#8217;s department wasn&#8217;t there. We hired a lawyer to bring the case again them on the federal level because it was the type of hearing that it was. But when our lawyer went to Knoxville to federal court to try to get the hearing set, well, the federal judge wouldn&#8217;t allow the hearing to be brought in federal court. I don&#8217;t know how he could do it, but he did it. And so it had to be tried in the local court here, where the strip miners had all their friends and stuff. And we didn&#8217;t get anything out of the damage that was done to us or anything. Judge Taylor, he -- I don&#8217;t know how he managed to run the federal court the way that he did, but he was a --. [Chuckle] I can&#8217;t say too much about him because I went before him one time for &#8211; I&#8217;d arrested a boy and they&#8217;d charged me with violating his civil rights. [47:16] EM: [48:37] So some of the strip miners went to church on Sundays? JWB: Oh yeah. Yeah, they always went to church and contributed heavy to the offering. But what the people didn&#8217;t know was that they was going to have to pay for it later in rate increases. What the strip miners was giving them, was taken back away from them later on! EM: So they went so that the people in the community would think better of them? JWB: Some of the people in the community supported them. In fact, some of them had relative &#8211; very few relatives &#8211; that worked in the mining industries &#8211; the strip mining industries &#8211; to start with. EM: Wow. Oh, can you tell me about the Coal Creek Mine Wars? JWB: They&#8217;s a book called Coal Creek War by Chris Cawood, and Chris and his family was raised in the area where this mine took place. And it was at, to begin with, it was called Lake City &#8211; or, I mean, Coal Creek &#8211; and there was a community there at Briceville, and they had a mines there at Briceville. And the man that was running the mines, they would just estimate the tonnage of coal that was loaded on a car, and so the miners decided they wasn&#8217;t being treated fairly. And they requested that they put in scales to weigh the coal, and the company refused. And the company, they had their own money called scrip, and they would write their own money, these coal companies would. And if you worked for them, you had to trade at their company store. And they always had elevated prices at this store compared to the other stores. But if you held your job at the mines, you had to trade to them. And the company, by paying them in scrip, anybody else that took the scrip would give the man a discount &#8211; the value of the scrip. Sometimes it was twenty-five cents to the dollar. So because they were giving scrip and couldn&#8217;t use the money that they had earned to buy things they needed other places than the company store, they asked that the company pay them in cash. And they wouldn&#8217;t do it, so the men struck. And then back then they had a law in several of the southern states that they would lease convicts. And any state that had convicts, they would lease them in and out to anybody that wanted a worker at a reasonable rate. And they would be responsible for the feeding and shelter of the convict, whoever leased them out. So a lot of the coal companies would lease them to work in the mines, and they brought in--. When the Briceville miners struck, why, they brought in a bunch of convicts. And the miners, they realized that they was in desperate position. And so they went down and told the guards that they was going to turn the convicts loose. And they said, &#8220;Well, you cant do that cause they&#8217;d been put in here by the judicial system,&#8221; and said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be held responsible for that.&#8221; And they said, well said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll just take them and send them to another area.&#8221; And so we loaded them on a railroad car and they wound up on the lawn of the University of Tennessee. And the governor, which was Buchannan at that time, they called him and told him; they said, &#8220;You need to do something; there&#8217;s a bunch of convicts over here on the University of Tennessee property that the people from Briceville has sent over here.&#8221; And so he was kindly upset, and he went over there and got the convicts and loaded them back on the train and sent them back to Briceville. And he sent the militia with them &#8211; the state militia. And they went over there and they kept working for a period of time, and finally, the miners took all that they was going to take. And they went down there, and they told the state militia, that they was going to turn them men loose. And they said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;You just wait and see.&#8221; So they turned the men loose. And the convicts said, &#8220;Now, we can&#8217;t go nowhere!&#8221; Said, &#8220;We&#8217;s not got any decent shoes; we&#8217;s not got any decent clothes.&#8221; And said, &#8220;We&#8217;re handicapped.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll fix that.&#8221; So they went down and broke in the company store and told the convicts, said, &#8220;You just get what you need. Just don&#8217;t be seen in this area no more.&#8221; And so they turned the convicts loose up there at Briceville. And then about a year later, some of the same miners went up there at Nashville and got a law repealed about leasing convicts to work again miners or anybody. And they passed a law that no convict could work in competition with free people. Couldn&#8217;t be leased out. She had a&#8212;her grandpa was in the militia. He was a lieutenant. And he worked as a guard over what they call Big Mountain near Oliver Springs. And there&#8217;s some of the convicts got out &#8211; escaped &#8211; and they captured some of the guards. And they was holding these guards hostage, and her grandpa was able to get by these convicts and get help. Bring in some law to help these convicts to turn these people loose. And the boys at Anderson Camp made him a medal for bravery out of a twenty dollar gold piece. They didn&#8217;t have anything to do to pay him or show their appreciation except make him a medal for bravery and presented it to him. And the governor was so pleased with it, that he give lieutenant Hobbs two passes to the Chicago World Fair. And he and his wife went up there. And his wife was elected the Fairest of the Fair while she was there. EM: Well, is there anything else that you want to get on the tape there? JWB: I just wish that there was someway somebody could make the federal courts look to the people instead of to the corporations. TVA come in here and they&#8217;d a federal unity that was formed to improve conditions in these poor areas, and they&#8217;ve turned out to be the biggest destroyer of these areas that there is. They shut down all the deep mines and created all these hazards &#8211; flood hazards and stuff. And ruined the forests. There&#8217;s a big--. Well, timber just won&#8217;t grow in these strip mine areas, and so we&#8217;ve not got the amount of timber that we could have. And not got the education on things because they&#8217;s nobody going to put any money in a deprived area like that&#8217;s left form strip mining. They&#8217;s a place over in Claiborne County, next to the Kentucky line, where there&#8217;s a valley there that had several thousand deep miners working in it. And the strip mining come in Land companies would let the community build a school on their land, but when anything happened, why, the school went back to the land company. And they&#8217;s a land company in this area that was shown to be one of the bigger contributors to the layer loading. That they made enough money off of selling lay loaded coal to TVA to buy a mountain. And I owned fifty acres on that mountain and it&#8217;s been in the Weis family since 1800s. And the strip miners bought the mountain, and they&#8217;ve done nothing but give me trouble ever since. In fact, this year they claim that they own my mineral rights. And they&#8217;s a record at the court house that I own the mineral rights, or the guy that I bought the land from owned the mineral rights. He bought the land at a auction. They had sold it for taxes, and he bought it. And he satisfied the court with the price that he paid for the land when he got it back. And they went in there and started stripping on his land, and he brought it up and told them that they&#8217;d have to quit. And they said, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll pay you.&#8221; And they paid him so much money &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how much &#8211; for what they stripped off his land. But the land company that owned it at that time made an agreement with him that he owned the land. And it&#8217;s in court record out there in the register deeds office that Rankins owned the mineral. And then when I bought the land, I was under the impression that I bought the minerals too. And I told the tax assessor [1:03:56] So I thought that I had them, when they say that I didn&#8217;t&#8230;But he can&#8217;t get no lawyer because they just favor the man with the money&#8230; EM: [1:05:41] Do you have any stories about your mom or your grandma that you would share? JWB: My grandma on my daddy&#8217;s side was a granny woman. She used to lay people out for burial and deliver children. And when McGovern was trying to run for President, he had a girl that worked for him, Nancy Amaday. And some of Senator Harris&#8217; people said, &#8220;You need to talk to that girl.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You know I&#8217;ll talk to anybody.&#8221; [1:06:31-1:06:40] I lucky that I let you boys come in here. I tell people that I&#8217;m in labor and I don&#8217;t have time to mess with them. Because she&#8217;d been working on that program for nine months. And I said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re in luck. Me and this boy is from the mountains,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;my grandma was a granny woman and we&#8217;re here to help anyway we can!&#8221; [Laughter] My mother she worked from &#8217;37 to the end of the &#8217;40 to try to help provide for the family. She tried running a grocery store, and found out that so many people in the rural areas believed in credit and didn&#8217;t believe in paying their bills. So she was forced out of the grocery business because of poor business practices. Kate Bradley: All the mountain women worked to help provide. There was women that made gardens and canned and preserved and put up stuff--. My dad would go into the mountains, and my mother was a strong hold in our family. She would work in that garden, put up stuff for the winter for all of us, and she practically fed us. So the mountain women was strong. And they had cows, chickens, and they did all that. JWB: And her mother&#8217;s mother was an Indian. And when she died, they wouldn&#8217;t let her be buried in the cemetery because she was an Indian. And so she&#8217;s buried outside the cemetery down in Alabama. [1:09:11] And she had a brother that put up more time in the navy than any other enlisted man except a guy that was over the submarine division. He put in forty-four years in the navy. KB: Well, back then it was either go into the military or go to the coal mines, and he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to work in no coal mines.&#8221; And he never would go in to the coal mines. He left home when he was seventeen and a half years old. EM: Well, I don&#8217;t want to overstay my welcome here because I know you&#8217;ve not been feeling well. JWB: Young lady, when you leave, I&#8217;ll quit talking, but you stay here and I&#8217;ll talk as long as you give me a lead on which way to go. EM: Well, did you go to that same school in Petros from kindergarten to high school? JWB: I went from what they call primer, which would be equal to head start I guess, through the eighth grade at that school there in Petros. And then I had to transfer to Wartburg to Central High School. So I went to four years in Wartburg. And the fourth year that I played football, we had nine first string players on the team from Petros. And it was a Wartburg football team. EM: And what was Petros like? I&#8217;ve never been there. JWB: Petros was just a poor community in Morgan County that was basically a &#8211; deep miners lived there. KB: And then the prison the come in and it give a lot of work to a lot of people. And then later with Oak Ridge, and that brought in a lot of work. But at one time, Petros was incorporated, and they had a bank and a jail and all kinds of stores and lots of that. But there&#8217;s nothing there now. It&#8217;s just a dead place. It&#8217;s all gone. They closed the prison last year, and that was the last thing. They took the railroad out and everything&#8217;s gone. JWB: We had a railroad and a depot in Petros. And we had two trains a day back when Petros was in its heyday. Passenger trains and freight trains hauling the coal out of &#8211; from the prison mines. My grandpa owned some land and because the state was required not to lease the convicts out they decided that they would buy up some land that had coal reserves on it and open their own mine. And use their convict labor to mine the coal for the state. And at one time, all the state institutions in the state of Tennessee burned coal or coke coming out of the mines that was mined by convict labor. And so they was tremendous savings to the state &#8211; or should have been &#8211; I guess through politics there&#8217;s enough corruptness to offset that. They had a mines--. Where was that your grandpa used to work? KB: Sand Mountain? JWB: They had two major mining industries for the prisoners at one time in the state of Tennessee. And they made coke, and so they had integrated coal or coke that was needed for any use of the state. KB: [1:15 Prison Farms in TN] They won&#8217;t allow them to do that no more&#8230;it&#8217;s sad because the men would have enjoyed it. JWB: [1:15:40] It was kindly self-sufficient. The state was taking care of itself, partly with the coal mines being the employment for the miners and the gardening and the farming to subsidize the facility. KB: [1:16:08 -1:16: 11] And there&#8217;s men in there that&#8217;d love that. They love that kind of work. That&#8217;s the reason why it&#8217;s so expensive for a man to be in prison. JWB: The prisons used to be self-sufficient. They had their own cooks, prepared their own food, and now, because of politics, they&#8217;ve decided to ship their food frozen stuff into them, and the convicts don&#8217;t like it. They say it&#8217;s not fit to eat. But it&#8217;s a political thing. They&#8217;ve got to go along with it. They&#8217;s a lot of corruption in the state of Tennessee. KB: My grandmother was the first woman that ever went in that prison when it was first built. She cooked for them. JWB: She was a steward over the kitchen. They always had a steward that was over the convicts cooking. It was a job for a civilian. KB: Back then there wasn&#8217;t no roads or no way to get in or out of Petros. It&#8217;s was just muddy roads and rocks. It&#8217;d take people a day or two to get in there if they come to see somebody at the prisoners or some of their family. And my grandmother, she had a room, and she would let them stay all night and fix their breakfast for a dollar. But she&#8217;d take them in and feed them all. And give them a place to stay if they didn&#8217;t have nowhere to go. She was an old mountaineer, but she was tough. EM: She sounds like a lovely woman. KB: Yeah, taught me a lot. Yeah, she was a wise old woman. She was rowdy sometimes, but she was sharp. She knew what she&#8217;s &#8211; she was a McCoy. JWB: She was ninety something year-old and still had her original teeth. KB: Ninety-two EM: Wow, that&#8217;s amazing! KB: Still had all her teeth. EM: Well, I guess I haven&#8217;t asked about--. What role did religion play? Where did ya&#8217;ll go to church? JWB: We&#8217;re pretty strong Church of God people. The basic religion around here is Baptist. There&#8217;s few Methodists and different denominations, but the basic is Baptist &#8211; the majority. But after we got married, we become what is known as&#8212; KB: Pentecostal. JWB: Church of God. KB: We don&#8217;t really belong to any one church. But that&#8217;s our faith is Pentecostal. EM: And did you start going to that church after you were married? JWB: We was raised Baptist, but after we got married we helped build a Church of God in Petros. And it spread out; we got another church built at Petros. And this church was a Church of God of Prophecy. And nineteen and forty something, the Church of God of Prophecy had world&#8217;s largest air fleet &#8211; noncommercial, nongovernment air fleet &#8211; in the world. And they was one of the preachers felt like that what Ezekiel saw was a airplane. And so he promoted airplane services. And using that to get to the people. And then later on, why, he decided that Joel was talking about it in the last days, it&#8217;d be a group of people, and the appearance of them would be as horseman. And he said that was people on motorcycles. And then Nahum&#8217;s chariots. Nahum prophesied in the last days that the chariots that Joshua wanted, get another in the broadways, and they&#8217;d run like lightening. So we had a church program where we supported the automobile, the airplane, and the boat, and the motorcycle. And in &#8217;61, we had one of the first motorcycle tours of church-related people that I&#8217;ve ever heard of. We&#8217;d go from state to state to different churches promoting the church. EM: So why did you become Pentecostal after you got married? JWB: I didn&#8217;t go along with the Baptist doctrine, &#8220;Once saved always saved.&#8221; Cause the scripture don&#8217;t back that up. I felt like Church of God followed biblical guidelines closer than any church that I knew of. And that&#8217;s the reason that I switched was because the guidelines that you were gauged by. KB: And then it got to be so much politics and corruption in the church, we left it. Because we just couldn&#8217;t go along with that. And we just haven&#8217;t joined another church. We go everywhere. I get along with everybody. EM: Every church is your home. KB: Yeah. Now the little Mormon kids, you know they get out and do their missions? They come here for about a year. I fed them about twice a week. They&#8217;d come in and they&#8217;d &#8211; because you know they had to root for themselves! And they&#8217;d come here, and I&#8217;d make them brownies and fix them jelly and canned foods. And they&#8217;d eat dinner with us. And they loved us. We went to church with them a time or two. Of course, they know what I believe, and I know what they believe. But we enjoyed them. I really did. I enjoyed feeding them little boys. And I&#8217;ve got a Jehovah Witness friend. She&#8217;s been coming here for twenty years. And she don&#8217;t talk about it very much; she brings me a little pamphlet. But me and her are the same age, and she comes and talks and talks. Pretty often she comes in to visit with me, to stay with me. So we have relations with all kinds of people. We have Jewish friends that&#8217;s real close friends. All kinds of Catholics. JWB: Catholic friends. KB: Got some fine Catholic friends. They respect me, and I respect them. So we get along. EM: That&#8217;s great. Well, this has been wonderful. Thank you guys so much for talking. I&#8217;m going to click it off. KB: Well, I hope that helps something, honey. EM: Oh no, every story is wonderful, and--. I&#8217;m going to stop it...
