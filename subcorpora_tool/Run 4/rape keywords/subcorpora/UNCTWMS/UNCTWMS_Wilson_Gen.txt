 Jennifer Donnally: Good morning. Today is Wednesday, August 17, 2011. This is Jennifer Donnally and I am at the Georgia Right to Life new office in Norcross, Georgia, and today I&#8217;m interviewing&#8212;why don&#8217;t you introduce yourself? Gen Wilson: My name is Gen Wilson and I am the current director of chapter development for Georgia Right to Life and I have been involved with the pro-life movement for&#8212;I should have figured this out&#8212;twenty-nine years. JD: And I forgot to say that it&#8217;s 10:50 in the morning, roughly. GW: Oh, 10:50 in the morning. JD: [Laughs] My first question to you is where did you grow up and what was your childhood like? GW: I grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am the oldest of five children. I was four years older than the next sibling, my brother, and he passed away six years ago, and then there was two sisters and then another brother. My parents were somewhat involved politically. I have memories of that although it didn&#8217;t really impact my life but I can remember parades for campaigns and stuff like that. JD: Now were they Southern Democrats or Republicans in your childhood? GW: No, they were Republicans. JD: Okay, so they were Republican in Florida. GW: Yes, but I had an aunt and uncle who were Southern Democrats and it was fun when they would get together because that was probably my first memory, without any understanding, of observing the political debate, and it was good because we were very close to them, so it was good. My parents were probably middle class, I guess, maybe lower middle class. My father was a salesman and he was out of town a great deal. Actually he was my stepfather because my mother was in the Air Force and got pregnant with me and my father bailed before I was born, and so when my mom met my dad then he adopted me. JD: So your mom must have been pretty incredible but it was hard to be a single mom, even for a little bit, before she met your stepfather. GW: Yes. JD: When was that? GW: When was I born? JD: Mm hmm. GW: I was born in 1952. JD: Oh, wow. GW: Yes, it was difficult. She was in the military and got pregnant and of course she could not stay in the military. I don&#8217;t know what women do now. I don&#8217;t know if they are allowed to have a leave and then come back, I really don&#8217;t know the process. But she received an honorable discharge out of the Air Force and so she went to my grandmother and stayed with my grandmother and then four years later she married again, well, less than four years, because my brother was born and we were four years apart, so it had to be about three years, I guess. JD: Wow. So your mother was a pretty incredible figure for you in your life? GW: Yes. Like I said, my dad was a traveling salesman, literally, so she was the constant. She was there. She worked, which meant that I had a lot of responsibility from a very young age, being the oldest. We did have I guess a baby sitter, a nanny, when I was very young, on and off. But, yeah, she is the only person that was really always there. Oh, and I guess my grandmother too. I was very close to my maternal grandmother and she took care of us some while my mom was working also. JD: Wow. So then you helped take care of a lot of your younger siblings as they grew up. What were some of the big changes you saw in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because you&#8217;re looking at major changes in Florida development as you&#8217;re growing up there? GW: Oh yeah. When my parents moved to the house that my mother still lives in it was like one of a handful of houses and there was farm area all over the place, I mean there were literally cows, and I mean it&#8217;s wall-to-wall houses and sidewalks and streets and stores now. It&#8217;s completely different than it was back then. I can&#8217;t ever remember a time&#8212;. I don&#8217;t have a vivid memory of when I was young but the elementary school that I went to that is still there, I don&#8217;t ever remember it not being there. The middle school, which when I went to school was called middle school, and high school, I can remember when those were being built, so the whole area&#8217;s just changed tremendously. JD: Now did grow up in a church? GW: We were Catholic, I was raised Catholic, but I would say it was nominal. There were many times that we did not go; we did not go to Catholic school, so it was not&#8212;. I would say no, that I wasn&#8217;t, but if my mother was asked she would say yes. [Laughs] JD: So then what did you do after high school? GW: I went to college and I met my husband and we got married and we continued going to college and then I had babies [Laughs] and I did not finish college because I got pregnant while I was in school. My husband&#8217;s job transferred to the Tucker [Georgia] area in 1983 and so that&#8217;s how we ended up here. Didn&#8217;t know a soul. JD: And how many children do you have? GW: We have three&#8212;girl, boy, girl. JD: That&#8217;s always a busy time when they&#8217;re young. My sister [has a young child]right now. GW: Very busy time, very fun time if you can take the time to enjoy it, but it&#8217;s very busy and lots of being tired. [Laughs] JD: So then you moved to the Tucker area, and Tucker is in Atlanta? GW: Tucker is&#8212;yes. JD: I&#8217;m not familiar with Georgia geography. GW: If you picture [Interstate] 285 going around Atlanta, Tucker is about 1:30 or 2:00, if you picture 285 as a clock. Yeah, his job was there but we moved to Snellville, so we were outside of Snellville, and when we moved here&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see, you probably don&#8217;t even know&#8212;. Gwinnett Place Mall was not there, the Mall of Georgia; it was all farm land, and I mean it&#8217;s crazy what&#8217;s happened. JD: Yeah. So then when you moved here in 1983 were your children in elementary school? GW: Yes. JD: So you had some time, a little bit. GW: Not much, but yes. JD: [Laughs] Whatever small amount of time it is. GW: Because I was doing&#8212;. When we were in Florida I was caring for children and trying to supplement our income by working from home and then when we got here it was, you know, being involved in&#8212;. If you&#8217;re working outside the home then your time is very limited; if you&#8217;re not working outside the home then you have the responsibility to be in the classroom and volunteer and all those kinds of things. It&#8217;s still a very busy time. JD: No, no, I always&#8212;. My mother was a stay-at-home mom so I always say she was a non-wage laborer. GW: Yes. JD: She did a lot of work. [Laughs] GW: I say that&#8212;. Women will say that. They&#8217;ll say, I don&#8217;t work, and I will always say you mean you don&#8217;t get paid for what you do, [Laughs] because it&#8217;s definitely a lot of work. JD: So then how did you become aware of abortion? GW: Well that actually happened in Florida. I look back at where I&#8217;ve come from. When I was in college I actually wrote a paper on abortion that I still have to this day because I want to remind myself of where I was and where I came, and when I read the paper I&#8217;m very disappointed because I was pro-choice. The conclusion, the final paragraph of the paper says something along the lines of, &#8220;While I would never have an abortion I believe that there are times when it might be necessary for other people&#8221; &#8212;the typical answer that you get. So that&#8217;s where I was, and I guess it must have been the [19]70s, had to be the &#8217;70s, had to be early &#8217;70s even, and I don&#8217;t know the year. I have a friend who I&#8217;ve known since I was in fourth grade and she had three children, was in a very difficult marriage, very difficult. Her husband was an alcoholic and verbally abusive; did not provide for the family. I mean she literally did not know if there was going to be food on the table and it was just a very difficult situation. She became pregnant and wanted an abortion and I was trying to&#8212;. Abortion was totally not on my radar. I do not even remember the Supreme Court decision. I was not involved politically, I did not know much about who even the candidates were for president or anything. So when my friend became pregnant and needed help I did not know where to get help, I did not know how to help her, and while I was trying to find out, a neighbor of hers took her to the University of Miami where they would perform the abortion if she would agree that they could have the baby for experimentation, and so she signed the papers and they did the abortion. I cannot remember exactly how far along she was but I do know that she saw the baby in a bucket, so it was clearly very well deformed, and I can&#8217;t figure out how&#8212;. I mean there&#8217;s questions that I have about it, because I can&#8217;t figure out how they did the abortion and the baby was still intact, but maybe it wasn&#8217;t. Maybe I just think that when she said she saw the baby in the bucket. I don&#8217;t know. After that she literally fell apart. She started drinking, started doing drugs, illicit sex, tried to kill herself three times, had to be institutionalized, and it was facing abortion that way that I realized that this solution to our problems, to a crisis pregnancy, wasn&#8217;t a solution at all. There had to be something else. There had to be a way to help women that were having crisis pregnancies without putting them through what she went through. So that was the beginning. That was when I&#8212;. And the worst part of it was, I was so upset with her for having the abortion. Even though in my paper I said I think it might be necessary for some people and I thought that her situation was horrendous, I was very upset with her for having the abortion. I couldn&#8217;t even help her after because of my own judgmentalism. So shortly after that is when we moved up here and there was a notice in the Gwinnett Daily News that there was a chapter of Georgia Right to Life starting in Gwinnett County and I went to that meeting and that&#8217;s how I got involved. JD: Do you remember anything about that first meeting? Was it kind of like a moment of, oh, yes, because you were still coming off of something pretty moving or traumatic? GW: I don&#8217;t have a clear memory of it but I know that when I went to the meeting it enabled me to have a course of action. I mean after what happened to my friend and my inability to help her while she was still pregnant and my inability to help her deal with the emotional and psychological fallout of the abortion itself, I felt an inner need to know how to be able to respond in those situations. And there was enough in that meeting to make me believe that this would be a good place to start. I mean, there have certainly been periods of my life since that time&#8212;and this has to have been, I believe, 1985&#8212;since that time there have been periods of my life, because of whatever&#8217;s going on in my life, that I have not been able to be as intimately involved as I am today, and there have been times when I have been more involved, but since then until this day it has been&#8212;probably I should say even since my friend&#8212;it has been a driving force in my life. JD: And have you ever reconciled with that friend? GW: Oh yes, yes, but not to the point&#8212;. I mean I should probably ask her, but I would venture&#8212;. I have never told her why I am involved. She doesn&#8217;t know that it was her life that propelled me into this, and we have never discussed it. We have never discussed the abortion itself or the fallout afterwards, but we are reconciled, we are friends, we are in touch with one another. JD: And do you talk about your views on abortion together? GW: Oh, we have, not in a lot of detail, and I&#8217;m not sure what she would say. It was so traumatic for her. She ended up getting pregnant again and carrying the baby to term. It was the life of that child that actually pulled her out of the depression and everything, and while she was pregnant she was deeply concerned that she would be punished for the abortion and that this child would be taken away, so it was hard. JD: It sounds like you were very&#8212;. When you started becoming involved in 1983&#8212;. [Noise in background] Was that a bird? GW: I don&#8217;t know what that was. JD: [Laughs] When you became involved, there are so many different wings of the movement, so what were you drawn to? Was it the politics, was it pregnancy crisis centers? What did you start [with] when you started? GW: At that point in history I don&#8217;t even think there were pregnancy centers. If there were I certainly didn&#8217;t know about it. Now, I take that back, there were, there were, and I did hear of them because in Florida I remember when I was trying to find help for my friend, I remember someone telling me, oh, there&#8217;s someplace that you&#8212;. But finding out where they were, how to get in touch with them, you didn&#8217;t have the Internet. You had a phone book and if a business became established during the one year or one-and-a-half years that it takes from the time a phone book is printed until the next time, you were just out of luck. You had directory assistance. But anyway, I forgot what the question was, I&#8217;m sorry. JD: Oh, what did you start [to become involved? GW: Oh, my draw was education. My draw is dealing with people directly. That&#8217;s why I love chapter development because I&#8217;m dealing with the grassroots. I got involved almost immediately with sidewalk counseling. JD: [Pause] What was that like for you? GW: It was very&#8212;. Well, I mean I came from Fort Lauderdale, I was rather sheltered, protected, so to go stand in front of an abortion facility, which I went to Midtown [Atlanta]. Do you know about Midtown? Okay. And you know that they did&#8212;. I mean they would advertise abortions twenty-four weeks and we know they were doing them much later than that. So to stand there and see some girls practically being drug in there, it was hard. It was hard but it was compelling because after my experience with my friend, I felt like what they&#8217;re telling us isn&#8217;t true. They&#8217;re telling us that this is a solution to an economic problem. This is a solution to a physical&#8212;. This is going to make your life better and easier, and I knew firsthand that that wasn&#8217;t the truth, and to watch these girls&#8212;. Now some of them were going in on their own and determined and this was their decision kind of thing. But there are a number of women going in there that didn&#8217;t want to go in there and you could tell. I mean some of them were being nicely escorted by their significant other, by a mother, a grandmother, and you could watch this, you could watch this happening, and it was difficult. JD: I&#8217;ve interviewed many sidewalk counselors and there is a period where they get burned out. How long were you able to stay in it, or how did that burnout feel, if you did feel it? GW: Oh, I did. Oh, I did. Shortly after I was involved in the sidewalk counseling, it was shortly after that, probably a year or less, maybe longer, I don&#8217;t know&#8212;like I said I do not have a good memory for dates, so I cannot tell you when I started sidewalk counseling, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like it was very long and that&#8217;s when OR [Operation Rescue] came to Atlanta, and when they came to Atlanta I had to really wrestle with what my role was going to be. First of all my husband said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get arrested.&#8221; He wasn&#8217;t going to bail me out of jail so [Laughs] that was the first thing. Then the second thing was I had a real concern that the time, the energy, the money that was being spent on the lock-ins and stuff were not really being that effective. So I wrestled with that for awhile and I decided that I was not going to participate because I felt like it just wasn&#8217;t a good return for the resources, which sounds kind of silly, but&#8212;. JD: Was there any rescues going on that were locally led prior to Operation coming in, in &#8217;87? Do you remember any of that sort? So it was very much Randall Terry coming in and saying&#8212;. GW: Well Joe Scheidler, you know, came to Atlanta&#8212; JD: Okay. GW: &#8212;before Randall Terry did and he would&#8212;. I can remember&#8212;. JD: His bullhorn? GW: Oh yeah. I mean his boldness was something new, was something that&#8212;. I mean I&#8217;m not like that anyway so, you know, but he&#8217;s the first one that I can clearly remember, and in my mind he was here before OR. He was here more than once. JD: So this is the question. There&#8217;s different roles when you&#8217;re doing the sidewalk counseling. Were there any prayer groups there? Because as sidewalk counselors you&#8217;re designated to talk and interact with the families, women, friends coming into the clinic, and then there are those who just decide to protest silently or actively pray. Did you belong in any of those [roles]? GW: Well I think right now it&#8217;s more organized like that; back then it wasn&#8217;t. I mean certainly you had&#8212;. It isn&#8217;t like, you know, Debbie is assigned to pray and Gen is assigned to talk. It was more what you&#8217;re comfortable with, so I was comfortable talking. I am a doer, so I would approach women and I would try to talk to them. JD: So you said your husband said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get arrested.&#8221; What did your husband and children and family think of this burgeoning activism? GW: I&#8217;m just a wacko. JD: [Laughs] GW: I&#8217;m a fanatic. That&#8217;s what they thought. That&#8217;s what they think. [Laughs] JD: Because they were not used to their mom going that way? GW: Well I would think most of us are&#8212;. I mean if you look at even the unrest there is in the United States today, I mean there are a lot of people that are very upset for a number of different reasons and yet the average person, who is upset, will be sitting&#8212;. Oh, there&#8217;s a deer out there. Look, right there [Pointing]. Can you see it? JD: No. GW: Come this way a little bit. Look down. See it? See this big tree? [Laughs] JD: Oh yeah. Oh, that&#8217;s nice. GW: That is. JD: Is that your first deer spotting in the office? GW: In the office, yeah. I actually live on a farm and I see deer all the time. I live fifty-two miles from here and we have goats and dogs and cats, but anyway, [Laughs] sorry. JD: Oh, no. I got that from grandmother. Always enjoy&#8212;it makes your day when you get to see a deer in a populated area. GW: It&#8217;s fun. Well I mean it&#8217;s just out there, you know, scratching itself. JD: It&#8217;s chillin&#8217;. GW: Yeah. This is a really busy, built-up area, so that&#8217;s cool. Anyway, where were we? JD: You were talking about&#8212; GW: Oh, the average&#8212;. JD: &#8212;apathy. GW: Right, the average person will swear at the television set and scream at his wife and she&#8217;ll scream at the children and rant and rave, but most of us are uncomfortable, quote, &#8220;doing something.&#8221; Either we&#8217;re uncomfortable or we don&#8217;t know what to do. So I mean I am not typical in that way, and I realize that, and that&#8217;s okay. I mean obviously I have a lot of friends who are pro-life, a lot of family and friends who are pro-life, but I&#8217;m the only one that is an activist. I mean I understood where they were coming from and what they were saying. It isn&#8217;t that they didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with my position, it&#8217;s just that I was kind of out there. JD: So you talked about Operation Rescue. Did you participate in that siege at all? GW: No. JD: So you didn&#8217;t even go down to help sidewalk counsel? GW: No. JD: I&#8217;m still trying to get the impressions of it. Was it a lot of people from outside of Georgia who came down to participate or was it a lot of local people who came? GW: It was a lot of local people because I know people who participated. Steve Bowen, in the office right down the&#8212;. He and his wife, Madia, participated. Some of the people that I was sidewalk counseling with did participate. JD: I was trying&#8212;. GW: I&#8217;m not saying there weren&#8217;t any from out of state. There were, but there was a lot of local people. JD: So I&#8217;m trying to figure this out. Was it a lot of Catholic local activists that participated or&#8212;? GW: I would actually say there&#8217;s probably more Catholic&#8212;. Well, let met think. That&#8217;s hard to&#8212;. There were Catholics but there were Protestants too. I mean I&#8217;m Protestant&#8212;. See, because I never got to that point in the interview, I told you I was raised Catholic but I&#8217;m not Catholic anymore, and Steve and Madia&#8212;. If I had to put a percentage on it, I don&#8217;t know. The people that were participating in the siege were not primarily Catholic. JD: So it really was&#8212;. Because Dan talked to me about it and it sounded like the movement divided, it was a very divisive time for the Georgia movement in terms of, to support it or not to support it and the reasons why. GW: Well everybody had to come&#8212;. Those of us who were out there in front of the abortion facilities, we had to make a decision because there was a risk. Back then the law, I mean we didn&#8217;t&#8212;. The law was very fuzzy: What can I do? What can I do? Am I going to get arrested just because I&#8217;m standing on the sidewalk? I mean there were people that were locking themselves on the sidewalk and locking themselves in various places, obviously you knew you were going to get arrested then, but the fallout of that affected everybody. I don&#8217;t see it as divisive as much as it was defining. People had to decide, am I going to risk being arrested to continue doing this or am I going to back off, and many people risked it. Many people were arrested. I don&#8217;t remember how many but it was hundreds and hundreds. I don&#8217;t even know if it was thousands. JD: Okay. So then I think I need to interview Steve, maybe, because I heard [31:19] [Laughs] GW: He&#8217;s here. JD: Yeah. Was the &#8220;Siege of Atlanta&#8221; a mobilizing force? Did it get a lot more people involved? GW: I think it did. JD: In what ways? What was the impact of it? GW: Well the impact of it was it raised awareness. That was one impact which I think was good. Another impact was that it gave people who beforehand had not been involved&#8212;like Steve and Madia had not been involved&#8212;it gave them a specific course of action. They were passionate about protecting the sanctity of life in the womb and it gave them a course of action that they didn&#8217;t have before, so I think that that was good. I think when people are confronted with an issue that, because I&#8217;m a doer, it is advantageous for them to have an avenue of action. JD: Did the membership in Georgia Right to Life increase in terms of numbers? Do you remember that? GW: No, I really don&#8217;t remember. I don&#8217;t think so. It seems like I would remember if it had. It was more like Right to Life was already here and existed; getting the word out to people that it existed and that there were things that you could do was very difficult. You didn&#8217;t have the internet. Everything had to be written and mailed, or telephone calls, so getting the word out was very difficult. There was a heightened awareness about the issue of the sanctity of life, which was good, but that didn&#8217;t necessarily translate into more people becoming aware of Georgia Right to Life or that they could be part of it. It was not linked. JD: I&#8217;m just going to ask these questions because&#8212; GW: That&#8217;s fine. JD: &#8212;my dissertation studies the Summer of Mercy in Wichita pretty in-depth so it&#8217;s interesting to see the contrast between the Siege of Atlanta and the Summer of Mercy. So I&#8217;m trying to think. You said you came on as president of Georgia Right to Life in 1991. Were there any big changes that came in when you were president? GW: No, I&#8217;m afraid not, very boring. When I became president, the president before me, Tom Smith, was not able to complete his term of office. JD: Was he president during the siege? GW: No. JD: Who was the president during the siege of Atlanta, do you remember? GW: Let&#8217;s see. Tom became president&#8212;in &#8217;89? Tom would have been just after. It was I think John Fuchko. JD: [Sneezes] GW: God bless you. JD: Sorry. [Laughs] Now I&#8217;ll probably sneeze again because I&#8217;m always a double-sneezer. [Laughs] GW: You do two at a time, huh? JD: Unless I say that, and then I don&#8217;t sneeze. [Laughs] GW: Oh, then you need to say that every time. [Laughs] Yeah, I think it was John Fuchko. I have records at home. I probably could look that up. JD: You should think about putting records in an archive somewhere, like personal papers. [Laughs] GW: Oh, I was just thinking I need to go throw them all away. JD: Oh, don&#8217;t throw them away. [Laughs] That&#8217;s the worst thing you can tell a historian. GW: [Laughs] JD: Because there are archives that are getting interested in collecting them, so you should&#8212;. GW: Really? JD: I&#8217;ve done a lot of work up in Massachusetts to get all the activists&#8217; papers in an archive there. GW: Really? JD: But, yeah, archivists are going to really start&#8212;. GW: So what would I do, just call you or email you? JD: I think the people to contact&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know if the Southern [Historical Collection] at UNC would be particularly&#8212;. I mean they could be interested and I&#8217;ll flag it on your interview, but I bet Georgia Tech has an archive where you could donate them. GW: Really? JD: There&#8217;s tons of archives in the Atlanta area because pretty much every college has an archive attached. GW: Really? JD: So it should be something Georgia Right to Life thinks about where the organizations&#8217; papers should eventually go. That should be something discussed in the organization and sort of arranged so that&#8212;. And then when you move instead of throwing them out&#8212;. GW: Which I think we just did. JD: I know. I keep on getting&#8212;. All my oral interviews are about two weeks after people move. Massachusetts Citizens for Life threw out all theirs right before I came and I was in tears. [Laughs] But, yeah, so that when you move you can just transfer those boxes of files to an archive and they&#8217;ll sort them for you and have them available to the public and talk to you about that, but that is something you should consider looking into, and if not&#8212;. I know someone, an archive, that would definitely be interested in Georgia Right to Life, Sallie Bingham at Duke University, and that&#8217;s just because Sallie Bingham has all the Atlanta clinic papers, or a lot of the Atlanta clinic papers, and I know the archivist there is very interested in getting right-to-life organizations&#8217; papers. GW: Okay. JD: But the downfall of it being at Duke is it&#8217;s a long way for you guys to go if you want to consult your papers for anything. But I can give you the name of that archivist [37:50]. GW: Okay, great. JD: But it&#8217;s something to think about in the long haul, and your own personal papers, because they really are&#8212;. You&#8217;d be surprised at how many papers from the movement from the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s are just gone. GW: Oh, I can imagine. JD: And there&#8217;s no history left for us to study because people just tossed it. GW: I mean that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re told to do. JD: [Coughs] I&#8217;m sorry. GW: That&#8217;s okay. JD: [Coughs] Of course the water has gone down the wrong throat. Okay. So then you were mainly&#8212;. Did you do any other kind of education? Did you go do presentations at churches? GW: Yes. JD: [Talk to people]? GW: Yes, all of that. When I was involved with Gwinnett Right to Life I was the education director, the vice president, the president, and as with any all-volunteer organization you wear many hats, and as I explained, my big passion was reaching people, helping them know that there&#8217;s ways to be actively pro-life, that there are other options, solutions, help out there for women in crisis, before and after. JD: So, when you did education presentations do you remember any of the videos that you showed and talked about? GW: Yeah, sure. The first big one that I can remember was&#8212;oh, what was the one before Silent Scream? JD: Assignment: Life? GW: No. [Pause] Oh, my goodness. I can&#8217;t believe I can&#8217;t remember the name of it. Silent Scream was with Charlton Heston, right? JD: Silent Scream had Bernard Nathanson, the famous doctor, narrating. GW: Oh, that&#8217;s it. Okay. Silent Scream is the one we used a lot and then Eclipse of Reason. JD: Okay. GW: Those were the two biggies, and we also before that, believe it or not, we had slides. [Laughs] That is so funny to even think about, but we had a slide presentation that was like gestational development and talking about the abortion procedures and the whole&#8212;and I can&#8217;t remember what that was called but, yeah, that was slides&#8212;. JD: It was probably done by Dr. Willke and his wife, the famous slide [40:35] GW: Yes, right. JD: Okay. GW: Yes, so that slideshow. JD: It&#8217;s funny; I actually had someone say to me, &#8220;What are slides?&#8221; GW: Oh, yes, they will say slides&#8212;. [Laughs] JD: The earlier version of Powerpoint for the computer. GW: That&#8217;s right, it was, and the biggest challenge, as it is today, was learning the technology. You had to be able to bring all that stuff with you, as you know&#8212;. I&#8217;m sorry. JD: It&#8217;s still on? Oh, yeah, you&#8217;re fine. GW: Is it hitting? You know, bringing all the equipment with you, praying that it was going to work, that if there was batteries involved that they worked, and all of that. JD: The one thing that I know, it&#8217;s a little easier today, because someone was telling me they had a three hundred pound projector in the back of their car at all times in the early &#8217;80s and I&#8217;m just like, that&#8217;s a lot to have to lift and do.GW: Well I mean you probably don&#8217;t even remember the video cameras, the size of them, what they used to be. They were monster things, you used to put them up on your shoulders, and now you can&#8217;t even see them they&#8217;re so small. But, yeah, it&#8217;s been interesting. I was trying to look that up for you. JD: So when you became president what were some of your goals? Did you have goals? GW: No, no. As I started to say, Tom Smith was not able to fulfill his term and so I actually had a little bit of his term and then started mine, and it was more of a default, somebody to stick their finger in the hole until somebody else came along. To be honest I was not a good president. [Laughs] JD: No, because sometimes holding the continuum is a really vital service. GW: I guess maybe the better way to say it, I have come to understand that a true leader, the head of an organization that is a statewide organization, or even a county, really needs to have a vision and they need to be able to communicate that vision in such a way that others understand it, buy into it, and can help implement it. I am not that person. I don&#8217;t have visions, so in that respect I really was just a place holder, which was a long time. It was over eight years. JD: So now you said that&#8212;. It sounded like you wanted to talk a little bit more about this, that you grew up Catholic but then you changed churches. What has been the role of the church that you&#8217;re currently in and how has that impacted any activism, or has it? GW: I would say yes, absolutely it has impacted. When you have deeply held beliefs I don&#8217;t see how they cannot impact all areas of your life, and I am a committed Christian. We currently attend a PCA, a Presbyterian Church in America church. We started attending Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale in 1974 and that was because someone&#8212;. I was pregnant with my first child and another lady&#8212;. There were actually about three or four of us that lived in the same general area that were pregnant at the same time and if you&#8217;re pregnant or you have something common like that you get to know one another. She actually shared with me that the Bible teaches that we&#8217;re all sinners and that this is a problem, that God is perfect and holy and he can&#8217;t accept sin into heaven and that he solved the problem by sending Christ to pay for my sins. She shared that information with me and I prayed to receive Christ, so that&#8217;s what happened between when I was raised and then when we started going to the Presbyterian Church, but the Presbyterian Church isn&#8217;t the most important part. The part is that I became a Christian and the impact it has had is that it further solidified my respect for life. I believe that we&#8217;re created in the image of God and that as such there is a sanctity of all human life, from earliest biological beginning to natural death. JD: Do you have a hard time sometimes, because the Presbyterian Church is one of the more mixed bags when it comes to life issues? GW: Well, just like there are Baptists and Methodists and Episcopals and Presbyterians, in the Presbyterian Church there are sub-denominations. So the PCA is more conservative. They hold to a pro-life view. In other words if you look at the foundational documents, they are pro-life whereas some of the other ones, like the PCUS, is more liberal, more progressive, whichever word you want to use, and they do not take a pro-life stand. So I don&#8217;t have a problem with&#8212;. JD: Okay. GW: But I would. I would not be able to support a church that did not have a [pro-life stance]. That would be not possible for me. JD: Did your church become involved? The siege of Atlanta, I mean it drew&#8212;. Randall Terry very much targets ministers and getting ministers on his side when he&#8217;s planning events. Do you remember any of that or any of the behind the scenes or any reflections on that? GW: I was not involved in the behind-the-scenes because I didn&#8217;t personally go. I think I went to maybe one or two of the meetings that were held in various churches to find out more about it and more about what was going on, what the plans were and stuff. But they were primarily in Atlanta and I lived in Snellville so he did not come out into Snellville at all, so I wasn&#8217;t intimately involved in any of that. JD: Okay. GW: I do remember that the meetings that I went to were very well attended and I do remember too that the pro-life community is somewhat&#8212;. You know you kind of know people, kind of thing, and I can remember that there were many people in the meeting that I knew, so it wasn&#8217;t like being with a lot of strangers. JD: Do you remember anything when you were president, any bills that you were lobbying for or any big political initiatives in Georgia or nationally? GW: Yeah, there were. In Georgia when I was president it was really rough because we didn&#8217;t have a pro-life governor. Forget governor, we didn&#8217;t even have a pro-life&#8212;. That&#8217;s back when Tom Murphy was Speaker of the House and he was&#8212;. His daughter was a registered nurse, if I remember correctly, and she was pro-abortion and greatly influenced him, and no pro-life legislation saw the light of day, so it was very difficult from that standpoint. On a national level there were&#8212;. I can remember one time in particular they were trying to reform welfare on a national level&#8212;and I don&#8217;t remember the bill or what it was called or anything&#8212;but one of the concerns was if they were to tell women that you can only have one child that would be on welfare, after that you&#8217;re going to get no resources, that would increase abortion, and I can remember that being a big debate on what the impact of something like that would be. JD: Was Tom Murphy Republican or Democrat? GW: Democrat. JD: Oh, so it&#8217;s like Georgia&#8217;s similar, local and state very strong Democratic party but not a national emphasis. GW: Yes. Yes, he was the longest sitting state Speaker of the House. I forget how many years it was now but it was decades and decades, thirty, forty years, thirty-some years I&#8217;m sure, so he was a very powerful man, very powerful. JD: Were there any big changes in the Republican party that you can remember in the 1990s? I know Georgia Right to Life is nonpartisan but a lot of times because of platforms it ends up endorsing Republican candidates. GW: Oh yeah. I mean we endorse Democratic candidates now, if they meet the criteria and they&#8217;re willing to&#8212;. Georgia Right to Life has changed in how they&#8212;. Their endorsement policy has changed. Are you aware of that? JD: Since 2000, which is the no-exception endorsement. GW: Right. Well, life of the mother is still an exception. JD: Oh, okay. GW: Just not rape/incest. But yeah, so we do have life of the mother. The&#8212;I lost it. Let&#8217;s see, the endorsement policy has changed. What was your question? I&#8217;m sorry. JD: Oh, changes in the Republican party or having to navigate the Republican party. GW: Yes, I mean because it used to be&#8212;. It&#8217;s kind of funny. It used to be that there was a perception that being pro-life was not a winning thing, and now if you&#8217;re a Republican you need to be pro-life. So that&#8217;s been a huge turnaround and in some ways it&#8217;s good and in some ways it&#8217;s bad because you have Republicans who say they&#8217;re pro-life though they&#8217;re not. I guess you always have that, politicians saying they&#8217;re one thing when they really don&#8217;t believe what they&#8217;re saying. JD: Has this been more since 2000 or did that all begin, really getting Republicans for pro-life, did that start in the &#8217;90s? Did it start after the &#8220;Siege of Atlanta?&#8221; I&#8217;m trying to figure out when did the sort of actually ensuring that Republicans at all levels, or, you know, that the Republicans one endorses at all levels are going to actually be&#8212;or pro-life is not the kiss of death in elections. Sorry, that was a very convoluted question. GW: I would think&#8212;. JD: I was just trying to get the language down. GW: My sense is that it was even before our endorsement criteria changed because the&#8212;. We started having people come to us and seek our endorsement before 2000. I mean of course like anything it wasn&#8217;t like one day being a pro-life Republican was a bad thing or a neutral thing, neutral to bad, and then the next day it was, oh yeah, we got to do that. It was a slow change but the change started happening before 2000. JD: If you had to venture a guess for why that changed, why do you think it changed? GW: [Pause] Well I think it was probably a number of reasons. I don&#8217;t think it was any one thing. As time has gone&#8212;I mean we have had thirty-eight years of legal abortion&#8212;and hopefully part of that is people are more aware. Technology has changed so we&#8217;re able to communicate in a more efficient and timely manner. I think part of it is education. Now, I can be slightly biased since that&#8217;s what my bent is anyway, but I believe that people were becoming more aware. I believe also that the polling, the issues, I mean I&#8217;m not a big fan of polling and I know that you can twist it to make it say whatever you want to say really. But I think that the polling actually probably helped too because even though up until just recently when asked the &#8220;are you pro-life or prochoice&#8221; question, up until recently the majority still were saying pro-choice, the numbers were increasing, and there was a reason for that. I believe it&#8217;s because people were becoming more aware of what the Supreme Court decision was and what the fallout was and so on and so forth. I mean there are still people that don&#8217;t realize that abortion is actually still legal through the entire nine months. They don&#8217;t know about partial-birth abortion. I mean education is the greatest challenge for sure, but people slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly are more aware, and I think that&#8217;s what did it. I think that the politicians were cognizant that there were things happening, that there was changes occurring. Certain districts&#8212;I mean obviously each district is different&#8212;but certain districts, their constituents were pro-life and they were becoming more aware of it. JD: What has been the impact of the internet? GW: Oh, overwhelming. It has been a blessing and a curse all in one. [Laughs] I mean we don&#8217;t get federal money. People learning about crisis pregnancy centers, right to life, knowing what the Roe v. Wade decision was, what the other decisions have been since, just disseminating information was so cumbersome, so expensive. If you had a piece of legislation in the Georgia legislature and you wanted to let people know about it, by the time you told them, it was no longer an issue. You either had to have the money to do phone banks and try to call people, and how can you explain legislation in a thirty-second or even a sixty-second message? It was very, very difficult. So I mean the internet has blossomed the ability to communicate. It has also blossomed false information out there, wackos who post all kinds of crazy things, and news outlets pick up on the extremes. They pick up on somebody who has a blog or a website that is&#8212;. I&#8217;m trying to think of what that&#8217;s called. I know that there&#8217;s one out there that&#8212;. What is it that he does? I know it&#8217;s very negative and it&#8217;s something that we would never condone. JD: Targeting, where he puts the list of targets? GW: Yeah, that&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m talking about. JD: Okay, the targeting of abortion providers. GW: Yes, that&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m talking about, so you know people&#8212;. I don&#8217;t like it that people can go to that site and think that that&#8217;s what the pro-life movement is about because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s about. But that&#8217;s inevitably what would get reported on or something. JD: How do you feel about the violence that broke out in the early &#8217;90s and the more recent violence that&#8217;s been going on? GW: Oh, I totally am opposed to it. You have to understand that when I was president is when they had the clinic bombing here in Atlanta and the Olympic Park bombing, so I mean I had FBI agents sitting in my living room. I don&#8217;t understand how someone can say they&#8217;re pro-life and then do something like that because you risk&#8212;. I mean you risk killing people, so to me it&#8217;s anathema. It&#8217;s incongruent. JD: How did you have to handle it, when the Atlanta clinic was bombed? What was your reaction and what were some of the things you had to deal with? GW: Well, we of course sent out a press release, which was virtually ignored, saying that we condemned it and that being pro-life means that you respect all human life, and that includes abortionists. I have so many friends that are post-abortive. I probably have more friends and family that are post-abortive than not. So I mean we sent out press releases and we would answer questions and so on and so forth. There isn&#8217;t anybody that I know of or am associated with that I&#8217;m aware of that&#8212;. Because obviously you have an organization and there may be people on the fringes, but there is nobody that I&#8217;m aware of that would have ever thought that anything like that was acceptable in any way, shape or form. JD: So when the FBI came to investigate, what were your feelings? Did you feel&#8212;. GW: Well it was kind of funny because for some reason they called my husband at work and my husband didn&#8217;t, you know, &#8220;What are you doing calling me?&#8221; They didn&#8217;t make it real plain at first why they were calling and I tease my husband now because when the FBI agent talked to him and my husband realized he said, &#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t want me, you want my wife.&#8221; [Laughs] I said, &#8220;Thanks a lot!&#8221; I mean, they were fine. It wasn&#8217;t one of those stories where they were being aggressive or anything like that. They called my husband; then they called me; we set up an appointment; they came to my house; they asked me questions. It was just one of those situations where they&#8217;re trying to run down, you know, trying to find out who did it. As you know it was, what, five, six, I don&#8217;t know how many years, and I guess they got the right guy, seems like they did. But again, my mind was&#8212;. There were three men, three FBI agents, all of them from out of state, and I&#8217;m thinking once again look at the money and the resources, the time, the energy, that is being spent on this when it could be doing so much more and better&#8212;that was a bad sentence. Believe it or not that was what I came away [with] from that instance, was what a waste of time and money. JD: There are some people who have argued that there has been an increase in violent rhetoric in the larger mainstream of pro-life in terms of, you know, an absolute conflict of values that cannot be resolved, and have pegged that as something that encourages violence. How would you respond? GW: I would respond by saying that I think that&#8217;s their way of framing the issue, framing the debate in such a way to try to silence. I don&#8217;t agree. I don&#8217;t believe that using inflammatory language is going to incite a normal person to do something violent and someone that is not normal is probably going to do what they&#8217;re going to do anyway. JD: What do you think have been some of the biggest successes of Georgia Right to Life since you became involved in &#8217;83? GW: I would say going from an organization that has little or no influence in the legislature to an organization that is sought out for input on legislation, is sought out for endorsement. I would say that was a big success, a big [Pause] something that we were able to do. The most important thing, I think, was when Georgia Right to Life came, [Pause] when we&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know if you would say we &#8220;became.&#8221; [Pause] Georgia Right to Life is a Christian ministry and for a long time we tried not to be. Does that make sense? So I think that that was very important and defining. JD: Did this happen in 2000, around 2000&#8212; GW: Yes. JD: &#8212;when Dan Becker came in and they just decided to lay their cards on the table, so to speak. GW: Yes. JD: What&#8217;s been the response to the billboard campaign that came out, the &#8220;Black children are an endangered species&#8221; billboard campaign? Is my understanding correct that Georgia Right to Life provided the funds for that particular billboard campaign? GW: Oh, we did more than provide the&#8212;. We asked Ryan to do it, so yeah. JD: Okay. What is your reflection on everything that&#8217;s come from that? GW: Oh I think it&#8217;s good. I think any time you can make people think, any time you can get&#8212;. I mean we&#8217;ve been talking on and off about how difficult education is and making people aware of what&#8217;s really happening, so I think any time you can get their attention and make them think and dialogue, I think that&#8217;s a good thing. I think that&#8217;s a good thing. I know that there was mixed reaction, I know some people looked at the billboards in a negative way, looked at it in a racist way. But obviously Ryan, Catherine, everything, I mean it was obviously not the intention and I still don&#8217;t see it. So I think it was a very good thing. When you have a society that is proportionately killing more of a&#8212;. I mean the whole thing is so stupid. When you have, I think it&#8217;s fifty-eight&#8212;. I think the black population in Georgia is around twenty-eight percent and yet they account for fifty-seven percent of the abortions. You can&#8217;t help but ask why and start investigating, and then when you find out that those statistics are being mirrored all across the country, especially in urban areas, how can you not ask yourself why is this happening? I mean as a human being I don&#8217;t want history to go back and say what they&#8217;re saying about what people were doing during Jim Crow or during Hitler or all that. I want to be able to say I wasn&#8217;t standing idly by while this was going on. I want my grandchildren to know, because I agree that children in the womb are an endangered species, black children in particular. I mean we have so much&#8212;I&#8217;m sure you know about the Lila Rose, the Live Action videos? JD: Mm mm [Indicates no]. GW: No way! JD: No, what are they? GW: Oh my goodness, you definitely have to look that up. I forget what school she was in. Was it Berkeley? No, it wasn&#8217;t Berkeley. It started as a group on campus and they took cameras. She&#8217;s very young looking, she&#8217;s tiny, and she posed as an underage girl going in for an abortion with an older boyfriend, fianc&#233;, whatever. Anyway, they have a number of them. They&#8217;re on YouTube. Her ministry is Live Action.org, I think. But anyway, they did one video expos&#233; where they called Planned Parenthoods and abortion facilities, Planned Parenthood primarily, and asked them about could they donate if the money would be used to abort black children only, and the response was just horrifying, I mean horrifying. [Sound of mobile phone vibrating] JD: I&#8217;m sorry. GW: That&#8217;s okay. JD: I thought it was on silent. GW: That was pretty silent. JD: That&#8217;s Catherine Davis giving me a call. [Laughs] GW: You can take it if you want to. JD: Oh no. She&#8217;s supposed to leave me a message with directions to her house so I can interview her this afternoon. GW: Okay. So&#8212;how did we get to Live Action? JD: I was asking about the billboard campaign, but you were talking about Planned Parenthood and the donations before the call interrupted. GW: Right, yes, and I was just saying that I don&#8217;t want someday, you know, my grandchildren&#8212;. I want to be able to say that I was actively doing something to stop this&#8212;. It&#8217;s genocide. I mean there&#8217;s no other way to say it. When you systematically kill one people group, that&#8217;s the definition. JD: I&#8217;m just going to ask your response. I&#8217;m just listing some people&#8217;s reactions and asking for your response. There were some reactions saying that the campaign particularly targeted black women and their decision-making ability. GW: How so? JD: Calling into question, you know, a black woman&#8217;s ability to exercise choice and make those decisions about her life by sort of making them dupes of the industry, so to speak, of the abortion industry or Planned Parenthood, that they&#8217;re being fooled into it, that the campaign&#8217;s looking at it that way instead of acknowledging that many black women are making these decisions themselves without&#8212;. Does that make sense? GW: Yes. JD: I&#8217;m trying to repeat one of the lines of the critique and asking for your response to it. GW: Yes, yes, but I mean we are all influenced&#8212;. I think that that is just a smokescreen to divert from the real issue, and the real issue is we are all influenced by the media, by the rhetoric that we hear in the world around us. We can&#8217;t help it. I can say to you that I realize that a certain newspaper is more liberal than what I like, I can tell you that most of the stories are not accurate because they are presented from that viewpoint, blah, blah, blah, and I can sit down and read that newspaper and still be influenced by it. So when SisterSong, Loretta Ross in particular, comes back with the rhetoric that we&#8217;re accusing women of being dupes or being uneducated and not capable of making their own decisions, it&#8217;s just a smokescreen because the truth of the matter is instead of dealing with the facts, and the facts are in Georgia black women are aborted twice as much as their population. I don&#8217;t know, I probably didn&#8217;t say the statistic exactly right, but that is the fact. And instead of dealing with that she is bringing up a whole other issue, saying we&#8217;re saying black women are being duped and they&#8217;re not educate-able and they&#8217;re not making their own decisions, blah, blah, blah. That isn&#8217;t the point. That isn&#8217;t the point. The point is that&#8212;. If I was a black woman&#8212;and you&#8217;ll see this with Catherine and Alveda&#8212;if I was a black woman I would be outraged. I would be saying, what is going on here? Am I being targeted? And no, she&#8217;s just throwing out rhetoric so she doesn&#8217;t have to answer the question. JD: As a woman have you felt empowered by your activism? GW: Yes. JD: In what ways? GW: I have to go back to my friend, because now when I meet a woman who is in a crisis pregnancy I can tell her where she can find help. I can tell her that I know other women who have had abortions, and that they regret them and they would be willing to talk to her. I know people&#8212;. I mean you know you hear, again more smokescreens and rhetoric, but: If you have this baby, who&#8217;s going to raise the baby? Well, you know what? There are people out there that do, all the time. So now I can help. JD: Do you have anything you&#8217;d like to add at this point in time? Well, I want to thank you for your time. GW: You&#8217;re very welcome. I told you, not nearly as interesting as Dan. [Laughs] JD: I think it was pretty interesting. GW: Well you will enjoy talking to Catherine. She&#8217;s a very dynamic speaker and very interesting...
