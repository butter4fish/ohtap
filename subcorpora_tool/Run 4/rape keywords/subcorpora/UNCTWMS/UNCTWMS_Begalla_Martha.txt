 Joey Fink: This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee. It&#8217;s May 13th 2011, and I&#8217;m speaking with Martha Begalla. Begalla&#8230; am I saying your name right? Martha Begalla: Begalla. JF: Begalla&#8230;at her home in Knoxville. Marty, could you start by telling me when and where you were born, and a little bit about what it was like where you grew up? MB: I was born in 1945, which was right at the close of World War II, and I was born on an army air core base, and I remember absolutely nothing about that. My first memory is moving from Denver, Colorado. My father had gotten out of the service, worked in Denver and my first memory is coming back across the country to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Because Daddy had taken a job with Alcoa, and we lived outside of Pittsburgh in a little steel town called Aliquippa. That&#8217;s where I started to school, and went to elementary school there, junior high school, high school, and then left and went to college. Aliquippa was a steel town, and since Daddy worked for Alcoa and took the train everyday there was hardly anybody there that my father worked with. Everybody else in the town worked for the same company. There was one steel mill there and that was Jones and Laughlin. We had no relatives there, and my father&#8217;s parents where deceased. They were from eastern Pennsylvania but my mother&#8217;s family - she was the only one of six children that ever left Orange County, Georgia. So for every big holiday, well, really for Christmas and then all summer we always went back to Cogdell, Georgia. So that was somewhat different because in Aliquippa [there were] huge, huge families with lots of relatives there. Of course we had no relatives [there]. [Pause] I was a wonderful student. JF: I was going to ask, was there an expectation that you would go on to college? MB: Oh, I can remember being asked where I wanted to go to college when I was seven. There was just my sister and myself, so there were no boys in our family. So, all of that high achievement went to me and my sister. She&#8217;s deceased now, but both of us had doctorates and neither one of us had children. JF: Do you think your parents were surprised that you went as far to get your doctorate? Did they think that perhaps you&#8217;d go to college and then-- MB: Get married. JF: Get married and have babies. MB: Oh yeah. When I finally said I was getting married my father said, &#8220;Well it&#8217;s about time.&#8221; JK: How old were you when you got married? MB: Twenty-five, that was very old back then. VERY old back then. JF: [Laughs] Where did you go to college and how did you make the choice for that college? MB: [Laughs] Well that&#8217;s a great story. I went to the college of Wooster, which was in Ohio, a Presbyterian liberal arts college. It was the only co-ed school that I applied to. I got rejected from Radcliffe, I got rejected from Pembroke, I got in to Agnes Scott in Atlanta, but by then my ego was all bruised and so I just decided I&#8217;d go as close to home as possible and went to Wooster. JF: And what year was this? MB: 1967, no 1964. From 1964 to 1967, and that was during all the civil rights stuff. JF: Wooster, if I remember from my other readings, was a pretty progressive-- MB: Very. JF: liberal place with a lot of activism going on? MB: Yeah, very. We had a very activist minister, who was doing a lot with the civil rights movement down in Birmingham. We were all doing stuff like tutoring people and all kinds of things that we thought - that was also during the time of Kent State. I wasn&#8217;t sure I liked Wooster, but anyway, my mother came to check on me one weekend so I took her to church, thought that&#8217;d be a good thing to do. She was horrified because the minister had just gotten back from Selma. She was a girl from South Georgia and she thought I had gone to [the] devil in a hand basket. So that was not the thing I should have done. That&#8217;s probably the first place where I really got involved in things that had a social conscience to them. Yeah. JF: Can you remember a particular moment or instance when you heard about something or heard people talking about something or read something about the civil rights movement or other activism that made you think, like, I should be part of this or I could be part of this? MB: Yes, all over the campus. There would be lectures; I took a lot of Southern History. There was a major in Southern History and I took a lot of those courses. So I guess that&#8217;s -- a lot of things like that on campus. JF: And so, when you were getting your degree in Economics, what did you think -- what were your aspirations for after graduation? MB: Well, I wasn&#8217;t sure because I set out to major in math, because that&#8217;s what my father wanted me to. When I got a &#8216;D&#8217; in second year calculus, I decided maybe this wasn&#8217;t the thing to do. And so I thought, well, I probably would go to business school, but I ended up going to graduate school in college administration because I had been very active on campus. I was the president of the Women&#8217;s Student Government Association, and the Dean of Women was very instrumental in saying, &#8220;You know you really out to think about college administration.&#8221; So that&#8217;s how I got into that. JF: Excellent, and did you have a sense that the encouragement you were getting was a little unusual for a young woman in the late [19]60&#8217;s? Being pushed into leadership roles and further higher education, or did it seem very natural and- MB: Well, because I had been so active. I just assumed that I could do that. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I figured out that you can&#8217;t do that. [Laughs] JF: What was your moment of realizing that &#8216;I&#8217;m a little different?&#8217; MB: Well when started looking around in your first job and realizing that you may have an entry level position, but the chances were you weren't going to move up particularly high in the organization. So it was more when I went to work, I think. JF: What was your first job like? MB: My first job was fabulous, too. It was Assistant Dean of Women at the University of Tennessee. We transitioned from a Dean of Women&#8217;s Office to a more women&#8217;s focused programming. Got rid of a lot of traditional functions, and I loved it&#8230; just loved it. JF: Great, I&#8217;d love to hear some more about that, so is that what brought you to Tennessee originally? MB: Yes. JF: And were you, to get a timeline, were you married by then? MB: No. JF: Did you know your husband? MB: No, met my husband at the University of Tennessee. This was after my master&#8217;s program. Then we met, we worked together, we married. If you wanted to go on and get another degree [the University of Tennessee] would pay for that and that&#8217;s how I got my doctorate. So I got that at the University of Tennessee. JF: What year did you arrive at Tennessee to take the Assistant Dean of Women Position? MB: 1969. JF: 1969&#8230; was the University de-segregated then? MB: Yes. JF: Do you remember any talk around that or events around that? MB: No, there were more events around student governance and student input. That was much more what we were dealing with. Getting rid of things like women&#8217;s hours, I can remember all of us on the administrative staff getting locked out of a student demonstration at a retreat that we went on, where all the students sort of coalesced and I can&#8217;t even remember what the issues where. Do you remember during the Democratic Convention [in Chicago]? [Pause] That was back [during] Kent State and all of that kind of thing. I&#8217;m trying to think, what was the issue here? We had a huge demonstration and we all were locked in our offices. I can&#8217;t remember! [Laughs] JF: When you say you were locked in your offices, like, you locked yourself in for safety or you got barred into your offices by the demonstrators, or-- MB: Oh, by the demonstrators. At this retreat, we all got locked out at the retreat. Then on campus, the upper level administration had a command post, anytime there was any difficulty, so they were off campus someplace. The younger staff we were all supposed to be on the front lines, listening to the police. We knew, because we knew enough about the students, the nothing was going to happen. So we just stayed in our offices and had a great time, drank champagne. Every time the people would call from the command center we&#8217;d tell them things were terrible, just terrible. Isn&#8217;t that awful? JF: Can you tell me a little bit about getting rid of the curfew for women? MB: That was done the year before I got here, and there had been a student demonstration about that. JF: So undergraduate female students who lived on campus had a curfew at their dorms. MB: Yes. JF: Did the male students have a curfew? MB: No. JF: Do you remember hearing about some of the things the female students did to protest it or-- MB: I think it was just-- JF: the strategies they used? MB: I think it was just a demonstration with a large number of people. JF: So it seems, so it wasn&#8217;t&#8230; what&#8217;s the word I&#8217;m looking for? It kind of went through fairly easily? Getting the women&#8217;s hours removed? MB: Yes. But wasn&#8217;t it about time? JF: Goodness, right? MB: Right. JF: I couldn&#8217;t imagine that. Coming from the north to the south, what were your impressions of the politics on campus? Were you surprised by any of the policies or attitudes? MB: No, I guess I was really surprised at how activist the students were. I was very surprised about that. Having so many relatives in the south, I wasn&#8217;t at all surprised at the diversity between the activists and the more traditional students. JF: So tell me some more about your time at the University of Tennessee. You started of as Assistant Dean of Women. MB: I did, and then when we moved into women&#8217;s programming I helped some of the faculty like Sue Bent and Suzanne Kurth get Women&#8217;s Studies started. We formed a commission for women; that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll talk to Lida Barrett about. That was about the time of Title IX. We had a university wide task force to see what the implication would be for athletics at the University of Tennessee. So I&#8217;d say athletics, commission for women, women&#8217;s programs, women&#8217;s studies - it was an exciting time - and continuing education for women. We had a group that worked on trying to bring women back into the university that either didn&#8217;t finish their degree or wanted to get additional education sorts of things. And that&#8217;s how I think we got started, I&#8217;m trying to reconstruct all this, into doing a community based women&#8217;s center. [It] was because so much of everything was centered on the campus and there were so many other concerns about women in the community. Oh, I know, we also started the Rape Crisis Center, which is now the Sexual Assault Crisis Center. JF: What was that like getting that started up? MB: Well, this is interesting because we just had a big reunion last night of all of the founders. It was VERY controversial cause there&#8217;ve been a number of rapes around the university. Melvin Laird was the Secretary of Defense under, who was he Secretary of Defense under? [Pause] Trying to think, way back when, anyway. His daughter was in school here and when she was at home in Washington, over summer vacation, she went to visit the first Rape Crisis Center that was sent up in the country and that was in Washington DC. She came back and got a group of faculty and graduate students and we were the second Rape Crisis Center that was set up in the United States. The current mayor at that time was an attorney and he helped with all incorporation and those sorts of things. A lot of resistance from the police, which is very different today. Now there&#8217;s a great deal of collaboration, we even have a forensic nursing part of the center. Victims are not even taken to the hospital initially; they&#8217;re all brought to the nursing unit at the Sexual Assault Crisis Center. JF: What was the resistance, what the resistance was about in the [19]70&#8217;s-- MB: From the police? Oh, &#8220;she deserved it.&#8221; You know, &#8220;she brought on the rape.&#8221; Just all those real, real traditional- in fact last night the chief of police said to us, he said, &#8220;You know, law enforcement really has changed in those thirty-seven years.&#8221; JF: Wow. MB: Yeah, it&#8217;s unbelievable. Because now all of the police transport victims to the Sexual Assault Crisis Center. JF: So it sounds like there was-- MB: Lot of stuff going on. JF: A group of women that just a lot of different interests and issues and activities. So these women were instrumental in starting up the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center? MB: There was a group of; Jane Weeks. Did Jane teach Sociology at Carson Newman? JF: Mm hm. MB: OK, she was very active in the community. Merikay Waldvogal, have you heard people, have you interviewed her? JF: One of my colleagues did. MB: OK, Marty Alman was another one of the women that was very involved with that. I'll never forget, we died laughing. We had $246 and I said there is no way we can start an organization, we&#8217;ve got to get some more money. Well they talked me out of it and said &#8216;no we can start it&#8217; and [we] were able to start that organization with less than $250. Got space from the city, had a resource center, did all kinds of programs. I would take part of my programming money from the university and use it to help support some of the programs. JF: What for you was the most important issue, or what did you think was the most important topic or issue to work on for women? MB: Oh, for me it was careers. But I think everybody tends to approach whatever their cause is from a personal prospective. So for me, I was very achievement-oriented, career-oriented and so I tended towards programming and ideas around that and that sort of thing. JF: I remember in listening to some of the interviews that have been done, one of the things that I read about they did at the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center was assertiveness training, can you tell me a little about that and what that was like? MB: That&#8217;s interesting; people don&#8217;t do that anymore do they? [Laughter] That&#8217;s so funny! That is so funny. Assertiveness training, it was a behavioral methodology for people to learn how to clearly express their ideas and their emotions; without being defensive, being clear, being non-judgmental. I&#8217;m trying to think what kinds of self-improvement things people might take today. People today might take something like negotiation skills. Leadership skills. So there were different types of skill-based things that women could use in their work, in their communities. That&#8217;s interesting&#8230; isn&#8217;t that funny, because we taught at the counseling center, we taught it in the community and people don&#8217;t teach that anymore. JF: I don&#8217;t usually hear about it-- MB: Joey that&#8217;s funny, I haven&#8217;t thought about that in years. JF: I think that there&#8217;s similar kinds of training and education going on, but it&#8217;s usually not specifically directed towards women or taught about in terms of gender and equality. You know. MB: That&#8217;s fascinating. That is fascinating. We would do things like financial skills, any kind of career interviewing, all those sorts of things. JF: And how did women find out about this? MB: We did a lot of publicity. See back then there was no internet, there was no email. So everything was newspaper, television, and mail&#8230; snail mail, published brochures, word of mouth. We would get organizations to sponsor things so that they would get their members to come. Posters&#8230; really antiquated sounding now isn&#8217;t it? JF: No. Did you get a sense that women were really hungry for this kind of thing? That they were excited to see, like, if they saw a poster it was like, &#8220;Oh, wow, somebody&#8217;s doing this!&#8221; MB: No, we had to drum up business in the community. There was a certain easy group to get, and then of course people were very skeptical. &#8220;What do we need this for&#8221; and &#8220;Who are these women's lib people&#8217; and all that sort of thing. So we would have to drum up. Now if we had a really, really good speaker a lot of people would show up. I still think that&#8217;s sort of true of community-based programs anyway, and of course now there&#8217;s so much on television. JF: The focus on community, I&#8217;m wondering if that was related to some of the war on poverty programs that came out of the Johnson administration, like the community action programs. Or was there sort of a longer tradition in Knoxville, where there older organizations or associations that you worked with like League of Women Voters or YWCA that had that kind of community-based focus? MB: We were all, in the [19]60&#8217;s, I think convinced that change occurred in a large scale community-based fashion. You&#8217;ve seen that kind of flip flop now when people target individuals for change. So the idea of being Barack Obama and being a community organizer, that was such a big issue because people associated that with coming out of the [19]60's. As opposed to some of the more religious things that are happening now, that change occurs within the individual. We worked with institutions [and] community groups. But we did, I think we believed that you would get institutional change by changing the system. Now, why was this in Knoxville? The University [of Tennessee] was here. Knoxville is in the South but it&#8217;s not southern like Memphis or New Orleans. Knoxville has a real strong mountain rural independent kind of streak to it. I think outsiders are much more welcome in Knoxville than they are some other places in the South. Like I wasn&#8217;t from here and I got to do a lot of things that you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily get to do if you were in another real closed southern town. JF: Did you feel like Knoxville, you know, was a city&#8230; or did it feel more like a small town, or-- MB: Largest small town you&#8217;ll ever live in. JF: [Laughs] Did that make it easier or harder or maybe both to do community based organizing? MB: I think it made it easier in the sense that your spread wasn&#8217;t so --, but there&#8217;s some real entrenched things here that you would, would make it difficult. Yep. JF: In the interview I did with Wanda Sobieski, she said, it&#8217;s kind of a small community. You can&#8217;t offend somebody and go to a different community and get away from them. You have to deal with the same people, so you have to be a little more-- MB: I think change has occurred more here from within systems than it has from without. Although I think you need both. But having always worked internal to organizations... JF: Can you give me an example of that, like say in the university system of where.. MB: Well I would say you had some very activist type students who would [put] political pressure on the top administrators, but then when it got time to implement things it usually fell back on those of us that were internal to come up with whatever the design might be, whatever was needed. So I think it was external pressure and then like the women&#8217;s curriculum, women's studies curriculum. JF: Were you part of the development of that? MB: Yes, we had a-- JF: Can you tell me some-- MB: Yeah, we had a group that was put together to design the curriculum. Then I taught, as a graduate student, a course over in the college of education. Those women faculty members really took a lot of heat for coming up with curriculum ideas in very traditional departments. JF: Like bringing women&#8217;s history into the history department, or gender issues into psychology? MB: Took a lot of heat. Getting them from just non-credit offerings into the curriculum. Really took a lot of heat. That&#8217;s one place where, well Suzanne [Kurth] probably would be a good person to talk to about that&#8230; and Cheryl Travis. JF: What kind of resistance from male faculty and male administrators did women get for trying to bring the women&#8217;s studies curriculum into the disciplines? MB: I would say it made it more difficult for them to get tenure, to have their research respected. I think it would also be the atmosphere in an academic department. When we started working on women&#8217;s inter-collegiate athletics it was very, very financial. JF: Meaning? MB: That all the money that was spent on athletics was all spent on men. We had a student activity fee that funded athletics, none of which went to women. So the men&#8217;s athletic department was very anti- women&#8217;s athletics because it was a financial issue. So I think for the women faculty, it got targeted on their careers and their career advancement. For the administrators, the athletics, Knoxville is a very athletically-oriented community. Not only in the University but outside. It was really resented. Have you interviewed Pat Head Summit? JF: No. MB: OK, she&#8217;s the female basketball coach. Probably the best one in the country. She was a graduate student at the time, and she had people selling doughnuts to get money to, you know, fund their teams. All the men&#8217;s athletics now they would hire her in a heartbeat to be the athletic director. But now that's been a thirty or thirty five year career. So it was, I would say, it was really individuals. People like Suzanne Kurth and Susan Becker, whose now deceased, but outstanding scholars. Cheryl Travis is just an outstanding scholar, and has gotten all kinds of recognition nationally. I&#8217;m sure it was hard for them. JF: Did you consider yourself part of the women&#8217;s movement in the 1970&#8217;s? MB: Yes. JF: And would you call, did you call yourself a feminist? MB: Yes. JF: What did that mean to you, what did feminism mean to you? MB: I guess it was a political recognition that women were equal and that there were issues that had to be addressed to make that happen. So I guess that&#8217;s&#8230; JF: I&#8217;ve noticed sometimes, I&#8217;m surprised when some women will talk about being part of the women&#8217;s movement but then say they didn&#8217;t call themselves a feminist or didn&#8217;t think of themselves as a feminist. Did you see that in the [19]70&#8217;s? What do you think the resistance to feminism from women who otherwise supported issues of women&#8217;s rights&#8230; where do you think that was coming from? MB: Probably a sense of insecurity about being labeled in a negative way. Whatever negative might have seemed to them. Being careful not to be identified with anything that was too liberal&#8230; flaky&#8230; that sort of thing. JF: Were there concerns of, you know, that being called a feminist you might get associated with the sexual liberation or the-- MB: You know I completely forgot about that, you&#8217;re probably right-- JF: Lesbian-- MB: You&#8217;re probably right about that, yeah, you&#8217;re probably right about that. JF: Did you ever encounter anything like that, getting accused of being a lesbian, or promiscuous or something because you&#8217;re out pushing for women&#8217;s rights? MB: [Shakes head no] I got to do some really neat things nationally. There was a woman at the University of Pittsburgh who had a department of education grant for improving the status of women in higher education. They ran an institute and I went to that one summer and then I was one of six people chosen to have an institute at the University of Tennessee. When I went to the national meeting, people where there like Gloria Steinem. What made me think about it is, there was a lesbian woman who had written a book called, Sappho was a Right on Woman. So I got to meet all these really kind of neat people. Betty Freidan was there&#8230; So it was fun. JF: That reminded me that Suzanne Kurth showed me a poster from an event in 1971 where Betty Freidan came to speak at the University. Do you recall anything from her visit? MB: She was neat. Yeah, she was neat. JF: How long did she stay in town? MB: Trying to remember whether she, I can&#8217;t even remember whether she came in, but we got to eat with her, or be with her after the speech. That&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s funny, that&#8217;s all I remember about it. JF: Was she what you expected or-- MB: I found her a little more entertaining than I thought she would be, a little less strident. I&#8217;ll tell you who was the most impressive, was Gloria Steinem. Unbelievable. JF: When did you first hear her speak or meet her? MB: When I was in that, when was that conference? Trying to remember, it was mid-[19]70&#8217;s I think. After Katherine Pearson&#8230; must have been mid-[19]70&#8217;s. JF: Sort of speaking of like the social interactions, did you attend book clubs or book groups meetings, reading groups with other women? Did you ever do a consciousness-raising program-- MB: Oh yes. OK, I did a consciousness-raising group but I never did a book club. JF: OK. MB: Doing book clubs now, but I didn&#8217;t a book club then. [Laughter] JF: What was that, what were your experiences like? MB: Oh, I love all that groupie stuff, oh yeah. JF: How old were you, when&#8230; do you recall? MB: I think, I&#8217;m trying to remember, I would have been right out of graduate school so I would have been [pause] oh let&#8217;s see twenty-six&#8230; twenty-seven? We ran consciousness-raising groups also with the counseling center. JF: At the counseling center at the University or at the-- MB: Mm hm. JF: Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center? MB: and then we ran some consciousness raising groups at the Women&#8217;s Center I think, I can&#8217;t remember. JF: What kind of things did ya&#8217;ll talk about? MB: Just all kinds, I mean just every issue, every jobs, opportunity, sexual related issues, legislation, just all kinds of stuff. People don&#8217;t do that anymore do they? JF: No. MB: You&#8217;re missing out. [Laughs] You are, you&#8217;re missing out. I think the world is so competitive now that people don&#8217;t really share and support one another. You know that was a big thing for us. Sharing, supporting, singing kumbayah&#8230;You know [Laughs] All of that kind of stuff. JF: [Laughs] I&#8217;m going to stop and skip to the next track to make sure we don&#8217;t lose anything. MB: Sure. JF: What did you think the Knoxville women&#8217;s movement had in common with the national women&#8217;s movement and what do you think was different or unique about the movement here in Knoxville? MB: Oh, this was much slower, much less activist. But that it had in common, it was not a main line, you know it was definitely on the fringes. We benefited from things that happened nationally I&#8217;m sure. Like I know for sure, in higher education and athletics&#8230; things like that. The women getting into non-traditional fields, I think we benefited from sort of being - we were certainly not setting the pace. JF: You mentioned women getting into non-traditional fields. That was a pretty big part of the Women&#8217;s Center right? MB: Right. JF: Can you tell me a little bit about that? MB: Well, because most of the job opportunities- everything from trade type jobs- we got a huge grant at one point, I think I was off the board by then, but we got a huge grant for women in the trades. Looking at women in law, women in medicine, women in the sciences&#8230; and honing in on those different areas because women were so unfamiliar with them. JF: What was the reaction from women who came into the Center? Were they coming in asking for help to get the training to get into these jobs or did they-- MB: Usually, if someone came to the Women&#8217;s Center they were already- they weren&#8217;t just walking in off the street. Now, they might, someone might bring them to a conference or something but basically people were interested in finding really good information and wanted to find information on opportunities. JF: Did you have African American women who were part of the Women&#8217;s Center? MB: Not as many as we would have liked. Trying, Joey, I can&#8217;t remember. JF: I&#8217;m going to speak with Gale Robinson next week, do you remember Gale Robinson? MB: Yes, yes. [Pause] I&#8217;m trying to think, like, on the commission for women at UT if we had an African American nursing person. Huge concern, yep. JF: What do you think accounts for the smaller number of black women interested in or getting involved in the Women&#8217;s Center? MB: Oh, I would say a couple of things. One, there is, there are not that many African Americans in Knoxville. It&#8217;s only like 12 to 13 percent. The other thing is there&#8217;s very, the women&#8217;s movement in Knoxville was very much a middle class and upper income movement, and there, just in terms of the African Americans, very few professional class African Americans in Knoxville. Very few, not as many students at the University are African American. Also, very much perceived as white movement on the part of African Americans. JF: Did that change at all, over the years or-- MB: Oh, I think that got somewhat better. I haven&#8217;t been associated with the University in a long time but I know there&#8217;s been a real effort to recruit black students for instance. I definitely think it&#8217;s a non-inclusionary kind of thing. JF: What about with poor women or working-class women? MB: Same issue, okay, is that, except for jobs programs, I think the women&#8217;s movement was very much perceived as a middle and upper income. JF: Did you see any overlap or alliances with other organizations or groups in Knoxville that maybe wouldn&#8217;t have identified as part of the women&#8217;s movement but-- MB: Oh like the League of Women Voters, the YWCA, the Girl Scouts&#8230; League of Women Voters was probably&#8230; Planned Parenthood was very involved. Trying, can&#8217;t think of any others. Couple of religious organizations, like the Unitarian Church-- [Door closes] Hey Moe! Jim, this is, this is the person interviewing me-- Jim: Hi! JF: Hi! MB: Joey is from UNC. [Thunder in the distance] Jim: I wanted to get [the dog, Moe] out before it started to storm. MB: Yeah. JF: Let&#8217;s see&#8230; Were you involved in the struggle to get the ERA passed? MB: In the state? JF: Mm hm. MB: No. I mean, I signed petitions, that kind of stuff but that was about as much as I did. JF: You supported it? MB: Yep. JF: Why do you think it didn&#8217;t pass? MB: Oh, politics. You know, I mean, just pure and simple. It&#8217;s a very conservative place. JF: One thing that I&#8217;ve heard a lot from women in the professions or in higher education, is that when they got in the job market or applied to grad school or law school, there was the idea that you could have a family or a career, but you couldn&#8217;t have both. So if you were going to choose a career, you couldn&#8217;t have a family and if you had a family you couldn&#8217;t-- did you run into that? MB: As a matter of fact, this was the funniest thing, I was cleaning out some files that I found in my office at TVA for some purpose, I can&#8217;t remember what, and found the interview notes that people had made about me when I interviewed there and the head of employment had written: &#8220;Strong candidate, however, not sure that she can do the amount of travel if she has children.&#8221; Written down. Written down. I used to give an awful lot of talks and that was one of my big topics, was the issue of, &#8220;Do you have to be a super woman to be able to do - &#8221; [Speaking to her husband] Which way is [the dog] going? Jim: Well, we&#8217;re going out front. MB: Oh, okay. Bye Moe. JF: [Laughter] Aw, that&#8217;s a cute dog. MB: She is cute. [Pause] That was one of my topics. That was very much - by the time I figured out that I wanted children it was too late. I don&#8217;t have any children, but I was very career-oriented. I would say that is, it&#8217;s a pretty good description. JF: A lot of women ended up re-evaluating their relationships with their partners or their husbands because of conflict over career or family. Was your husband supportive of your career? MB: Oh, very, very. But his mother always worked. So he had a really strong role model. I was just fortunate enough, both of us were able to find things to do here, so we never moved. That, particularly for women on the faculty, that&#8217;s hard&#8230; to be able to find two jobs. I was able to always stay in the same field but I moved from the university to TVA to a hospital system. As opposed to moving from this university to another town to another University. JF: Yeah, I&#8217;ve heard in interviews with other women that they were warned that &#8220;You&#8217;re never going to find a husband if you&#8217;re uppity or bossy or too smart or if you&#8217;re a threat to their jobs, that you might take their jobs.&#8217; MB: Well, I already felt that way because I was 25 and that was considered to be an old maid&#8230; [Laughter]&#8230;that&#8217;s, so I didn&#8217;t need anybody to tell me, I already felt that way, I got the message from TV or somewhere. JF: What do you think-- MB: Dreamt it up myself I don&#8217;t know! [Laughter] JF: [Laughter] You ended up getting your doctorate and ended up having this very successful career. What do you think in your personality or your background or your education gave you the sense that you could do this, and you could, you didn&#8217;t have to make these choices between, you know, a marriage and a career or being personal happy or being professionally happy? MB: I am kind of an overachiever and I always did something I loved. So it was very easy to want to achieve when the work you were doing was related to being a female. Because I was in women&#8217;s programs, I was in management and leadership development at TVA, so everything [about] my entire career was very personally congruent. What was of concern to me as an individual was the work I was doing. It was all the same thing. I was not a data entry person someplace [where] there was no connection to being female and being a data entry person. My work was really relevant to who I was. JF: What would you consider to be your biggest accomplishment? Or one of you favorite moments in your career? MB: A couple of things; One was getting the management development program started at TVA and then the other one was, I led our led our hospital system through getting the state quality award. JF: Oh, wow! MB: So those are probably two of the things I would say, yeah. JF: Well, I would like to ask seemingly mundane questions-- MB: Sure. JF: But I always like to know, what were you watching on TV or movies in the [19]70&#8217;s, what did you think of them? MB: Oh how interesting. You know, I&#8217;ve never gone to very many movies and I read a lot. JF: What were you reading? MB: Mainly things related to work. I&#8217;m just not a movie person or a TV person&#8230; I watch the news all the time, so I am in tune I think with what issues are. But people used to say to me, &#8216;have you seen whatever&#8217; and I hadn&#8217;t. [Laughter] I hadn&#8217;t! JF: Do you think that because of the women&#8217;s movement in the [19]70&#8217;s women have been better represented in media like in magazines or-- MB: I do-- JF: Newspapers, images of women-- MB: I do-- JF: And issues of gender? MB: More female newscasters. [It] comes and goes I think with politicians and how many women are running for office. I think there are certain professions where women have really made great strides, the law is one. But there&#8217;s still a huge glass ceiling in business. It&#8217;s hard coming, yeah. JF: Another topic that I&#8217;ve talked to women about is what they wore and their appearance, because I&#8217;ve noticed that it was an issue for some women being concerned about looking professional or-- MB: Oh that was me, little Miss Professional. My husband always - we always used to joke and he said, &#8220;Marty, I have two rules.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t care what I did. He said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do, I just want you to keep working and not wear pants to work.&#8221; Is that not hysterical? I mean, now I don&#8217;t wear anything but pants. You know, I was always&#8230; always very [pause] wanted to look professional. JF: Why didn&#8217;t he want you to wear pants to work? MB: Well that was the professional part. That was the professional part. JF: In the [19]70s? MB: Dress for success. JF: What kind of outfits did you wear, what did they look like? MB: Oh, all kinds of neat suits and dresses and very conservative. I didn&#8217;t get a pair of blue jeans until I was probably twenty-five. Isn&#8217;t that funny? I mean now - I went out for lunch today that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve got this on. [Laughs] I was a hippie in college, was a hippie in college. JF: Yeah? MB: Back in the hippie days. JF: Were you part of the anti-war movement? How did you feel about the Vietnam War? MB: Dead against it. Dead, dead, dead against it. My high school boyfriend was killed in Vietnam and oh yeah, absolutely. JF: What was the anti-war movement like? MB: That would have been at Wooster, when I was a t Wooster and when I was at Indiana University. JF: You came to UT in [19]69 were there any anti-war actions going on? MB: Yeah, student demonstrations, discussions, all that kind of thing. JF: How do you see the Vietnam War relating to the social movements, like the women&#8217;s movement or- MB: Oh I think it was the first time that people demonstrated that they could really make some change through civil disobedience and putting pressure on politicians, pressure on institutions. You know, some of my friends went of Canada. That was when mother came to church and it was a big problem. [Laughs] JF: How did your mother feel about your career and what you were doing? MB: Very, very, very proud of us. The only thing that was funny was, she kept telling my sister and I, when we would go to school somewhere she&#8217;d say, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just get a real job?&#8221; But she was very proud of us. I can remember my mother saying to me when we were growing up, it&#8217;d be time to do the dishes, she&#8217;d say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to do the dishes, I want you to study otherwise you&#8217;ll end up like me.&#8221; Isn&#8217;t that sad? JF: Did she go to college? MB: Mm hm. She did not graduate. When World War II broke out, her father pulled her out of college. It would have been World War II, I believe. He pulled her out of college and brought her home to the family business because girls didn&#8217;t need to go to school. JF: Did that influence you, her telling you things like that? MB: Oh, yes&#8230; oh, yes. There wasn&#8217;t anything that we didn&#8217;t get to do. From going to camp, having all kinds of lessons, we really had a lot of opportunities. At the time you don&#8217;t realize what you were given, but my sister and I were given incredible educations. JF: Do you think, would your mother have called herself a feminist? MB: Huh uh. [Shakes head no]. My mother looked like and sounded like Lady Bird Johnson. And my father looked like and sounded like L.B.J. [Lyndon Baines Johnson]. [Laughter] When my mother moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania she could not get a hair appointment without first going into the beauty shop so that they knew she wasn&#8217;t black because of her accent. Now that&#8217;s in the 1950&#8217;s. JF: In Pittsburgh? MB: In Pittsburgh, well in Aliquippa. So it wasn&#8217;t just a southern issue. JF: Pittsburg has a pretty big, strong African American community there. Did your mom talk to you about-- MB: Yeah, well that-- JF: Race relations? What did she teach you about race relations as a kid? MB: Oh very, very traditional. Because, see, we would go home to Georgia where all of the African Americans still lived in the quarters. My grandmother had a black chauffer, she had a black cook. Oh, it was&#8230; now, the blacks in the south my mother thought were a lot better than the ones that were in the north. They knew their place better. That&#8217;s why she was so horrified about coming to Wooster and finding out that the anti-war movement and all of us tutoring black kids that were having trouble in math and all of that. JF: My&#8230; MB: Oh yeah, this isn&#8217;t that long ago. JF: Mm hm. MB: I mean it seems like it wasn&#8217;t that long ago. JF: No, it really wasn&#8217;t. MB: Yeah. JF: How did things change for the women&#8217;s movement from the [19]70s to the [19]80s? MB: I think a lot of institutional change had been made. So that things that were obviously discriminatory on the books had been removed. It then became the subtle practices ad the implementation of things, so the legalistic part had disappeared but in many ways the real work had to begin. JF: What do you think is the best strategy or resource for changing those subtle or invisible things that still keep women in unequal positions to men relative to pay or advancement or education? MB: I just think, work with the decision makers. If there's an issue like sexual harassment or whatever&#8230; to put all of that change on the victim is just not going to work. You&#8217;ve got to find people that have the influence and can create a different atmosphere, and are in power positions to make changes. You know, expecting people just to speak up is not going to get it. [Pause] JF: You mentioned sexual harassment&#8230; did you have any experiences with that-- MB: No, I-- JF: either personally or hear any thing about it? MB: Oh, I&#8217;ve heard about it but I did not have any personal experiences. Too many professional suits I guess, I don&#8217;t know. [Laughs] No, I never had any; I never had any personal experiences. JF: Do you remember hearing about any that-- MB: Oh yes. JF: struck you particularly or-- MB: Oh yes. JF: or, close to you -- MB: Oh yeah, and particularly in health care. Well, and out on construction projects too at TVA, big nuclear plants, those sorts of things. JF: So there were women working in the construction units? MB: Mm hm, or nurses in the hospital. Lots of issues. JF: Do you think that they were dealt with fairly and justly or- MB: Oh, not in all cases, oh no. Not in all cases. Because so much of that depends on the risk that the supervisory personnel is willing to take. I would say in many cases women just move on, change jobs. JF: That&#8217;s a very common thing I hear, that one or the other has to go, either the victim or the person accused. MB: That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right. Now, I will say in recent years medical staffs have become more willing to sanction their own peers than perhaps they were in the past. Some medical staffs have been willing to create sanctions for people and send them away to educational kinds of things because of their inappropriate behavior. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff that goes on that you would be appalled at. JF: I spoke with a woman, Sheryl Rollins, she&#8217;s an African American woman who was an attorney with a private practice for years and she used the word &#8216;disgusting.&#8217; She said, "It&#8217;s disgusting how many cases.&#8221; MB: It&#8217;s disgusting, that&#8217;s right. JF: Running the gamut from waitresses-- MB: That&#8217;s right. JF: to professors-- MB: That&#8217;s right. When you think about it in health care it really is upsetting. Very upsetting. JF: What about divorce? How has that changed? Women&#8217;s ability to get divorced or what happens to women after they get divorced? MB: Well, that is one of the things that I think was an impetus for us to start the Women&#8217;s Center. Because it used to be often times when women got divorced they were not at all prepared financially or education-wise, and the Women&#8217;s Center was a real good place for people to land to get counseling and direction. Now I think it&#8217;s easier for women to get divorced, there are more women attorneys now. I think the difficulties are still there. Financially, issues related to children, issues related to custody. There are more opportunities for women, but divorce is still a huge and very traumatic thing. For both males and females, I think. I think the courts have a better perspective now on what it might take for a woman in order to be financially stable, but then there are also some backlash things where people don&#8217;t get alimony. They may get an education supplement but they don&#8217;t get alimony. JF: I remember hearing one woman at the University of North Carolina talking about, when she thought about it later she wanted to sue her husband for retirement. When she married him, [because of] the nepotism rules, she had to quit and so she never built up a retirement fund that she would have had she been able to continue working. MB: That&#8217;s right. Well, access now to people&#8217;s retirement is much more common than it used to be. In other words, part of your settlement may end up being part of that person&#8217;s retirement. My dissertation was on the economic value of a homemaker, and I was an expert witness for a local attorney. We were trying to get overturned, what is your when you get a divorce status for things like - this may sound really silly but, your telephone. If your telephone was not listed in your name, then you had to reapply to get a telephone and pay all the fees again even though you may have been paying the telephone bill for all those years. The economic status of women was what we were trying to be more equal in the state. So I was testifying about when someone does not work, what is really their economic value, what do they bring economically to the marriage. JF: That&#8217;s a huge deal right, that&#8217;s a big change-- MB: Huge deal. JF: That must have been a fascinating dissertation to work on. MB: Well, it was an article that I did. We took a questionnaire that analyzed the job of a homemaker and compared it to hundreds of other occupations and what we found out was that what a homemaker does is most similar to what a policeman does. JF: Really? MB: Yes. All the crisis intervention, the counseling, the discipline. So then we could equate [that to the] average hourly wage for a policeman. You had really hard data on what were the individual tasks that the homemaker did and how did they compare with the individual tasks that all these other professions did. Now that&#8217;s just sort of academic but that was what was interesting. JF: How did you and your husband negotiate responsibilities around the house? MB: Neither one of us liked to do certain things, so we hired somebody. I guess because just the way his mother was, we&#8217;ve just always shared. The most important thing is, I&#8217;ve never cut the grass and I&#8217;ve never done the laundry. JF: You&#8217;ve never done the laundry? MB: I&#8217;ve never done the laundry. I do most of the cooking, although he loves to cook and we cook together. We each kind of take care of the cars, we each pay certain bills. We did it based on interest, sort of who wanted to do what. I think the only disagreement was that neither one of us wanted to have to clean. JF: Well it must have worked. MB: It worked! It worked! 40-some years later, it worked! [Laughter] JF: Well it seems like we&#8217;ve got a storm rolling in-- MB: I think-- JF: so I think we should wrap up? MB: Would you like to go see my car that&#8217;s got all hit with all the hail? Did I give you the kinds of things you were interested in? JF: Absolutely. I always close by asking if there&#8217;s anything that you thought I would ask about that I didn&#8217;t or if there&#8217;s anything you&#8217;d like to add that we didn&#8217;t touch on? MB: The decision not to have children never was really as conscious as it probably should have been. So as I get older, I really envy people that have that family. We have a lot of godsons and nephews and people like that but I don&#8217;t think that I - I think I fell through the cracks. I got so career-oriented, I just think I fell through the cracks. And that&#8217;s a regret. Because for sure I think you can do it all if you want to. That&#8217;s the only thing I think I would add. I think that&#8217;s it, yeah. Joey, thank you! JF: Thank you! MB: Thank you, thank you, thank you. This is so funny I&#8217;d forgotten all this stuff. [Laughter]..
