 Jessica Wilkerson: Okay, it&#8217;s June 19, 2009 and I&#8217;m here with Brenda Bell. We&#8217;re in Maryville, Tennessee for an interview. Okay, so I&#8217;m going to start by asking you what life experiences prepared you for your work as an activist and community organizer? Brenda Bell: Hmm, that&#8217;s a nice big, broad question to start with. JW: I know. [Laughs] BB: Well I think I have to go back to the environment in which I was raised, which was as the oldest daughter of a fairly liberal minister so all of my early impulses were shaped by what I understood to be the precepts and the guidance that came from a fairly liberal Protestant denomination. I can get more specific about that, but I remember even from being very young my father taking certain stands that were in opposition to mainstream culture. The one that&#8217;s the most vivid for me was in 1954 when I was nine years old. We were living in Richmond, Virginia, and Dad was very involved in the response to Brown v. Board of Education in trying to help things stay calm and to move in a good manner in the aftermath of what was a backlash against that. I can remember answering the telephone at home and having a couple of people make threats against my father, so that made a big impression on me, that there were times when you stood up for what you thought was right and people disagreed with you so much that they would attack you. JW: Mm hmm. BB: So that&#8217;s an early experience that didn&#8217;t make me scared, just made me think that&#8217;s what you were supposed to do. JW: Right. So what were your first organizing experiences? BB: Well you know a really early one, which was not deliberate organizing but it grew out of just an impulse, a reaction to something I didn&#8217;t think was right. When I was sixteen and we had just moved to Tennessee from Virginia I was working at a church camp in Middle Tennessee for the summer and the number of young people on the staff was very small--there were maybe five of us who were there for summer--and included the son of the cook, African American guy, our age, and we were told--so this would have been 1960--that we could not swim in the swimming pool at the same time. I just thought that was outrageous and so I just jumped in the pool with him, and then soon everybody else followed suit and then because of that incident--. I guess you&#8217;d call it organizing. I mean I got people behind me from the state church youth group board and we wrote up statements and presented them, because at that time the statewide board of the adults had been challenged by this and it had caused an uproar and so we presented our case and worked through it. I don&#8217;t remember the specific outcome, I just remember the process of it, and soon, of course, everything was integrated, but that was I guess one of the first times I remember doing that. JW: Yeah. BB: So. JW: When and how did you learn about feminism and a movement for women&#8217;s rights? BB: Hmm. JW: And I say both of those, feminism and a movement for women&#8217;s rights, because it&#8217;s--. BB: No, it&#8217;s two different things. JW: It can be a--yeah. BB: Well early on I was aware that my grandmother, my mother&#8217;s mother, had been a little different in that she had really worked for the women&#8217;s right to vote and that she had gotten an education--this was in central Kentucky--at times when most women didn&#8217;t go to college. She went to college, she got a nursing degree, and then she didn&#8217;t marry until she was thirty. She had a career, so I always knew that about her. When I was growing up I didn&#8217;t learn a lot about the suffrage movement or what she did but it was just in the background. JW: Mm hmm. BB: So my first contact with the current phase, the &#8217;60s phase of feminism, came in the late &#8217;60s, after I had come back to Tennessee. I&#8217;d been in the Peace Corps and I came back to Tennessee, to Nashville, and found all kinds of stuff swirling around me, including some people that I&#8217;d known from before who were getting into these women&#8217;s consciousness raising groups, so not wanting to be left behind I joined one, and kind of a little bit reluctantly. Not really reluctantly, but sort of thinking, what does this have to do with me, sort of thing. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Then I quickly found out that it had a lot to do with me, and that&#8217;s been a lifelong exploration of the ways in which it does have something to do with me. About that same time--. Well let&#8217;s see, I had a couple of different jobs when I came to Nashville and one was with the Race Relations Information Center, but I moved quickly on to working for Motive magazine, which was a Methodist publication that was a journal of politics and culture and art, and it became sort of the nexus of a lot of political work in Nashville in the late &#8217;60s, &#8217;67 up through the early &#8217;70s, so this was probably about &#8217;69 when all this was happening for me. JW: So did that publication explore the women&#8217;s movement? Did it become-- BB: Oh, yeah. JW: --a space where you could do that? BB: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean it had published an issue on the women&#8217;s movement which you might want to look up. JW: Yeah. BB: A 1967 issue. I think it came out in &#8217;67 or &#8217;68, and that was a big--. It caused a lot of controversy within the Methodist Church, which, by the way, is not the denomination I grew up in, but I just happened to get this job because it had become--. Motive was in the process--. It always was a cutting edge journal but had become increasingly political because it was in the environment of the &#8217;60s where everything was politicized. So, yeah, I&#8217;d say from the period of '67, &#8217;68 up until we went out of business because we were too radical and lost our financial support with the double issue on the gay and lesbian rights movement, it was a lot of political activity that happened around--and one of which was a real strong focus was on feminism. JW: Mm hmm. You said you were reluctant at first. BB: Mm hmm. JW: Do you remember why you had a reluctance to think that this was something that was for you? BB: Yeah, because I just sort of thought well I&#8217;ve always been able to do what I want to do, a little bit, but that&#8217;s really not true, as I, with other women, started exploring the ways in which we were raised and the choices that were put out to us or how we were guided. I remember at this point I was maybe twenty-four, thinking I had all this life experience behind me. Certain things that I remember kind of going, aha, about was, oh, yeah, that sociology professor who said to me, and who was a woman, &#8220;Oh, Brenda, an academic career for you; you can&#8217;t do that and have children at the same time,&#8221; or the person who told my sister that really being a lawyer was not a thing for a woman to do, that sort of thing. JW: Right. BB: From that to understanding the ways in which I&#8217;d been socialized to defer, to maneuver in the background, to facilitate things, all of which are okay but they can also have their down sides. JW: Mm hmm. BB: And there are ways in which I viewed relationships with men, some of which were good and some of which were very problematic, so. JW: Mm hmm. Where were you a Peace Corps volunteer? BB: Senegal. JW: Okay. BB: West Africa. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Yeah. JW: I just wondered. [Laughs] BB: Yeah, yeah. [Laughs] Yeah, yeah. JW: Well how do you think living and organizing in the South in particular shaped your understanding of women&#8217;s rights? BB: Well--. JW: Or even shaped your participation, early participation, in the movement? BB: I think there are certain strengths that Southerners brought, both to the women&#8217;s movement and growing out of their involvement in the civil rights movement, not that everybody who became active in the women&#8217;s movement came out of the civil rights movement but a lot did, and a lot of that group of people, if we drew a picture, if we drew a Venn diagram, a lot of them came out of a religious background. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve read some of the writings about people&#8217;s early involvement with various church movements and stuff, and I think that&#8217;s something that could be explored a lot more from this very positive--. I mean I have a very ambivalent relationship right now to organized religion but I do appreciate so much the support from within primarily mainstream denominations for taking strong stands on civil rights and then later within the women&#8217;s movement. You have to look to find who were the people who were creating those spaces and which way it came out but it&#8217;s there. So here&#8217;s another story that was important to me. In 1962 and 1963 I was real active in the United Christian Youth Movement, which was the interracial youth movement in the South, and in the summer of &#8217;63--that&#8217;s when the March on Washington was, right? I&#8217;m notoriously bad about dates. Instead of going to Washington we were at a camp at Bethany Hills, the church camp that I&#8217;d been working at the summer before, with at least four people who graduated from Little Rock in Arkansas, Central High School in Little Rock. It was another profoundly moving experience to be there and to be watching at a distance, watching the March on Washington, and then to be reflecting about it for us right there in Central Tennessee at that time. We didn&#8217;t do anything dramatic but it was just a lot of very rich discussion. But your question had to do with how my experiences intersected with the,-- JW: Well how--. BB: --with women&#8217;s--influenced my organizing for women? JW: Yeah, well how being in the South specifically shaped it. BB: Mm hmm. JW: I think you&#8217;ve touched on it partly. BB: I think I got more involved in reaction to meeting people from the North who really put down Southerners, not intentionally, but it made me look at the culture in which I&#8217;d grown up and the strengths of specifically women and what they brought to it and sort of push a little bit harder because I just knew in my gut that there was a lot more than was being seen at other places. I was real active in Appalachian Volunteers when I was in college, which had another--. That&#8217;s an experience that I reflected on in my consciousness raising group later. The whole men/women dynamics within that organization could be very interesting and it would be very interesting to have a discussion with several women from that period. JW: Mm hmm. I should-- BB: Write that down. JW: --write that. [Laughs] BB: And there&#8217;s this new book, From Reformers to Radicals. JW: Yeah, from Thomas Kiffmeyer. BB: Yeah, and I&#8217;ve sort of just dipped into it, but that&#8217;s what I really want to see, if he dealt with any of those dynamics. I don&#8217;t know whether he has or not. I don&#8217;t think so. It would be really interesting to pull together some women to talk about that. I&#8217;d be happy to do that. But it was during those--. From the participating in the founding meeting of the Appalachian Volunteers all the way up to my post-college work helping train VISTAs one summer on behalf of the Appalachian Volunteers, that&#8217;s where I met people coming in from other parts of the country, and one who was surprised that I didn&#8217;t have a really strong Southern accent, who couldn&#8217;t imagine that we had a strong base of organizing from which to draw on ourselves. You know it was just like this whole, aha. And then I sort of reacted to some of the stereotypes that people tried to put on us by digging in my heels and being more and more involved. JW: Mm hmm. BB: So that&#8217;s sort of a negative [Laughs] way in which I started drawing on what I saw around me as strengths. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Actually that&#8217;s happened to me a couple of times in my life, later on in my life when academics told me that working class people had sort of a limited way of learning. Not limited, but was sort of like very linear and not nuanced and deep. It made me so angry. [Laughs] JW: Mm hmm. BB: [15:38] going to prove you wrong about that too, so, anyway. JW: Well one of the questions I have for you is when did you begin organizing in southern Appalachia, because I didn&#8217;t realize you had been an-- BB: Appalachian Volunteer. JW: --Appalachian Volunteer, so--. BB: Well in college--. I was in college; I mean I wouldn&#8217;t call it organizing. I would call my early involvement with the Appalachian Volunteers as more of a response to the, quote, War on Poverty culture that was coming out and I was one of the students--. I went to school in Central Kentucky. I went to Transylvania. We were one of the campuses that was organized [Laughs] by this early group called the Appalachian Volunteers, so we went out on weekends to work in rural communities to help repair schools, and then from that grew into--. I spent two or three summers living in communities and sort of running a summer school program and helping organize people in the community to get resources to do their own improvements to the school, and then that grew into more of like, oh, this is not just a school by school thing; this is a systemic thing. It was about that time I was leaving college that the Appalachian Volunteers became much more politically oriented and tackling issues not just in education but in mining and healthcare, etcetera. But those were my first experiences of seeing a little bit of the power you can have when you try to get groups of people together to do something. JW: Mm hmm. BB: It&#8217;s difficult, because not--. All parents of kids in these one-room schools didn&#8217;t want to stick their necks out. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Initially they wanted to have, yeah, a space so they could have a hot lunch at the school, so yes, we could organize around that and get that done, but then the question of why were resources for teachers so limited at the schools was a little bit harder. JW: Mm hmm. Do you want--? BB: [18:05] Yeah. JW: Do you want to go ahead and comment--? It&#8217;s something that I think you&#8217;re right, it would be interesting to have a group discussion about the gender dynamics, but do you want to say something about your own experience as a woman in the Appalachian Volunteers-- BB: Mm hmm. JW: --and what that was like? BB: Yeah. It&#8217;s hard to separate it out from who I was as a young woman and some insecurities that I was bringing along with me, to separate that out from what was a very male dominated organization. All the organizers were men. The leadership in Berea were all men. They were all white men. I think, well I know, that I really would have liked to, after college, gone to work for them. I didn&#8217;t push myself. I wasn&#8217;t assertive enough to suggest that. JW: Mm hmm. BB: I was not--what&#8217;s the word that I&#8217;m looking for? This is one way in which people get brought into the ranks. Somebody would look across and see who would be good to bring up. I wasn&#8217;t one of those that met that criteria. One woman who did was a close friend of mine and she had political connections. Her father had been the governor of Kentucky. She&#8217;s one person that we could bring into this discussion who&#8217;d be very interesting. JW: Mm hmm. BB: So I thought, okay, [I&#8217;m not worthy,] or something, you know, that kind of a thing. JW: Mm hmm. BB: That sort of meek [19:49] There were--. I mean I can&#8217;t--. There were relationships between the male staff and the female volunteers, some of which were fine and some of which were probably a little questionable and problematic. JW: Mm hmm. Was that something that the organization discussed or no? BB: Mm mm. Not while I was around. JW: Mm hmm. BB: No. I mean remember this was in 1963 to 1967, before, at least from my experience, sort of consciousness raising groups were getting started, any discussion, any groups that were where people got together to talk about issues, for example, while I was in college in Lexington. I used to go over to the University of Kentucky because there was a chapter of SDS over there and participated in some discussions there, but it was not--. At least in that year it was not about personal dynamics and interpersonal politics. Later in Nashville it became very much that way. I mean I don&#8217;t have any huge stories to tell about the AVs but just that it was a very male driven, male run organization. JW: I&#8217;m trying to think if we want to skip ahead a bit to your work with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. BB: Mm hmm. JW: One question I had about your work with the union was how did you think your experience in the women&#8217;s movement in Nashville impacted your work later with ACTWU [Pronounced &#8220;act two&#8221;]? BB: Mm hmm. Hmm. [Pause] Well that&#8217;s a good question. Let&#8217;s go back to Nashville for just a minute, or to those before. I moved over to [East Tennessee] around 1972, somewhere right in there, but in those couple of years between 1969 and early, mid-1972--it seems like this huge expanse of time but it was really quite [22:33]--I was involved in a consciousness raising group, and then there were a group of women who were sort of more politically oriented and who were concerned about issues of economic justice as well as civil rights and we had a women&#8217;s Marxist study circle. JW: This is still while you&#8217;re in Nashville? BB: This was in Nashville, yeah. We thought it would--. Because we wanted to understand--. We wanted to try to think about things ourselves. We didn&#8217;t want to have to have it filtered through somebody else&#8217;s understanding of it, so we read some of the general texts, trying to--. I think I still have notes from those discussions too. I can probably dig them out. JW: Mm hmm. BB: It wasn&#8217;t that we really acted on it that much. It was more of a--. Well it was like a study group, a women&#8217;s study group, but it had a very strong sense of, we want to bring our understanding as feminists to this. But that&#8217;s where I--. It was in that group, and then there was also a mixed men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s group that I was part of a little bit, which is where I met the person that I later married,--. JW: And they were both Marxist study groups? BB: Mm hmm, but not doctrinaire. There were doctrinaire groups operating in Nashville at that time but the groups I was part of were not associated with any arm of a revolutionary movement. JW: Mm hmm. BB: It was important to me to begin to understand and have an opportunity to talk about issues of class as well as gender and race, so later when we moved over to East Tennessee, and I had a couple of other things that I did before I started working with Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, I brought some of that with me to that work, but I also have to say that what I also brought with me to that work was my experience of being married to a person who worked with his hands for a living. JW: Mm hmm. BB: He was a machinist at Alcoa, so I think that just as much as anything else [25:03] with me. The first--. I don&#8217;t how much June told you about our work that we did. It was under a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. I don&#8217;t know if--? Did you--? JW: [Who--?] BB: June Rostan? JW: Yeah. BB: Yeah, yeah. JW: On health and safety stuff, or--? BB: Well no this was just an early--. It was this labor education program that ACTWU was part of that had a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to do some broad based labor education, not shop stewards training, not health and safety training, but to provide opportunities for union members to explore their history, to think about current issues, to do some reading, to look at movies, to have discussion groups, to try to kind of recapture this sort of intellectual in a broad sense basis that the early organizing efforts in this country had. JW: Mm hmm. BB: What we did was focus on women&#8217;s issues and the role of women in the labor movement, both here within the programs that we did in Knoxville, and then because of that work I got to teach for a couple of summers at the Southern Summer School for Union Women, which was super interesting and super important, and I kind of got slotted into the labor history strand of things and really thoroughly enjoyed the work I did with women who came through that. There would be these aha moments: &#8220;Oh, you mean this happened? Oh, you mean women did this?&#8221; Which is always an exciting thing. JW: So what years did y&#8217;all have that grant then? BB: Those were in the early &#8217;80s, yeah, late &#8217;70s, early &#8217;80s, when I was doing that work. Yeah. JW: So what sort of--? You said women&#8217;s issues-- BB: Mm hmm. JW: --often came up, and I wonder what those issues were and then what the participation, if you had large female participation? I think Susan Williams was saying she was always astounded that there were always more women at workshops and stuff than men, often. It was her experience. BB: At Highlander? JW: Yeah. BB: Uh huh. JW: And she couldn&#8217;t explain why but she said that just seemed to be a trend that she noticed. BB: Uh huh. Interesting, interesting. JW: Yeah. BB: I think--. It&#8217;s hard to know, but women&#8217;s participation in the Southern Summer School, well it was for women, so of course they-- JW: Right. BB: --came to that. The activities that we did locally under this grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, there were more women who participated but overall participation was very low because it didn&#8217;t have the support of a lot of the established union leadership and because it was just outside the realm of experience of many people to do this kind of thing. But in general, I mean from my experience doing some workshops and participating in some workshops at Highlander and other places, it would be interesting to explore this, but I think women came more often because it was a venue in which to interact with a broader range of people, to get away from home, whether or not you had your kids with you, and a safe space in which to explore things and to be challenged by stuff. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Plus just, yeah, just a new thing to do, is my sense of why that might be. JW: Yeah. Well at the--and remind me, the Southern School--? BB: The Southern Summer School for Union Women. JW: Southern Summer. BB: Yeah. JW: In the early &#8217;80s the women&#8217;s movement is pretty strong at that point and you have a lot of Title VII cases,-- BB: Mm hmm. JW: --and sexual harassment is becoming a part of the daily vocabulary and I wonder how much those things impacted what was going on at the School, if that was a part of discussions there? BB: Yeah, I think so. I mean I feel like I have looking back a very limited slice of what went on at the Schools because I would be involved all day in doing my track, what I was teaching, and so missed out on other stuff, and then frankly I just now don&#8217;t remember what degree those things were there. But, yeah, I think--. And there must be records somewhere of those Summer Schools to go and look back at what the topics were that the workshops were on. But as far as I remember there was no deliberate integration of current topic of something that people were struggling around within one union or another, and what Peggy Walkerson and I were doing in the [30:27] history strand, you know, like we didn&#8217;t try to go back and find examples to illustrate how women [had struggled] [30:39]. Does that make sense? JW: Yeah. BB: Yeah, so I&#8217;d have to go back and look at stuff to sort of jog my memory on that. JW: Yeah, I think you&#8217;re right. Those records must be stored somewhere. BB: Mm hmm. By the way, speaking of records, and I might have mentioned this to you on the phone, at Vanderbilt there&#8217;s an archive of sort of--. I think it&#8217;s a social history archive of Nashville, and about five years ago some of us from my women&#8217;s collective were interviewed and one person who was an absolute packrat donated all of her papers there. JW: Okay. BB: So if you ever wanted to know--this is sort of outside of the Appalachian region--but if you need to dig around there&#8217;s some stuff over there. JW: Okay. Let&#8217;s see. Here&#8217;s another question that&#8217;s still about women&#8217;s issues. Do you think working with working class women changed your understanding of women&#8217;s issues? BB: Mm hmm. JW: How do you think it changed? BB: Well it&#8217;s working and living with working class women, because for many years we lived in a rural area of this county and a very poor area [32:17]. Now it&#8217;s all populated with second homes and all that stuff, but some of the people that I was dependent on in my daily life when I had little kids were my neighbors who didn&#8217;t have much education and who worked as subsistence farmers and then supplemented with small jobs around, so a change from sort of being this intellectual and emotional understanding of women&#8217;s rights and women&#8217;s place in history to one of necessity almost, for economic issues and reasons. It didn&#8217;t switch--. It grew to include that because there was a whole ball of wax. I also understood that the very personal deep seated emotional needs of women are the same and their responses are the same regardless of class, but they get expressed in different ways, depending on what kind of environment and what kind of living situation you have. JW: Can you think of--? BB: Does that make sense? JW: Yeah. Can you think of moments that helped shape that understanding or any experiences where you thought, oh, things are different for this person because of class differences along with the gender differences? BB: Well I mean the person who comes immediately to my mind is a neighbor and friend of many years when we were raising our kids together who didn&#8217;t have a high school diploma, worked, if she was able to get work, cleaning schools then later people&#8217;s houses, whose oldest son went to prison. She--. So it&#8217;s not really one experience that I think of but it&#8217;s just getting to know her so well that I knew what incredible strength and resiliency she brought to a wide range of daily issues, a somewhat abusive husband, just figuring out how to respond to things with limited resources, financial resources, and then limited sort of networking resources. I&#8217;m not being very articulate about this. I can&#8217;t tell you exactly what it was that had an impact on me but I just learned a whole lot from it. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Hmm. Have I talked about the stint that I did working in a sewing factory? JW: No. BB: Okay. [Laughs] JW: [Laughs] That sounds interesting. [Laughs] BB: [Laughs] That was in the early &#8217;70s, &#8217;73, &#8217;74. I went to work at a sewing factory in Knoxville with the thought of maybe trying to organize women, and this is where it would be interesting to have me and Fran together talking because we both did this at roughly the same time. JW: Mm hmm. BB: I met some amazing women--this was an unorganized factory--amazing women who were so strong and so smart and so under the thumb yet of the management at that place. JW: Who I imagine were mostly men? BB: Oh, they were men, yeah, definitely men. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that was a real lesson in how difficult it is to help people make sort of structural changes in their lives that may be very strong in some ways and have to be really gutsy but when it comes to established power structures. And then there I was doing my best. I mean I couldn&#8217;t really do any real organizing because I was always behind [Laughs] with my piecework quota. JW: [Laughs] BB: I could never sew fast enough to have any time to talk to anybody. I was a disaster. [Laughs] Interesting times. That was around--. It was after that I think, or about the same time, that we formed the little oral history collective in Knoxville. Fran and Bill Murrah and I went around and collected a bunch of interviews of people who had done organizing around various issues that turned up in a now well known issue of Southern Exposure. JW: Yeah. BB: Yeah, yeah. JW: Um--. BB: Um--. Go ahead. JW: Well, so now that--. I didn&#8217;t realize that you&#8217;d gone--. I knew Fran had but I didn&#8217;t know that it was--. Did that come out of-- BB: It came out of our--. JW: --the collective? BB: Well, we, I mean--. JW: Did you talk about it and then decide? BB: Yeah, I mean so Fran and I were in that group together in Nashville and then both moved here at roughly the same time. Yeah, it was sort of a deliberate decision to try to do that. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Yeah. JW: So when did you become an organizer for Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union? BB: That was later in the late &#8217;70s, early &#8217;80s, and I was never really an organizer. I was the person who was the educator,-- JW: Okay. BB: --the labor educator for this humanities program. JW: Okay. BB: If you want to talk to somebody who organized for Amalgamated you should talk to Bingham Poth. Have you talked to her, Bingham Graves? JW: No, but a couple people have mentioned-- BB: Yeah, yeah. JW: --[the name.] BB: She was on the staff in the &#8217;80s. JW: Mm hmm. [Pause] So I guess another topic I&#8217;d like to touch on is your work on adult education and what led you to pursue that work specifically. BB: Well actually it grew out of the work that I was doing with ACTWU under this grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. I enjoyed it, was challenged by it, and at the same time I was doing the ACTWU work I did some consulting work, convening workshops for the Mountain Women&#8217;s Health Collective or doing some other things, and some of those would take place [at homes] or elsewhere. I liked to think about how people learn and how people draw from their life experiences to inform their learning and where they want to go in their lives. I can&#8217;t remember how it was I decided to go back to school, but I did. At that point I had three kids and it seemed like going back to school was something that could fit into life with three kids whereas a full time job couldn&#8217;t. During those years I was working mostly part time, fitting stuff in around raising three kids and running a farm and living in a house that was under construction the whole time. JW: [Laughs] BB: So going back to school at UT was a way just to reflect on that and to try to put some language, the language of academics, onto what I was seeing and learning just from the work I&#8217;d been doing. JW: Mm hmm. BB: I wish I could remember the name of this professor who was an advisor to the humanities education program for ACTWU. I can remember being in New York at the ACTWU headquarters sitting around a big board table with these advisors to the program who were so--. One in particular was so limited in how he understood people&#8217;s learning. It was almost like that unless you had gone to a certain level of formal schooling you couldn&#8217;t understand an issue. It was that kind of thing that got me back into school because I just knew that&#8217;s not right. It&#8217;s just not right. It&#8217;s not correct and it&#8217;s not true, so exploring that sort of stuff took me back. JW: Mm hmm. So with the work you did on adult education, that took you--. I mean you&#8217;ve done workshops at Highlander but you did adult education for Highlander as well? Is that right? BB: Well, I mean I was doing--. I was facilitating workshops and processes for various groups along the way. I did a lot of different things in the late &#8217;70s, early &#8217;80s. JW: One thing I did notice was you helped with the pregnancy study-- BB: Yeah, yeah. JW: --for the Coal Employment Project. BB: Yeah. That was really interesting. JW: I wonder was there anything you want to say about the experience of doing that and what-- BB: No, [Laughs] but I just remember-- JW: --maybe some of the major struggles were? BB: --being underneath my house while I was working on that study, and helping write this booklet was mostly what I did, but I was about six or seven months pregnant and trying to scoot up underneath my house, which was built up on piers--there was not a very deep crawl space under there--because we were trying to repair a water pipe. I thought, oh, my God. Think if I was in the mine-- JW: [Laughs] BB: --[and had to stay] in the mine all the time. [Laughs] Oh, God. It was kind of firsthand experience. JW: Uh huh. BB: No, that was just fascinating work and really the opportunity to engage with women&#8217;s stories about working in the mines was just fascinating, and I don&#8217;t remember anything particularly--. I was sort of secondhand involved. I was helping with the study and helping shape a booklet that--. Actually the booklet was &#8220;Pregnancy in Mining.&#8221; JW: Mm hmm. BB: [Sort of] help for women miners who were pregnant. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Yeah. But back to this adult education stuff, obviously I was influenced by discussions with Myles [Horton] and interactions with him, and along somewhere in there--gosh, this is where I need a chronology--I happened to be at the right place at the right time to edit the book of conversations between Myles and Paolo Freire about education and social change, and that was a really important experience for me, in part because it gave this deep way to--. You have to really, when you&#8217;re editing a book of conversations, you really have to think about what somebody&#8217;s saying to you and when you&#8217;re editing somebody like Paolo Freire, whose syntax is so convoluted, and you&#8217;re trying to make it come out still like a conversation and have it be understandable, it was really sort of like working with pieces of a puzzle sometimes, and I really enjoyed it and was actually very proud. I can&#8217;t think of times when I say that I&#8217;m proud but when Paolo said to me, &#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t need to have my translator look at this because you&#8217;ve done such a good job,&#8221; so that was really a pleasure. But I think I brought to that experience of doing the editing my own engagement with the issues and with trying to figure out what&#8217;s the best mix for helping people learn from their experiences. JW: Mm hmm BB: Maybe it was later in the &#8217;80s. I think it must have been later in the &#8217;80s. Yeah. JW: Well did you see your feminism or your concern with women&#8217;s issues intersecting with the adult education in any way? BB: Mm hmm. Yeah. In fact personally in some of the groups I was working within when I was in graduate school--I still think this would be so interesting to try to do--I had everything sort of in place to try to do a thesis on women who had come to Highlander during the early &#8217;40s for the labor workshops. I had found some original writings, and probably for family reasons I didn&#8217;t ever do that thesis. I just took the non-thesis option for a master&#8217;s degree. Somewhere all that stuff is still tucked away, because I was really interested in women&#8217;s perceptions of what they were learning and I wanted to know the degree to which Highlander was really paying attention--. Let me back up. It seemed to me from looking back that they were doing just straight union shop stewards training. JW: Mm hmm. BB: A workshop on writing the newsletter, public speaking, organizing, or something, not what people usually think of as associated with Highlander. I mean granted they were doing it with the CIO so there was reasons why they were going along with that format, but I wanted to know what the undercurrent was, and I thought maybe some of that undercurrent would come out in the writings of women, because they were writing things during those early workshops, but I don&#8217;t know. Maybe you can look around some more and find out. [Laughs] JW: [Laughs] Well so--. [Pause] I had a question in my head about that-- BB: Oh, that&#8217;s okay. JW: --and then--. BB: That&#8217;s okay. Let me back up. The other thing that was going--. I mean, yeah, women&#8217;s issues was always a focus of mine but at that point in my life as a mother what I was really concerned about was survival as a mother. JW: Mm hmm. BB: So I was active personally with a women&#8217;s group that was composed of mothers, right? We would sometimes have--. We&#8217;d each bring our work experiences into it, but I wasn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t think--. There was a ten-year period in there in which I would say to you I was living it all. I wasn&#8217;t trying to interact to make some change somewhere else; I was trying to incorporate stuff into my own life in a way that made sense and kept a balance. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Does that make sense? JW: Yeah. BB: Yeah, yeah. I don&#8217;t know. JW: I think so. BB: Yeah, yeah. I don&#8217;t know. JW: So when you were thinking about Highlander and the women who would come there, what was your sense of what Highlander was doing as far as women&#8217;s issues went? BB: During what time period, like in the &#8217;80s or earlier? JW: Well I guess more when you were running workshops there and involved. BB: Hmm. JW: And I say this because Fran had mentioned at some point that she thought that there had been some issues that came up, if--. BB: Well there were, I mean and I think more in the early &#8217;70s or mid-&#8217;70s when our sort of generation of southern Appalachian activists started having kids that came sort of smack up against sort of Myles&#8217;s vision, actually, of Highlander as a place for adults and what did that mean. It wasn&#8217;t that he was opposed to kids because he loved children but he had this sort of separation of children don&#8217;t come, and it became sort of a woman&#8217;s issue at that point because we weren&#8217;t going to leave our children elsewhere, and mostly didn&#8217;t have the resources to, so we really pushed Highlander to open itself up and to become a place that incorporated children into what was going on so that a childcare center got started. I remember taking the first high chair. Other people may remember that they took their first high chair but I remember actually, [51:41] physically taking stuff. When Mike [Clark] became the director, he&#8217;s an incredibly wonderful, smart person I&#8217;ve come to know over the years, but at that point I felt like he was very dismissive of women&#8217;s opinions or contributions. Wisdom says he was probably just a little insecure himself about opening up to certain things, but he didn&#8217;t want to address issues. Then speaking personally--and I would be interested to see what Fran or somebody else had to say--I could get a little intimidated. Even with all my years of involvement in the women&#8217;s movement I still at that point would be reluctant sometimes to speak out as assertively as I think now from my perspective thirty years later I can be much more assertive? Does that make sense? JW: It does. BB: We were who we were, you know. JW: Yeah. Well, and--. BB: We were trying hard but then you know when it comes to it, when you&#8217;re sort of pushing you sort of go to your default, which is so deep inside of you that you just kind of [53:05] JW: Mm hmm. But at the same time you still were making changes at Highlander. BB: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, we were. We were. JW: I think sometimes we forget that even a place like Highlander had to make some significant-- BB: Significant change. JW: --changes on those. I saw on your CV that I guess in 2007 or &#8217;06 you gave a talk on local women and global--local women working for global peace. BB: Mm hmm. JW: I&#8217;d be interested in knowing more about that talk, but my question is what experiences have led you to believe that local women specifically are important for trans-national organizing or whatever else you might mean by global peace? BB: Okay. I think that talk is probably directly related to my work on peace and justice in the Middle East, specifically Israel/Palestine. Since the early &#8217;90s I&#8217;ve been more involved in that big topic, and for the last seven years we&#8217;ve had a very active and strong group of Women in Black in Knoxville and now in Maryville, much smaller out here. I don&#8217;t know whether you were around at any time--. Did you ever come to any of our weekly vigils or anything? JW: I didn&#8217;t but I remember seeing a couple years ago. BB: Mm hmm. JW: It would have been--. BB: Mm hmm. JW: Yeah. BB: And we&#8217;re still going on. It&#8217;s like every Tuesday at noon [on the corner] [54:57] JW: Yes. Yeah. I&#8217;d seen the people standing out on the side. BB: I feel like I&#8217;ve learned so much and drawn so much strength from the women who&#8217;ve persisted as part of that group. Some are Palestinian Christians, Palestinian Muslims, Jews, Christians, no particular religious affiliation, but it&#8217;s been a good opportunity to see women grow and develop who have never been involved in anything politically before. JW: Mm hmm. BB: And nobody has been particularly trying--. Nobody was organizing us to grow and change and try to do something. It&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s been very organic. To see how people&#8217;s identity expands [from] well I can&#8217;t really do anything about this issue, to becoming very informed, to taking responsibility for the maintenance of the group, to speaking before other people, to advocating for certain things with our Congress people, and then seeing themselves as global, related globally, even though many may have had an ethnic and cultural identity as say a Palestinian but that&#8217;s gotten--broadened? I don&#8217;t what the word to put it--. It&#8217;s not just a cultural thing. It&#8217;s more identity with--. How do I say it? [I should] go back and look at the notes from my talk, whatever I gave at that point. It&#8217;s really understanding issues in a much deeper way, not just do we act [57:02] this specific thing happened to us and so therefore this. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Anyway. And then personally through that network I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to go to international gatherings of Women in Black and to do international work around peace issues. JW: Yeah. BB: Yeah. JW: [Pause] Let&#8217;s see, oh--. BB: Also--I&#8217;m sorry--that talk, one of the talks I gave in the last couple of years, was also an opportunity, maybe it wasn&#8217;t that one, but because I work so much internationally now I&#8217;ve been able to bring back to some forums here the experiences of women that I work with around the world. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Especially people are very interested in the work I&#8217;ve done with women in Afghanistan, so it&#8217;s a little--. When people can&#8217;t go themselves then you sort of become this bridge builder. JW: Right. I guess, I mean it&#8217;s especially interesting to me since you had your start in such a local or regional place in southern Appalachia, and I wonder what you see as your relationship to this region, or even how your relationship to southern Appalachia per se has changed over time? BB: Mm hmm. That&#8217;s a really good question and I wish I knew the answer. Personally right now I&#8217;m involved in a real struggle about sort of where I belong, because I&#8217;m gone a lot and it just, right here from this, what&#8217;s my relationship to this community that I live in. JW: Mm hmm. BB: I&#8217;ll start to get involved in an issue and then I&#8217;m off in some other country for a month and then I come back and I&#8217;m going somewhere else again, so it&#8217;s very localized to here much less what&#8217;s my relationship to whatever&#8217;s happening in the region, you know. What am I doing around mountaintop removal? What am I doing around other energy issues? It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m struggling with. On the other hand I&#8217;m thoroughly enjoying what I&#8217;m doing right now so it&#8217;s very personally satisfying and personally I&#8217;m learning a lot and not feeling--. At one point in my life after I came back from the Peace Corps I said [59:44] international work--. You have to work right where you are. I need to be here in the States. Who am I to go somewhere else in the world and be involved in issues? [Laughs] I don&#8217;t care about that anymore. JW: [Laughs] BB: I&#8217;m very selfish. I mean selfishly I just am, at this point in my life, thoroughly enjoying the opportunity to learn and be in new cultures and immerse myself in them. JW: Mm hmm. BB: But I can&#8217;t continue to do that work for a really long time. Traveling the world sort of nonstop is hard on the body. [Laughs] JW: [Laughs] Yeah. BB: As well as the mind, so [1:00:23] what&#8217;s my niche here? What&#8217;s my spot? How can I make contributions? JW: Mm hmm. BB: And I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t really know right now. JW: Mm hmm. BB: I mean I&#8217;m still very identified as being from this part of the country, absolutely, and it&#8217;s amazing how many people in my travels, in my work around the world, are so interested. I mean what I bring of the United States when I go somewhere else is a whole snapshot of life that most people don&#8217;t have an opportunity to know about, and I can draw a lot of parallels to some of the structural issues that are happening in the countries where I work to the issues in southern Appalachia. So I have that connection, but I&#8217;m just not sure what the future holds on that one. JW: Mm hmm. BB: If that makes sense. JW: It does. That is a point that I probably haven&#8217;t really thought about, that the structural issues, particularly in southern Appalachia, may relate more to what&#8217;s going on in other countries sometimes than to the extent they relate to other parts of even this country. BB: Mm hmm, mm hmm. JW: So I think that is an interesting point. BB: Just look at the issue of clean water for example, [I mean it&#8217;s] not just in southern Appalachia, but if you look at the issue of clean water you can draw parallels, I mean from runoff from strip mining or some other pollutant that&#8217;s coming in from somewhere. That&#8217;s just one thing that just popped into my mind. JW: Yeah. BB: Yeah. JW: Yeah, and land ownership, I would imagine too is-- BB: Yep, yep, big one. JW: --really important. Well do you see--this is another one of those broad questions--do you see continuity in your many activist experiences, coming through civil rights movement, women&#8217;s movement, being active in southern Appalachia, in other words are there threads that you see running through those many experiences? BB: Hmm. JW: How do you kind of see them as relating to one other? BB: I&#8217;m thinking about it, because I think I probably have more to say about that than what&#8217;s coming to my mind right now. I mean of course there&#8217;s significant threads of all that that run through my life. [What mostly has weight--.] What comes to my mind initially is that the common thread is a responsiveness to issues of whatever stripe and whatever form they take, and responsiveness and responsibility, plus a richness of connections with people. It&#8217;s not just that those people who have been involved in social justice movements are all serious and always focused on the next demonstration or the next time you&#8217;re going to engage in civil disobedience--that&#8217;s a whole other topic of my involvement with anti-nuclear stuff here--but it&#8217;s a community that brings a lot of depth of relationship and rich musical traditions and arts and all those things that really help give meaning to life, so I can&#8217;t separate that out from--. It&#8217;s just sort of life, you know. JW: Mm hmm. BB: [1:04:26] It would be an interesting question to ask my daughters, because I have three daughters, not necessarily about me but, growing up in the family that they grew up in, what they pulled away from it. That would be actually a more interesting way of looking at it, what were their perceptions of the importance. JW: Mm hmm. BB: And I think [some of them] might say it was a little bit too important, or something. Yeah, but interesting. JW: Uh huh. BB: [1:05:05] JW: Well what have been the most powerful experiences in your activist career, for you personally? BB: [Pause] [Let&#8217;s see.] I don&#8217;t know. I really don&#8217;t know. Hmm. [Pause] I mean I think the one in more recent years that just was so overwhelming was six, seven years ago when there was the Israeli incursion into the West Bank and we just acted on our instincts of what needed to be done and within a day there were a hundred and fifty people [1:06:19] street corner. That sort of thing is very--. That&#8217;s been very powerful. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Other experiences have been--. This is interesting. If I think about it some of the most personally powerful have been when I trusted my gut instincts about something and had a degree of impulsivity about it where the power comes from interacting with someone or some other group of people in a way in which it can sort of [1:07:03] make something happen. Another example that popped into my mind was reacting so strongly to some images of Muslim women that were in--. They might have been in the Metro Pulse in the early years. It was the anti--. The ads were for the Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health, about women&#8217;s rights to birth control and abortion and stuff. It said, &#8220;Do you want to be like this woman?&#8221; and it had an image of a veiled Muslim woman in a hijab and I just ran all over. I was driving in Knoxville and there was a woman next to me who had on a hijab and I just rolled down the window [Laughs], and I didn&#8217;t know who she was from Adam, and I said, &#8220;Have you seen this?&#8221; We became friends; we organized women; we wrote letters; we took the ads out; we had this relationship with Knoxville Center for [Reproductive Health]. That was not out of some thought out campaign to do something. At the same time I believe thoroughly in the power of people really into strategizing and working together and making things happen, and there have been a number experiences [1:08:11] have been very powerful as well. JW: Mm hmm. BB: So I don&#8217;t know whether those are--. It gives you a couple of little snippets. JW: Mm hmm. Yeah, and I guess it&#8217;s a--. I know it&#8217;s a difficult question, and I&#8217;ve been thinking about it because you&#8217;re from a generation that I&#8217;m personally very envious of in some ways, that there was so much going on when you were in college and when you were young with civil rights and then all of these movements-- BB: Right, right. JW: --that were so powerful,-- BB: Right. JW: --and I think it&#8217;s difficult for me to wrap my head around what that must have been like to be a part of so much change. BB: Yeah, yeah. JW: I&#8217;m real fascinated by it. [Laughs] BB: Here&#8217;s another example from way back in 1969, or 1970, when I was on the staff of Motive. We had our own internal struggles with the men, the women on the staff. There were eight of us in this collective. We were trying to operate as a collective and words weren&#8217;t doing it, so one day we were having a staff meeting and we dressed, the women on the staff, we all wore--. We came in in clerical garb and just sort of playacted the men to them. JW: [Laughs] BB: That was pretty powerful. Oh, here&#8217;s another thing that was really fun. It was fun and we had a sense of like [Growling noise]. My women&#8217;s collective in Nashville, we disrupted the beauty pageant at Vanderbilt. We were careful not to disrupt the pageant once it started because we wanted to be respectful of the women who had chosen to be in it, but we dressed as witches and disguised ourselves and right before it started we just ran through the auditorium throwing these leaflets that said, &#8220;All women are beautiful.&#8221; JW: [Laughs] BB: [Laughs] That was a hoot. That was really fun. [So I think we--. Yeah, there have been some things where it was kind of neat.] JW: Mm hmm. How has your idea of women&#8217;s rights changed over time? BB: [Pause] Hmm. Well I mean I&#8217;m much more aware of and some in my work now focused on issues: sexual abuse of women, domestic violence--. [Interrupted by PA system announcement] As well as political rights of women in certain countries and where they haven&#8217;t been really exercised. I&#8217;m doing a little bit of work in Rwanda right now, which is such a fascinating country full of contradictions. I mean most any country is but that one is very close to the surface so it&#8217;s gotten a lot of press as having the highest percentage of women in elected office in the parliament there. JW: Mm hmm. BB: And it&#8217;s true, they&#8217;re there, but there&#8217;s this huge gap, enormous gap, [what&#8217;s going on with the men in that country.] I think a lot more about how you help women develop the skills and knowledge to be active in formal political arenas, much more than I did when I was younger, both in Rwanda or in this country also. I mean I&#8217;d say that women in Afghanistan that I know have a much stronger sense of themselves as needing to be politically active in their community than women here do. I worked for a couple of years with literacy programs in small rural communities in Afghanistan where women are learning to take a real active role in the community development councils and doing all these things that are pretty exciting. [Pause] But how has my understanding of women&#8217;s rights changed? I&#8217;m still not getting at your question. I&#8217;m not sure that I--. [Pause] JW: Well, I think you are, I mean--. BB: Mm hmm. JW: I think you are. BB: Mm hmm. JW: It seems to have gotten more global, definitely,-- BB: Mm hmm. JW: --which makes sense. BB: Mm hmm. In taking a rights based approach to education or this international work I&#8217;m doing, I&#8217;ve often thought about what would it mean to take a rights based approach. In my work we really work on issues of human rights, specifically on women&#8217;s rights but human rights. I wonder to what extent people in this country would say that they&#8217;re taking a rights based approach. They might. I&#8217;m off thinking about things that I hadn&#8217;t thought about for awhile, Jessie. JW: [Laughs] BB: Sorry. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know. Something for me to think about. JW: Well are there any questions that I didn&#8217;t ask that you have thought of that maybe you would address, or any concluding thoughts that you want to add? BB: No, I mean I don&#8217;t have any questions right now. I probably will later. Why I think it&#8217;s important to do interviews like this is to help other generations have somewhat of a glimpse into some of the things that we did, and to really understand we&#8217;d have to go a lot deeper, I think. It feels like probably we just touched the tip of the iceberg on a number of different topics and I feel very inadequate to give a real kind of succinct description of some of the things that I&#8217;ve been involved in, even though it was my own life, because it&#8217;s so twisted and turned up into all kinds of things. You don&#8217;t usually separate things out in these nice, neat boxes. How can I separate out what I was doing with Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union from having a four-year-old and a one-year-old? I mean really in my mind it&#8217;s all like when I think back to those days I have to think about it all. I have to do a lot of sifting in order to pull it apart. Does that make sense? JW: Oh, absolutely. BB: Yeah, yeah. It was fun thinking back about it. JW: Mm hmm. BB: Thanks for the opportunity. [Laughs] JW: Oh, well, and we&#8217;ll keep doing it. [Laughs] BB: Okay...
