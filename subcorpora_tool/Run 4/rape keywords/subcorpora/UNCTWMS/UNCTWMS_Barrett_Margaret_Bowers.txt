 SARAH CATHERINE BRYAN: All right. Hello. It is July 26th, 2013 at one in the afternoon. I am Sarah Catherine Bryan interviewing Margaret Barrett at the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. So to begin with, would you like to share anything about where you come from, who you are, your childhood? MARGARET BARRETT: Sure. I&#8217;m Margaret Barrett and I grew up in Buies Creek, North Carolina, a small town where Campbell University is based there, and much of my family still lives in the Harnett County area. So I ended up coming to UNC Chapel Hill for my undergraduate, and, like a lot of people, ended up sticking around for a while at UNC. When I was at UNC, I did a lot with women&#8217;s issues. I took a lot of women&#8217;s studies classes, and I was involved a little bit in the campus Y women&#8217;s forum. I got to do an internship in the Department of Women&#8217;s Studies. That was before you had women studies as a major although I think a friend of mine was the first women&#8217;s studies major about a year after I graduated. So I was a political science major. And after graduation, I took a year to explore different options, and during that year I had a really great experience. I went through the volunteer training and I became a Helpline volunteer. And Helpline in those days in about 1987 Helpline was through the Orange-Person-Chatham Mental Health Center, and it was a suicide prevention hotline, but it also addressed many, many other issues. And so the training was really great and lots of role plays, lots of getting to talk to clients or getting practice before talking to clients. And I became very immersed in doing this Helpline crisis intervention. One of the jobs of Helpline volunteers was we served as the first response crisis contact for the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. And for what then was the Orange-Durham Coalition for Battered Women. And so I think of that as my first introduction to the rape crisis center. I&#8217;m sure I knew about it in various ways when I was an undergraduate student. But that was my first time contributing somehow to the mission of the center. And it was also my introduction to crisis intervention as something that I really liked being involved in. So after a bit of time being a Helpline volunteer, I ended up going to law school, and I kept doing that volunteer work, and I had been doing it long enough at that point that they invited me to be one of the trainers for the volunteer classes. It was still a volunteer position but I felt like I was more part of that work. So that was my introduction to actually participating in the kind of really excellent volunteer training that I think Orange County Rape Crisis Center still does. And so I also got to meet the--, I think it was usually the director at the time, Mary Ann Chap who would come in and do the training for the Helpline volunteers. So I went to law school, was very active in Women in Law, [which] was the name of the group. In law school I did some--, worked for some law firms, did some criminal law practice during law school. But really my passion continued to be with women&#8217;s issues or what then were labeled more as women&#8217;s issues. And I ended up taking a job in Charlottesville, Virginia doing mostly family law research and writing. I really liked writing and that seemed like a good fit. So I was a research attorney, there for two years, doing things like child custody jurisdiction, and I definitely was drawn back, wanted to get back to the Chapel Hill community even though Charlottesville was nice. While I was in Charlottesville, I did some volunteer work with literacy, the local literacy council. But I really missed the community in the Chapel Hill, Orange County, and Durham County area. And so I got married to my husband, Craig Carlson, and we came back to Chapel Hill, and I came back to a job as Assistant Dean of Students and Judicial Programs Officer at UNC Chapel Hill, which was really a huge dream job for me. And part of my job there was going to be training student leaders around how to handle hearings, disciplinary hearings and those kinds of things. Part of it was sexual assault issues and helping to do compassionate appropriate response to students who were survivors of sexual violence and also helping to draft and administer policies around sexual violence. So there had been a lot of controversy on campus around sexual violence at that time or soon before I started. So the issues for the Committee on Student Conduct and some other initiatives that I was involved in really did focus a lot on sexual violence, and in that role within my first year I had been to the Orange County Rape Crisis Center several times because I really wanted to build that relationship with the university. So I would go to the Rape Crisis Center and participate in the volunteer trainings and talk about the university&#8217;s response, help prepare the rape crisis companions, how, what they might expect if they were helping a survivor through the university discipline processes or other ways the university could support survivors. And that was a really important part of my job. I also was one of the people at UNC that would greet survivors of sexual assault and help them determine what their options were and--. So then seven years into that I was Associate Dean of Students and Judicial Officer. And I had a chance, the Dean of Students had retired, and I had a chance to partially fill in that role for about a year, a year and a half, and I reached a point where I thought I was ready to transition into something different. I had been on one or two non-profit boards and I decided that I was going to consider non-profit management, and I started telling my friends, &#8220;Oh I would really like to work somewhere in non-profit management, maybe somewhere like the Orange County Rape Crisis Center.&#8221; So I started quietly telling friends that, just for more of a long-term plan. I wasn&#8217;t thinking of it as short term. I remember telling one of my best friends, &#8220;oh and I&#8217;m going to talk to Margaret Henderson who&#8217;s the director of Rape Crisis Center and see if I could ever maybe shadow her sometime and see what she does or maybe do even an internship there or something.&#8221; And lo and behold, about a week after I start saying all this Margaret Henderson announced she was leaving. And I saw it literally in the paper, which was really strange. And I thought, &#8220;Oh no, now this is something I have to think about and consider a little bit more quickly because obviously I had been very drawn to the work and to the organization and to non-profit work.&#8221; And then all of a sudden there&#8217;s that opportunity there that I really was not--, not necessarily prepared for all aspects of it. I had not had a lot of fundraising or development experience. I had not had huge amounts of financial management experience. But I had been immersed in the issues around sexual violence, and I had done a lot of volunteer training and a lot of work with clients and survivors of sexual violence, and I knew the community and I was part of the system that cared for sexual violence survivors. So there was a big piece of it that I felt real confident about and then there was a big piece of it that I was less certain. And I remember they had a really intense interview process. I had to come and meet with three different groups during that summer, and I remember how supportive Margaret Henderson was when I told her that I was applying, and I&#8217;m sure she was probably supportive to everyone who was involved in it if there were other candidates. So after the intensive interview process where I had to write an essay or something--I think the essay was to tell people why I was interested in the job--I ended up getting the job. So that was how my career at the Orange County Rape Crisis Center began. I started in September of 1999 after being at the university from [19]93 to [19]99. I started at OCRCC around September of [19]99 and came in with an incredible staff. I can remember all the staff members who are very dear to my heart. When I started Amanda O&#8217;Briant was the crisis response coordinator. Caroline Biber was Community Education coordinator. Matt Ezzell was the administrative services coordinator. You&#8217;ve met Matt? SB: Yes. Yes. Sorry. MB: That&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s the reaction you often get when you mention Matt&#8217;s name. Let&#8217;s think for a second. Melany Coopmans was the Support Services Coordinator. We had Lisa Weisemann-Ward as a part-time community education assistant. And I&#8217;m trying to think. Oh, and Christina Riordan was the Northern Orange services coordinator. So we had just kind of newly had our office in northern Orange County. And I hope I&#8217;m not forgetting anyone. But I could easily be. We had about six or seven staff at that time. So it was a pretty small group, and they did amazing work. It was definitely when I started the job, they were at a point where volunteer involvement had been declining in terms of how many hours were donated by volunteers and that was a huge challenge because it slipped up on us. I remember Margaret Henderson thought it was because the economy was better so more people were working part-time or getting jobs instead of necessarily spending those hours volunteering. When volunteers couldn&#8217;t fill a twenty-four hour shift or do a community education program the staff members really had to fill in those gaps. So that was really pretty daunting. I remember Amanda and Caroline were working lots of extra hours because they were doing the volunteer trainings and filling all those gaps. So I remember one of the things that I had to do early on was [to] sit down with everybody and look at [the] workload, not the most glamorous of issues. Just looking at how we can balance this workload because thanks to Margaret Henderson&#8217;s great leadership I had inherited sort of the culture of self-care. That was not something people talked about at the university, a culture of self-care. It was more work all the time and that&#8217;s okay. At the Rape Crisis Center it was this idea that you need to take care of yourself in order to be healthy to help care for survivors or the community. So we really tried to work on that. I&#8217;ve talked for too long. SB: No, you&#8217;ve given me some really great material. But especially at the university where you were, you were performing the jobs of what now are fulfilled by Title IX coordinator and the Title IX--, I know him as E.W.--, but you were filling so many roles for what is now four or five positions at the university. What was it like for six years with no community of self-care to or very little? MB: I should say that I, we had an incredible Dean of Students Fred Schroeder, and then Melissa Exum for my last year was the Dean of Students. Then there were always other Assistant Deans of Students. There was Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and Ron Binder did Greek Affairs and Judy Barter before Ron Binder, so there were a lot of people in the Dean of Students office. There was also a Sexual Harassment officer who did more of that Title IX because that was more the staff and faculty. So we networked a lot with that office. So yeah, I wasn&#8217;t doing everything they are doing. I mean they&#8217;ve expanded. Thankfully they have expanded the Dean of Students&#8217; office staff, and they have more staff than they had when we were there. But it wasn&#8217;t easy. It was always twenty-four-seven because there were so many students and so many different expectations. But we didn&#8217;t have, it sounds so funny but we barely had the internet when I first started. We didn&#8217;t have email. There was no Facebook. So there were certain things that take a lot of time nowadays that you didn&#8217;t have then. You had, we were doing paper letters, those kinds of things. It was very, very different. That brings me to the thought when I started at the rape crisis center. Two people on the staff had email, Christina and the Orange County office. Christina in the northern Orange office had it because they had set up her office fairly recently, in the last year and they wanted her to have email so that she could communicate easily with the staff in Chapel Hill, and Matt may have been the one that had it because he would copy messages for Margaret Henderson. He would print or make sure she got the messages. So one person in the Chapel Hill office had email. So that&#8217;s hard for you as a student in 2013 to imagine. SB: It&#8217;s a skill I&#8217;m proud of, drafting beautiful emails to send to complete strangers. MB: But I think back to it and I think, &#8220;Wait, how did we communicate?&#8221; Because now that&#8217;s become such a part of the culture. And over the years there were always issues of should clients be able to communicate by email. I haven&#8217;t ever really talked to Shamecca Bryant, the current ED, about it, but I&#8217;m sure they do communicate by email now in some way because that&#8217;s so much a part of communication. Eventually that was probably one of my bigger financial accomplishments at the agency was probably about two years after I started. We had had a lot of unanticipated, really amazing donations my first year or so. It was--, the Fraternal Order of Police locally dissolved and gave us this--, part of dissolving as a nonprofit is you have to give your resources to another non-profit for tax purposes and everything. And they decided to give it to us. I don&#8217;t remember the exact amount but it was in the neighborhood of thirty thousand dollars that was unanticipated and a couple of other unexpected big donations like that, and so we ended up with a really strong surplus of our expenses that we had planned during that year compared to our revenues. And I don&#8217;t remember, it was probably my second year. And the Board of Directors and the staff were very open to establishing a technology plan. So we used those extra resources to upgrade computers, make sure everybody was on email, get more networks, a lot of things. I mean, we still had a lot of challenges technologically. But that was a huge step toward changing the way we could communicate with volunteers and staff and partly lucky that we had that extra money on hand because technology is a big investment, which makes me think now that it must be even harder to maintain an adequate budget for non-profits because you have to, now you have to maintain that kind of technology. Then, it was, &#8220;Oh let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; But now you&#8217;d have to do it. SB: That&#8217;s a good point. Gosh, I guess since fundraising was like not your background. You had more of a client based approach. Did you have specific people within the agency who really give you help with managing that surplus or&#8212; MB: It turned out I mean the irony is that in my, where I am now Ipas I work in development now. So that ended up being an area that I really liked. I hadn&#8217;t had a lot of experience. Because what it turned out fundraising was a combination of building relationships and writing and communicating. I love writing and editing. That had always been a strong area for me. So with respect to the grants and proposal applications and the reports I always enjoyed doing that. And I did get a lot of great help from staff over the years. And both in helping develop projects and proposals and in writing some of the content. But I always enjoyed doing that. And then the building relationships really wasn&#8217;t that different, I mean sometimes you&#8217;re building relationships to figure out how to serve clients better. Sometimes you&#8217;re building a relationship to find out can there be a match for fundraising. So it turned out not to be that unusual, that different from other things that I was doing. Margaret Henderson, my predecessor, had already set up really strong relationships with all the local governments and with the Governor&#8217;s Crime Commission and with the North Carolina Council for Women and those were some of the big funders. So the relationship was already there. It was more me reaching out to make sure we maintained it. So I inherited a really strong agency when I came. And it was amazing staff, great volunteers, a strong Board of Directors. So that was nice. SB: And one thing you had already done work coming in to this position is cultivating a relationship with the university, which I as a student now would like to see more of. I&#8217;m actually on a task force where we talk about a lot of what you were doing. MB: Oh great. Are you on the task force for the sexual assault policy? SB: Yeah, revising the policy. MB: Oh, that&#8217;s great. I reached out recently to Amy Tiemann. I need to get back in touch with her because I saw that she&#8217;s on that task force and I know her through some other things. SB: Right. MB: Oh that&#8217;s great that you&#8217;re on that. SB: Yeah, I&#8217;m really fascinated by the work that was going, or how policies have evolved at UNC and how their implementation has not changed to the degree that policies have changed. I'd like to hear your perspective on, in broad terms how things are run at the university. MB: I don&#8217;t stay up on it as much. There used to be more communication, public communication with the folks who were handling the policies directly than I perceive that there is now. But that&#8217;s just a perception in terms of talking to media and things like that. It seems like over the last few years that&#8217;s been concentrated at higher levels, and so there&#8217;s not always as much as much direct communication about what really happens at the student level. So I think that&#8217;s just a different way of running things than the leadership was running things when I was there. I don&#8217;t mean the leadership, at the Dean of Students&#8217; level--. But seems like the higher levels, that there&#8217;s less which is ironic because there&#8217;s also so much social media and that kind of conversation. SB: Like you can follow someone who is head of undergraduate research on Twitter but not--. MB: But maybe not, maybe that person is not going to be empowered to talk to a reporter, which is a different thing. It&#8217;s like, is social media causing institutions to control their communication more by not having it be a dialogue? I don&#8217;t know. But we definitely were engaging a lot. Now that doesn&#8217;t mean that we had everything solved, and there were lots of bumpy issues around sexual assault when I was at the university where we were starting [to] doing more training and things like that. And the Rape Crisis Center had been pushing for us to do a better job. By the time I got to UNC they were already pushing for that. That would be interesting research to look back at some of the cases, some of the around 1992, [19]93 you&#8217;d find some interesting news articles. SB: Yeah. Right when the student governments started adjudicating cases under the honor system of sexual assault. MB: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know how far that went back, but yeah it probably went back to the late [19]80s, early [19]90s. SB: You mentioned that there&#8217;d been some controversy around sexual violence on campus at the time you came to UNC. Would you talk about that a little? MB: It was primarily around how cases were handled by the student judicial system. So it&#8217;s much like some of the dialogue going on now and my memory, I have to be cautious because I don&#8217;t want to share things that would&#8217;ve been confidential obviously. That many years ago it&#8217;s hard maybe to separate, but there definitely was some public controversy because the Committee on Student Conduct was considering all the policies based on input they had gotten from the Rape Crisis Center as well as from some student groups like the Rape Action Project and the, what was the organization called? It might have been called Women Against Rape. WAR&#8212; SB: WAR, yeah. MB: But I can&#8217;t remember. As [it] happens now a few student groups changed their names so it would be one acronym. It was ASAP for a while, Advocates of Students Against--, Advocates for Sexual Assault Prevention. That&#8217;s what it was. ASAP. SB: The Feminist Students United is the direct--, there&#8217;s a direct lineage from ASAP to the group. MB: And ASAP might have been the WAR first and the Rape Action Project. So all that was swirling around when I came to UNC, which ultimately helped. Over my years, the seven years I was at UNC I was not always the direct sexual assault person. There were other people in our office, mainly Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and later Don Appiairus because I was the Judicial Officer. So I tended to do a lot of sexual assault to help train about what it was like to go through the student judicial system. And because we would have gaps in coverage somebody would leave, and then it would take a while to replace, I was the direct person a lot of times, for sometimes as much as a year at a time. But I wasn&#8217;t always that direct person and so that was always something that stayed with me that that was an interest I was, I wanted to do more on, which was a big part of what led me to the Rape Crisis Center, bringing it back to OCRCC. And actually when I got to the Rape Crisis Center I do think it was good that I had those university relationships but probably for a good while I needed to focus more on building those community relationships. I look back and it&#8217;s hard to remember exactly, but I probably did less with the university but more encouraged other staff to partner with the university so that I could focus on building relationships with the County, with the Town of Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, Carrboro, and with other donors like the United Way. I remember spending a lot of time my first couple years with United Way because they were restructuring and you had to be part of several committees with United Way. We got some funding through a children and youth committee and some funding through what I think was a self-sufficiency committee for our client work. So it was interesting. I came from the university background, but I didn&#8217;t do as much with that once I was over with Rape Crisis because the County is such a huge entity. It was surprising to me because I having been on campus for a long time and then you think of the campus as such a big part, but then when you are in a position when you are serving the whole county you realize how much broader it is. SB: It&#8217;s part of the bubble effect where it&#8217;s not so much--, well it is in part the fact the self-importance that comes with being part of a university campus, but also the fact that it functions as a town within a town within a county. I&#8217;ve done a series of interviews and people have talked about the longer temporal scope of Orange County, OCRCC&#8217;s vision for providing services at the universities. Because of turnover and the lack of stability because there&#8217;s not an institutional knowledge of how to adjudicate the cases fairly, how to relate to people who are going through the process. Since you brought a strong, feminist and survivor friendly perspective to your job were, as the associate dean, did you encounter much pushback or surprise from people regarding your perspectives? MB: I don&#8217;t think so. I mean I came in to--, because I was committed to being the Judicial Officer. That was my primary scope of work. I definitely came in to be -- neutral is the wrong word--, but objective. One of the things that brought me to Rape Crisis was the desire to be more of an advocate. When you&#8217;re a Judicial Officer, you can&#8217;t be an advocate. You have to be really balanced and you can support students who are in front of you and you can help them know what their resources are and where they can go, but you have to really balance that, if you&#8217;re the Judicial Officer, you have to see the whole picture and make sure everybody&#8217;s getting fair judgment. Honestly, wanting to be more overtly, do more overt advocacy was part of what drew me to the Rape Crisis Center. Because you&#8217;re always in different roles. SB: Interesting. It&#8217;s knowing the whole picture, coming to the Rape Crisis Center but you had to know what it was like to be a responding party within the system. That sounds like a really valuable set of experiences. MB: Yeah, I mean it was different. For me it was nice to have more focus on one issue. Sexual violence is obviously broader than one issue. So it&#8217;s very broad. But coming from UNC I was dealing with academic dishonesty; I was dealing with substance abuse issues, alcohol, sexual violence, student crises, suicide prevention, all of this wide range of issues. And so it was freeing to come and focus more directly on one issue that&#8217;s really important and that intersects with so many other issues in a lot of ways. And that&#8217;s one of the things I love about the Rape Crisis Center is that it stayed true to its mission and a really focused mission, and sometimes there&#8217;s temptations to bring issues together which you do to solve problems, but I think sexual violence especially lends itself to getting submerged if you don&#8217;t have something that focuses directly on it. So I&#8217;ve been really proud that the Rape Crisis Center has continued to have rape in the name for example. And that was a debate that every once in a while would come up in my years. I think it always does. &#8220;Oh, should we consider changing the name? Should we make it broader?&#8221; And ultimately folks would always go back to the sign on Estes Drive. We were the little house on Estes Drive my whole time there, which is exciting to be here in this nice space on Franklin Street. I still am just amazed when I come in here. And I thought the space on Estes Drive was really nice because the Center had been, I don&#8217;t know if Margaret Henderson talked to you about that. But they had been in this little old rickety house on Rosemary Street. And so getting the space on Estes Drive was a big deal when Margaret Henderson was there. I had visited there and gone to training. So keeps moving into cleaner, nicer spaces that is good, giving people more of a feeling of self-care, protection, whatever. SB: That just being invited into spaces. I know that in the Estes Drive house there was a workshop where a community advocate came in it [and] was like, &#8220;Where are the gender non-specific bathrooms?&#8221;, which I really appreciate, understanding although we&#8217;re all focused on eliminating rape that there are ways where we can foreground sexual violence while addressing racial oppression, gender oppression, heterosexism. MB: Well I don&#8217;t remember. We only had one working bathroom there. So I guess everything was gender non-specific. SB: Gender non-specific. MB: In the Estes Drive space. SB: Estes Drive, then it must be Rosemary Street. I feel like this person came within this millennium. MB: I don&#8217;t know. I only remember one. We had one little bathroom that was in one of the offices, but it usually didn&#8217;t work and was storage. But the folks at Amity Methodist Church by and large were very nice about fixing things up. They were our landlords. The church next door was the landlord. And you&#8217;re talking, speaking about the oppression issues and the intersection between sexual violence. Really neat historically. Michelle Johnson-- You know Michelle. SB: Yes. MB: She is now a Carrboro Board of Alderman. And Michelle was a volunteer at the Rape Crisis Center and eventually was on the Board and was on the staff for a while and she was very instrumental. I learned a great deal from her. She had given me some input, and she really helped us start a Diversity Committee and to think intentionally about how sexual violence intersects with other forms of oppression. Then when we did strategic planning probably either midway or a little more than that when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, we did a big strategic planning process. We ended up with a vision. I was sharing it last week because I was doing a training about a form of strategic planning and facilitating the meeting and I said oh when I was at the Rape Crisis Center our vision was a world free of sexual violence and all other forms of oppression. That may still be the vision. I haven&#8217;t looked at it lately but very ambitious. And then we tried to focus in our mission on stopping sexual violence and its impact through support, education and advocacy. Thanks to the incredible volunteers like Michelle and Linda Brooks and some other folks, really we did try to focus on diversity in a really intentional way, not just one aspect but lots of different aspects. And we focused a lot on disability issues, we were very fortunate, there was a project going on with the state Office of Health and Disability, and they contacted us and said, we would like to provide you all with funding and support to improve your services for survivors of sexual assault with disabilities. And so they came in and did an assessment for us and helped implement a lot of things. Everything from a disability parking space to Braille on the door to helping us look at how our documents wouldn&#8217;t be accessible to people with learning disabilities, all sorts of stuff. And they did trainings for our volunteers. I actually remember they did a day-long training on a Saturday. And that turned out to be the Saturday that I had my son who&#8217;s now nine years old. So I had to miss the disability training. I called during the training and I remember Kiran Easwara Chandran, who was our Client Services Director at the time answered, and they were doing activities to help the staff and volunteers learn how to better serve clients with disabilities. She was all excited that my baby had been born. SB: You called after you&#8217;d given labor, gone through labor? MB: Well, I mean for me and maybe not for everybody, the Rape Crisis Center when I was working here it really was a family to me. It was, as you can imagine, pretty intense to work in sexual violence. You may work in it yourself. But it&#8217;s very intense and to do it you develop a lot of camaraderie and really love and support for the folks you work with. So it seemed normal. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t normal. But a Rape Crisis Center is not just your garden variety workplace. SB: In order to not have people dropping out every few years, which still happens for a number of great reasons you need to have strong, something other than a passion for ending rape because&#8212;. MB: Yeah, you need a lot of support and, but I do think that that&#8217;s part of what makes it hard to stay in for a long, long time. I mean eight years definitely seemed like a long time. It is that intensity of, intensity of the issue, intensity of the work, intensity of keeping a small nonprofit afloat. So kudos to Shamecca and everybody for keeping it going. SB: Forty years, almost. It&#8217;s amazing because I developed relationships or been friends with people who do this sort of work and this is a twenty year old but only have relationships with people who have done this, this kind of work. Was it strange going out of rape crisis work or--? MB: Oh definitely. SB: Yeah. MB: Definitely. Because, even now it feels strange sometimes during holidays and things where I&#8217;m not thinking about who might have the pager or should I have the pager or I&#8217;m not on&#8212;I&#8217;m not thinking about who&#8217;s on call. But that is a big deal. When you&#8217;re working in Rape Crisis Center, you&#8217;re always aware that somebody is on call. I ran into last week because we have kids at the same school, a man who was a detective. And he doesn&#8217;t work in that field anymore either, but he was a detective who investigated sexual assault cases and we were reminiscing about being at the hospital in the middle of the night and never sure what the call was going to be and those kinds of things and so it does. It feels --I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a certain amount of -- well there&#8217;s really a great appreciation for those who are doing it. I don&#8217;t want to say there&#8217;s guilt that you&#8217;re not doing it, because that&#8217;s not a good healthy thing. But that happens maybe the first year or so, and then later it&#8217;s more this appreciation for the people who are doing it. And occasionally when my kids are a little older, I wouldn&#8217;t mind going back to doing some crisis intervention volunteer work because there&#8217;s something about being with somebody in that time of crisis. I was talking recently with Ardith Burkes who was our Crisis Response Coordinator for three years and now she works at the Compass Center doing client services for the Compass Center. And we were sharing that feeling of how being there when somebody is going through such a difficult crisis and being able to help them through it and to know that they can get, that healing is a process not something quick. But you&#8217;re helping them move toward healing, and there&#8217;s really nothing, you feel like that&#8217;s where you really needed to be when you&#8217;re in that moment with people. SB: Thank you for sharing that. So the first year it&#8217;s would you say that you, I don&#8217;t know how to say this or what I&#8217;m saying right now. MB: The first year I came to the Rape Crisis Center? SB: Or the first year after leaving, where did you feel there was a change in the degree of support you had from the people with whom you did work or--?. MB: No, it was so different because I was going into a job that was more of a writing job, and I was, because my kids were three and five at the time and sleep had not really come easily for a few years, I was really tired, honestly. I was so tired. The transition was right into this job that was more of a writing and editing job and learning that. So it was a good transition. I&#8217;ve continued trying to financially support the center whenever I can and however much I can so I&#8217;ve stayed at least somewhat aware. But it is, there&#8217;s a lot that goes on. I don&#8217;t know if I answered what you were asking. SB: Is there anything that you expected me to ask during this that I didn&#8217;t? MB: I don&#8217;t think so. I mean I do want to say that I was so fortunate to have really strong Board of Directors&#8217; leadership when I started. Brendan Moylan was the Board President. So he was the Board President who made the offer to me to come and work. And then Mary Cason was the next Board President or she was the vice president with Brendan, and Brendan is an incredible leader and so is Mary. And Mary and I have become close friends. I consider her one of my best friends ever in the world. In fact, we&#8217;re going out to dinner tomorrow night. And Mary was the Board President. She was a volunteer companion, a community educator. She was, she went to, Mary and I had the distinct experience of going to court at one time to try to keep Rape Crisis Center records private. So that felt like a historical moment. So I joke sometimes when people, people wonder if I can keep something confidential. And I&#8217;ll say sometimes well, I went to court before to protect confidentiality. You can trust me. I&#8217;m not going to spill your secrets. So that was a big thing where we had been served with a subpoena to release some client records and there&#8217;s a lot of media, and there was a lot of media coverage around that. Bob Epting, who is this fantastic local attorney who is also a pilot and flies small planes ( ). Bob came and represented us for free as we didn&#8217;t think we should have to release records. So that was an important moment and we got recognized for that work by the NC Center for Nonprofits. Somewhere around here there&#8217;s a little award from that. So that was good. That felt like we were doing something for other Rape Crisis Centers as well. We also had other board presidents like Shauna Hay and Shelley Golden and Elin Abercrombie and Amy Preble, just really great folks. Most of our board presidents while I was at the Rape Crisis Center came from the pool of volunteers. They had been trained in being a rape crisis companion or being a Community Educator and came at it with that strong training and then rose into being a leader, being a Board President type of leader. That was really important that folks have that grounding. One thing that really stayed strong and still is that commitment to strong training which is expensive if you think about it. It&#8217;s really hard to do forty to sixty hours of training, and it&#8217;s hard for people to devote that time. So that was a real commitment the agency had. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve tried to stay as close to that as they can. But it got harder and harder because there were a lot of organizations you could volunteer for without having that much training. So how are we on time? SB: One-fifty-seven. MB: Yeah, I need to go soon. SB: All right. Well, unless there are other comments you&#8217;d like to add, I&#8217;ve been thrilled to have this conversation with you actually. But-- MB: Well, great if you have other questions at some point let me know and you&#8217;re going use this to fold into the overall oral history? Is that the way it gets used? SB: Yes, this will probably go into the Long Women&#8217;s Movement Collection, but once we stop recording I can go over the deed of gift forms and-- MB: That&#8217;s probably a good idea because I have a two-thirty...
