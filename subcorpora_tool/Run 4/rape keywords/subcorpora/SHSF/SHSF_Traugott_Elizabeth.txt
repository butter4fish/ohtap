 Diamond: Today is June 5, 2012. Iâm talking to Elizabeth Traugott, who was head of the Stanfordâs Department of Linguistics and then was appointed Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies at Stanford. Iâm Diana Diamond and Elizabeth Traugott is with me. Good morning, Elizabeth. Traugott: [00:00:32] Good morning. Diamond: I have a variety of questions here to ask you, and letâs start off with your background. This is such a big question, but could you narrow it down? What was significant about your background, family, upbringing, education that really influenced your life and career? Traugott: [00:00:55] As I have often told people who ask me questions like that, I kind of fell into being an academic. My father was an academic, he was a professor of German, and my grandfather was a professor of German, both in England. When I went to Oxford University as an undergraduate and finished my degree there in English, I really wasnât very keen at all on a job in the academic profession, but for one reason or another, I eventually decided I would explore the U.S. as a graduate student, so I came in 1960. Diamond: To Stanford? 11 Traugott: [00:01:42] To Berkeley. And I sort of fell into linguistics by taking a few classes on language, and I just loved it. Diamond: Why? Traugott: [00:01:57] I think I have always wanted to be in a field thatâs somewhat scientific, but I was brought up at home and I never really learned an adequate amount of mathematics or science to do that. And thereâs something about the way language is structured and the way we approach that, that appealed. It seemed to fill the gap that I had in my prior education. I had studied Old and Middle English at Oxford, so I knew about the history of English. That became my major, but it was a very non-theoretical training that I had at Oxford. It was very detailed, descriptive. And what fascinated me here in Berkeley was thinking about the much larger picture: how language is structured. So thatâs a very short version of how I fell into linguistics. I had always really wanted to do something administrative, which is part of why I was grateful when various people, including, in fact, former Stanford president Dick Lyman, suggested that I mightâ Diamond: He was the president of Stanford at the time. He made these suggestions to you. Traugott: [00:03:28] I suppose he must have been at the time. Letâs see. I was invited to be a university fellow. I donât know whether they still have the program, but it was a program for potential administrators, people who had been noticed some way or another as possibly being likely to be chairs, deans, and 12 so forth. That would be back in the early seventies. Iâm not sure that he was president at the time. I think he was provost. Diamond: He probably was provost. Traugott: [00:04:05] I think he was provost at the time. I should have checked my CV. But I had been on a committee looking into the status of women at Stanford, and that was my project as fellow; those kinds of issues were all feeding in together in the early seventies. Diamond: That was the time of Gloria Steinem andâ Traugott: [00:04:39] Yes. Letâs see. At that time I believe there were seven of us women. Diamond: Seven faculty? Traugott: [00:04:46] Tenured faculty in H&S anyway. I donât know about the rest of the university. Diamond: Was Barbara Babcock from the law school? Traugott: [00:04:56] From the law school. She was around. Itâs a very small number, but in H&S I believe there were seven, and one of them was Clara Bush, who was actually in linguistics. So we all felt that there were rather too few women around. Diamond: So it was the number of women who were teaching as opposed to their getting higher-level positions at Stanford. Traugott: [00:05:23] Right. Yes. And then I remember in the Faculty Senate some years later on, and again it was Dick Lyman, and I think he was president at the time, asking me at one of the presentationsâI wasnât giving it -somebody else gave a presentation, maybe he didâabout numbers of 13 women and minority faculty and increases and decreases. And I, who was on Faculty Senate, said, âWell, why donât you give the figures about women in higher positions?â which he asked, âWhy do you want to know?â Diamond: Interesting. Traugott: [00:06:02] It was a very interesting question. And I said, âWell, if weâre talking about parity, itâs not simply a question about whether weâre hired; itâs a question about what the options are once weâre here.â Diamond: Dick was married to Jing Lyman, whoâs certainly a strong woman. Traugott: [00:06:24] Very, very strong woman. And a very wonderful woman. Diamond: He married her. He must have liked women like that. [Laughs] Traugott: [00:06:36] You know, I think it was probably not a real question. It was one of those rhetorical questions so that it could be put down on record why it might be valuable for them to have the numbers for women who were chairs, because I think women were only chairs at that time, and maybe by then I hadâI canât remember the timing of all of this. Itâs been many decades. But I either was chair of the department by then, which would have brought it forward to 1980, or I was hoping to be, which would put it in the late seventies. Diamond: Iâm leaping ahead a little bit. In 1985, as I mentioned, you were appointed vice provost and dean of graduate studies, Stanfordâs then highest-ranking woman administrator. Were you surprised when you were appointed or pleased by the appointment? Traugott: [00:07:50] I was very pleased. Yes, I was surprised, because at the time I was chair of the Department of Linguistics, and as I mentioned earlier, I had 14 always been interested in doing administrative work, but this is quite a privilege. I mean, I wasnât ignorant of the fact that I had been suggested, so in that sense I wasnât surprised, but I was surprised in the sense that I actually made it, yes. Diamond: Then-provost Jim Rosse â and I read a news release announcing your appointmentâsaid that you were, quote, âlevelheaded, imaginative, with a demonstrated capacity to get things done.â Did you consider those words at all patronizing? Traugott: [00:08:44] No, and I donât consider them patronizing now. I think theyâre factually probably pretty correct. Diamond: I just wondered whether he would describe a man as levelheaded, imaginative, with demonstrated capacity. Traugott: [00:09:03] Well, I donât know. I canât speak to that. One would have to look into the records. I mean, you know, I think men are often described as levelheaded, at least for CEO kinds of jobs. Diamond: Thatâs true. Traugott: [00:09:17] Imaginative is sort of important, I mean, maybe the combination is, but, no, it didnât strike me as patronizing. Diamond: What were some of the biggest problems you were facing when you took over the post? Traugott: [00:09:29] My recollection is it was actually when I was acting provost one summer, that was when the medical school was just trying so hard to expand and expand and expand, and the kinds of salaries that people were asking for 15 were so out of sync with the rest of the university. I remember that was a major, major issue. I donât know whether youâre going to ask parts that I enjoyed. The parts that I enjoyed wereâ Diamond: Let me hold you there. So the salaries were considerably higher than any of the other faculty were getting? Traugott: [00:10:23] Absolutely. Diamond: By a factor of three, two, four? Traugott: [00:10:28] I would say two to three, probably. And space demands, people in the sciences in general, of course, were looking for space. But the constant space demands, financial demands, thatâs what I remember. Iâm sure there were many other things to remember. Diamond: I remember when I was working for David Korn as dean, I described him as having an âedificeâ complex, because every chairman he got wanted a new building. Traugott: [00:11:05] A new building, oh, yes. Diamond: So he kept on building more and moreâ Traugott: [00:11:07] So you know what Iâm talking about. Diamond: ânew buildings. Traugott: [00:11:10] New buildings, new buildings with some faculty who wanted housing on campus. Housing on campus was a big issue, of course. Or getting people from other campuses and hiring them and finding some way for them to be able to afford to live here. Diamond: Which was a problem then and now. 16 Traugott: [00:11:35] Which was a problem then, and is still, yes. But those are the kinds of things I remember as big problems. Diamond: What did you enjoy when you took over the post? Traugott: [00:11:44] What I enjoyed very much was the whole process of preparing the faculty files for promotion and tenure and appointment for the advisory board. I found it fascinating. Diamond: Which advisory board was this? Traugott: [00:12:06] At that time, there was only one. But, anyway, there was at the time an elected faculty board whose responsibility was to advise the president about appointments that would be forwarded to the trustees. So it was above the provost and reporting to the president. I was actually elected to it one year, very, very prestigious, because pretty much everybody on it had a Nobel Prize, Ken Arrow and people like that. Diamond: Interesting. But I remember there were some department politics. I mean, the economics department always tended to appoint more conservative individuals than liberal economists. Traugott: [00:13:11] Oh, well, yes, economics and the GSB [Graduate School of Business], that was always a fight between those two. But those things are fascinating. I find this fascinating, the structural issue of how a department defines itself vis-Ã -vis other ones, particularly when thereâs overlap like GSB and Economics. Just fascinated me. Still does. Diamond: Is that still going on? Traugott: [00:13:38] At Stanford? I have no idea. Now and then I did various kinds of assessments. I was on the GRE board, and so you go out and assess various 17 graduate programs. I was on the GRE and TOEFL boards. And I still do quite a bit of assessing. In fact, Iâm going to the Netherlands to assess a program in the Fall. [00:14:05] Itâs this whole issue of looking at the way some research program, in that case in the Fall, or some department or some school is structured and how one defines the category and domain of, say, being in linguistics rather than in a language department. How do you make those choices when you make an appointment? How do you make those choices when you apply for a job? Because a lot of jobs these days are crossdisciplinary. They were then too. [00:14:50] So, yes, what you bring up, the issue of how a department decides that it is going to structure itself, whether more conservative, less conservative, more concerned with statistics and quantification or quality judgments, all those kinds of things are part of the structuring of the program. Diamond: The advisory committee, advisory council, recognized these departmental attitudes? Traugott: [00:15:24] Yes, and they tried, with the provost and the president, with the provost especially, to guide and counsel, particularly when new appointments were made. Now Iâm rethinking what I said. The advisory board, I think the advisory board must have reported to the president. This is not familiar to you, the advisory board? Diamond: No, I didnât know about it. 18 Traugott: [00:15:55] Well, maybe it doesnât exist anymore. Anyway, the reason Iâm now querying it is that the provost, at least then, was the academic side of the administration, and the president is more directed to the outside world. Now, those are not absolute divisions, of course, canât be and shouldnât be. But because these are faculty appointments, one would have thought it would report to the provost, but that couldnât be because the provost was preparing the documentation. Diamond: For the president. Traugott: [00:16:33] For the president. Unless it went directly to the trustees, but the president always saw them, exceptâIâve forgotten to whom they reported. But, anyway, yes, the advisory board was very concerned with these matters because if you make a new appointment, and particularly if you bring someone from the outside as a full professor or someone whoâs going to be the chair of the department, you want to know what that view is, what the vision of the department is and of the field and how it fits in the university at large. Diamond: And within their department, yes. Traugott: [00:17:11] Yes. Diamond: I know you were also concerned with the scant number of ethnic minorities, and women that were going into graduate education. Iâve got a few figures here. In 1985, there was an increase of one student in graduate education from the previous year, from 119 to 120. The number of women graduates declined from 2,168 in 1984-â85 to 2,100 the following year. What were the problems? 19 Traugott: [00:17:44] I think the problems for minorities were basically that Stanford was, still is, perceived as too elitist, too expensive. Now, we tried very hard to counter-argue that, but I think itâs still a perception problem. I think that itâs also the problem that in many cases, certainly at that time, parents of African Americans, Chicanos, and others were concerned that their children would go into professional, high-paying, important, to them, jobs, and so they discouraged their children. Iâm not sure that itâs quite as bad as that still, but it was certainly at the time a sense that academiaâs not the place for us to have an influence. Diamond: Whatâs the minority, in terms of student population, at Stanford now? In fact, I just heard Ken Auletta being interviewed. He wrote an article in The New Yorker, and I think itâs 54 or 55 percent are nonwhites. So thatâs been a dramatic change since when you were in the administration. Traugott: [00:19:21] Well, nonwhite is a different matter, because weâve always had a huge number of Asian students, huge. Diamond: Thatâs true. Even back then? Traugott: [00:19:31] Oh, even back then, even back then. I think there are more now. And speaking of my own department, I mean, students from Korea, Japan, China. Not so easy in those days to be from China, but certainly Korea and Japan, there were many of them. Now theyâre from China as well. And thatâs linguistics, and thatâs a humanities department. And they were the majority, often, in computer science and some of the sciences. [00:20:08] So if youâre talking about nonwhite versus minority, youâre talking about totally different groups, because minority in those days were 20 defined by Congress as African American, American Indian, Hispanicâand that was always problematic that we focused on Chicano rather than Hispanics in general. But those numbers were tiny, and I think theyâre still very small. Diamond: Had your predecessor done enough work in this area, or was it just a hard problem to solve? Traugott: [00:20:51] I think itâs a really hard problem to solve. My predecessor, you mean Jerry Lieberman? Diamond: Yes. Traugott: [00:20:57] I think he did his best. He had certainly been instrumental in hiring a staff. There was Cecelia Burciaga, who was Chicana, and she was actually in charge of the minority recruitments. But being Chicana, she was particularly focused on Chicano issues. Diamond: She was a strong woman too. Traugott: [00:21:27] Oh, a very strong woman. And then there was Ann Medicine, who was recruiting American Indians. Iâm embarrassed to say I donât remember the name of the woman who was recruiting African Americans. There was some changeover in the system there. But those three slots were in place, and Iâm sure Jerry Lieberman put them in place, or maybe his predecessor, I donât know. But we had a large staff concerned with just those issues. I think numbers have improved, but very small, very small. Diamond: Certainly thereâs a major effort to get more minorities. I was reading, too, back when you took over, there was a decentralized approach to graduate 21 education, more the responsibility of each department rather than a unified approach. Traugott: [00:22:25] Well, it was unified at that time. Diamond: Oh, was it? Okay. Traugott: [00:22:30] And it became decentralized. I think Jerry Lieberman had sort of centralized it, and he was absolutely devoted to centralization of the graduate office and actually encouraged staff to continue that. I had some questions about it because Karlene Dickey was absolutely fantastic. She was extraordinary for what she did. She was in charge of all of the admissions and all of programs and everything. [00:23:16] But to centralize the whole university did mean it was a somewhat cumbersome way of dealing with things. I mean, if you just think of all admissions, all applications going through one office, just think of the piles of mail. Departments got frustrated. They felt we were slowing things up. So a lot of things happened inâI guess it was 1991. There were also financial problems. There have been financial problems on and off ever since Iâve been around. But that period of financial problems, it was decided to decentralize the graduate office and other offices. So there was a staff, I believe, of somewhere in the range of 150 in graduate studies, and the reorganization abolished the dean of graduate studies position, putting associate deans in schools, so thereâs an associate dean of graduate studies in H&S and other areas. [00:24:39] Then they brought the graduate dean back again with Patricia Gumport, because apparently there had always been an intention to 22 have a graduate dean, but in order to just cut things clear, straightforward, abolish the office for a while, decentralize, and then recentralize when youâve figured out what really needed to be centralized. And certainly minority recruitment needs to be at both levels. It has to be in the department. This was clear from day one. But it also has to be centralized. Diamond: A university concern. Traugott: [00:25:22] It has to be a university concern because you have to have the image of the university and people from the university going out and making clear to the world that Stanford is a good place to come to, regardless of their field. It might be English; it might be linguistics; it might be computer science; it might be medicine. And you need to get that message across at a centralized level, I think, as well as a particular level, a particular department. Diamond: Now, you were vice provost from 1984 to 1993, is that correct? Traugott: [00:26:05] A shorter time, 1985 to 1991. It was the same as the graduate deanship. Diamond: Did you feel any prejudice or discrimination during those years or particularly at the beginning since you were the first major woman administrator? Traugott: [00:26:24] Oh, well, I think itâs very well known that women say something at a committee meeting and nobody responds, and then someone twenty minutes later has exactly the same thought, but itâs a man and heâs listened to. That is an experience that I had on many, many occasions, and itâs such a well-known phenomenon in all the literature on gender discrimination. So I had many examples of those. You felt ignored, but we persisted. Somehow the message got across, even if it was thought not to be oneâs own. The 23 important thing was to get things done, not who necessarily did it. So, yes, there was that. I think there was some considerable resentment in certain areas. Diamond: By the men or by other women? Traugott: [00:27:34] They were almost all men. There were very few women chairs at the time. But I think also that was connected with resentment of the central authority of the university. The medical school was interesting, and the dean, David Korn, was delightful, a delightful person, but I do think that the medical school felt that it somehow ought to be separate and special, so they couldnât quite understand why the dean of graduate studies should be interfering, quote, âinterferingâ in their business. Of course, I was concerned with all students, graduate students. Whether MDs or PhDs, didnât make any difference, they are graduate students and itâs their life. Because we were concerned not only with the program, but also with the lives of the students, since it was a centralized office, of course I needed to be concerned about the medical students. Same thing with the GSB. I always met with deans of schools or I met with department chairs. Karlene Dickey was funny. She said, âWeâre going to have to have a shoe budget, because we keep walking around campus.â [Laughter] I didnât want people to come to me. I wanted to go to them, because I think itâs useful to see people in their own domain. GSB didnât bring along any figures or any concerns for the MBAs. I said, âBut MBA is a graduate student.â 24 âOh, I thought youâd only be interested in the Ph.D.âs.â No, we have graduate students here and the postdocs. Itâs an odd category. That was a difficult category to deal with. Diamond: As to your first comment about you say something and then nobody acknowledges it, I can remember being at meetings which included some Stanford trustees, and the men would look at each other, and youâd say something and no one would listen. I would be sitting there just like the rest of them, and Iâd have to say, âIâm here.â I waved my hand. Traugott: [00:30:06] Yes. Diamond: At Berkeley, before coming to Stanford, you were assistant professor and then you were with the University of York and University College of Tanzania. Letâs focus on Berkeley. What were the differences between Berkeley and Stanford in terms of teaching experiences? Traugott: [00:30:29] Well, I was at Berkeley at a time when everything was in a state of upheaval. This is the late sixties. Diamond: Vietnam War. Traugott: [00:30:49] It was a time of so much upheaval, and the English department, which I was in, actually closed down. Now, I was teaching a course on the structure of English language, which was a requirement then. Not any longer, ceased to be somewhere around 1970, but at the time it was a requirement for teachers in schools to take a grammar-of-English class. So I was teaching this class which was taken in part by people who were trying to get their credential in education. 25 [00:31:36] When everything closed up, partly because there was teargas on campus all the time, and there was disruption and students would come into the class and disrupt, so classes were closed down, I refused to not teach the class, because there were these people who needed their credentials. Furthermore, if somebody wanted to take it, I thought it was their right to have the class, and I thought it was the right of people if they wanted to drop out, they could drop out. I also thought it was the right of people who insisted they should do something relevant, they could do something relevant, but I wasnât sure what they thought was relevant. So I said, âOkay. If you can devise, tell me what is relevant, weâll work something out together.â So my big class wasnât too big, it was about sixty people, ended up in three different sections, and we met in peopleâs houses. Diamond: Oh, how nice. Traugott: [00:32:35] So it was such a different atmosphere from here, where, yes, there was very bad disruption for two weeks, but departments werenât closed down. The English department, which Iâd been a graduate student in, and I was married to one of its members by then, had been a very, very friendly department. They were always having cocktail parties. I canât tell you how much hard liquor was drunk in the mid sixties. I went there in 1960, so the early sixties. It was an extremely friendly department, the English department at Berkeley. By the late sixties, some people didnât talk to each other for political objections to each other, and so it became an extremely unpleasant place to be. Diamond: Almost like the polarization today. 26 Traugott: [00:33:44] It was totally polarized. So when I was here, I didnât find that. I was partly in the English department and partly here and partly in linguistics, and all the time that I was here, I was one-third in English. People were very friendly. [00:34:07] The kind of course I taught was the same kind as I taught in Berkeley. You mentioned Mary Pratt, a Spanish professor. I wrote a book with her for that course. It was called Linguistics for Students of English. Diamond: She was head of the Department of Sociology? Traugott: [00:34:28] Spanish. Spanish and Portuguese. Diamond: I thought she was also in Sociology. I may be wrong. Traugott: [00:34:35] She might have had a courtesy appointment, but in later years. She didnât then. I thought that I should offer a course on grammar, and also since it was in the English department, I should make it relevant to the literary studies. So I started including a component at the end of the course, actually in Berkeley already, of how is this relevant to literature, and then it became a much larger part of the course and became part of the book eventually. [00:35:09] So I would say basically the difference was the political difference, and, of course, U.C. Berkeley is a much larger place, and so the classes were larger. The quality of the students, I would say, was just fairly similar. Diamond: You mentioned that your husband was a full professor of English. Traugott: [00:35:31] Yes. Diamond: If I recall, about that time U.C. Berkeley had a nepotism rule. 27 Traugott: [00:35:37] Thatâs right. Diamond: Then you had to resign because of that. Traugott: [00:35:40] Thatâs right. Actually, the nepotism rule was deemed illegal by the time I got the job here, but I hadâ Diamond: You had experienced it. Traugott: [00:35:51] âlooked for a job because I knew I was going to have to resign. It didnât matter, you could live together, but you couldnât get married. So it was totally ridiculous. [00:36:05] But, actually, I think being in the same department with a spouse when youâre that different in age, because my husband was eighteen years older than me, was a little bit difficult on a personal level, but not academic. Diamond: Did you fight the rule at all at the time or did you justâ Traugott: [00:36:25] Well, I didnât. I couldnât, really. I suppose I could have, if Iâd really wanted to make a fuss of it, but I wasnât all that enamored of the English department at Berkeley anyway because of the time. As I said, Iâm not sure, but for personal reasons, I would really have wanted to stay there. I think itâs slightly tricky. Diamond: Oh, sometimes, itâs very hard to work with oneâs spouse. Traugott: [00:36:58] Itâs hard to work with a spouse, itâs hard in the system when one is so much more senior than the other, and also I had been a graduate student in that department. So there were a few reasons I didnât really want to fight it and I was quite happy toâ Diamond: I donât want to be incestuous â¦ 28 Traugott: [00:37:16] But itâs an excuse to be elsewhere. Diamond: In 1980, then-president of Stanford, Donald Kennedy, appointed you chair of one of three task forces designed to recommend women who might be valuable additions to Stanfordâs tenured faculty. What did you do, and were you successful? Traugott: [00:37:35] It was 1980, yes. I was wrong earlier on. I said it might have been President Lyman. Okay. What I did, there were three of us, and my job wasâone was in the medical school. I wish I could remember her name.1 Right now I donât, but anyway, there were three of us, and my job was to represent H&S. So I went to, again walking on my feet, to every department in H&S, talking with them about their goals and their expectations and how they made appointments, listening to their concerns and how they did things, and developed with them over time a protocol for appointments. So if you have, say, 100 applicants of whom some subsets are women, and they have equal credentials, be sure to give them an equal chance. I think that was the basis, like equality of treatment right from day one of the appointment process, and be aware that women at the time were, some of them, entering into fields which were not well known. Now, weâre talking about 1980. Gender studies was not a very hot topic at the time. It is now. But at that time, it was a new topic and people didnât know how to evaluate it. People never know how to evaluate a new topic. So there were questions about how to evaluate, so we had to develop some criteria or asked departments to 1 Elizabeth Traugott later recalled that it was Helen Blau. 29 develop criteria to evaluate new research and sometimes to take a bit of a risk. Traugott: [00:40:20] So that was really the process, and I think we were successful, yes. Not immediately. Diamond: Let me follow up, because as I was reading through your file, in 1993 five female senators of the Faculty Senate submitted a report that Stanford trailed behind its peers in recruitment and retention of female faculty when compared with Ivy League or Pac-10 schools. So that was thirteen years after you were chair. So you were somewhat successful, but there was still a problem in 1993, which is pretty late. Traugott: [00:40:57] Thereâs probably still a problem. I think we were successful insofar as we met the first goal, which at the moment, 1980, was to have departments consider women faculty for appointments, and I think there were quite a few appointments. [00:41:38] Now, our job was less, at the time, to work with departments to think about retaining a number of women who were there at the time. Now, I think that in subsequent years, people like John Hennessy was just fantastic in getting recruitment to the School of Engineering. It really needed the engineering school to commit itself. But whether the retention was as feasible, itâs really difficult to say, because it was exactly like the minority faculty. If youâve got a good person, lots of universities are going to try and hire you. The pool is small. If the pool is smallâ Diamond: Theyâre in demand. 30 Traugott: [00:42:33] âand there are lots of incentives out there to go to other places, you have to consider whether your department is really the best department. For me, there was no reason I would ever want to go to any other Department of Linguistics, because at that time it was ranked, after MIT, the best Department of Linguistics, the most lauded Department of Linguistics. Why would one want to go anywhere else? [Laughter] But thatâs not the case in all departments, and sometimes you want to have a new opportunity. You want to explore something else, particularly midlife sometimes. You get new ideas. So, yes, it was unfortunate the numbers did go down, and I think there were retention problems because perhaps not enough was done to retain people in general. I would include at that time there was also problem with retaining minority faculty. Diamond: Thatâs a good segue, because this report from the five senators, from what I read, there was some delay in implementing it, and at that point Condi Rice was a provost and it was part of her responsibility. Did she play a major role in either implementing or delaying those reports, I mean acting on implementing them? Traugott: [00:44:14] Well, the perception was that she was so concerned with meeting very high criteria, that things could have gone forward faster and more productively, and there were, I think, quite a few people whoâ Diamond: When you say the very best criteria, only the best and the brightest? Traugott: [00:44:48] Yes. Now, the best and the brightest are good terms, but very difficult to evaluate because they depend on so many factors. So, yes, that was a bit of a problem at the time. 31 Diamond: Why did you leave the job as vice provost, or what happened? Traugott: [00:45:21] It was a five-year term, and, in fact, I was there the sixth year mainly to devolve the centralized graduate department. Also, I wanted to go back to teaching. I had insisted all the way along that I would have one afternoon to meet with graduate students in linguistics, because I knew I was going to go back into research. Diamond: And you did. Traugott: [00:45:57] And I did. You lose touch if youâreâI mean, the job was 100 percent time, and the way I work, I can easily doâ Diamond: Two hundred percent. Traugott: [00:46:07] â200 percent. Well, not 200 percent, but I can easily do 100 percent plus. So I did actually have a few graduate students. We had little, little seminars. It was sort of one-on-one rather than other things. And I taught a Linguistic Society of America summer session course here at Stanford, so I didnât have to leave the campus in the summer. Diamond: It was during these years, the eighties and early nineties, that Stanford rose in prominence, nationally and internationally, and no longer was it âthe farm.â It was the âHarvard of the West Coast.â What contributed to the success, in your opinion? Traugott: [00:46:56] I think it was a very deliberate attempt in the seventies, which took time to implement, of course, but a very, very considerable attempt to make a lot of new appointments of people who clearly already were stars or were going to be, and to do a big job tenuring them. 32 [00:47:29] Iâll take my department as an example, because the deans of H&S gave us lots of leeway to make new appointments. When I came here, linguistics was a committee. It was a group of faculty who were in different departments and, quite frankly, the graduate program was quite weak. That was the late sixties. There was an effort to turn things around. This is because the deans of H&S saw that linguistics was an up-and-coming field, and there were some good people on campus. We became a department, and Clara Bush and I were quite instrumental in making that happen in the seventies. [00:48:29] As it happened, at the time that it happened, the deans decided they were going to give us a lot of billets. Now, we werenât the only department where that happened. It was with several, but Iâm just using this as an example. We got a number of people who had been trained at MIT, and theyâre still with us. Joan Bresnan, for example, she came, then she left, and then she came back again. Sheâs now retired. Paul Kaparsky came sometime, and Stanley Peters. Stanley Peters was not from MIT. But there were a large number of appointments that were made actually at the associate professors level before I was chair and during the time that I was chair, so late seventies, early eighties. It was happening across the campus because it was a time of expansion. Diamond: Lots of new energy. Traugott: [00:49:35] Huge new energy, new people, and the criteria was always get someone who you think has already changed the field, is going to change the field. Thatâs how it happened. 33 Diamond: Don Kennedy was an energetic president too. Traugott: [00:49:54] Oh, he was very energetic. Diamond: Which leads me to my next question. You worked directly or indirectly with several of Stanfordâs presidents: Dick Lyman, Kennedy. Traugott: [00:50:07] Don Kennedy was the president at the time that I wasâ Diamond: Was there. Okay. Can you comment about their styles and how they differed from one another? Traugott: [00:50:16] Not really, because I didnât work directly with Dick Lyman when he was president. I met him from time to time. I was on the Faculty Senate, so, yes, I saw him. Well, I think Dick Lyman was more retiring, shall we say? He gave the impression of being more laidback. I believe he wasnât. Iâm just talking about style. [00:50:53] I think both of them really led the university in very good directions. They were both very clear about standards and the right to do oneâs own research without control by trustees, donors, or businesses. So the right to freedom of research, both of them, really, really important to them. So they upheld the standards of being a university and became a model, made the university a model for many other places. Diamond: Was that true also with Gerhard Casper? Traugott: [00:51:54] Oh, to some extent, yes. Diamond: He was more academic. Traugott: [00:52:00] He was more academic, yes. I had come back to the faculty by the time Gerhard Casper became president, so I didnât know him as well. I donât 34 think I felt as influenced by him as I did by the others, but then I was older. It makes a difference. [Laughs] Diamond: Youâve had a long career at Stanford. Whatâs your best accomplishment? I know thatâs a hard question, and youâll probably think of more instances after I leave. Traugott: [00:52:46] Well, youâre talking about as an administrator or as an academic? Because those are two different things. Diamond: Both. Letâs do academic first. Traugott: [00:52:57] Well, I suppose the academic side. I would say thatâs what weâve been talking about, the concern to create a good department, a very strong department. I didnât do it by myself, but contributed to that, contributed to the increase in the number of women and minority, faculty and students, graduate students. I think all those would be things that I would say at the administrative level. [00:53:29] The research level, I think, is a rather linguistics-specific issue, but done a lot of work on language change and ways of theorizing it, and those have been quite successful. Diamond: Now, you retired when? Traugott: [00:53:54] 2003. Diamond: And what have you been doing for the past several years? Traugott: [00:54:01] I have done more research than I ever had time to do before, and I travel a lot. Every year I go somewhere to teach small, more intensive courses on the research Iâm currently doing. Iâm currently co-editing a handbook on the history of English, and I am currently writing a book with a 35 colleague at the University of Edinburgh. Itâs called Constructionalization, but itâs a totally new way of thinking about language change. So thatâs what I do. Diamond: Whatâs the focus or foci of your research? Traugott: [00:54:47] Itâs all on language change, itâs on the history of English, how meaning changes, how sentence structure changes, and then how you think about that and sort of theory of conceptualizing it. Diamond: Weâre just about through. Are there any other thoughts and things that I didnât bring up or that you would like to share? Traugott: [00:55:33] I guess I have conveyed what I said offline, before you started recording, that I think that Stanford has been a wonderful, wonderful place to work. One of the things I really like about it is the degree to which it fosters interdisciplinary cross-departmental work. I was working in the English department as well as linguistics. I have found many connections with the Asian language department now, and, in fact, I have a graduate student right now finishing her dissertation in Asian languages. I know that President Hennessy has paid a great deal of attention to cross-disciplinary work, and I think that thatâs really important. One has the idea that thatâs what you do in the sciences, or used to have the idea that thatâs what you do in the sciences, not what you do anymore at all only in the sciences, itâs everywhere. Diamond: Outside of engineering and science and medicine. Traugott: [00:56:48] Yes, and all these interfaces, all these interrelations. Itâs back to the issue of how you conceptualize your field and how you conceptualize the department and its relation to other departments. Itâs good to see cross- 36 school connections that we have in bio-X, biology and medicine and engineering and humanities. Linguistics has always had people who do computational linguistics. So thereâs always been some connection with computer science. Terry Winograd, whoâs now in computer science alone, was in linguistics and computer science. And a more recent appointee, Dan Jurafsky, has a courtesy appointment in computer science. So those kinds of cross-school connections, I think, are really important. Diamond: Do you mind if I mention your age? Traugott: [00:58:01] No, not at all. Diamond: Elizabeth told me earlier sheâs seventy-three years old, and I think sheâs going to continue at this speed for another twenty-five years or so. [Laughter] Traugott: [00:58:13] Oh, no, no, I hope not. Diamond: Sheâs been lovely to talk to. And I want to thank you very, very much. Traugott: [00:58:20] Thank you. Diamond: Appreciate it. Traugott: [00:58:21] Interesting questions. Thank you...
