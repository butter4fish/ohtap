That many years ago it&#8217;s hard maybe to separate, but there definitely was some public controversy because the Committee on Student Conduct was considering all the policies based on input they had gotten from the Rape Crisis Center as well as from some student groups like the Rape Action Project and the, what was the organization called? It might have been called Women Against Rape. WAR&#8212; SB: WAR, yeah. MB: But I can&#8217;t remember. As [it] happens now a few student groups changed their names so it would be one acronym. It was ASAP for a while, Advocates of Students Against--, Advocates for Sexual Assault Prevention. That&#8217;s what it was. ASAP. SB: The Feminist Students United is the direct--, there&#8217;s a direct lineage from ASAP to the group. MB: And ASAP might have been the WAR first and the Rape Action Project. So all that was swirling around when I came to UNC, which ultimately helped. Over my years, the seven years I was at UNC I was not always the direct sexual assault person.
