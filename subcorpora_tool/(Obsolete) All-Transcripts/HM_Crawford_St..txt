Crawford, Sr.] and she had a dream of lightning and after researching it, she realized that it was the Northern Lights and the Northern Lights were often referred to as St. Elmo's fire, so she named her first son after the Northern Lights.

Story_ID: 415446
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] side of the family.  We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Mamie Evelyn Walker [Mamie Walker Crawford].  And after she married, her name became Mamie Evelyn Walker Crawford.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born on September 7, 1921, in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family and how back can you trace--how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I'm the great-grandson of Maggie Lena Walker who was the first black banker in America.  She was also the first black banker in America and she started the Penny Savings and Loan [sic. St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Richmond, Virginia] which now is the Consolidated Bank of Richmond [sic. Consolidated Bank and Trust Company; Premier Bank, Inc.], that was my mother's grandmother and she was the daughter of Ethel [Ethel Robinson Walker] and Armstead Walker [sic. Melvin DeWitt Walker], Armstead was the son of Maggie Walker.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, her grandmother and grandfather, Ethel and Armstead Walker?  Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now, so Armstead Walker was your, was Maggie Walker's son?
Speaker 2: Maggie Walker's son, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well tell us the story of Maggie Walker, can you go back any, any further than Maggie Walker in your family history?
Speaker 2: Not accurately probably, but Maggie Walker's parents were, of course, were slaves in the United States, and she was born of a mixed family.  Her father [William H. Mitchell] was white; her mother [Elizabeth Draper Mitchell] was a Negro at the time.  I don't know too much about that part of the--of history.
Story_ID: 415447
Speaker 1: We know quite a bit about Maggie Walker [Maggie Lena Walker], of course, who, you know was quite a phenomenal lady in her own right.  She was a banker, she was a real estate entrepreneur, she started a women's sorority she initiated several educational programs in Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Let me go back just a little bit and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now, her mother [Elizabeth Draper Mitchell] was, let's see, her mother--did she work in a house, do, do you know if, if she was a house servant or, or is that, any of that information available?
Speaker 1: I believe she was a house servant, and she was also the mistress of the owner of the house in which she worked, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so after--so your great-grandmother was born on that property that, during slavery?
Speaker 1: I believe so.
Speaker 2: Okay and that's near Richmond or around Richmond?
Speaker 1: It was in Virginia, I'm not sure it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --was in Richmond proper.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But, she came out of slavery and moved to Richmond I guess?
Speaker 1: Moved to Richmond.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And was able to start a bank [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Richmond, Virginia].  Now is there--any family lore about how she got the idea for that, or what kind of person she was, you know?
Speaker 1: Oh there is, there actually is, is quite a history of her, her accomplishments and she was, I think in her teens when she first decided that she was going to start [sic.] an organization of young women, and that organization actually is still today.  It develops young teenagers and dancing and literary skills, speaking, public speaking and all that.  From that point she started a sorority of women which was to encourage women to become independent, to seek higher education.  And with that she then decided that, you know, black men and women needed to start saving and sponsoring their own businesses.  So she started a penny savings bank so that they could, you know, amass their funds and save their money and start their own businesses in, in Virginia.  And I think that was the inception of the bank and the, the sorority that she started, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what's the name of the sorority that she started?
Speaker 1: St. Luke's society [Independent Order of St. Luke].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay and--now there's--we had some literature here in our research that indicated she started with very little money to, you know, began this bank, you know, she had--
Speaker 1: And became one--
Speaker 2: --the savings and loan bank (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) of the richest women, white or black in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 2: One of the few women entrepreneurs, white or black too?
Speaker 1: White or black at that time and she was the first female bank president in the United States.  Not just black bank president, but she was the first female black--bank president.
Speaker 2: That's something.  So I take it here her mother probably was a--did work in a house and passed along some skills about etiquette and that sort of thing to her daughter, 'cause her daughter, you know, taught, taught those skills to the, in, in the sorority founded?
Speaker 1: I think Maggie probably acquired most of those skills on her own (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay so--
Speaker 1: I'm not--
Speaker 2: Yeah so, okay.
Speaker 1: --sure it was something that was handed down, but I know she was quite a--she, she was quite obsessed with, with proper etiquette and manners and protocol and that was one of her, her organizational concerns is that everything had to be in perfect order, perfect place and perfect settings at the table.
Speaker 2: Now, did she have a chance to go to one of the black colleges [HBCUs] in the early days when they were founded by the Freedmen's Bureau [Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands] and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: Maggie Walker did not attend college I don't believe.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Okay, so, so she founded the bank in?
Speaker 1: All of her children did though.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay so about what year was it that she founded the bank?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Oh, Jesus, the bank was founded I believe in the early 1900s, 1908, something like that I believe?  I'm not sure of the date exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 415448
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] grandparents are Armstead [sic. Melvin DeWitt Walker] and Ethel Walker [Ethel Robinson Walker]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, what did--were they in the banking business too?
Speaker 2: No, they were not.  Armstead was at one time involved in the bank [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Richmond, Virginia] and I think Maggie [Maggie Lena Walker] tried to get him interested in the operation and management of the bank.  But neither of her children really were involved in the operation and management of the bank.
Speaker 1: Now what did, he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Armstead was a--he was kind of an entrepreneur on his own, he, he attempted at several businesses on his own and of course, Maggie financed many of his entrepreneurial attempts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right and, so they were all, this is all in Richmond?
Speaker 2: This was all in Richmond, Virginia (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you, did your mother [Mamie Walker Crawford] grow up in Richmond?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until she graduated from high school and she attended Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a major in music.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She have a specialty on an instrument or anything?
Speaker 2: She played piano but she played several instruments.  She played the clarinet, she played the violin, and ultimately she obtained her master's [degree] in education and music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She attended New York University [New York, New York] to obtain her advanced degree in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was after Howard University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 415449
Speaker 1: She [Crawford's mother, Mamie Walker Crawford] met my father who was a basketball star and tennis athlete at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He also had attended high school here in the District [Washington, D.C.] and he also attended Howard's dental school.  He was a graduate in the class of '42 [1942], I believe, at Howard University College of Dentistry [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Okay, well let's go to your father then.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: His name is St. Elmo Wallace Crawford [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] as well.
Speaker 2: Okay, the same history behind the name (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Same history behind the name, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: Well he was born in Florida, Jacksonville, Florida and his date of birth was in--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Nineteen twenty [1920].
Speaker 1: March.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  May.
Speaker 1: May 1920.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 1: May 12th to be exact, 1920.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 1: His father was one of the first lawyers that passed the bar in Florida and he was a lawyer in Jacksonville, his name was Percy Cyrus Crawford [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Percy Cyrus Crawford (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, Robert Percy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Robert Percy Crawford [Robert Crawford, Jr.], yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, any, any stories about him that are passed down about being (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Don't have a lot of information about him other than the fact that he was a prominent black lawyer in Jacksonville, Florida and he was one of the first to, you know, pass the bar and, first black man to pass the bar in, in Jacksonville, Florida.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can imagine that wasn't easy to do, if being the first the down in a southern state in those days, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Back, back then, yes it was, yeah.
Speaker 2: I was wondering if any, any stories passed down about him though?
Speaker 1: Not many.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not many, he died I think relatively early.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, now did your father talk about--is, is there any history on your father's side that goes all the way back to slavery?
Speaker 1: Not much that we were able to research, we did not research as much, his mother [Pearl Wallace Crawford] was a very interesting young lady.  She was, of course married to the attorney in Jacksonville, and after he died she moved to Washington, D.C. with both of her sons, and she was a nurse at Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] at the time.  And she had two sons, Robert [Robert Crawford III] and St. Elmo.  Robert was the oldest, of the two, they were about a year apart, I think a year or two years apart and he became a pediatrician and his brother St. Elmo became a dentist.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay now, so did, did she herself attend Howard or at all, or get nurses training?
Speaker 1: She came, she came to Washington and she started as a nurse's aide and she, you know, pursued her nursing career until she became the head nurse at Freedmen's Hospital, and she remained in that position until she retired.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, as head nurse, okay.
Story_ID: 415450
Speaker 1: Did your father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] pass on any stories of growing up in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] or in Richmond [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: He attended Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], and at the time Dunbar High School was known for the success of its graduates, its black graduates then.  And when we looked at the class of Dunbar that he had graduated from, many of the graduates were physicians, lawyers, dentist, architects and it was, it was a very, very encouraging time at that, at, at that school.  So Dunbar was probably the premier black high school in Washington at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And many of the graduates of Dunbar went on to attend Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  At the time he played on the tennis team and the basketball team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he went on and, and played on Howard's basketball team as well.
Speaker 1: Now was he--? Now you're fairly tall, you're what, about 6'4"?
Speaker 2: 6'6".
Speaker 1: 6'6"?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're taller than I thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Was your father tall too?
Speaker 2: 6'4".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --very tall for his time.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: I'm considered short, I guess.
Speaker 1: No, you're still tall.  (Laughter) Okay so he played basketball for Howard's team and played (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Played basketball for Howard, and he played basketball in high school as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so did he win any championships at Dunbar or at Howard?
Speaker 2: Actually at Dunbar they won two championships, the two years that he was captain of the team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he not only played, he was a captain?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know what their success rate was at Howard, I don't have those.
Speaker 1: It's seems like Howard--it's not historically a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they had--they had a championship tennis team during the time he played on the tennis team at Howard as well.  So, I do remember that they were--and later in his years he became an avid golfer and he was one of the first black regulars at Langston Golf Course on Benning Road in Washington.
Story_ID: 415451
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Mamie Walker Crawford and St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] met, that they've told?
Speaker 2: Interesting story, a friend of my father's, Peter Robinson [ph.], Pete Robinson introduced my mother to my father, Pete Robinson was from Richmond [Virginia] as well.  And I think they played on the team together and he introduced my mother to my father and after that the two were almost inseparable.  So my father and my mother always told me that they always attributed their marriage to the introduction that Mr. Robinson had given them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he's remained a family friend to this day.
Story_ID: 415452
Speaker 1: Your father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.], I know, had a long and distinguished career as a dentist here, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He practiced over forty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: He served in the Dental Corps in Korea and then he came back and opened up a practice in Cleveland, Ohio, and then shortly after moved back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and opened up the practice here where he practiced until his death.
Speaker 1: Okay and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: This was--?  Now, when he served in Korea, this was during the Korean War?
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was active duty and the captain in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So did, was he married?  I mean, did, did he have a family at that time when he was in the Korean War?
Speaker 1: I think he got, I think they were married prior to his going to Korea in 1942, I think around 1942.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did he move the whole family to Cleveland when he started practice in Cleveland?
Speaker 1: Yes he did.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: Well there were, there was the whole family then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was just my sister [Nancy Crawford Ware], at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I came a little later, after they had moved back to D.C.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And both of them, my mother [Mamie Walker Crawford] and my father are buried at Arlington Cemetery [Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia].
Story_ID: 415453
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Mamie Walker Crawford and St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I'm a combination of both.  My father was a very, he's very intellectual, he was an avid reader.  He read everything he could get his hands on, and he was the disciplinarian.  Well my mother was a music major of course, and she was an educational professional so she was very much into the two of us and preparing us for school, college testing, the SATs and that was--her, her fame was, was actually preparing.  And even her grandchildren, she was very, very fundamental in preparing them and testing them and seeing that they were in the right programs to, you know, better prepare them for, for college.  And, I think between the two of them, I've got a little bit of both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --got a little about both.
Story_ID: 415454
Speaker 1: All right now, now they were both--from, from some of the research, I have, it seems like they were very involved in civic life here in Washington, D.C. and, and the civic involvement goes way back in the family, of course, to your [maternal] great-grandmother [Maggie Lena Walker] and beyond so--
Speaker 2: My mother [Mamie Walker Crawford] was very active in five of the social clubs.  She was also a Delta, I remember the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and later they formed a club called the Delta Girls which were graduates from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] that were members of the Delta Sorority and she was also a member of the Epicureans [National Epicureans, Inc.].
Speaker 1: And what is the Epicureans?  Were they, were they--?
Speaker 2: Epicureans was a social, civic group here in the District [Washington, D.C.], ultimately it became national and they, they put together members, you know, of, of the black middle class here in the District that pursued, you know, civil rights issues and discussed the raising of kids in the District and, you know, what they needed to improve the school systems and all, so they were involved in that.  She was also a member of The Links [The Links, Incorporated] which is a national organization of black women.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and your father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] as well?  Or did he--?
Speaker 2: My father was very active in several organizations primarily golf though, golf was his passion, he loved to golf and he played almost every day.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did he--did he teach at, at Howard at all?  Or did he just, or did, was he just in private practice?
Speaker 2: He was just in private practice after he left the armed services as a dentist and he went into private practice and he practiced, in solo practice until I graduated [from Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] in 1977.  And I joined his practice at that time and we associated and started the corporation, (unclear) corporation, so he was very involved until his death so he practiced up until the time he passed in 1986.
Story_ID: 415455
Speaker 1: Now do you have a sister, right?  One sister?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: Right and that's?
Speaker 2: Nancy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Nancy Ware [Nancy Crawford Ware].
Speaker 1: All right.  So it's the two of you and you--growing up?  Just--so the household included your mother [Mamie Walker Crawford] and father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] and your sister?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And, and we had a, we had a very difficult childhood because my mother became ill very early on.  We were in our--I was I think around twelve or thirteen when my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  She was thirty-five or in her early thirties at the time and after going to all of the hospitals here in the area she went to Georgetown and Howard, well at the time it was Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  And there was little they could do, my father took her to New York [New York], to Sloan Kettering cancer research hospital [Memorial Hospital and the Sloan Kettering Institute; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York] and she was one of the first radiation, cobalt radiation patients.  So she was an experimental patient because her case was considered terminal, and we were fortunate to receive the services of a Dr. Whittaker [ph.] who performed the cobalt radiation therapy and radical surgery to, you know, arrest the cancer, and she was one of his success stories.  Actually she out lived the surgeon, she out lived my father, she out lived most of her friends, so, she was considered cancer free after, I think about twelve years and lived to be eighty-two, I think.
Speaker 1: That's, that's quite a story.  So, but that kind of hung as a, as a cloud over your childhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was very difficult for her, but she, she was hospitalized for almost a year at, at, at Sloan Kettering, and my father was commuting between Washington [D.C.] and New York, and trying to raise us and practice and it was, it was a very difficult time for him.  So he would practice during the day and at night he would fly up to New York to be with her and he'd fly back in the morning to take us to school and, and, and he would work all day and then he would do again try to fly up to New York, and he did that at least two or three times a week, and that went on for almost a year.  And, we had a lady that would come and stay with us from the time that we got out of school until he returned the next morning and it was, it was a difficult time.  And at the time, you know, many blacks in America didn't know much about insurance, so he had put aside five or six thousand dollars anticipating that that would take care of any broken bones or any problems that we had, never, never expecting that one of us would be stricken with cancer.  And at the time the hospital bill was, oh, I guess, another fortune and he paid on that until I think I, I reached college [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], so it, it was a difficult time.  Doctor Whittaker, her physician and surgeon at Sloan Kettering, offered his medical services with professional courtesy for my father because of the circumstances and we were just responsible for the hospital bill which was still enormous for that time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it was, it was a difficult time but it really brought us together and my sister and I are very, very close because of the time that my mother was away and we, we kind of took care of each other.
Speaker 1: So, now do you have an earliest childhood memory in the family?
Speaker 2: Mostly with my sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's a clinical psychologist now and she was worked for the justice department, federal justice department [U.S. Department of Justice] and the District's department of child protection [Child and Family Services Agency].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --and advocacy.
Story_ID: 420462
Speaker 1: Now I was asking you if you had an earliest childhood memory of family life.  And you said your sister [Nancy Crawford Ware], you're talking about your sister, and--?
Speaker 2: Well, the earliest re-memories I have are probably during the time that mother [Mamie Walker Crawford] was sick, I think that's probably is what sticks most in my mind and the time when she would have to go away to the hospital and, you know, the, the discussions that we had prior to her leaving to go to New York [New York].  We were rather, rather pessimistic because of the reports and the information that, you know, my father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] had received from all of the other hospitals locally and, you know, we were dealing with the possibility that we would have to live without our mother.  And, and that, that was probably the most memorable part of my childhood and I became--I was very religious at the time.  I, I was attending St. Stephens Episcopal Church [St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.] on 16th Street, and my godfather, Paul Scott [ph.], would see to it that we made it to church every Sunday and we prayed deeply and hard that she would recover and, and return to us and I think my prayers were somehow answered.  So, I, I think as a result of that, I have a very strong faith in, in God and I, I believe truly that he was responsible for her recovery and her being able to spend, you know, our life, you know, the better part of our life with us.  So, I think that, that probably changed my life, was her illness and her recovery and ultimate, you know, conquering cancers.  And during that time it was such an amazing thing, because all of these things were experimental and not really tested and tried and the fact that she even out lived most of her friends that were healthy and without these problems was in my mind, just a real miracle.  So, I think that's probably my strongest childhood memory is her illness and recovery and the belief that my faith and my sister's faith and, you know, our prayers were just answered because of that so, I, I think that's probably the strongest childhood memory I have.
Story_ID: 420463
Speaker 1: Can you describe your neighborhood for us?  What it was like and, you know, if, if it has a name, give us the name of the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: We lived in, in Brightwood [Washington, D.C.].  I attended Brightwood Elementary School [Brightwood Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and we lived on Van Buren Street which was walking distance to--
Speaker 1: Now you said Brightwood?  With a B or--?
Speaker 2: Brightwood, B-R-I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, bright, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --G-H-T-W-O-O-D, yeah.  It was--the area was called Brightwood or, and at that time we were able to most often walk to school, so Brightwood was a long walk, but we, we could walk from our house to, to my elementary school.  And then I attended Paul Junior High [Paul Junior High School; Paul Public Charter School, Washington, D.C.] which was not, again not too far from, from our house and that was walking distance as well on a good day.  And then, ultimately I attended Calvin Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] which was at 5th [Street] and Oglethorpe [sic.].
Story_ID: 420464
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Washington [D.C.], you know, we, we, we had Georgia Avenue and there were a number of businesses and bakeries and stores along Georgia Avenue, much different than it is today.  And the dry cleaners, it was a Martinizing dry cleaner which was a kind of new odor and smell, and we would pass those businesses on our way to and from school and I think the traffic of cars and things going up and down Georgia Avenue and 16th Street were probably a big part of our childhood memories.  And we enjoyed so much going to school because we would all meet, all of our friends were on the way to and from school.  So we would all meet up in the morning and walk to school except on the days when the weather was too bad, and those days, my father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] would drive us to school and coming home we would all get together and walk home and as we went home we would drop off some of our friends on the way they would stop at Underwood Street and Tewkesbury Street [sic. Tewkesbury Place] and Van Buren Street and all of our families were very close.  So even in our, our, our off time during the summer and our free time, we would all visit each other's homes and, and spend the night at, at, at our, our classmates' houses and the parents were all very close.  So it was a real close knit family here in Washington during that time, and many of the childhood friends that we had growing up are still, you know, our friends today and many of them--although they've gone away to school, or gone away to college, or professional school--have, many of them have returned here and all are a part of our social circle here in the district even today.

Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I liked science; I was a science fanatic, I guess, and we were very involved at that time in science fairs and science projects.  And we would have a citywide science fair which was always a big, big occasion, and all of us would compete for a national position and citywide position.  And so, we would put together these projects which would extend for months and months in preparation and then we would have the citywide fairs and all.  So, I think science and--
Speaker 1: Can you remember your, your fav- your best project in science?
Speaker 2: My best project was probably working with my sister [Nancy Crawford Ware] and that was the seahorses.  And she was a little more on the artistic side so she liked the thought of seahorses, so she wanted to breed seahorses, and my father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] and all of us ran out and got these special plastic tanks and we were raising these seahorses.  And miraculously, I think, we had I think two litters of, of offspring.  And we could watch them actually transfer the offspring to the male seahorse and the male seahorse would carry the eggs and the, and the embryo until their full maturation and it was just a fascinating project.  And I think it was more her project than mine, but I was somehow involved and in keeping the water salinity and everything, so, that was, I think the biggest one we did and the most complicated, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did you have a--any favorite teachers or mentors at school or in the neighborhood in those days?
Speaker 2: We had a number of excellent teachers in the public school system here.  Mrs. Logan [ph.] was one that I remember specifically from elementary school [Brightwood Elementary School; Brightwood Education Campus, Washington, D.C.].  And she was a very strict disciplinarian but she was also an excellent teacher and kept the whole class, you know, well-motivated and I think prepared us for, you know, our next level in junior high school [Paul Junior High School; Paul Public Charter School, Washington, D.C.].  My mentor, probably most memorable was Colonel Conti [ph.].  He lived across the street and he was a retired colonel, I believe in the [U.S.] Air Force actually.  And, I think I was like Dennis the Menace to him and every day when I got home from school, I'd run across the street to Colonel Conti, and he was always involved in certain projects, fixing a lawn mower, cutting the grass, and, doing various projects around the house.  And every year he would carry me to the commissary, the PX [post exchange] and then the air show that they would have at Andrews Air Force Base [Joint Base Andrews, Maryland].  So, well my father worked most of the day and he came home usually around, I guess, eight or nine, by the time his office closed and he was able to get home.  So, all during the time, from the time I came home from school to the time I did my homework, I would run over and hang out with Colonel Conti.  And so, he, he was very fundamental and he would carry me everywhere with him, he helped me build a go cart and all these types of things that kids at my age, you know, at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's good, yeah.
Speaker 2: --that age, you know, enjoy doing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, let's see.  Now, okay, now, now did you, did you think when you were in, in grade school that you were going to be a dentist too?  Did you?
Speaker 2: I wasn't sure.  I, I'd felt that I would probably go into some form of, of the medical field.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I wasn't sure that I was gonna be a physician, a dentist, an ophthalmologist.  But I, I did have aspirations to, to join the medical profession at some level, and in some field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 420466
Speaker 1: And you mentioned church.  Were you, were you very active in a ch- in a, at St. Stephens [St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Very active.  We had a very unusual pastor, his name was Father Wendt [William Wendt], and he was one of the very active participants in the march in '64 [sic. 1963], when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to town and we were one of the churches that were heavily involved and we carried the cross and at the time I was an acolyte, and I was one of the kids carrying the cross that led the procession down 16th Street to the tent.  I'm trying to remember the name we had given it, we had given the name to the compound of all the tents where all the protesters and had all met down--.  We called it Resurrection City, I believe, Resurrection City is what we called it.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: --that was on the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.], that's right.
Speaker 1: You're talking about, you're talking about in 1968, when the Poor People's Campaign?
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where we had the, the march that's right--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: That's '68 [1968]--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Poor People's Campaign--
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: And march--
Speaker 2: --and Martin Luther King came and spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And later on, I know that Resurrection City became like a muddy quagmire sort of--
Speaker 2: Quagmire of tents--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --and protesters and, yeah.  And we were very involved, our church was involved, we provided food and housing and medical assistance to the, you know, to the residents of Resurrection City.  So that was, that was a big thing then.
Story_ID: 420467
Speaker 1: Do you remember the riots of '68 [1968], when--?
Speaker 2: Very well.  My father's [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] office was located in one of the areas that was very hard hit by the riots, the H Street quarter [in Washington, D.C.].  He had an office on Benning Road, and the stores and businesses along the H Street quarter were set on fire and broken into and our father went to his office and stood at the office trying to protect the office.  And I think most of the people in the neighborhood realized that it was a black owned business and, you know, my father had treated many of the people in the neighborhood and that particular business was spared.  And down below him was a pharmacy and the pharmacy was spared as well.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: That was a Dr. Ferguson [ph.], and above my father was his brother [Robert Crawford III] who was a pediatrician, so the building that my father owned where the three businesses were housed was spared in the, in the riots and we were thankful for that.  But the rest of the neighborhood was ravaged and burned and it was, oh twenty years or so, before the businesses actually started to be rebuilt and come back.  So, it's just now starting to turn around really, I mean, you're starting to see a real resurgence in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now how old were you in '68 [1968], when this--
Speaker 2: Jesus, I was probably around fourteen or fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking, yeah.
Story_ID: 420468
Speaker 1: Now, what were you interested in when you, when you were in junior high [Paul Junior High School; Paul Public Charter School, Washington, D.C.] school and high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?  I mean, I mean around that age (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cars.
Speaker 1: Cars?
Speaker 2: Cars, without, without question cars, motors engines, that was my passion.  I would build cars and build motors and build engines.
Speaker 1: So, so you built some real, built some real motors and--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we were, we--well at the time we were into drag racing and I, you know, I was very involved in building the, the engines for these drag racing vehicles.
Speaker 1: And did you have your own car, you know?
Speaker 2: Ultimately, ultimately I did but mostly I worked on everybody else's and helped everybody else's with theirs.  I kind of pieced mine together from three or four different cars.
Speaker 1: Had you kind of learned some mechanics from the colonel across the street?
Speaker 2: Colonel taught me quite a bit and there was another gentleman that was across the street from me and he was retired as well and he, he--I used to go over to his house.  And I'm struggling with his name, but he would build these lawn mower engines in his basement and I would go over there.  He lived next door to Dianne Tyrance [Dianne Tyrance Neal], and I, I'm struggling with his name, it's been so many years but, he's the one that really got me interested in engines and building, 'cause we would take apart these engines and put 'em together.   And then once I started with the go carts and all, he would help me, you know, with my engines in building them and taking them apart and putting together so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now you're 6'6", was--did people just try to give you a basketball and get you out there and play or?
Speaker 2: Well I did, I did play quite a bit of basketball, and I had a gentleman that was kind of a trainer and he kind of got me involved in all, all sports.  He was a retired policeman and he would pick us up, several of us, pick us up on Saturdays and, and take us.  One Saturday we'd do tennis, one Saturday we'd do baseball and the next Saturday we'd do basketball.  So I was fortunate enough to play a number of sports.  In high school I ran track and swam, I was on the swimming team, those were my two--
Speaker 1: Okay so you--
Speaker 2: --best sports.
Speaker 1: --you didn't play high school basketball?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Now in high school, and it wasn't until my sophomore or junior year in college, I was very short, I didn't start getting tall until I was in my second year of college.
Speaker 1: Real--okay now that sounds like the story of Dennis Rodman.  You know, he tells a story that he was a--graduated from high school about 5'10" or something like that.
Speaker 2: I was very short.
Speaker 1: And he--
Speaker 2: I was very skinny and small so swimming was my fame and I also played on the tennis team in high school as well.  But I didn't get any height until I was a sophomore or junior in college.
Speaker 1: About how tall were, were you when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: Probably around 5'7", 5'6", 5'7", I was shorter than my sister [Nancy Crawford Ware] who was at that time 5'9".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: I mean, were you, your pro- I mean the, the age you, what you were seventeen when you graduated or eighteen or were you younger?
Speaker 2: I graduated a year early from, from my school and I finished a year early from college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was admitted into Howard's College of Dentistry [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] after my junior year at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and it was a special program called the D.D.S, the B.S./D.D.S degree program.  So, upon completion of your dental degree, you would receive both your B.S. and your D.D.S. degree.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were growing up, television was very popular.  Was that a, was that a big part of your life when you were growing up with TV or, or music or any popular culture or stuff like that?
Speaker 2: Television was, was just really starting to, you know, hit the airwaves and, and households and I remember we would s- together as a family watch 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and 'The Nat King Cole Show.'  That was the big thing then because this was a black artist who had his own television show and that was, I think in the late '50s [1950s], early, early '60s [1960s], late '50s [1950s], I believe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think about '59 [1959], he was on for--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was, I was pretty young and I--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I remember 'The Nat King Cole Show' was a weekly, I think it came on every week?
Speaker 1: I think he only lasted a half a season or something but, but a lot of people remember that show.  It was--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --the only show then?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a phenomenon then, and it was quite a production.  And then of course 'Ed Sullivan' came on every Sunday and we would, we would sit around and watch that.  Those are the two that kind of stick in my mind as I was growing up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: And we would do that together as family.
Speaker 1: Now you said your, you said your mother [Mamie Walker Crawford] was into music at one--or your grand- or was it your?
Speaker 2: She was, she was an avid musician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, I have pictures of her playing the saxophone, the clarinet and she insisted that my sister and I play the piano.  So we both played piano all through our childhood, and then I also played the violin as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All under her instruction and, and tutelage, so that was her thing, she was, she was quite a musician.
Story_ID: 420469
Speaker 1: Okay high school, Calvin Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].  That, is that in the s- in the neighborhood or--?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: That--? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's located at 3rd [sic. 5th Street] and Tuckerman [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so, whelp, what was Calvin Coolidge like?
Speaker 2: It was interesting, it was a public school and we had a, a mixture of, of social and economic students there and it was a little tough at first.  I was very, very small and, of course, in high schools then it was a little, it was a little rough to get along.
Speaker 1: This is an all-black school right, for the most part?
Speaker 2: It was not at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was not at the time.  We still had a number of white students then.  And even more so when my sister [Nancy Crawford Ware] attended, she was three years ahead of me at Coolidge and she attended Coolidge as well.  By the time I reached Coolidge it was beginning to become a predominately black high school, and we had our fights with other schools over football games and, you know, the riots and the gangs and the things like that were just beginning to get a foothold, you know, in the public school system then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well did you have any special teachers at Coolidge that, that you admired or took a special (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Quite a few.
Speaker 1: --interest in?
Speaker 2: Quite a few.  We had a principal, his name was William Roundtree, who really set the tone for the school, and he was very much involved with almost all the students.  And he was a counselor, a mentor and disciplinarian and he pretty much set the tone for most of the teachers.  And I can remember many occasions when he would take the teachers to task that, you know, he didn't feel were performing or producing or maintaining their class and, and most of the teachers then, I think were very dedicated because at the time the District [Washington, D.C.] didn't have the highest salary scale in the area so the teachers that taught in public schools in the District were relatively committed individuals.  And we had, I think at that time probably at least a 60 or 70 percent college rate and almost 80 or 90 percent graduate rate of it's--of the students that attended.
Speaker 1: Now that's good, that's a--
Speaker 2: So that, and, and in that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that time I think that was, that was a commendable accomplishment.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and during that period it was.  Okay so, you started school in '65 [1965]?  High school was it?--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Coolidge in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And each of our, our levels were four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, well actually high school was three years and junior high school [Paul Junior High School; Paul Public Charter School, Washington, D.C.] was three years.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were there about '67 [1967]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967]--
Speaker 1: I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: --through '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: That's '67 [1967], so--
Speaker 2: And then junior high school, from '65 [1965] through '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now were you active in high school activities when you were there?
Speaker 2: I ran track, and I, I played on the tennis team at Coolidge. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you a member of different clubs and?
Speaker 2: No I wasn't very social, I again, I was very small and kind of geeky I guess, so, and I was a mechanic, that was my, that was my claim to fame.  So, every summer I worked as an auto mechanic in one of the car dealerships here in the area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now that's a--so okay, so you were, you had an aptitude for putting things together and, and--
Speaker 2: I think so, I think so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I certainly enjoyed, joyed, enjoyed working with automobiles and I was the youngest auto mechanic at Handley Ford [Handley Ford, Inc.] each summer.  So I would work there all summer long and that was quite an accomplishment for me.  I felt privileged to be able to, to work as a line mechanic for, you know for a car dealership, you know at that age. I was fifteen, sixteen, somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Now we live in an age now where a lot of kids can't fix a car, you know, a lot of people can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know--
Speaker 1: --fix a car in the cities anymore.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I still--
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: --work on cars.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still work on cars and boats and things and motorcycles, so I still, I still enjoy the engines.
Speaker 1: Yeah it seems like those skills passed along older people, I could pass it on to young and then--
Speaker 2: Well the newer vehicles are much more complicated too with the computer driven, you know, technologies and things, it's a little more complicated than it was when I was growing up, but I still find it fascinating.
Story_ID: 420470
Speaker 1: How were your grades in school?
Speaker 2: I think I was a better than average student through high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and then once I reached college, I seemed to do a lot better.  And I took an accelerated number of classes at Hampton.  I attended Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, well--
Speaker 2: --then.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you how?  Why did you choose Hampton from all the schools?
Speaker 2: I was privileged to go down there one summer and visit my cousin who lived in Hampton, Virginia, his name was Michael Boone [ph.] and I spent the summer with him there and during that summer we would go on to the Hampton Institute campus and meet the students and, and hang out with the students and I just felt that this was the best place in the world.  And, at the time it was, it was just a wonderful environment, you know, for, for black students and I just decided that that was definitely where I wanted to go and I made every attempt to make sure that I got accepted in Hampton.  So my freshman year, I started in Hampton Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in the '70 [1970], right, in 1970?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what was your major at Hampton?
Speaker 2: I was a biology major and chemistry minor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you join a Greek organization at, at Hampton?
Speaker 2: My sophomore year I joined the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity and pledged and became very active with the fraternity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they have a black student organization there on campus?
Speaker 2: At the time the whole college was black so we had a number of organizations, I wouldn't call them black organizations, because most of the students they were, were, were black.  But we had a number of organizations and activities at the school.  It was, it was just a wonderful environment, you know, to learn and, and develop and grow and mature in.  And most of the students there were away from home for their first time, so living on the campus, you know, we had curfews and we had of course cafeterias and dorm mothers and dorm captains and, it was, it was a, it was an excellent, excellent environment.
Story_ID: 420471
Speaker 1: Well who were your favorite teachers once again, you know, at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I had a real mentor at, at Hampton, his name was Dr. Abram [James B. Abram, Jr.], he was a professor of parasitology and he was one of the biology teachers that I, I took classes from.  So, I took a number of classes under him and he was also a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and he's one of the people that encouraged me to consider pledging, you know, a Kappa and once I pledged Kappa he assisted me in becoming very active as an officer in the, in the fraternity and ultimately I became a national officer in the fraternity as a result of his, you know, encouragement and, and, and support.
Speaker 1: Okay, as a parasitology, was he interested in--I know you talked about the diseases in Africa a lot or in the Caribbean?  I know there's a lot of parasitic diseases in those places (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, he provided a very broad, broad biology background and he taught more than just parasitology.  He taught, he taught botany, he taught gross anatomy, and he covered a number of classes so you had to go through him three or four times if you were a biology major.  Parasitology was his most difficult course and that was his specialty and that was the course that really got me interested because it was very closely associated with diseases and disease entities, nematodes and, and diseases of the body.  And we would have to, of course, seek them out in animals and, and identify them and, and classify them and.  So yeah, he was, he was very fundamental in, in developing an interest in medicine for many of the students there.
Story_ID: 420472
Speaker 1: So Hampton University and--now, now were you involved in anything special at, at Hampton, any special projects (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well at the time it was Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay. So that changed--?
Speaker 2: It became Hampton University after I left, yes.  But, at Hampton I was very active, again in the fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] there and I did a lot of swimming while I was there as well.  And it was just a great environment.  I was a member of the biology club.  We had a number of scientific organizations which I was active in as well.  During that, we had organic chemistry club and I pretty much participated in all of those that were related to my major.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have a real active social life at Hampton, at, you know?
Speaker 2: Not that active at--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Hampton.  (Laughter) Not that active.  I had a very, very intense academic schedule, I was taking about, between eighteen and twenty-one hours each year.  I, I see the reaction over there (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I enjoyed Hampton, Hampton was just a great environment, but I took a very intense course my first three years with the intent of enjoying my senior year there and I completed all my requirements pretty much in my junior year and my senior year I had signed up for basket weaving and swimming and sculpture.  And somehow my father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] got a hold of my intended schedule and let me know in no uncertain terms that he wasn't gonna pay for a senior year of frolicking and having a good time.  So I had to go seek, either continued education or employment at that time so I was accepted into the early admission program at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For, for dentistry.  I was also accepted at University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and University of Rochester [Rochester, New York].
Story_ID: 420473
Speaker 1: Did you decide to go to Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] because of your fa- your fa- your father's [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] background there?
Speaker 2: At the time I really kind of wanted to come back to the District [Washington, D.C.], I, I kind of wanted to reacquaint myself with my roots here and my friends and all and I wasn't ready to venture off to another city and, you know, a strange environment again.  I really wanted to stay at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] another year, but since that was vetoed then my next preference was to come back to the District.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what was dental school like?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a maturing process for me because I was the youngest person in my class.  I was twenty years old and many of my classmates had second careers.  They were pharmacists prior to coming to dental school, one was a Nassau [ph.] engineer, a few--one was a microbiologist, and many of them had worked and then saved their money and decided to come back and, you know, go to professional school.  So the average age in my particular freshman class was probably between twenty-nine and thirty-two.  Most of the, you know, members of my class were that, and then we had a number of them like twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, that had been out and at least worked a year.  So at, at twenty years old I was considered the baby in the class and many of them took me under my wing, under their wing and we sat down and studied, you know, countless hours at night, so it was a maturing process.  And it--associated with people three, four, five, six years older.  Matter of fact, the oldest person in our class was forty-two in my freshman class.  So, it, it was very demanding and, and luckily I was around very, very mature individuals who were committed and many of them had families and their wives were working and, you know.  They had given up jobs, you know, relatively good paying jobs to come to dental school so they were very, very serious about, you know, the, the academics and their pursuit, so there wasn't a lot of time for foolishness.  And, and then being around those particular individuals who had made such a sacrifice to come back to professional school helped me quite a bit, and, you know, my ma- maturation process and, and all.  So, it was, it was again a, a really enlightening experience.  I met some wonderful people, again, many of them who are my lifetime friends now, you know, going through four years of dental school is like going through pledging in the fraternity.  So the people that you go through these experiences with are, you know, become a part of your, your being so to say.
Speaker 1: About how many were in your class when you went through?
Speaker 2: We started out with a 110 in my freshman class and 60 graduated.  So we, we lost, you know, clearly a third of the class just about.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Through academic, you know, failures and financial, you know, problems and family problems and all that.  So, so it's--it's a, it's a difficult four years, you know, when you're struggling to try to work and go to school and support families and all that and like I said, most of my class were, were much older than I was.  I was blessed to be in an environment where, you know, I did have support and I had a family structure and I really wasn't out there, you know, fending for myself so to say. So I was, I was extremely blessed in that, that respect.
Story_ID: 420474
Speaker 1: I kind of skipped something here.  I wanted to ask you about--you, you mentioned earlier, I think it's something worth mentioning that, that you grew from 5'7" to 6', 6' in a, in a--
Speaker 2: Couple of years.
Speaker 1: Couple of years?
Speaker 2: Couple of years.
Speaker 1: Now what was that like?  You're in college [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and, and I think a lot of people dream, "Well, I wish I was taller," and then all of a sudden you, you actually are much taller than--
Speaker 2: A lot of my friends from high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] didn't even recognize me when I would return home from, from school and I guess I just was delayed in reaching my growth spurt or something, I don't know.  But, between my freshman year in college and my junior year in college is when I gained all of my, my height and it wasn't until, like I said my junior year that I started really crossing the 6' line.  So it was a wonderful thing, I enjoyed getting taller and didn't get much bigger then unfortunately but I did, I did gain a lot of height, you know, a lot of length, not much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's--
Speaker 2: --much breadth.
Speaker 1: --that's kind of a really unusual situation.  I, I guess your classmates probably were kind of shocked too that you--
Speaker 2: Very, very.
Speaker 1: --were still growing at that age.
Speaker 2: And especially people that I hadn't seen for a year or two, you know, many of my high school friends, you know, who I hadn't run into when I would come back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and run into them, you know, it was like, awed at how much I had grown.  So I, I just, I guess it was just an unusual, you know, timing of my growth perspective I guess.

Speaker 1: When you look back at dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], if you were gonna give young black folks now, some advice.  What would you suggest their course of study be?  Would it be similar to what you did, you know, study biology and--?
Speaker 2: Well, the ones that seemed to do the best in, in dental school, in my opinion are those that have, have gotten scientific degrees.  Math and, and science certainly help.  Biology is helpful, but I think those that have the, the scientific degrees--math, engineering--they do extremely well in, in dentistry.  Den- dentistry is a combination of engineering and biology.  It's not just medicine, and it's not just science, there is quite a bit of engineering involved and space relations, perceptions and it's even quite a bit of art involved in it.  So, it seems to me that those that had math and engineering, you know, backgrounds seem to fare, or find the, the work a little easier than those who had just the biology or just the chemistry or just the science backgrounds.
Story_ID: 420476
Speaker 1: Do you know very much about the history of Howard dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.]?  And I guess it--'cause at one time there were, there were, there were very few dental schools in the United States at all, right?  Up until maybe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only two.
Speaker 1: --the turn of the century.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were just two.  It was Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and Howard at--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the time that would admit black students.  And there was one student, his name was Robert Freeman [Robert Tanner Freeman], he was admitted into Harvard's Dental School [Harvard Dental School; Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts] and he was one of the first black graduates of Harvard's Dental School and he also was one of the first licensed dentist in the District [Washington, D.C.], black licensed dentist in the District after which we named our local component of the National Dental Association here after him.  It's called the Robert T. Freeman Dental Society.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think isn't there a national association of black dentists that's called the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's the National Dental Association.
Speaker 1: National Dental Association.
Speaker 2: And that's made up of local components and, you know, most of the major cities in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay so the Robert Freeman--
Speaker 2: Robert T. Freeman Dental Society--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is the Washington [D.C.] or the District of Columbia's chapter of the National Dental Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and that still exists today?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  As a matter of fact, they're having their convention now.  I missed the convention in Detroit [Michigan] this year but they, they have a annual convention every year of all the local chapters that meet.
Story_ID: 420477
Speaker 1: Now, your course of study at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] was ho- how many years?
Speaker 2: Four years in dental school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, were there any--once again any teachers that come to mind that are--?
Speaker 2: All of my teachers come to mind, vividly come to mind actually.  I had one teacher, his name was Walter Manning; he was a pediatric dentist.  He was a very interesting individual and he encouraged me to pursue pediatric dentistry as a profession, and he hired me after graduation.  I was again the youngest faculty member at Howard at the time and I was twenty-four and I was hired as an instructor in pediatric dental department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I taught there for almost ten years, and during that time I was given a fellowship to go back to school and get a specialty degree in pediatric dentistry and I attended Georgetown [Georgetown University School of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] and Children's Hospital National Medical Center [Children's National Medical Center, Washington, D.C.] and obtained my pediatric dental certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from that program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I taught for two or three years and then between 1980 and 1982, I went back to school under the fellowship, Louise Ball Fellowship program [Louise C. Ball Fellowship] and obtained my pediatric specialty certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you go into private practice then or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Did you come back and--
Speaker 2: I didn't. I taught.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I returned to teaching as a part of our fellowship contract that I return to Howard as a full time assistant professor and taught in the pediatric dental department and orthodontic department.
Story_ID: 420478
Speaker 1: Now you met your wife [Giselle Crawford] in dental school I take it?  Or st- did you?
Speaker 2: No I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, she came and worked my office while she was in dental school and she continued to work for my office after she graduated, and ultimately we were married.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she was a student at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a student--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a graduate from Howard as well--
Speaker 1: But later, later on.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, this is about what year?
Speaker 2: That she attended Howard?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: She attended Howard in 1980--
Speaker 1: Well that you all met, I mean, that's what I mean, what year did you meet?
Speaker 2: We met in 1989.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughter) Fortunately.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a good thing.
Story_ID: 420479
Speaker 1: You taught at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] how long?
Speaker 2: I taught at Howard from 1977, until my father's [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] death in 1986, full time I taught actually, and I practiced part time.  And then in 1986, after my father's death, I, I changed to part time status and the--taught part time which I still do today, and I practiced full time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now as a dentist, black dentist trained in a black community, what are, or what would you say are, do--or does the black community have special dental needs that make them unique, or--?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I think.  I think the black dentist in the community has an obligation to encourage, you know, the patients that he has, that are young and inspiring to pursue a medical career, dental career.  And I think many of them look to their medical professional for, for guidance and, and mentoring and in that respect, I think we've been very fortunate because we've had over forty associates in the dental practices that I have and that's been over the past thirty-one years, we've had over forty associates and all of them have gone on to open their own practices and--.  I think we've been very fundamental in preparing them for, you know, private practice environment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And for the past, oh four or five years we've had even all of the senior students rotate through our offices, you know, for the experiences in working in a, in a, you know, full time dental office.  And that was a part of their, you know, senior experience.  And we've enjoyed, you know, enjoyed the participation of the Howard University senior dental students--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) in each of the offices.
Story_ID: 420480
Speaker 1: On the community side of it, what would--how would you assess the state of dental health in the black community?  And what recommendations would you have (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There are many programs which need some, some help.  The, the Medicaid program, of course, provides medical services for children under twenty-one, who do not have medical insurance or who do not have the ability to pay for dental services.  And that program has gone through a number of changes over the past ten or fifteen years from straight Medicaid which is paid for by the city and, and federal government to third party programs which are administered by, you know, HMOs [health maintenance organizations] and PPOs [preferred provider organizations].  Many of the foreign children that are in the area, Hispanic and other, because they do not have language skills, or the ability to sign up for these programs, many of them are lacking dental care because they don't have the insurance to cover it, they don't have the finances to pay for it and they also are not able to really enroll in these programs or take advantage of the federal and, and, and, and city programs that provide services because of the language barriers.  So I think from a community point, you have to really provide, you know, services to, especially children that are in need, and you have to assist parents in getting these children signed up for programs that will support their, their, their dental and medical needs.  And I think you have to provide some mentoring and guidance to kids in terms of, you know, encouraging them to go on and pursue professional careers whether it's medicine, dentistry, dental hygiene, dental technology, I think all of these are, are excellent opportunities for, for young students coming out of high school to set their, their, their sights on these professions.  Because they're, you have to start early to, to get into these professions and I think the earlier they're exposed to them, and their first exposure obviously is through their, their medical professionals that they, that they encounter.  I think it provides an excellent opportunity for mentoring and encouragement and guidance for these young youngsters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now are there any particular dental syndromes that are unique to the black community, or that--?
Speaker 2: I don't think there're in, there're, there're too many that are unique.  I think there are many that are endemic in, you know, those who are too poor to afford dental services, and I think those that are not educated and to the importance of dental hygiene and dental care.  And education is just one of the, the big landmarks that separates, you know, good dental health from great dental health to poor dental health is they just don't know, you know, the importance of, of, of their teeth and dental maintenance.  So, I think education is probably the biggest obstacle that we must overcome in the, in the community.
Story_ID: 420481
Speaker 1: Flipping the page, I guess to the fashion end of it--half.  (Laughter) Have you been involved in these--you see people now with a lot of gold in their mouth, it used to be a fashion in the, in the early part of the century to have gold teeth and so now it seems to have come back in the form of, you know--?
Speaker 2: It's, I think it's representative of a, a certain image that you know the rap artists and all have, have proliferated and, and this area was not very popular in, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], in Baltimore [Maryland] there was, it was almost a local fad to have, you know, gold teeth and all that, we haven't seen much of that in, in, in this area.  And I think that, that that will phase out very rapidly.  We are seeing, you know, the, the tongue rings and the tongue, you know, the tongue ornaments and, and the piercings and things like that, that has become very, very popular and, you know, there are some disturb- disturbing statistics associated with disease and, and, and illnesses associated with these.  And again education I think is the key to, you know, overcoming the obstacles associated with these fads and things.
Speaker 1: Ha- have there been amateur people involved in trying to install gold on, you know, or, or gold dentures or that sort of thing?  I mean, I just--it occurred to me that that might be something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm, I--
Speaker 1: --that's going on now.
Speaker 2: --am aware that there are some dental labs that try to provide dental services and, you know, the local boards and, and, and administrative agencies are, are the ones that police, you know, the licensing and, and the certification of people qualified to provide various levels of dental services.  And I think they, they function very well in this area, I've served as the chairman of the board in the District [Washington, D.C.] for over twelve years and I feel comfortable that, you know, the boards do give, you know, adequate oversight over the people that do provide these services.
Story_ID: 420482
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any future plans to expand your practice [St. Elmo Crawford, D.D.S. and Associates, Washington, D.C.] or to--?
Speaker 2: Well I have a nephew that just graduated this year and he joined the practice.  We have three offices and it's pretty intense management, you know, challenge to, to, to maintain three offices and a number of, you know, full time dentists and several part time dentists.  So, at my age now, at this point in my career, I don't have any immediate plans to expand.  I would assist, you know, my nephew and, you know, the other younger dentists in the practice if they're interested in opening other offices and, you know, different venues and things like that.  Personally I'm, I'm not planning on any further growth or expansion.
Story_ID: 420483
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well my concerns are, are the encouragement for the younger ones to continue to pursue advanced education.  There seems to not be enough emphasis on, on the pursuit of college degrees and advanced college degrees, M.B.A., Ph.D., M.D., D.D.S. degrees.  We have a culture of immediate gratification which we see in, you know, the rap music and, and the videos and all and my concern is that the younger generation does not lose sight of the importance of advanced education.  It is to me critical that we continue to encourage these, these kids to go to college and the statistics are, are frightening when we look at the number of black males that attend college compared to the number of black females that attend college, and the number of dropouts we have after high school and even the number that don't even complete high school.  So my concerns are that we, we continue to encourage, you know, advanced education and the importance of education, college education and advanced degrees to all of our youngs because, you know, it, it's such a temptation to jump out and, and pursue the, the gratification of immediate employment and job opportunities that come, you know, straight out of school and straight out of high school, straight out of these athletic careers and they sacrifice their opportunities for advanced education and most of them never return, they just never go back.
Story_ID: 420484
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at, over everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: Probably a lot of things I might do differently but I, I don't have any gr- regrets.  I've been very blessed in my profession.  I never dreamed I would have had the, the, the successes and the, and the satisfaction from the profession that I've had. I've enjoyed teaching immensely, I've enjoyed private practice immensely, and I, I truly appreciate the patients that I have.  The profession to me has been just such a wonderful gift and, and I, the more I practice and the longer I practice, the more I can appreciate, you know, just how much of a gift, you know, the education of, of a dental career is.  And I just wish that I could encourage more people to pursue, you know, dentistry as a career because it's just been a, it's been a tremendously rewarding profession for me.  The satisfaction that you give your patients, the appreciation that people have of the services that you provide, the interaction with the students that you teach and seeing them come out and take over and, and become professionals and model citizens and all, it's, it's immensely rewarding for me.
Story_ID: 420485
Speaker 1: It just occurred to me that as a pediatric dentist, do you have special techniques for--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --quelling some of the fear that, that children have of the dentist?
Speaker 2: As you get older, it becomes a little more challenging.  I think children relate more to younger dentists then they do the older dentists.  But, there are a number of techniques and, you know, children are probably--given the right exposure and the right experience--better patients than the adults because they don't have the, the phobias and the fears and the bad experiences that some of their parents have.  So we have a number of children who are two, three, four years old that come in and get their dental work done and dental services done and are just model patients.  And I think the experiences that they have initially coming into the office, it would make them, you know, more comfortable with the dental professionals.
Story_ID: 420486
Speaker 1: Once again when you look back over your career to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: The number of dentists that I, that I have personally been responsible for, preparing for private practice and, and that have matriculated through our practice [St. Elmo Crawford, D.D.S. and Associates, Washington, D.C.].  So I think my legacy is, is the number of, of associates that we've had that have gone on into, to open their own practices and have been, you know, wonderfully successful in their careers.
Story_ID: 420487
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  We talked a little bit about your wife [Giselle Crawford] and do you do you have children too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I do and probably they're the greatest gifts that I've had and when you talk about what you have invested the most of your wealth in, and, you know, easily I can say my, my children [St. Elmo Crawford III and Christian Crawford] have been that and for that you just don't have any regrets because you can see the benefits of what you've provided them.  My goal was to try to do more for my children than my father [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] was able to do for me, and he provided me with at least a college education that did not have any associated educational debt with it.  So coming out college without any educational debt to me is a major accomplishment and I would just like my children to, to know that, you know, they could come out of their educational pursuits without any, any educational debt and it allows them to get started in their careers much, much, much easier than coming out in a hundred, two hundred thousand dollars in debt--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --which is what many of the, you know, dental professionals now are facing.
Speaker 1: It's hard to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Overcome--
Speaker 1: --get past that.
Speaker 2: Oh, so hard, tremendously difficult to, to overcome that, you know, starting out with that kind of, you know, debt service.
Story_ID: 420488
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about or, that we need to pursue before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think we've covered, we've covered just about everything that I can think of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As an individual who truly, truly loved his profession and loved every aspect of, of, of the dental profession and the dental experience that I've had.  And I've given my whole life to this point, and that's been thirty-one years to, to a dental career.  And it's just been tremendously rewarding for me and I've just appreciated every day, every year of my career and I just thank God that I, I, I've followed my father's [St. Elmo W. Crawford, Sr.] footsteps into this.  I never dreamed I would have enjoyed a profession as much as I do.
