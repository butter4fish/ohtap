 Finchum  Sharp  Today is October 5, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and I   m here today in Sulphur,  Oklahoma, to speak with Ron Sharp about his experiences with  Cooperative Extension. So thank you for coming today. We   ll get started  by having you tell us a little bit about yourself, like where you were  born, when, parents, and then we   ll just work our way forward.  Well, I was born in Garfield County, but we didn   t stay there long. In  fact, they moved when I was nine days old, moved to Pawnee County.  So I grew up in Pawnee   actually, lived in Ralston for a while, which is  a little town north of Pawnee, and then we moved to Pawnee. Dad was  an elementary principal there, Mom taught high school English. I grew  up on the edge of town on a farm. I had two younger brothers and a  younger sister. We were all very, very active in 4-H club work, and we  had some very, very good Extension agents that helped us along the  way. Basically, we didn   t have any money. Dad and Mom were both  school teachers. I don   t know. His salary would probably be sixty to  seventy dollars a month back then, when we were kids. We always had  plenty to eat, had our own milk cows, chickens, hogs, and that type of  thing, so we survived.  We were real active in Extension with George Hull, who became, later  on, the director of Extension in Arizona, Harold Murnan, who retired as  County Extension director in Osage County, and Buster Ford. Buster  was there for a short while, and he retired in Wilburton. So those were  really our 4-H agents. A.R. Garlington was the county director there. We  lived real close, of course, to Stillwater, twenty-seven miles, so there  were always Extension events going on, particularly the dairy judging,  livestock judging, swine field days, that type of thing. We were all very  interested and very active in that, especially my two brothers and I. We  had a good life, and we had a good Extension life.  5  I graduated from high school in 1953. Not knowing really what I wanted  to do, I went to Stillwater and, of course, to us, that was the only school  that there was. The one in Norman didn   t exist   still doesn   t exist. Our  blood is orange. I started out in pre-vet. I ran up against a lady that  taught organic chemistry and she knew more than I did, and I bailed out  and got a degree in animal science. I graduated in 1957, so I went to  work for United States Department of Agriculture in Ag Estimates in  Oklahoma City. That was an interesting job, but the only thing about it I  didn   t like was the fact that every office in every state was in the capital  city of that particular state.  Me being a country boy, I didn   t want to live in a city. I tried it for two  years in Oklahoma City and I didn   t like it at all, so I made an  application in Extension with Mr. Bill Cook. That was our district  director. There were two people in the Extension office, in the state  office at that time. Liz Blocker, who was the secretary to the director of  Extension, and her husband, Ward, who was the man that took care of  all the money. They were both from Idabel. My wife, at that time, was  from Idabel. They were real close, so we had some connection with  Extension.  My first job with Extension was, I was trying to think about that a while  ago   August 1, 1959. I was assigned to Coal County. My title at that  time was county 4-H agent at large. The Extension Service had a  program back then that all new employees were hired and went through  a training period with an older Extension agent. Coal County was one of  those counties that was designated as one of those teaching counties, so  Mr. Curtis Floyd, who   d been in Extension for like twenty, thirty-something  years   thirty-eight years, to be exact   was county director,  and Lucina DeGrote was the home economist. They had young men and  young women, both, going into that county. It was a training session I  would not  forget . I always felt real good about it because it was an  experience that you cherish for the rest of your life. We would go to the  corner drugstore, C.R. McGinnis, and drink coffee and all the farmers  came in there. Then we would go out and pull bolls, cotton bolls to  check for cotton weevils. You never knew who you were going to go to.  This was when the insecticide, Sevin, had just come out. Oh, it knocked  the boll weevils out of the cotton so easy. It was a real experience.  Also, back in those days and in the    60s, you met 4-H clubs. You met  every club, every month, all year long until they were out of school. In  Coal County, back in those days in, I want to say, October, November,  or December, they turned school out for a month so the kids could go  pick cotton, and then once the cotton was picked, then they   d go back to  school. So you had a month vacation, basically, of not meeting 4-H  clubs. It was real interesting. You would go to the school, the 4-H clubs  6  were in the school system. You didn   t meet after school, you met during  school. The administrators were all very receptive to the 4-H program. I  think they   re probably getting away from that now, but you had a  personal touch with all your 4-H   ers and it was an enjoyable thing.  Then I moved on from Coal County to Muskogee County. I went from a  poor county that had no money to Muskogee County that had tons of  money back in 1961. I was in Coalgate fourteen months, and then I went  to Muskogee and was there for ten years. Muskogee was a metropolitan  setting that had lots of little schools and lots of 4-H clubs. In fact, we  had forty-eight 4-H clubs in Muskogee County, and we met each one  every month. So you had a lesson to prepare and present to each one of  these kids. They had programs back then that they don   t have any more.  They had a personality improvement program, I know. Sponsored by  Bell Telephone, they gave away four fifty dollar savings bonds, and this  was on a district level. In Muskogee County, we tried to win them all  and we would win three, but never could win four.  There was a Sears and Roebuck Swine Project they sponsored. They  would buy eight gilt pigs and one boar pig. So you would place these  animals out to the kids in different clubs, and there were lots of things  that we went on that happened then that don   t happen anymore. Years  ago, each county had a vehicle. The Chevrolet garage would furnish a  car or furnish a pickup, and they were called the county 4-H pick-up or  whatever. They did away with that because the state law said you  weren   t supposed to do that.  Then I went from Muskogee County to Antlers. It seemed like I went  from poor to rich, back to poor. I was there for fifteen years as county  director, and it was a big, big county  My, it was. It took a lot of time  just to go wherever you were going. Back in those days, you would  make home visits, they would call you. The first home visit I ever did, a  little lady called and said her milk cow was sick. Well, we didn   t have a  veterinarian in that county, so me being who I was, I went out to see the  cow. I finally asked her,    What did you feed this cow?    She said,    Oh, I  fed her some commodity cornmeal.    I said,    Oh, my goodness  Okay.  She   s got a bellyache, is basically what she   s got.    So we gave her some  mineral oil, and the next day or so the cow got okay, but these are some  of the things that you do when you   re a long way off and no veterinarian  close.  I had a real good experience in Push  Pushmataha  County. They either  liked you or they didn   t, and most people in that part of the world   and  nothing against them, bless their hearts   there   s just no money there.  But they were just good as gold. They were good to Extension, good to  us. Our funding was cut off one year and they came through and funded  7  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  by personal donations to keep the office open. I will always be thankful  for those people that did that. And then from there, I went to Ardmore as  county director again, and another metropolitan area that had lots of  money. It didn   t take long for that to dry up, but we were still meeting 4-  H clubs. I did have a 4-H club agent in Carter County, and it made it a  lot easier. We dealt with a lot of livestock problems and horticulture,  being in southern Oklahoma.  We had to compete (I say compete, we really didn   t compete). We  worked with the Noble Foundation real close. George Hedger was the  director of the Noble Foundation for a long while, and George grew up  in Idabel. He and I were real, real close friends, and we did lots of things  together. We had a county pecan show, and then we had an area pecan  show that was put on by our office and the Noble Foundation. We had  lots of livestock projects and field days together, and it made it a lot  easier for us to work with them than to work against them. Their  specialists were trained by our specialists in Stillwater, so it was good to  work with them. Then I retired in 1990. I went to Russia for a spell, tried  to teach them how to grow tomatoes in greenhouses, north of the Arctic  Circle 700 miles. After I got there I found out that   we had forgotten  that they have three months of total darkness, so they had to have  artificial light. But my experience in Extension has been very, very  good.  The reason you moved from county to county was promotion?  Yes, and this is the way that Extension works. Back then, you made a  step up each time you went. In fact, years ago we called them district  directors. They   re district supervisors now, but the district directors lived  in Stillwater, themselves, and you might have one for two or three years,  and then they would shift them around, too. So they got to know the  Extension people better and the areas of the state better. Yes, you start  off, as I say, I started off as at-large, and then I went to Muskogee as a 4-  H agent, then I went to Antlers and Ardmore as county director.  So how many, twenty-something years before you retired?  Oh, thirty     Let me do my math, thirty-two.  Thirty-two, plus annual leave and sick leave added up to about thirty-five  years.  Do you remember a question or two that was kind of crazy?  8  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Yes, and I can   t recall what it might have been. I was taught by Mr.  Floyd, I call him the old man of Extension, but he always said,    Ron,  always be truthful. If you don   t know, tell them you don   t know. Find  out the answer and give them the answer.    And that kind of stuck with  me. If you didn   t know, why, tell them you didn   t know. I mean, there   s  nothing wrong in not knowing. In that particular county, it was largely     it was poor. And today, it   s one of the richest little counties in the  country with all the oil that   s going on over there now. But I saw silos  made out of bales of hay and they wrapped the hay with wire and it  worked. I was surprised. I had never seen anything like that. They made  salami and had it in the cellars, and they made Choc beer and had it in  their cellars, and if you were their friend, they would invite you to the  cellar. And if you weren   t, you weren   t invited. (Laughs) But lots of  good Italian people there in Coal County. In fact, it was the coal mines  that brought all those people there years and years ago, and the coal  mines went out and they stayed.  Well, would the questions be much different from county to county?  No, not really. We worked with agriculture people, and it would be,     What insecticide do I use? What variety of fruit trees do I need to  buy?    One thing Mr. Floyd always said,    Most of these people will want  to know what to spray on a fruit tree. The first question you need to ask  them is,    How much fruit do you eat?       People will spend more for  insecticide on a peach tree than they spend on peaches to eat all year. It  makes you think twice,    I don   t eat that much fruit.    Most of the time,  when you spray a fruit tree with insecticide, you   ve still got a problem  with the peach before you ever get it harvested. So that   s kind of what  his philosophy was.  Where was your office located in each one of those counties?  Well, most offices   and they   ve changed to what they used to be   but  most offices were in either the post office or the courthouse. We were in  the basement of the post office, in Coal County. We were in the  courthouse at Muskogee, and then we went to the federal building, and  then we moved to the fairgrounds. Antlers, we had an office complex  that we had just built south of the courthouse that was on the courthouse  square, but not in the courthouse. In Ardmore, we were in the same  thing, in an annex. The sheriff was in the north end and we were on the  south end. In Push County, the OSBI was on one side and we were on  the other side. So it seemed like we always ended up with the law  enforcement folks.  Interesting. Well, describe a typical day at the beginning of your career,  and then toward the end. How they differed.  9  Sharp  Typical day starting out in Extension. Of course, if I started, say, in Coal  County, first thing was you were always at the office at ten    til eight. We  went to the drugstore and drank coffee until about eight fifteen, then we  went out and pulled bolls or we made farm visits until, probably, 10:10,  10:30, came in the office, did your mail, and then went to 4-H club  meetings that afternoon, and if there was a night meeting. Generally,  there wasn   t in Coal County. You get to Muskogee and you had a night  meeting practically every night. Some days you would meet as many as  four 4-H clubs. You go to Haskell and you   d meet three 4-H clubs over  there. One of them would be after school was out, but with forty-eight 4-  H clubs, you had to do that just to make everything go.  The important thing, I think, in 4-H club years ago was record books. I  know we had a little school called Sally Brown. It was a one-teacher  school, a two-room, one teacher school, Sally Brown, south of  Muskogee, and Anna B. Adams was the teacher. She had a perfect 4-H  meeting every time you went, with a boys    and girls    demonstration, a  boys    and girls    speech. They gave the 4-H pledge, pledge to the flag, it  was all done correctly, and then when it came time for 4-H record books,  every child that was in the 4-H club turned in a record book. When we  came to the banquet, every child from Sally Brown had a medal, won a  medal or some honor. She was one of the old-time 4-H leaders that made  sure that it was all done correctly. Most of her kids that graduated from  Sally Brown graduated from high school and went on to college. I know  she was really, really proud of that. She always said that 4-H club taught  them more than anything she could teach them, and I appreciated that.  We had US Representative Mike Synar, who was one of my 4-Hers, and  probably did more public speaking than anyone that I ever had, other  than my daughter. Let   s see, the Synar family was   of course, Ed, their  dad, was real active in our 4-H program in Muskogee County. Edwin  and Allen were the younger brother and sister, and then had Clayton,  Taylor, and Debbie Lowe and these were all state winners and national  winners in 4-H club. Ira J. Holly was the state 4-H leader, and he was an  ex-Extension agent from Muskogee County. He was a tremendous  individual as far as the 4-H program was concerned, and that was why, I  think, 4-H was so good and so big when he was the state leader. Ray  Parker, and Ray is still alive and still there and he is a Jim Dandy. He  helped a lot of folks in the 4-H club program.  Back to our daily thing, now, Extension is a leader-led program. Very  few counties have a 4-H club visitation program like we had back in the     60s. It   s a leader-led, they give a leader lesson, and the leaders go out  and give that lesson to the kids. This particular county has a different  outlook, totally, altogether different. They have a monthly meeting, the  10  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  parents bring the kids in, they have a meeting for the kids, and then they  have a meeting for the parents. And this is done on a monthly basis, and  it   s worked out real well   and they feed them, every month. It may be a  light sandwich or something like that, but the parents really come. There  were three hundred people here this past month, which was the first  month.  They have project clubs. There is a sheep, a goat, livestock, I   m talking  about beef, photography, cooking, sewing, quilting, several project  clubs, and they have leaders that do each one of these. They have one  man who is a banker, and he has a drum corps, and these little kids are  beating sticks on a five gallon bucket, and they   re the cutest things  you   ve ever saw, and then they rattle it out pretty good. We have a  fellow that   s in the soil conservation office here. He is a karate expert,  and he has a karate club. They have hunting sports, which use air guns  and a bow and arrows, so it   s totally different than what it used to be. I  had none of these when I was starting in Extension. It   s a lot easier and  yet, it   s not. You just shift your energy into finding leaders, making sure  that everything is covered, and everything that they need is covered,  where we used to have to do it ourselves.  That   s a big difference then.  Big, big difference. It really is.  Well, back in    the day,    would you do some prep work at home?  Oh, yes. Yes, you had to do a lot of prep work at home. Another big  thing I think that   s changed is salary. I started out in Muskogee County,  and I got a  400 raise when they hired me because I   d been employed  two years by USDA, and I started out at  4,800.  A year?  A year. Not a month, a year. And most people, they were starting out at   4,400, but since I had been employed for two years, they gave me a   400 raise, and I got  4,800. I thought I was on top of the world. The  first car I bought when I went in Extension cost  1,900. It was a two  door Chevrolet, six cylinder, standard shift, cost  1,900 and I don   t  know whether I was getting five cents or six cents a mile.  And how many miles did you put on it that first year?  Oh, I wore it out. (Laughter) I wore it out. It was funny, and I probably  shouldn   t tell it, Mr. Floyd was a tobacco chewer and he always had  tobacco  in his mouth . One day we were out, we were going out to do a  11  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  home visit and he turned around and he spit but the window was up. It  was such a new, bright, clear window, and it backfired on him.  (Laughter)  Well, the reason you get to work by ten    til eight, and you have coffee  until 8:15, was that just to make connections with the people?  Yes. Just make connections with the farmers at the drugstore. C.R. and  Bob McGinnis had the drugstore in Coalgate. C.R. was a younger  brother, and he went to Oklahoma City and took a test to become a  pharmacist, and never had a day   s school. Of course, he   d been working  in a drugstore for twenty years with his brother Bob, and he passed the  test, so he was also a pharmacist in Coal County. I   ll never forget, that  was the year   and I don   t recall what year that was   but liquor was  passed, and they put in a liquor store right next door to the drugstore, of  all places. A lot of things happened in that little town, and when I first  went there, I thought,    Oh, my  Coal County, I don   t want to be here,     and then when I had to leave, why, we didn   t want to leave. They were  so good to you.  Did you have to do that type of networking in each place, each county  you went to?  Oh, yes. Yes, yes. I don   t know, the Good Lord laid down Extension  leaders in every county, and those people that were Extension leaders  were basically ex-4-H members. They had the background of 4-H club,  knew exactly what Extension was and what it meant. Of course, TV, the  internet and all that has totally changed a lot of things now, but back  then, if you wanted a question answered, you called a county agent   s  office, and they would get you that answer. As it is now, you   ve got to  work at it.  Get on the internet and ask. (Laughs) When it was time to retire, were  you ready for it?  Well, yes and no. When you work thirty years, thirty-two or thirty-three  years, it   basically, the reason I retired was money. They said I could  make more money retired than I could working. I   d take home more  money, I   ll put it that way. I said,    Well, I don   t know about that.    She  said,    Well, let me show you.    So she did, and I said,    Yes, sign me up.     (Laughter)  Most people would, I   d say.  So I did. And, oh, you miss it, my goodness  But I   ve totally stayed  away. I hear it every day anyway, with my wife being county director  12  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  here in Murray County, but she has a real good Ag agent, and I help him  if he wants help. That   s the way I want it to be. I don   t interfere with any  of their projects or programs or anything. In fact, when it came time to  come to the fair, why, I came one day and then the Oklahoma City fair, I  didn   t even go. But when you do it for thirty years, there are other things  you   ve got to go and do. So that   s what we do.  County fairs have changed a lot, too, haven   t they?  Yes, they have. I don   t know, you hate to say it, but you go to some fairs  and all they are is a carnival. This one here is totally   it   s probably the  biggest one in this area because it has a real strong Extension group of  ladies, and they keep it going real well. The Vo-Ag boys here all work  so good together. They have lots of animals. Goats are getting to be a  bigger thing than anything around. Hogs are getting smaller, as well as  the sheep. The horse thing, they have it here on a Saturday. The fair is  over with on Friday, then the horse show is on Saturday and it will last  all day. That   s one thing that a lot of kids are involved with, horses.  They   ve got a real good horse leader here and they meet on Sunday  afternoon at the rodeo arena, and works real good with the kids.  Don   t do so much meat judging?  Well, we have had meat judging here and Carl, the Ag agent was on the  meat judging team in Stillwater, so he has worked with kids. It   s  something new for them and they really enjoy it. And the grocery stores  have been real good to help get meat prepared for their contests.  Much with chickens anymore?  No. In Muskogee, when I was there, we had the state broiler show.  Then, of course, they have a chicken show here, during the fair. But the  broiler show   and I don   t know if they even have it anymore or not.  There used to be a processing plant there in Muskogee that processed  chickens and of course, it was Tyson   s and they closed, or moved to  Arkansas. So I don   t know if the state even has a poultry show anymore.  They have a poultry show in December, but it   s held in Shawnee now  instead of in Oklahoma City like it used to be years ago when my two  little brothers and I showed chickens.  If you showed chickens, did you have to kill them?  No. The broilers you do, but the show chickens, no. No. When we were  kids, when we grew up, I had White Wyandottes and my little brother,  Raymond, had Rhode Island Reds, and David had White Cornish. So we  had three different breeds, three different pens, and the eggs all ate the  13  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  same. (Laughter)  So you grew up on a farm?  Oh, yes. Yes. Yes, I had five Jersey milk cows, we milked the cows,  bottled it. Mom would strain it and bottle it, and we sold it in glass quart  jars, milk bottles is what we called them, with a cardboard lid, fifteen  cents a quart. So that tells you what the price of milk has done from the  fifties up until now.  Well, in the fifties did your farm have electricity by that time, rural?  Yes. It had one light in the barn   at first, no. There was no electricity.  You had to get home and milk before dark. Then Dad, I don   t know how  he got it done, but we got electricity in the barn that had that one light  bulb, and it sure was nice  (Laughter)  Running water?  Yes, we had running water, but I can remember as a kid when we didn   t  have running water and we had lamps, no electricity. I   m not going to  tell you how far back that is, but that was a ways  (Laughs)  And the heating at the house, I guess, was with a wood stove at that  point?  Yes, and you would hold a blanket up around the stove and get it hot and  then run to the bedroom, because there was no heat in the bedroom.  So when it   s time to get up for school, it   s dress quickly?  Oh, yes. Yes, you did. Yes, people don   t understand how fortunate they  really are these days. There were four of us and Mom and Dad, and we  had one bathroom. So there was lots of hurry, hurry, hurry. (Laughs)  There sure was.  And you knew early on Extension was where you wanted to be?  Oh yes, yes. Yes, I was at home with Extension. I was at home with the  4-H program. We had it, it wasn   t beat in our heads. It was something  that we lived with every day. My folks were so Extension oriented, and  we got to know the Extension people. They would come to our house.  We knew them on a firsthand basis. Harold Murnan had three boys and a  girl just like we had in our family and Buster Ford had two little boys  and George. Betty Hull didn   t have any children, and then they adopted  two, once he got to the state office in Stillwater. They were always kind  14  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  of like an older brother to us. They were just fresh out of school. It  seemed like much of Garlington always got those that had just  graduated, being close to Stillwater. He was a soil scientist and a little  crippled man, but he was a wonderful guy as a friend, Mr. Garlington  was.  Good role model.  Yes, he really was a role model.  Did you go to Roundup?  Oh, yes. Yes. We went to Roundup. I think the first year I went it cost  ten dollars. We stayed in Thatcher Hall, had bunk beds, and it was a real  experience for a little guy raised in a small town to go to the big city of  Stillwater, 4-H Roundup. My little brother Raymond was state 4-H song  leader one time. He was the one that was always pushing out front. He  was a politician and the rest of us stayed back behind trees. (Laughter)  Roundup was   they had a fellow by the name of Peterson, and he came  in from Michigan, and he led the singing every year. Mr. Holler had Mr.  Peterson come in. It was a real wonderful experience. Back then, in  Roundup years ago, counties competed, basically, at Roundup.  Demonstrations, speech contests, they had all sorts of things, and you  would get so many points and each county would try to win the whole  thing. Garfield was generally, or Kay County, were the two counties that  would always win, and don   t ask me why. They always did, but  everybody was giving a demonstration, and we figured that just one was  enough. (Laughs) But it was good. It really was.  When was the last one you went to?  Oh, well, the last one I went to was probably in 1993 or 1994. I drove a  bus when I was county director, and I went with the 4-H agent up there.  I   ve been to Roundup with Deb, but only on a daily basis. But it has  changed, also. I was a member of the first Key Club the state had. It   s  the top 1 percent of all 4-Hers, members of the 4-H Key Club. We went  to the celebration that they had last year in Oklahoma City for the  hundredth year of the 4-H Club. Our daughter Amy is an attorney in  Oklahoma City, but she is a die-hard 4-Her, a die-hard cowgirl. Her  blood is orange as can be, and it pleases me that she is that way. She is a  member of the Oklahoma 4-H Council. She   s a strong 4-H supporter and  that   s where she wants to be.  Did she attend OSU?  Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Yes, the top twenty, of 2200  graduation seniors , her  15  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  high school counselor said she wasn   t smart enough to go to OSU. She  needed to apply for a Pell grant and go to Durant. And she said,    I   m not  going to Durant, I   m going to OSU.    So that   s where she went.  Amy  has a degree in Ag Journalism from OSU.  She was always the youngest  one in the class. She was a year younger than practically everyone in her  graduating class in high school. She hated math with a passion and had  to take it in the summertime because she just didn   t like it. The only B  she   s got on her transcript was given to her by her math teacher in high  school. She   s just one of those fortunate people that she reaches and she  has it, and that   s good. She worked in the 4-H office some when she was  in school. We had a little girl here that could not afford to go to  Roundup this year, and I think it   s  120-something now, to go. She  called her mom and said,    Momma, I want to sponsor someone if you   ve  got someone that can go.    And Deb said,    Yes, I   ve got one.    And so  she   s that type of person. And we   re real proud of her. She   s got three  brothers and they   re not that interested in 4-H Club like Amy is.  Did any of them     Oh, yes, they were all in 4-H Club. We had animals running out our  ears. Deb and I have five boys and one girl, and the boys all showed  hogs, the last three showed sheep   no, the last two, and Amy showed  sheep. They   d pull them with the four wheeler, then turn loose, and here  they   d come running back to the house. (Laughs) But they didn   t like the  lamb thing. They   d rather show pigs. The jackpot shows on weekends,  we would load up the trailer with the hogs and here we   d go. If there  was a show in Hugo or Shawnee, it didn   t matter. That   s what we did for  a weekend, we were with our kids.  Good family time.  They didn   t participate in anything that we weren   t there with them. I  missed one game, a football game of our oldest son, and he got hurt.  And I said then, I would never miss an event that our kids are involved  in. One of us or both of us are going to be there, and we pretty well did  that. They respect that. It   s hard for them not to do something and call  Mom or Dad and say,    Hey, what about this? What about that?     Sometimes you think you got rid of them when they got out of college,  well, you don   t. If you ever have them, you   ve got them for life   (Laughs)  And that   s okay.  Yes, that   s fine. It is.  Any grandkids involved with 4-H?  16  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  No, and yes. We have one   well, no. She   s in college now, so there  won   t be any. We don   t have any big enough. We   ve got thirteen  grandkids. Well, I take that back because I   ve got two in Stillwater  themselves. Alea and Aaron are my number two son   s kids, David, he   s  a comptroller CPA for Ditch Witch and his two kids are real active in 4-  H Club. Alea, in fact, is now in Scotland doing her senior year in hotel  and restaurant administration. She was in Finland last year, so she   ll  have a degree in international hotel and restaurant administration from  that thing, and then she   ll have a degree from OSU in Hotel and  Restaurant Administration. And she   s another one of those kids that     well, she was president of Payne County 4-H Clubs for two years in a  row. She took the ACT test three times trying to make a thirty-six and  made a thirty-two, thirty-two, and a thirty-three. I said,    Alea, just forget  it, honey.    She said,    But I want to make a thirty-six,    and couldn   t do  it. Then there   s Aaron, and he   s a little goober and he   s precious, but he  doesn   t care whether he makes a thirty or a twenty-one. (Laughs)  Well, when you were in each individual county, did you do radio shows,  TV, news     Did a radio show in Muskogee. When I got there, Bob Kennedy was the  4-H agent and then he moved to Tahlequah, in Cherokee County, as  county director. He said,    Now, you   ve got a radio program for five  o   clock in the morning on Tuesday or Wednesday morning.    I said,    Oh,  Bob, why   d you do this to me?    He said,    Well, you   ll like it.    So I did  that for a while, and it was at five o   clock in the morning. Billy Parham  was my county director and one day he said,    You know, I don   t think  anybody   s listening to us at five o   clock in the morning.    I said,    Well,  I   m sure glad you said that     And so we backed out of the radio program  because it was so early. TV? No. I was never in a county where it was. I  did several TV spots in Carter County when I was there. Generally, it  was in the spring time, it was doing insecticides, what you do with your  yards or trees or grasses, that type of thing. But that   s basically about all  that we did.  And the newspaper articles?  Every week. When I was in Carter County I had a horticulture newsletter  that went out every month, so you knew different things for different  times of the year. A lot of folks were still gardening then and they still  are a lot, but not as much as they used to. I had Ray Campbell, bless his  heart. He started Oklahoma Gardening in Stillwater. He   s an Idabel boy,  and I could call Ray and tell him,    I want to do a gardening program.  Will you come and assist or will you come and do it?    And he would do  it. But when they knew Ray Campbell was coming, you had a crowd.  17  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  You had a room full. And he enjoyed coming, too. Basically, I was in  the southeastern part of the state, so he liked to come. That way he could  slip on off and go to Idabel, go home, and then enjoy his folks.  This seems to be a pretty tight-knit group of people. Every county  director knows every other county director. It   s just a very tight-knit  group.  Yes, really, it is. Deb and I, we got involved with the National County  Association meeting. I guess Debbie and I, we   ve been all over the  United States just attending National County Association meetings.  When you   re president of the association, which I was in the later    80s,  the national presidents    group, each state president would go to a  national meeting in Florida, for just the presidents only. You got to  know the people from Texas and Arkansas and Louisiana and so on and  so forth. The national meeting has been   every year it   s in a different  location. It   s divided into northeast, southeast and northwest, southwest.  So they rotate around. This year, the national meeting is in Tulsa, in  Oklahoma, and next year it   s going to be in Michigan, and then the next  year it   ll be in the northwest, and then it   ll be in the southeast. So we   ve  got to see a lot of the different states and what they   re doing, and we  share ideas.  Bob Spears was a kid that grew up in Maramec, in Pawnee County, and  he was a county president ahead of me, and he   s the county director in  Virginia. I wrote him one time, or called him, and asked him if he   d send  me some tobacco seed. We are always planting something different,  whether it was broomcorn, tobacco, or whatever, and he sent me some.  Well, I didn   t know what to do with it after I got it up. So I called him  and I said,    What is this?    He said,    Well, it   s a cigar tobacco.    I said,     What do you do with it?    He said,    Well, you   ve got to roll it.    Well, I  let it dry. You   re not supposed to do that. (Laughs) So it was a mess, but  we had a good time with it. Dad ended up his teaching career in Lindsay,  and in that country there   s lots of broomcorn. So we raised broomcorn  one year outside our office in Antlers. We always had something a little  different. People got a big kick out of it. They didn   t know what it was,  and it looks like a broom.  Did you raise it outside your office?  Oh, yes.  Do most county offices do that?  Well, a lot of them do. They have a little area. I   m a little different. I  always do something.  18  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  It   s an educational process.  Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, see, the boy here that works with Deb, he   s got a 4-H  garden back behind here. They had it this year and they had kids and  they   ve got tomatoes, had them planted in raised beds, in tires, in boxes,  you name it. They were just trying it just to see what they could do. He  had a tremendous green bean crop, okra, tomatoes, and squash.  Do they teach what to do with them after they   ve raised them?  Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, yes. In fact, Carl taught a jelly making class one day.  They picked, I don   t know, some apricots or something. They were  making jelly back there.  He taught it?  Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, yes. We   re versatile in this country. (Laughs)  Not the home economist or whatever they   re called these days?  Yes, educator.  Names have changed.  Yes.  Any thoughts on that?  On what now?  Name changes, title changes?  Oh, the old folks, we   re still county agents, home demonstration agents.  That   s not the name anymore. They   re Extension educators, whether that  is in home economics or in livestock or whatever. 4-H agents will  always be 4-H agents, I think.  The county office has changed, too, hasn   t it, the name?  Yes, and you can   t find it in the phone book.  No.  I heard that complaint more than anything,    Well, we can   t find you in  the phone book. What are you?       Well, OSU Extension Center.       No,  19  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  it   s a county agent   s office,    So a lot of folk won   t change.  What has been your biggest challenge?  My biggest challenge?  Yes, in the job.  Since I retired?  No, in the job.  Oh, in the job itself. Well, probably, it was a challenge to come up with  something new and different as a monthly program for children, for kids.  You just wear yourself out trying to figure out,    Well, what am I going  to do this month?    or,    What am I going to do next month?    I can  remember one month when I was in Muskogee County, we went into a  4-H Club and we had a marriage, and that husband and wife   they  could   ve been anybody, but we had like five marriages, and they had to  come back next month with a budget on what they were going to spend  as far as for food, for shelter, for everything that a married couple would  come up with, house payments, car payment, and all this. And they were  really interesting to watch these kids really go to work and try to figure  out what they were going to do. To me, the biggest challenge was trying  to come up with something new and interesting enough to hold their  attention.  You   d have to rotate it every couple of years?  Generally, if you did it once you didn   t do it again.  Ever?  Didn   t try to. It was difficult.  A couple high points?  High points as far as 4-H work is concerned or Extension work, being  elected president of the County Agents Association probably was one of  them. Seeing your 4-H kids do well was probably the best thing you  could see. When you go to Kansas City or to the American Royal   well,  it used to be the American Royal   or go to Chicago to the National Club  Congress, come home with a boy or a girl that was a national winner. It  took a lot of time, a lot of work, a lot of work on the parents    part as well  as that child, but especially their parents. The stronger the parent was,  the better the kid was going to be, and there were a lot of good little kids  20  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  that didn   t have any parents, or had one, or was raised by Grandpa and  Grandma.  I had a boy by the name of Gene Burris who has his doctor   s degree in  entomology and he teaches at the University of Mississippi. Then Dr.  Bob Barker, and his degree was in entomology, and he taught at OSU.  These are kids that, I think, if it hadn   t been for 4-H and the 4-H  program and Extension itself, they wouldn   t have done what they did.  To see these kinds of people really thrive and do well makes you feel  real good, real good, especially Eugene. He was raised by his grandpa  and grandma, lived in Braggs, Oklahoma, which Braggs is right in the  middle of the old army depot over there. His mamma, I don   t know if he  ever saw her, but he   s a good kid. If he got in trouble, he   d call me. One  night the phone rang. I pick it up, and it   s Gene. I said,    Where are you,  son?    He said,    I   m at the county jail.    I said,    Oh, my lord  What   s  wrong?       Well, I   ll tell you when you get here.    So I went down and, of  course, the policeman that had picked him up was from Braggs also. I  said,    Just let me take him home,    and he did.  Clayton Taylor, in Muskogee County, called me one night. It was two  o   clock in the morning. He said,    Ron.    I said,    What   s wrong,  Clayton?    He said,    I   ve got a flat and I   ve got two girls with me and  we   re supposed to be home at midnight.    And of course, he lived twenty  miles from where he was at. I said,    Let me come and get you. We   ll  take the girls home, then we   ll fix the flat, and then you can go home.     So that makes you feel good that they call you, that they know that  you   re there for them.  That leaves an impression with them for a long time.  Oh, yes. Yes. I can   t go to a football game or a basketball game that I  don   t see Clayton Taylor. Of course, he   s baldheaded as can be and he   ll  holler,    Hey, Ron     I may be fifty yards away, but I know it   s Clayton.  Yes. Those are the things that make you really feel good.  We probably should back up and let you tell us how you met your wife,  Debbie.  Okay, you ready?  Yes. We   re ready.  I had a little girl the other day say   well, she is the new 4-H agent in  Durant, and she married the Ag agent in Tishomingo about two months  ago. I was visiting with her and she said she was from Muskogee. I said,     Okay.    I said,    Well, I       And then she had heard that I was the 4-H  21  agent in Muskogee County.    Did you ever know Debbie Low?    I said,     Yes, I know Debbie Low. I know Alice Low and I know Don Low.     She said,    Well, Debbie was my momma,    and Debbie was my 4-H state  horse winner in 4-H club in record books years ago, so there it goes  again. Here   s a 4-H girl or lady, a girl that was in 4-H club, now her  daughter   s in 4-H club as a 4-H agent. So it makes it all worthwhile.  How I met Deb, 4-H camp. She was in Choctaw County, I was in Push  County. In this part of the world 4-H camps are held, of course, every  summer. Some are held for juniors, some are held for seniors. I find my  senior and junior 4-H Club members. Years ago, a girl by the name of  Wilma Wright was in Idabel, and we decided we   d do a 4-H leadership  camp at Beaver   s Bend in Broken Bow. We let each county bring three  boys and three girls, and we started off with that. Now, that has turned  into a district 4-H leadership conference, and you can take as many as  you want to take. This year, the leadership conference is in Ada. So you  start a lot of things.  In 1962,    62 or    63, we had a lot of interest in horses in Muskogee  County, lots and lots of kids with horses. There was no place to show  them, a rodeo arena. Of course, Muskogee at that time was a state fair  and I don   t know that it is anymore or not, but Basil Myers was one of  those guys that came through. Muskogee County was designated in the  northeast as a training county for 4-H agents. We had John Teal was the  first one, Harold Fogleman was the second one, and Basil Myers was the  third one. Then after Basil, he went to Claremore as a 4-H agent. So I  call him one day and I said,    Why don   t we start a state 4-H horse  program?    And he said,    Well, that would be nice.    He said,    Nobody in  Stillwater has started anything like this?    I said,    Well, let me call Bill  Taggert and find out.    So I call Bill. He said,    Well, yes, I don   t know  why not. Why not just start it?    I said,    Well, the first thing I want you  to do is I want you to come and judge a horse show in Muskogee.    He  said,    Ron, I don   t know anything about horses.    I said,    Well, I   ll have  Bob Farabough,    (who was in McAlester and also, he was married to my  first cousin). I said,    I   ll have Bob come up and help you and then Al  (who was a fireman in Tulsa) will come down and help you so you can  learn, too.    He said,    Okay.     So we started the first 4-H horse show, a state show, in Muskogee. The  next year it went to Tulsa, and then the next year it was in Oklahoma  City, and now, we have a district horse show in every district, and then  we have a state horse show in Oklahoma City. So it has expanded into  something real good. Kids have learned a lot about horses. I   ll never  forget, a little girl was on a big quarter horse mare in Muskogee, and her  uncle was the secretary of the American Quarter Horse Association in  Amarillo. He happened to come to the show. Well, one of the things that  22  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  the judges asked the kids to do was dismount. So she dismounted and  then they say,    Well, we want you to mount.    She said,    You   ll have to  help me,    because she was so little, she couldn   t reach the stirrups. So  they had to help her get back on her horse. And they all got a big kick  out of that.  Back to me meeting my wife, who is county director, Extension  educator, here in Murray County. Deb and I were in 4-H camp, I  presume, at Lake Texoma. I had Push County and she had Choctaw  County, and we had Bryan County, McCurtain County, and Choctaw  County, four counties, and that   s where I met her. Amy was a little bitty  brat. We stopped at Braum   s on the way home and I bought them an ice  cream cone, and she dropped hers and just squalled like a panther, so we  had to buy the second one. (Laughs) But that   s where we met, and we  later got married. She had four children and I had two, so we   ve got a  total of six. We   ve got three with degrees from college, two CPAs, and a  lawyer. Then we   ve got a propane dealer, a logger, and the youngest, the  baby   s got a country store in Bennington. He probably makes more  money than all of them. He went to college for a semester, and he called  home and he said,    Dad,    he said,    You   re wasting your money and my  time. I don   t like it and I don   t want to go.    And I said,    That   s fine, but  I admire you for telling me because college is not for everyone.    And  he   s doing super good, doing super good. They all are. We   re just real  fortunate.  Except for the houses     Except for the houses that get lightning struck. (Laughter)  You   ve mentioned a couple of good names there. We   ve talked with Ray  Parker.  Oh, Ray, he   s such a sweetheart. He really is. Wallace Smith is another  one, and Wally was in charge of 4-H after Ira Holler. I   m trying to think  of some of the older ladies, Mary Sue McBroom, who is in Norman  now, or retired, of course, and Virginia. Her name is Virginia Helwig  now, she lives in Kingfisher. She was also another one of the ladies that  worked in the state office. Extension, years ago when I started, we had  our own specialists. We had an Extension building. We had our own soil  conservation people, our own livestock people, and our own dairy  people. Now it   s all in the university. They assign you 50 percent  Extension and 50 percent teaching. We had our own foresters. Now we  don   t have a forester. The university has a forester, and they are assigned  so much Extension time. That   s a different change.  Do they ever make it to the county?  23  Sharp  Finchum  Not as much as they used to. Years and years ago, Coalgate, for years,  had a bull sale, and all the farmers would bring their bulls in, and  whatever. You would have livestock specialists show up from Stillwater  because that was their cup of tea. Well, now, you couldn   t get them to  come to Coalgate for anything. Then you had the old-timers like Ray  Campbell, from Idabel, went to University of West Virginia and got a  doctorate in horticulture. You   d call Ray and he   d be there. He liked  coming out. He liked talking to the audiences in the counties. There are  so many specialists on the state staff in Stillwater that they don   t even  know the counties exist, basically. They   ve got them doing something,  they   re writing fact sheets or they   re doing this or doing that, and they  can   t come out, or they won   t let them come out. If I wanted a program  in pastures, I need a pasture specialist. Loren Rowmann was him, and he  would come. I don   t know who it is now. Of course, I don   t know who  they are now, but they don   t come like they used to.  We would have a hay show where you would bore, take a core out of the  hay sample or the hay bale, and send it in and have a sample made to tell  you the protein content, and on and on and on. You could do it then with  the Noble Foundation for free. Stillwater was charging you from five  dollars up to ten dollars a sample. Well, a poor little old county like Push  County or Coal County couldn   t afford that. So we   d send them to the  Noble Foundation. Well, now the Noble Foundation   s not doing it. So  there   s no place to do it unless you send them to Stillwater, and then you  have to pay. I don   t think it   s out of line, but to that old farmer it might  be. If you cut your hay three or four different times, you   d like to have a  sample of each cutting just to see what you   ve got.  I had a county commissioner in Push County, Buddy Jordan, and he  wanted his hay samples tested. So I said,    Okay, Bud, we   ll come out  and do it.    So we went out and took a sample of his Bermuda grass.  Frank Bates was the livestock specialist out of the Ada office at that  time, and Frank came out and did a program. He said,    Now, Buddy,  you don   t need to buy any feed. All you need is this hay, because this  hay will furnish enough nutrients for those cattle for all winter.    And  Buddy said,    But, Frank, I   ve been feeding them cake all my life.    He  said,    Yeah, but you don   t need to. You   re just throwing money out  there on the ground.       But I still want to feed them.    He said,    Well,  that   s fine if you want to spend your money for cake, but you don   t need  to.    So Buddy did. He didn   t feed them as much, but he had to feed them  every day. Those are some of the things that you had to get over to these  people. If you just don   t have to do it that way, you don   t want to.  That came down to economics?  24  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Yes. Yes, exactly.  Were there days when you got phone call after phone call after phone  call?  Yes, and you tried your best to answer all the questions that they asked  you.  And a lot of those days were before computers.  I hate to admit it, but I   m the world   s worst on a computer. It   s  something that I never was confronted with   and that   s not the right  term to use. It wasn   t there for me to use. When I retired it had just come  in, basically, and my secretary could turn it upside down. I couldn   t turn  it on. (Laughs)  And your newsletters that you wrote before that, that wasn   t on the  computer?  No. And that was another thing. In Coal County, Tom Lee was in charge  of the mail room, and he   d send   it didn   t matter what came across his  desk, it went out to seventy-seven counties. I didn   t need to know  anything about broomcorn or wheat because I didn   t grow any, or  cotton, in Push County. All right, if it came to forestry, they weren   t  even sending that to Boise City, but everybody got everything. So you  had to open it up and see what you had. And now, you   ve got a  computer, and Deb gets all of her mail on the computer.  Seeing everything, though, helped prepare you for your next job in the  next county.  Yes, yes. Sure does.  Did you carry any particular tools of the trade with you?  From county to county?  Yes.  No.  Like a pocket knife or anything like that?  No. No.  Any bad experiences?  25  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Oh, if there was I don   t remember them. Yes, I   m sure there was. Those  things are things that you forget about in a hurry.  Sounds like you have to be a people person.  Right.  Anything I need to ask you that I haven   t?  I don   t know. (Laughs)  Any other stories you want to get on tape before I ask my last question?  I don   t guess.  None? No funnies?  I   ve had a wonderful life in Extension. It   s been real rewarding, and as I  say, we went to the celebration that we had in Oklahoma City. They  were selling tables for  1000 a table, ten people per table. Amy Jo, our  daughter, called and she said,    Dad, I want to buy a table. I want you  and Mom to be there.    I said,    Okay.    So we went to   I think it was at  the Skirvin. I don   t know for sure where it was, somewhere in the city. I  got ready to get on the elevator, and this kid got on the elevator and was  looking at me. We went up to the third floor where the celebration was  and I got ready to get off, and here that guy stood. He said,    You don   t  remember me, but I was one of your 4-Hers in Muskogee County.    I  said,    Where were you from?       Haskell.    I said,    Golly     It   d been fifty  years since I   d seen him. He said he lives in Coweta, worked for OG E,  and retired. He said,    I wouldn   t have been able to do any of that if it  hadn   t been for 4-H.     That   s what makes it all worthwhile.  Yes. It really does. Then I went to Washington, D.C., when I was  president of the County Agents Association, and they said,    Where are  you going?    I said,    Well, I   ve got to go see Mike Synar a minute.    So I  called his office and they said,    Well, he   s in session. Who is this?    I  said,    This is Ron Sharp.    They said,    Just a minute.    They called back  and said,    He   s in session, but he   ll be out of session when you get  here.    So I went over to see Mike and he said,    I wouldn   t be here if it  wasn   t for you.    And that makes you feel good. It makes you feel good.  Those are the things that make it all worthwhile.  Those long hours and     26  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  You don   t worry about the twelve, fourteen hour days you put in. I was  in Muskogee one day, and that was back when we did sheep and you had  to do all the trimming by hand. Clayton Taylor, who   s a super guy, came  by riding his horse. He said,    When are you going to get through with  my sheep?    I said,    You get your butt off that horse and get down here  and help me, and we   ll get through with it.    He   s a lobbyist at the state  capitol now, and everybody knows Clayton Taylor. He worked for Mike  in Washington, D.C., and then he came back home. You just look at  them and, well,    What little part did I have in their life?    When you  have them you don   t think anything about that. It   s later on when they  have done good and they reflect back on what you did with them. That   s  the whole story about Extension, to see those young people do good. To  me, that   s the real story.  Well, they got to see adults do good.  Oh, yes. Yes, that   s true.  The state was lucky to have you.  Well, I was real lucky to be in Extension. I was doing what I grew up  doing, and I liked what I did when I was growing up. I had a good mom  and dad, two good brothers and a sister, and we all have degrees from  OSU. I think, with our spouses we   ve got about thirty-six to thirty-eight  degrees from there, so our kids are doing good. It   s the atmosphere that  you let them grow up in that makes us all a better people.  Well, I appreciate you sharing your stories with me today.  Thank you.  It has been a pleasure.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
