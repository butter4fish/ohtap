Speaker 2: I like soul food.  So, catfish, I'm a country boy raised in the city, so, I mean, whatever is, whatever--good soul food.  I like everything just to--pretty much except for lobster and stuff like that.  I don't, I'm not into really exotic foods, but I like most foods.

Speaker 2: In terms of what?
Speaker 1: In general of the spectrum of colors that you like.
Speaker 2: I'm a, I like the rainbow so I don't have a favorite color.

Speaker 2: Yeah, Satchel Paige used to say that, if you didn't know how old you was, how old would you be?
Story_ID: 466628
Speaker 1: Okay, what we're gonna do now is we're gonna go into some of your early years.  And we'd like to start out by talking about your mother.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Hessie Waterhouse, H-E-S-S-I-E.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: I believe she was born in North Carolina, okay, but then brought to Massachusetts and raised there.
Speaker 1: Do you know much about her background as a child growing up?
Speaker 2: No, not that much.  I know she had a--she told me she used to play and very active with her brothers.  Basically, she was raised in Leominster, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Leominster?
Speaker 2: Leominster, yeah.  But there's a lot I don't know, a lot she does, she's not--she knows her background but--she knows her youth but the other things related to her family history, which is typical of a lot of African American families that are sort of in a gray area, which I'd like to find out about.
Speaker 1: Did she share any other stories besides the athletics with you about her childhood?  Do you recall any special stories she may have shared?
Speaker 2: Seemed to be pretty, pretty happy.  She, professionally, I mean, I know she ended up--I don't know which war it was.  I know she worked as a welder and a seamstress.  She'd done a lot of interesting things that I'm finding about, as life goes on, when she was growing up.  She's eighty-three right now, still shoveling snow in Massachusetts which is insane.  She has good health, exercises every day.  That's my hero.
Speaker 1: Now, how about her mother, did you know her?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  I have her birth certificate in High Point, North Carolina but that's really all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, and a grandfather?
Speaker 2: Don't know any of that.
Story_ID: 466629
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how 'bout your father, what was his name?
Speaker 2: William.  Now, my birth father, William Overton.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: I believe Fredericksburg, Virginia just outside of Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: And what--do you know much about his childhood growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little.  I was basically raised by Eugene Waterhouse, who I've considered my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Boston, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Eugene Waterhouse.  Now, did, did he share his background with you growing up, his life as a child or any of his?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  I had the privilege of meeting his father--was raised, my father was a mechanic, a foreman for a trucking company, my--his father owned his own garage and gas station in Boston, Mass [Massachusetts].  So, I mean, I had the chance, you know, when I was young to go around there, that shop on Ruggles Street and Tremont [Street] in Boston, Massachusetts.  But I don't--I have some fond memories of some of that but my father wasn't really the kind of person that would sit around and talk about his past or his history.  Which I didn't really find out a whole lot about him until he passed away.  He was a military cop, and that's why he was a hard ass (laughter) on me all the time, but I didn't find out until later.  You know, but, I mean, he was no nonsense, work all the time, you know, don't ask me questions just do what I tell you to do right now, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you mention that's his personality, now, how about your mother's [Hessie Waterhouse] personality.  How would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Completely the opposite, you know, she's real cool, very gracious, very humble, good sense of humor.  Spoiling me without question.  I would say they were absolutely opposites, you know, unyielding love for each other.  Not so much--not necessarily on the surface but, I mean, I knew it was there.  I knew it was real, and again, I had a chance to learn, I guess appreciate it more as I got older.  You know, lot of times when you're a kid you don't necessarily understand, you know, what couples go through, you know.  But both of them worked, you know, I wish, you know, I think they had a pretty, pretty good run, yeah, from my perspective.
Speaker 1: Now, now you mentioned Eugene Waterhouse's father.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You met him and you were exposed to him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was like four or five, six years old, yeah.
Story_ID: 466630
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about your early years.  What's your earliest memory that you can recall growing up, your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Man (laughter).  I've never been asked that question.  My earliest memory.  I got a pretty good, pretty good memory, I mean, I had--going back to--I remember getting in a (laughter) I remember getting in a fight, Jesus, with--what is it--I think Jeannie Davis [ph.] and--a girl, and I don't remember the outcome but I know her three brothers were standing on the sideline waiting to see what the outcome was gonna be.  So, I don't know, I was saved by somebody but I don't (laughter) I don't remember the circumstance.  But that would've been in, that would've been before the fourth grade, yeah.  But I also remember when we lived in an apartment on Warwick Street.  That what my address was, 127 Warwick Street, which is no longer there.  And, we had like a two-story--like a duplex, and I remember some fond memories in that instance.  It was a park across the street, which I don't think is there any longer.  But it was across the street from the Sherwin School [Boston, Massachusetts], which I remember there was a hurricane that knocked over a big tree.  And I used to, when the hurricane was over, I remember going out, you know, in the park and walking around looking at stuff.  And I remember I used to always go look under the benches 'cause guys would lay down on the benches or pass out on the benches or whatever.  I'd find money under the benches, you know, (laughter) so all these are--I, again, I'm just--I haven't talked about this stuff on camera at all, but I do remember fond memories, you know, of growing up playing in that particular park.
Speaker 1: What were some of the--you say 127 Warwick, what was that neighborhood like at that point?
Speaker 2: Now keep in mind, I would've been--oh, boy--I moved to go into the fourth grade so I was probably--this would've been before I was five, six and seven.  The neighborhood was all duplexes or triplexes, old, you know, colonial, brick buildings, you know, bordering a park.  That was my particular neighborhood because, I mean, at that age you just didn't, I mean, I didn't wander too far.  And, I mean, very nice people.  Some of the folks that--I still have friends with--matter of fact, my first babysitter, Patricia Van Story, I tease her all the time that was my first exposure to child abuse was her.  (Laughter) I'm sure I'm gonna hear about this one, saying this on camera.  No, she and--but I have fond memories of some people.  The Gordon [ph.] family, matter of fact, I just reconnected with one of them, these are all older than I am.  But it was always--from that timeframe, I mean, in my life it was pretty much positive.
Speaker 1: What was the racial makeup of your community at that point in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: In my--in that, you know, I'm not--I think primarily African American.  There were I know some of the store owners that remember going to were white, but I don't, I mean again, when I think of that particular neighborhood during that timeframe I really--I couldn't tell you what was two blocks away to the northeast or south.  You know, I mean--I basically stayed, you know, stayed put.
Story_ID: 466631
Speaker 1: Do you recall any of the sights at all, and sounds and smells?  You've mentioned some of those things, the smells or the sights, the sounds of that neighborhood, do you recall any of those?
Speaker 2: Because it was across the street from the park, it was nice, you know, the Sherwin School [Boston, Massachusetts] was considered--one of the reasons that we moved was 'cause the school was--the neighborhood was turning a little rough.  So we moved to another part of Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] that they called up on the hill, and into an apartment there as well.  But I don't--in terms of smells and ambiance, and environment and all that stuff, I really don't recall, I mean, that much.
Speaker 1: What was life like in your home, were you the only child?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  They got it right the first time, so.
Speaker 1: What was life like growing up in, in your household with your mom [Hessie Waterhouse] and dad [Overton's stepfather, Eugene Waterhouse]?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a lot of--it was good, a lot of fun.  My mother, again, like I say I was spoiled.  I didn't know it then but I basically got most of the things that I wanted.  I mean, not that I was rich, you know, albeit, we definitely were not rich.  And my mother worked not--probably like nine to five [o'clock] at--when I was young in that age.  She was working for Gilchrist's [Boston, Massachusetts], which I think still exists as a department store, as a marker.  And I don't know what else she did there.  And so, I was a latchkey kid from probably when we moved, when I went into the I think fourth grade.  I think from that point forward I was a latchkey kid, 'cause my father worked.  If I recall, he would drop her off at work 'cause we had one car, and he worked usually like on the outskirts of Boston [Massachusetts], not in Boston.  You always had a good drive to take and so he would come home probably seven or eight, so he was, he would literally put in 12, 13, 14 hours a day.  So, it was pretty much, when my mom got home it was just, you know, me and her.
Speaker 1: And what was his occupation?
Speaker 2: He was at a trucking company, a foreman, mechanic, fixed tractor trailer engines and things of that sort.
Story_ID: 466632
Speaker 1: Your first school that you can recall, like maybe the kindergarten through you said the fourth grade, do you recall what the name of that school was (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was the Asa Gray [Asa Gray School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Asa Gray.
Speaker 2: A-S-A, Gray, G-R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers or people there that stood out in your mind that you can recall, or any experiences that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: I do remember Mrs. Jackson [ph.], not that much but it was--that was actually one of the few African American teachers I ever had.  But I do remember, remember her more so from an image standpoint than I do in terms of what actually occurred during that timeframe.
Speaker 1: And what was the image?
Speaker 2: Positive, you know, like a mom or a grandmother, or aunt or something like that.  It was pretty positive.
Speaker 1: So you were there at that school, Asa Gray School, for how long?
Speaker 2: I believe from kindergarten through the third grade, I think.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any of your other classmates, anybody that stands out?
Speaker 2: You know, it's--not really, other than Jeannie [Jeannie Davis (ph.)], I mean, the girl I got in a fight with.  'Cause I know I liked her so I--but I don't know why I got into a fight, you know, but I don't really remember anybody other than that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what kind of--so you moved in you said around the third or fourth grade you moved.  Now, where did you all move to?  Up on the hill you said.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] also, to a street called Munroe Street, which is--the street is there, the house is not, which upsets me.  You talking about history makers, I think it was one of the only houses on the doggone street they tore down.  Hope that had nothing to do with us.  (Laughter) But, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the difference between that neighborhood and the neighborhood you had just come from?
Speaker 2: Well, because I was older and I had a chance to see more of it, I mean, of a neighborhood so, 'cause I would've been, what, eight or nine so I could, you know, move around a little bit.  Had a bicycle, we had a yard.  Actually, a pretty good-size open area, it was a three-story wood framed house.  We lived on the first floor, the two--and two other families above us.  Insane landlord, respectfully speaking, if that makes sense.  (Laughter) But it was a--we had a nice, nice neighbors.  But a good-sized, open area, in the back, there was a cherry tree back there, a pear tree back there.  We used to play, you know, all kinds of games and it was--that's very memorable times when I was growing up on that street.
Speaker 1: Now was the neighborhood--how was the racial makeup of that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Primarily African American.  The, the--I know the Purdys [ph.] were an Irish family that I was close to, they lived up the street.  A Jamaican couple, Mr. Burgess [ph.], lived across the street, there was Portuguese people lived down the street, a few Jewish people in the neighborhood.  But, again, I--it wasn't like when you're nine, ten and eleven, I mean, I wasn't really walking around, you know, asking for ethnic oriented questions, you know what I mean.  It was a great community and everybody--it was a real close, close-knit community from my perspective.
Speaker 1: So what school did you attend in that community?
Speaker 2: I started out at the W.L.P. Boardman School [Boston, Massachusetts] on Munroe Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you--about the fourth grade you were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I only went there--I think I went there one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to the Henry L. Higginson [Henry L. Higginson Elementary School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Higginson.
Speaker 2: I went there from the fifth and sixth grade, and then I went to the Jewish--not Jewish--I'll be okay.  I went to the Lewis Junior High School [Earl Lewis Junior High School, Boston, Massachusetts] the seventh, eighth, and ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Higginson and Boardman.  Are there any teachers or people that were really what you would consider role models or stood out in your mind that you can recall, or maybe even classmates that might be important for this time period?
Speaker 2: I don't really--no, no teachers come to mind 'cause I think I was only at the Boardman for one year I believe.  So, you know, was a kid that's just uprooted from one neighborhood to another and I didn't really know that many people in the neighborhood.  And, I literally, to go to the Boardman School, it was probably half a mile from my house, so I walked.  But, you know, on the same street--had to cross Humboldt Avenue, which would be considered a major street, and other than that it was no problem.  Then, when I went to the Higginson that was about the same distance away but in the opposite direction, and I walked there as well.
Story_ID: 466633
Speaker 1: But I don't--the Higginson [Henry L. Higginson Elementary School, Boston, Massachusetts], I've got sort of different memories 'cause again I was a little older and I had a lot of, you know, friends there that I still have.
Speaker 2: Who were some of those friends?
Speaker 1: Well, let's see, let me just back up.  So I would say people like Harold Jones [ph.] is still alive and well thank God.  Jeffery Mayo [ph.], who is one of my closest friends, almost like a cousin, he passed away unfortunately.  He lives right across the street from the Boardman [W.L.P. Boardman School, Boston, Massachusetts].  The Roberts [ph.] family, they had a lot of kids and I just loved all of them, all of them were great.  They--I think Tiny [ph.] was the sister that I was the closest to and, let's see, David [ph.] was older than me.  So Tiny and I, we went to the Boardman together I believe, and when I went to the Higginson, the Coleman family, you know.  Well, I was very close, my first girlfriend was Stephanie [Stephanie Coleman], you know--I tend to--it's funny as I'm listening to you, I tend to (laughter) make connections with experiences based on what girl I liked or didn't like.  Now that's funny, going all the way back to elementary school.
Speaker 2: So you were there through the sixth grade, what kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 1: I was a well-behaved student for the most part.  'Cause crazy as I am right now, I'm a practical joker and all that, I didn't get in that much trouble.  But I can say that I was--I don't know, I don't--that I'd have to have--someone would have to find one of my teachers or whatever and say, okay, this is the kind of student he was.
Speaker 2: What kind of a child were you in the home and--
Speaker 1: I was a good kid; I was a good kid.  I mean, I loved life.  I've never grown up, I'm still a kid now.  I'm the biggest--my daughters would probably call me the biggest fool on the planet, you know, I try not to--as serious as I am about a lot of things, I try not to take life too seriously.  So, and my whole life, starting when I was young, basically centered around sports.  It was not--schoolwork, for the most part, was something that I had to do, it wasn't something that I wanted to do.  My life basically was about baseball.  I went from season to season, to season.
Speaker 2: So, did you play Little League and--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I played everything, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Who were some of your role models during that time period when you were playing baseball, Little League?
Speaker 1: Well, let's see, Mr. Chauncey Pope.  Mr. Pope was a baseball coach, just a great guy.  Richard Morris [ph.] was a basketball coach for a number of years when I got to be probably in high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts].  Sort of playing on club teams, traveling teams, things like that.  Jim Mahon was part of the St. Mark's Church [St. Mark Congregational Church, Boston, Massachusetts] where I grew up so he coached me probably before high school.  I had a lot of great, you know, male role models that would volunteer to--whatever sport was in season.  I didn't really play football until I got to high school.  But there was always my uncle, Al Brothers [Alfred Brothers, Sr.] was always, you know, taking us on trips to New Hampshire, to Vermont, to whatever 'cause I was a Cub Scout, you know, so between sports--it was always something to do.  I would--I never sat around saying, "Man, life is boring."  That just didn't happen.
Speaker 2: Two things you mention now, you mentioned the sports and you also mentioned that your uncle.  Did you have your siblings on your parents' side, your parents' siblings?  Did your mom [Hessie Waterhouse] have sisters and brothers?
Speaker 1: Brothers, yeah.  They were basically not, what's it, consanguine, not blood brothers but they were raised as brothers.  So she had four, three.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Norman [ph.], Frank [ph.], Charlie [ph.], yeah, that's it.
Speaker 2: Norman, Frank and Charlie?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And do you know their birth order or where she would have fallen in their age groups?
Speaker 1: She was the youngest.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How about your father, Mr. Waterhouse [Overton's stepfather, Eugene Waterhouse]?
Speaker 1: His sister, only sister was Ruth [ph.], who would have been--who was--I don't know if she was--(makes sound), boy.  I'm not so sure if she was younger or older, I don't remember.
Speaker 2: And were you aware of any of your biological father's siblings?
Speaker 1: My father William [William Overton] didn't have brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But his dad, who was also named William, did.  There was one of eleven.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You mentioned the St. Mark's Church, was there a strong, a strong religious background in your family?
Speaker 1: No.  Not at all.  But, I mean, I went 'cause it was--that's what I was--'cause I guess some of my friends went so that's why I went.
Speaker 2: What denomination was St. Mark's?
Speaker 1: First Congre- united, well, first Congregation, yeah, Protestant (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 466634
Speaker 1: So now you go to Lewis School [Earl Lewis Junior High School, Boston, Massachusetts] in--for junior high?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Explain--now, you're getting a little bit older, now you're twelve or thirteen I guess.  Explain that experience for us.
Speaker 2: That was a pretty--I would say a positive experience.  And keep in mind, I mean, most of my experiences outside the house were always positive.  That's why I always--I mean, I never missed school and things with that 'cause it was my family, you know, so like the brothers and sisters I didn't have at home, I had in school or I had on the basketball court or baseball field or something like that.  So, I remember some of my most positive experiences and role models were people like George Johnson who was my--who was the gym teacher.  And he was real strict.  And I remember when I think of him not only--I can remember if you talked in his class, if he was holding a basketball you might get a basketball in the head.  I mean he was real hard when it came to that.  I mean, you learned discipline and he always had--every couple of years he would get a brand new Imperial and it was always the flyest car in the neighborhood from our perspective, you know, so I remember in moments like that.  I don't remember too many of my other teachers, I do remember a Mr. Ashford [ph.], who was probably I think the first African American male teacher that I had.  And I remember him like it was yesterday 'cause he was--(makes sound)!  He was tough.  And, I mean, you didn't fool around in his class, and I remember him he had parts of his--these two fingers missing and, you know, you'd be in class and if you were talking or something like that and he'd walk around, and you're doing something you weren't supposed to be doing, bam!  He'd smack you, upside, upside the head.  And, I mean, it didn't take but one time before you'd understand you weren't supposed to do that.
Speaker 1: Now, you're still involved in athletics by this time period?
Speaker 2: Just, really just started to sort of start to realize I guess that I was--well, I guess I mean from a community standpoint, you know, people start to identify, oh, he's pretty good at doing this, he's pretty good at doing that.  But that's when--'cause at that time baseball was probably one of my favorite sports, along with basketball, those two.  Plus, and I was going to the Y [Huntington Avenue YMCA, Boston, Massachusetts] so it was swimming at that time as well.
Speaker 1: So which positions in baseball and basketball were you playing?
Speaker 2: Pretty much--at baseball it was first base, which I enjoyed.  And I--well, I throw right handed but I'm ambidextrous, so that was kind of fun.  Basketball, I was--which has probably ended up being my better sport.  I was a forward, wannabe guard, and swimming I did the breast stroke primarily.
Speaker 1: And in--you said you started to get some notoriety in junior high, were there any awards or--
Speaker 2: Oh, I doubt it.  I don't know, I mean, I played everything but it was, you know, community kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: And were there any friends at that point in junior high that have stood out, or anybody of note that you'd like to mention from your junior high experiences?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, I mean, I--just all--I had so many good friends.  I remember, I mean, we would (laughter) probably what introduced me to the entertainment business and the ability to communicate started at the Lewis Junior High School, because when school was over we would walk up Humboldt Avenue, up the hill, you know, towards where we all lived.  And so talking trash and playing the dozens, as they used to call it.  You talk about each other, sort of you earn your stripes to see if someone's either gonna make you cry or they gonna make you laugh.  That was sort of my entree into being able to stand on my own from a verbal standpoint, 'cause I'd talk about you like a dog.  I mean, 'cause that was--I mean I didn't have brothers, it either that or fight, you know, so, I mean I kind of did a little bit of both but not that much on, on fighting.  So, people like Roger Harris [ph.], you know, Harry Wolfson [ph.].  I mean, these are guys I love like brothers now, I mean, were very much a part of antagonizing me, and the tit for tat back and forth.  And anybody that lived off of, you know, Humboldt Avenue, I mean, that's where we'd--our rapport, you know, was embellished as we went home after school.
Story_ID: 466635
Speaker 1: So do you have any aspirations at this point for the rest of your life as a young preteen, teenager?  Do you have any aspirations inside of you that I wanna be this or do this?
Speaker 2: No, not at that age.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you stay there [Earl Lewis Junior High School, Boston, Massachusetts] through the sixth grade?  No, through the eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Through the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Ninth grade.  And then where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Boston English High School [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts], which is the oldest public high school in the United States.
Speaker 1: Boston English High School.  It's the oldest?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now you're a lot older now.  And, before we even bring up to the school, you're more aware of things now, and what's going on racially in society in Boston [Massachusetts]?  Boston has had its, you know, been known for a lot of different things.  What's going on now, are you starting to be aware of more things around you?
Speaker 2: To--depends, because, now, going to Boston English High School was my--it was an all boys school.  So, if I'm in the tenth grade, I dare say I was fifteen.  So, you heard me mention about, you know, girls and that I can--in terms of connecting dots in my mind.  At age fifteen, that's the last thing in my mind was thinking about girls because I was real--at that time, it was really all about sports for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 466636
Speaker 1: Could you just state your birth date for us, please?
Speaker 2: My birthday is February 26th.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Should be a national holiday.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you're at the Boston English High School [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts].  This is a public school for boys, you said.  Was that, was that popular at that time to have the division of gender?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, which and I think it should be--I wish it would become popular again.  You know, Boston English High School, Boston Technical High School [John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], Boston Latin School [Boston, Massachusetts], which was the premier, you know, academic school in the city.  Boston Trade School [Boston Trade High School for Boys, Boston, Massachusetts], and then there were others that were co-educational as well.  But, for me, it was a tremendous--I went there because of the quote, reputation, of it being in a good place for athletes to go, okay.  I wasn't smart enough to go to Latin School, I didn't take a--you had to take an entrance exam to go to Boston Technical for--there was someone, a friend of mine, one of the coaches suggested to me that English would be a good place for me.  And because they were good in football and some other sports and I was really--that's something I wanted to do so that helped me make my decision.
Speaker 1: What was the sister school for girls at that time in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: We didn't have a sister school to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Describe your time at Boston English?
Speaker 2: Tremendous.  Again, I think I was fifteen years old, really had tremendous relationships with the guys on my--my classmates, my teammates, got a sense of some of the teachers.  That was really the first timeframe where I had--where I could determine, make a determination what was a good teacher versus a bad teacher, or teachers who really cared or an appreciation for knowledge or the lack thereof.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those teachers?
Speaker 2: Mr. D was my--DeGirolamo [ph.] was my homeroom teacher I think when I was--I don't remember what year, but he was the French teacher as well.  He was a, he was a hoot, he was a riot.  And, I forgot my English teacher's name, very staunch, very strict, but really helped me develop an appreciation for English literature, American literature, et cetera.  Some of the--trying to think of some of the other teachers.  Don't, they don't come to my mind right now but by--well, and because of, like I said, my classmates, you know, were the demographics of the school were Irish, Italian, a significant part of the population Jewish, smaller, African American, you know, about the same as the--and it was all about the school.  It was such a tremendous amount of pride, you know, we had military drills and things of that sort, rifles.  We went through all kinds of stuff, but it was definitely all boys.  The coaches that I had there, you know, were a lot of--just got a lot of good--it was all about men, it was all about guys.  And, for me, I mean, that--I really--that resonated with me 'cause I really wasn't--other than my mom [Hessie Waterhouse] and my aunts, I mean, I didn't really care that much about girls especially my sophomore year.  My junior year, yeah, I became much more serious about sports and I think I didn't have my first girlfriend I think 'til I was probably end of my junior or maybe my senior year.  I mean, I really didn't take women that, that seriously because they appeared to be, you know, a potential impediment for me to get to where I needed to go.
Speaker 1: Describe your feelings in this school, was this your first really racially mixed school you had gone to?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean with high numbers.  My--for example, I was the vice president of my senior class.  We had five running out of sixty-two guys in the class so that--now, and because where it was located, centrally in Boston, everybody took buses for the most part to get to school.  So, the Irish might have come from their particular community, the Italians came from East Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], blacks came from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] and the surrounding area, but basically the people came from their respective communities which were in Boston pretty provincial, still is.  Definitely was during that timeframe, but when we got there, it was, it was a different situation altogether.  So, as I said, to probably the biggest manifestation of the melting pot is everybody talked about--not only would you talk about each other like a dog, you'd talk about each other's parents like a dog so the guys that were Irish, I mean, they'd go by and whisper my mother's name in class, you know, and people would fall out laughing, I mean, it was really insane, you know.  So people like, I mean, Barry Hickman, real important in my life, still is, I mean, John McQueeney, some of the--Marty Finkel's [ph.] one of my closest friends now, Bobby Rich [ph.], one of my closest friends right now, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, these are all classmates?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all classmates and they're all different races, ethnicities, et cetera.
Story_ID: 466637
Speaker 1: Now, you're involved in sports.  What's your main sport at this time?
Speaker 2: My sophomore and junior year, my primary sport was basketball.  And--the--I wasn't eligible my junior year to play football, which was my fault, you know.  And I only played football one year, my senior.  And I beat up everybody and got lucky and got a football scholarship.  But, basketball was my stronger sport 'cause I played it the most, and I was the co-captain with Lovett Tucker my senior year in high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts].  And baseball because of the sort of--which is probably about my best sport out of everything, because of my size and speed and all that.  But there were not a lot of facilities at the high school level, which was odd because we were in the inner city.  So, if you had to play--when you played baseball, you had to sort of travel outside, you know, to gain access and it was too much of a hassle just getting there, 'cause we had some tremendous athletes and certainly baseball players.  It's just, when they got--we got to be sophomores and juniors, they kind of went into other sports just because, you know, it was easier.
Speaker 1: Well, is anybody of note that went on to play professionally from your school, from your years?
Speaker 2: Nobody other than me that I can think of.  They certainly--well, I mean, like Eddie Lloyd [Edward G. Lloyd], Eddie, and Arthur Carter [Arthur E. Carter], and I'm leaving somebody out.  They went--they had a tremendous run at New Mexico State [New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico].  Eddie is now the chief operating officer at UNICEF [United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund], a stellar career, great guy, and in New York City [New York, New York].  Everett Sheppard [Everett T. Sheppard], yeah, it was Eddie--they all went to New Mexico State, did very well.  I'm not so sure--now, several like Bobby Cofield [Robert Cofield], Richie Lane [ph.], guys that came from this high school, football players, they went, they went to historically black colleges [HBCUs], did really well.  I mean, they are--some went to--Leon Coleman went to Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], you know, tried out for the Olympics when [HistoryMaker] John Carlos--I forgot what year that was--'68 [1968], '68, yeah.  So, Leon was a tremendous--dear friend of mine now, tremendous athlete coming out of Boston Trade High School [Boston Trade High School for Boys, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: What other activities were you involved in at this time?
Speaker 2: In high school, I spent a lot of time from the time I was actually at the Lewis Junior High School [Earl Lewis Junior High School, Boston, Massachusetts] through high school at the Huntington Avenue YMCA [Boston, Massachusetts].  That was like my extended family.  So, I mean, anything that if there was a sport component, I mean, I was there.  So I spent a lot of time swimming there, I became what they call a junior leader, so I always enjoyed teaching, you know, younger kids even though I was young myself.  I mean, if I was eleven I'd take the time to try to teach somebody who was four or five.  If I was--when I was fifteen or sixteen, I'd take the time to teach someone who was ten or eleven.  I'm still, I'm still coaching girls soccer to this day for the most part.  I just--the role models that I had, you know as I mentioned and identified earlier, I--that's what made me go towards the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] was the way to give back.
Story_ID: 466638
Speaker 1: As you approached your junior and senior year, can you describe what your plans for the future are, or how they started to develop in your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, it's twofold 'cause a couple of my dearest friends, and some that were just good cordial friends, they did a lot but I guess it merits being said because when a couple of them were juniors, they inadvertently fathered children, and that scared the heck out of me.  Matter of fact, it scared a lot of guys.  Because in some instances--well, the girl certainly had to drop out of school.  Some of the guys, I can't remember exactly, finished, but some of them dropped out, went into the [U.S. military] service.  And that was a real important--to see that made it crystal clear to me that you need to be careful when dealing with the opposite sex.  So, and I knew at that time, because I was basically inexperienced, naive, didn't have a whole lot of interaction with women.  Like I said, my first girlfriend was I think when I was a junior and my second girlfriend was when I was a senior.  And, I mean, didn't have a lot of experience and--but I knew that I needed--I used to hear these stories about the girls in the South, the southern belles.  They would just wrap you around their fingers and turn you every which way but loose, and I said, "You know what?  I'm not ready for that."  And I don't know, I don't know how it happened, I don't know where I got this epiphany but I knew I needed to not go South.  So I got lucky to some degree because I had a chance to go away to junior college to Nebraska.  And, I mean, so I said, you know what?  I'm not going down that path based on what I heard.  So I went the complete opposite direction because I was also--I'm still very much a disciplinarian and I'm--if I make up my mind to do something I'm going, I'm gonna stick on it.  So, I just--in that time football was the decision--I mean, I got really--did pretty well when I was a senior in high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts].  So I went to school on a football scholarship.  So, I mean, and at that time it was about getting in shape, lifting weights, you know, no nonsense, you know, very, very strategic in all my--yeah, endeavors, et cetera, but then it was all about sports for me.  And it was basically football.  Basketball was no big deal anymore, not as much and it was--but that was it.
Speaker 1: Describe how you obtained the scholarship for football to Nebraska it is?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I, I actually--I was recruited by Wake Forest University [Wake Forest College; Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] where I ended up going in North Carolina after I left Nebraska.  And I guess the coaches there, they probably came to, in all honesty, I mean, I'm not so sure that I'm not--I don't even have to hesitate on that one.  Wake Forest was a real hard school academically.  I--no question about the fact that I wasn't ready to go there from high school, so I went to junior college first.  And when I got there, I mean, it was my, you know, I did real well in school 'cause I studied.  I realized--I think the first book I ever really read was 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley], and that turned me around from a soul standpoint.  I mean, I understood so much about what I did not know, you know, and here I am the only black in the town.  In Nebraska, it was a town of ten thousand people.  And, you know, carrying the banner and the responsibility of my high school, of my community, et cetera, and they thought I was--because of the way I dressed that I was from a wealthy family.  They didn't have a clue, I lived in an apartment.
Speaker 1: What city was this in Nebraska?
Speaker 2: McCook, M-C-C-O-O-K.
Speaker 1: And what school was--
Speaker 2: McCook Junior College [McCook Community College, McCook, Nebraska].
Story_ID: 466639
Speaker 1: Okay, McCook [McCook Junior College; McCook Community College, McCook, Nebraska].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, describe please your arrival there and seeing this coming from Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) that's funny.  The--well, actually, it's my first time on an airplane.  I left Logan Airport [General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts] on a jet and flew to Denver [Colorado].  I remember very clearly like it was yesterday my mother [Hessie Waterhouse] crying, my father [Overton's stepfather, Eugene Waterhouse] crying 'cause I was going away to school.  And they probably laughed like hell when I--when the plane took off but they, they put on a good front.  And so, when I got to Denver, I flew on Frontier Airlines back to McCook [Nebraska] on a prop plane and the wings were going like that, I got sick as a dog.  That was a bad experience for me.  Now, they had the safest record in the country at that time, and still have a pretty good track record--they're still, I mean--for a long time.  And I got off--I can remember coming down the stairs out of the plane, and the first thing I heard was "Moo."  I went, what in the hell?  And I was--it was a cow pasture.  I mean, the airport was probably five times the size of this room.  And there was one person in that room, you know, and my coach was there, Rex Grossard, big strapping guy with a big cowboy hat on, was there to greet me.  And I'm pretty sure I was there on a weekend I'm not positive, but he got in the truck and my luggage, et cetera, and he drove into town.  And the reason I say I think it was a weekend--I think it was a Sunday 'cause there wasn't a lot open.  And I know we went into a tavern at the end of the street.  And, you know, you go through the doors like on the old television series--guess it'd be--
Speaker 1: 'Bonanza'?
Speaker 2: 'Bonanza,' you know, you go through to open the door and, you know, smoke-filled, people turn around.  Everybody in there greeted me, they knew who I was.  I thought that was pretty funny, you know.  And that was the first vivid experience, and then I ended up--part of my scholarship I stayed--the school was so small, they didn't have a dormitory, I stayed in the hotel.  I had a suite on top of the Keystone Hotel [Keystone Business Center; McCook, Nebraska], which was on the sixth floor, which was a part of my scholarship.
Story_ID: 466640
Speaker 1: Did you run into any racial problems while you were there [McCook Junior College; McCook Community College, McCook, Nebraska]?
Speaker 2: My first year, no.  It was--I mean, I was part of the family 'cause, I mean, I was a hell raiser, I mean, on the football field and they liked that.  And we had a winning team, and I'm easy to get along with.  I wouldn't cause trouble, I went to class, I did everything I was supposed to do.  And, and again, like I said, I was real committed.  Then--
Speaker 1: And what position were you playing?
Speaker 2: I played defensive end, yeah.  And offensive end.  And so, no, I didn't, I didn't really run into any racial issues, which was still minor but it was interesting, my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Could you describe that for us?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a girlfriend, so I guess my sophomore year, and 'cause, like I say, I had just started to really evolve, you know, as a male.  (Laughter) And, so I guess I would have been, what, eighteen?
Speaker 1: Now this is at--in high school or--
Speaker 2: No, this is in junior college.
Speaker 1: Junior college, okay.
Speaker 2: This is about my second year of junior college, so I didn't have a girlfriend in my--the girlfriend I had when I was in my freshman year would have been in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  That was Yvette [ph.].  So, the--when I basically started to evolve and, and, you know, you become a little--gain a little notoriety as an athlete, all that stuff.  Make a long story short, I ended up liking someone who was from the town, and I remember it like it was yesterday--make it--I'm giving you the short version, where her dad requested a meeting with me.  And, now, I had talked to--I'd never met her mother and father, I'd talked to her mom on the phone when I'd call the house.  And she always was nice to me on the phone, and I know she had a brother.  Brenda [ph.] was her name.  And so, I remember going to downtown McCook [Nebraska] in a cafe with her father sitting across the table from me.  I had my knife in my--no (laughter).  (Cough) Excuse me.  And the bottom line was--he said to me, "You know, I have checked you out.  I know your history, I know what you're like, I know you treat my daughter, you know, like a lady with respect, all that."  And he said, "I appreciated that."  And she was a year younger than me.  And he said, "You got two things you can do, two ways you can approach this," 'cause, you know, just some talk and stuff or whatever.  He said, "You can either be subtle and quiet about what you do and continue, or you can basically tell the town to go to hell and do what you want."  I think I became a man that day, because here was a guy--I didn't know what to expect but I was literally--I had in my mind--'cause I was at that time I'm 6'2", probably 210.  I was pretty crazy.  I didn't know if it was gonna be a fight, I didn't know what was gonna happen.  But when he said that he appreciated me as a person and knew that I cared for his daughter, and was always, you know, motivating, I mean, was about trying to do the right thing from his perspective, that I grew up, you know.  And, from that point forward, I had--if there was any issues--from that day forward, I never had issues with relationships, with white versus black versus Jewish versus this versus that, because he had--this man stood by me.  I mean, I had my coach [Rex Grossard] supporting me, just as a man.  But here was a father, you know, which that prepared me to do with my own kids, you know, that prepared me to deal with women along the way.  So, and probably 99 percent of the instances from that point forward, I mean, I've always considered myself dealing with women from a respectful standpoint.  'Cause it just, it merited that.  I'm sure there might be a woman or two out there that might say that something contrary to that (laughter) but I did the best I could.
Story_ID: 466641
Speaker 1: So, with two years at McCook College [McCook Junior College; McCook Community College, McCook, Nebraska], then what happens?
Speaker 2: Well, I got--then I had convinced a friend of mine, Andy Heck, who's a real good friend of mine, a running back at McCook, to go to Wake Forest [Wake Forest College; Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  And because he went, I decided--and they had recruited me when I was a freshman, I decided to go there.  And that was quite an experience 'cause now I'm going from a rural, small, quote, hick town, to a city in the South that was Winston-Salem [North Carolina], private, Baptist, upper-class school.  No nonsense, no drinking, no--not that--I didn't drink anyway.  No, no drinking, no dancing on campus, maid service, you know, which most people when they hear it today they go, you had what?  I mean, we literally had maid service.  And most of the people were, you know, well-dressed.  Lot of the kids came to schools in chauffeur-driven limousines.  I saw wealth that boggled my mind.  I just was not--just had never seen that before.  And so, I was--myself, Bob Grant [Robert Grant], Butch Henry [Kenneth Henry], our class was the first class--they were there two years before me--to get--to go on football scholarships.  So, in the Atlantic Coast Conference, ACC, it was revolutionary what we were doing.  You know, we were the first to play--first blacks to play at Clemson [Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina], first blacks to play at the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina], Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina].  There was a lot of things that, when I see the way that sports has evolved now, when I look at what I went through.  We were the first blacks to play at Auburn Tiger stadium [Cliff Hare Stadium; Jordan-Hare Stadium, Auburn, Alabama].  So I can see now--I remember walking in Auburn Stadium and, and looking at this old, raggedy, rickety, broken-down section where the blacks had to--up at--like up, way up at the left where they had to sit.  And it really--man, it bothered me.  I tried to tear the quarterback's head off.  I used to take out my racial issues that I saw or heard about, or read about, I'd take it out on the opposing team.  As sick as I am.
Speaker 1: So, now you've--this is probably--so you enter Wake Forest as a junior now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, you're going into North Carolina, it's a little different in that part of the country.  Tell us about and describe, please, the racial tensions of what you encountered when you arrived there?
Speaker 2: It's an interesting time.  Matter of fact, I'm surprised I'm still alive.  But, now, you have to keep it--I have to say this, I had pretty much great experiences at Wake Forest.  But it all depends on, you know, how, how much you wanna examine it.  First of all, I was a student athlete so, I went to class, I didn't fool around.  I didn't really have much of a social life my junior year similar to what happened in--when I went to junior college.  My first year, I mean, I'm all about taking care of business so, I mean, I'm on the football team and we're, you know, Division I and, you know, I'm starting defensive end.  And I got--I played hard and, well, I had great, you know, really good year.  And we didn't have a great team but, I mean, I took everything personally because I knew at that time I was going to the pros somehow.  So a lot of the things that other people did, I mean, I didn't deal with.  Now, so, but racially, you know, I mean, I, you know, when you're a football--when you're an athlete, you know, people deal with you differently.  Now, I didn't have a car so I didn't leave campus that much, so what was going on in the City of Winston-Salem and what was going on in the South the only way I found out about it was through reading and things of that sort.  So, we were, you know, we are knee deep in the civil rights era during that timeframe.  And I was concerned, you know, about some of the things that were going on but I wasn't really--I'm getting ready to sneeze--I wasn't really in it because, I mean, I had--you go to football practice.  You go to class, you know, you interact with your teammates, your guys, I mean, that was sort of, you know, that was sort of it.  You know, I didn't go--and because, again, in the back of my mind, I think I said earlier, that I had this sort of phobia about going across town to Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] or to North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], looking for sisters over there because I did--my mind was on the National Football League [NFL] (laughter).  I tried to stay out of trouble.  Now, I mean, I did, you know, I did waver from time to time but not that much.
Story_ID: 466642
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that young black males might be considered different or viewed differently when they're playing athletics, could you describe that?
Speaker 2: Well, I--you know, I think some of the relationships, you know, some of my teammates, I mean, they were in fraternities that didn't allow blacks in the fraternity.  Now, I didn't--I never challenged them or questioned them on that.  And, I mean, I'm not even an authority on which one was, which one was not.  But, I mean, I know there was a lot of issues, lot of things going on about that.  You know, I had some--I had one teacher in particular, which I know he had a real problem with me.  I had a social problems class in which I really enjoyed, and I mean, and a lot of the issues dealt with sociology and things that were going on in urban areas, urban America in particular.  Well, I knew this; I lived it so I would always challenge this guy.  He didn't like me at all.
Speaker 1: Do you recall his name?
Speaker 2: I wanna say it was Schwartz [ph.].  You know, he used to give me a rough time and I would, in turn, because I knew what I was talking about I responded probably in ways that maybe I shouldn't have.  But I didn't particularly like him.  But, also, I mean--then now on the flip side of that, Dr. Shirley [Franklin R. Shirley], who eventually became the mayor of Winston-Salem [North Carolina], he was my speech and voice and diction teacher.  And he would use me, which is odd.  See, he would use me as the example of how the English language was supposed to be spoken, which I thought was an absolute hoot, because he did not like the southern drawl that the other--that everybody else had.  Now, he was from North Carolina.  And I just thought--and that was the first teacher that ever said that--that basically used me as a role model for something that was good.  Like my conversation with Brenda's [ph.] father turned me out in terms of my head, I'm ready now.  Dr. Shirley was the person that said, you know, communication is something you could be good at, so pay attention.  So that was really my first endeavor from that point forward to know I was gonna do something to deal with my big mouth by my--which all started with talking about playing the dozens and talking about people's mamas when I was (laughter) nine and ten, and eleven, back in junior high school [Earl Lewis Junior High School, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: What was your declared major along with the football?
Speaker 2: Getting out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I changed my majors three times which is a whole another story which is--leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I was a--I thought I was a lot smarter than I was but we don't need to get into that.
Speaker 1: So at the time you were taking the voice and diction class, what was that--was there another major you had declared at that point?  Why were you taking that class?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I changed into that.  I think my end of my senior year, and then when I went back after my first year of playing football when I got out of college [Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].
Story_ID: 466643
Speaker 1: So, as you're approaching the end of your college [Wake Forest College; Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]--your four-year college or undergraduate, what is going on for you now?  Can you describe that time period and what's next on the horizon for you?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, there's some interesting stories that, I mean, the audience might get a kick out of.  I remember--I think I was a senior being coerced by Karen [ph.], who was in one of my classes, to go see 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,' which was Sidney Poitier.  And, I wasn't excited about going with her.  I mean, I liked her but taking a white female to a movie theater in Winston-Salem [North Carolina]--I don't even know where it was, I know it was off campus.  I don't know if it was in town, I don't really remember.  But that was--I was a little concerned about that just from the--everything that I did on school from a social standpoint was kind of low key, what little bit I did.  But it was strange as heck because that movie was very powerful.  And the country reacted to it in a very phenomenal way.  Well, probably twenty years after that [sic.], I ended up doing--playing Sidney's role in 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' on television, directed by the Academy Award [Oscar] winner, Stanley Kramer.  And what an amazing flashback all of that was for me, you know, to--so to be able to do that and then have Stanley Kramer tell me, you know, that this show--if this show sells, you know, you're gonna be the most loved and the most hated African American in the country.  They're gonna look--like they gonna look at you like they look at Muhammad Ali.  I'll never forget that.  And they--it was for Columbia [Columbia Pictures], and they ended up changing the air date I think about five times, and ended up putting the show on the air July 4th, like at nine o'clock.  So the only people that saw the show was my family and Leslie Charleson's family.  And it was done, it was done by design.  And I think to date, 2008, you've not had an African American male married to a white female in a primetime series.  I mean, very interesting what's going on, you know, in our country.
Story_ID: 466644
Speaker 1: Now you're a star athlete at this school as you said, there were some groundbreaking things that you all did through your time period as far playing at different stadiums, in different leagues, some of the first African Americans.  Talk about the recruitment process and what happened, you think, in your opinion, describe the process and what goes on?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, you know, once, I mean, once I'm there, I mean, you're talking about at Wake Forest [Wake Forest College; Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] is what you're talking 'bout, I mean.
Speaker 1: In general what do you think the process involves with young black athletes?
Speaker 2: Well, well, like--really, I guess that's a really good question because my observations, you know, Wake--if you studied the, the athletes at Wake Forest during that timeframe, every one of the guys, African Americans, without question were nice guys.  Butch [Kenneth Henry], Bob [Robert Grant], Howard Stanback, Jimmy Johnson, unfortunately no longer alive, Steve [ph.], Steve and his brother, and these younger guys, Gilbert McGregor [Gil McGregor], who is a color analyst for the New Orleans Hornets [New Orleans Pelicans] right now.  Just--these are super human beings.  And I--it was never said to me, but these schools I thought recruited a particular kind of athlete.  Just like you would hear about I guess how Jackie Robinson was hand-selected, so to speak, because the owner--I forgot the owner--O'Malley [Walter O'Malley] felt that he could deal with what was gonna come at him during that particular time.  Now, when you look at--and I compare like what happened at Wake Forest in the Atlantic Coast [Atlantic Coast Conference], Wake Forest was I think the first to make the moves that they made.  When you look at USC, University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California], I mean, historically, I mean, they had, you know, Mike Garrett, then came O.J. [O.J. Simpson], they had Vince Evans, Charlie White [Charles White], Al Cowlings.  I mean, most of--if you looked at--it was almost like they, they--I would jokingly say, look like some of the athletes that came out of USC were created in a lab.  'Cause a lot of times they were good looking brothers--Marcus Allen, I mean, well-spoken.  It was like, where do they find these guys?  Well, when I look at Wake Forest, they handpicked certain brothers that they thought could make it.  Now, one of the things that they did not do in my opinion is recruit African American females.  So when you've got--you're on campus and you are a, quote, a star student athlete 'cause I don't think--and none of us walked around like we were stars.  I mean, I certainly--I mean it was an interesting time.  Now, Bob, my teammate who was the real star on the team, I mean, he basically snubbed his nose at the school and dated whoever he wanted to date, you know.  And he was from--Bob was from the South.  And I just--I really wasn't about--I was all for social change but I wasn't gonna force myself or my wants or wishes, or my social objectives, on anybody.  If I didn't think people were comfortable with me, I stayed away from 'em.  Now, for example, I was the first--I was told I was the first African American to join a southern white fraternity in the country.  And I say I'm an Alpha Sigma Phi [Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity], I don't really, you know, participate and do much with it.  I'd like to get more involved because there's a lot that I'm sure they don't know about what I did.  And I was basically recruited by the guys in the fraternity, who were some of the white guys, obviously, from the North, from Massachusetts where I was from.  And, in my mind I'm going, okay, I don't have a car, I'm a senior now, don't have much of a social life.  If I become part of a fraternity, they have parties, hm (laughter) my mind was working, you know, so I joined.  And that was a, that was a hoot.  Just the indoctrination and, you know, that whole pledge thing.  I mean, I could tell you a story, you wouldn't have enough tape to talk what I went through when they took us out and left us out in the damn boonies in North Carolina and we had to find our way back.  And here I am a brother, and I remember in the back of the truck, you know, 'cause they had to hide me to get me back to campus, right.  And the guy who was driving the truck was talking about the interesting black folk, but he used different terminologies, that were now playing at Wake Forest.  I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 466645
Speaker 1: Now you say that you didn't venture much away from campus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but did you go into Winston-Salem [North Carolina] itself on occasion?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I had the--not often because Butch [Kenneth Henry] had the car, he had the only car.  So Butch and Bob [Robert Grant] were like two peas in a pod, you know, three's a crowd.  You got a girl--you got two guys in the car, you ain't got room for two women.  And--but I didn't--and, again, you know, you figure that I'm gonna be at a school for two years my mind is--my focus is on planning the next level.  So, and I did have, you know, a few positive experiences with some people off campus but it really, really wasn't--and I still was really young and naive when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex.  And that's really the only thing that would make me think, well, let me go over here or go over here.  I remember we visited Howard University [Washington, D.C.] because Bob's girlfriend, real girlfriend, was at Howard.  So we drove up there one weekend, and I mean I must've fell in love about ten times.  I ain't never seen sisters look like that, you know.  But it messed me--and I--but then, again, because I was now more mature I said, "I ain't coming back here."  You know, so I went back.  But my standard and my identification, you know, with girls who were not only fine as new money but smart, just let me know.  Because I didn't--I think I only had one--the entire time I was at Wake Forest [Wake Forest College; Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] we had one African American, Valjean Griggs, who I really--who I like, who I was tight with, you know.  I think she came my senior year, but she lived off campus so my, you know, my reference points for women and males all the way through college was white.  I mean, I never had a black professor, you know.  And I didn't--and the only time I would get--the race thing would become--I mean, I would, I'd go home to Boston [Massachusetts] and go to a party 'cause I loved to dance.  But I didn't know, I didn't know what was going on so I'd have to--I'd study the moves that people were making and go in the bathroom and practice and then come out and act like, I mean, I never missed a step.  But I knew how to square dance with the best of 'em from Nebraska, that's the honest to goodness truth.
Speaker 1: Would you attribute possibly the rise of the black athlete being joined to the white women as this reason because of the association and the exposure of who's there on campus?  Lot of times do you think that's what causes, as we see now a lot of that going on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  When I was in Nebraska, I mean, the junior college [McCook Junior College; McCook Community College, McCook, Nebraska], you know, the major--the University of Nebraska [University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska] was one of the top schools during that time.  I mean I think my sophomore year I think they had maybe two or three first round [sic.] draft choices.  I mean, Freeman White, Tony Jeter--oh, I forgot, geez, I can't remember the other [HistoryMaker Robert Pickens], he won a bronze medal in Roman wrestling [Greco-Roman wrestling]--ah, man, he ended up playing with the Chicago Bears as a lineman.  I mean, this was--they were serious student athletes.  But, I mean, there were no--to my knowledge there were very few African Americans.  This is now a major university, we're talking thousands, you know, versus where I'm at junior college.  So, I mean, Freeman's wife was white, I mean, back then, you know.  And I just remember that--and I would, it would--I was curious, you know.  So, when Chamberlain--Wilt Chamberlain, I mean, was obviously way ahead of me, but at the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas], I mean, it wasn't no sisters on campus during that time I wouldn't imagine.  You know, so all of the--the Big Ten [Big Ten Conference], the Big Eight [Big Eight Conference], the Pac-10 [Pacific-10 Conference; Pac-12 Conference], I mean, for the--well, certainly not in the SEC [Southeastern Conference] 'cause the SEC didn't have--until SC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] kicked Bear Bryant's behind, I mean, in the whatever the bowl it was.  I mean, the SEC didn't recruit black athletes.
Story_ID: 466646
Speaker 1: Do you think it's the same way now somewhat?  Do you think it's changed much?
Speaker 2: Oh no, are you kidding me?  I mean, when I say--well, was it--what's the guy's--the brother's name?  Begins with an H, all-world, University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Herschel Walker?
Speaker 2: Herschel, Herschel's wife [Cindy Grossman] I believe was--or girlfriend, I mean, he got, he was--did he win the Heisman Trophy?  I mean, he won everything.  But when--and I can remember just being amazed, I mean, I--because when I left playing football--I only played professional football, uneventful, two and a half years, bouncing around, never really got on track.  I left and I shut football out of my life 100 percent.  When I saw people like Bo--when Bo Jackson won the Heisman Trophy from Auburn [Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama], I went, damn!  Because that was maybe ten years after me.  But keep in mind now, I know nothing about what's really going on in college sports 'cause I divorced myself from that.  But I'm sitting here telling you I remember it like it was yesterday being the--one of the first blacks to play on that field.  And I can remem- so that was such a cataclysmic change from a social phenomenon for me, and I'm still, you know, amazed.  But so you see now--and they don't really talk about it a whole lot in a positive way, but I mean, there's a lot of--like in the entertainment business.  You see a lot of mixed relationships.  When you become a star, when you score and you do well, even if you're a woman, I mean, it's easier 'cause typically, the unfortunate, sad state of affairs, in sports the opportunities for women are minor compared to the men.  So the guys make all the money, they get all the fame, all the fortune, et cetera.  Then it's basically about power and money, and then you get the pick of the litter.  Doesn't matter what race you are, they come at you, you know.  I mean, in the entertainment business.  I mean, Sidney Poitier, Sammy Davis, Jr., [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, I'd gone on--I mean, who did they marry, you know, I mean, not just marry but, I mean.  And so, I'm always curious about that.  And it's not a slight against African American women at all, but it's, it was like, what is available, you know.  And how do standards change?  And where do you go?  What neighborhood do you live in?  Who's your agent?  And when you got an agent and a manager, and they're handling your money, where'd they--what kind of, you know, who are you listening to?
Speaker 1: So would it be fair to say that sometimes there's an idea that African American athletes and entertainers, male, purposely just go out on a hunt to find a white mate.  But is it possible--are you saying that possibly just the pure exposure and they're around makes it just, as anybody else would be, you pick who you're around?
Speaker 2: It would be an insult to white women, okay, in my opinion, to say that they're just fodder for black athletes.  I think that they're--I mean, the couple of young ladies that I went out with when I was in college and my limited exposure and experience, I really cared for them, and I know they cared for me.  Well, you're, you're a kid and I'm talking about young, I mean, I was from seventeen to twenty-one, you know.  I'm, I don't think I'm any different than any kid on any college campus in America except, I mean, well it depends.  I was different, okay, but I was raised in the North and here I'm in the South.  But, today especially now the blurring of the edges through music, you know, through TV, through film, et cetera, through media, you see a lot of changes.  But at the same time, you know, you see, I mean, Halle Berry, can you imagine a star African American actress--well, actually [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll did it.  I mean, so when you score it's like, okay, who are you around?  'Cause Diahann Carroll caught all the flak for marrying somebody white, you know.  Diana Ross caught flak, I mean, so what.  We should all only wish that someone would be happy, you know.  And the conversation I had--the conversation we had off-camera, you know, you're gonna deal with someone's daughter, you treat them with respect and dignity.  You know, on the flip side of that, if you're a female, you know, you treat a man, I mean, the way you would--like he's a man, like he's a gentleman, et cetera, you know.  'Cause I've never had to date, you know, any respect for guys that treated women like dogs and these are white, black or otherwise.  I just don't, I don't believe in that, you know.  And I've never associated, you know, with guys like that.  I mean--but, you know, you learn things along the way, you know.
Story_ID: 466647
Speaker 1: Now, you're coming to the end of your college career, what's next for you?
Speaker 2: I was, you know, determined, you know, I was gonna play professional football, that's all I really wanted to do, you know.  I mean, there was nothing else I had--it was--that's all I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So were you going through the--what do they call it, the being looked at process, were you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know, it happened so fast.  By the time, you know--and I've had some of these things I don't necessarily wanna go into on camera 'cause I--in my senior year--and I had a tremendous junior year in college.  I started every game I played ever in college.  And--but my coaches switched my position when I was a senior, you know, and because I was a committed athlete and I didn't--they sacrificed me for the team as opposed to looking out for me.  And, I mean, I let it go but it caused me problems, you know.  And then I heard some other things later on about what I was socially, how that might have affected me.  You know, 'cause the first team I ended up going to was the Dallas Cowboys.
Speaker 1: So, you got picked, drafted by the Dallas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a free agent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, and I went to the Dallas Cowboys as a linebacker, weighed like 'bout 215, 220 [pounds] by the time I got there, you know.  And, it was a really interesting experience, you know, for me.  But, again, I found out--well, like 'cause I left there when the season was over.  Actually, I left--I made the taxi squad, ended going to the farm team in Oklahoma.  Lot of people don't, I mean, don't know but a lot of stuff I used--I just focused on what I did.
Speaker 1: So there's a whole system, there's a farm system that you can go through in football as well as baseball (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, there was then, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So I went there, played there until the end of the season, went back to, went back to Wake Forest [Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and really got into the whole--communications, diction courses, classes, blah, blah, blah, blah, all of that.  And--but because now I am quote, a professional football player who has returned--different phenomenon going on there socially as well.  That's a whole another story which I don't need to get into.  But I learned a lot, I mean, about how people change, you know.  And, I also--it left some bad tastes in my mouth in terms of how universities deal with you, and how I was dealt with specifically.
Speaker 1: There's some things--I know you don't wanna go into the whole, full details but are there some anecdotes or things you can share with us about that time period that you do--that you don't mind sharing?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess for any parent that has a child that's a student athlete, you need to be--you need to stay involved in their career to give them the guidance that they need to have to get over the hurdles and the obstacles in front of them.  My mother [Hessie Waterhouse] and father [Overton's stepfather, Eugene Waterhouse] never went to college so I couldn't ask--they didn't know.  And, you know, I was without question manipulated, you know.  Now, did I know it, did I know it when it was happening?  Did I know it when it was--no, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say manipulated, away from your professional career slightly?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  You are used, you are sacrificed sometime for the sake of the team.  You know, coaches, like I say, players have an agenda, my agenda was to get to the next level.  The coaches have an agenda, they want to get to the next level.  They never say that, you know.  They don't-- they gain points, they get credibility based on their winning, you know.  And you could be the best player, the best--your position might be this and that's what destiny has in store for you, but if the team needs you over here in order for the team to do better, for the coach to do better, for him to get to the next level, you're sacrificed.  See, that happened to me.  I did not know that until after it happened.
Story_ID: 466648
Speaker 1: So, you're saying your true position was sacrificed, what you should have been playing and being looked at, you were operating somewhere else in another function.
Speaker 2: Exactly, you know, because I was the kind of person, I mean, I'd tear your head off, you know.  I mean, I was all about ego, you know, tenacity, jock to the bone.  That was me, man.  Everything I go after right now, I mean, I play 'til I'm the last one standing.  And they took advantage of that.  Now a lot of coaches would say that's a good thing, and it was a good thing.
Speaker 1: So for the people that might not be as athletic, it's like saying you were a quarterback and then, and then they said, "Okay, you're gonna be a running back instead."
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Different skill set.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My--the first quarterback in the--first black quarterback in the Atlantic Coast Conference [ACC] was like my brother, Freddie Summers.  He came to Wake Forest [Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] because of me.  When I got out of high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts], and I went to Nebraska as I said, I came back home my first summer.  He was working in the drugstore as a soda jerk.  This man was fast, tall as me, probably 200 pounds, had a rifle for an arm, rifle.  Okay, he went to a co-ed school, Dorchester High School [Boston, Massachusetts].  He couldn't get--nobody took him serious.  It's in Boston, Boston, Massachusetts.  Nobody, no college offered him anything.  I got on the phone, I remember it was an old black and white phone we had in the hallway where I lived on Munroe Street.  And I called--probably knowing me, I called collect.  Called Coach Grossard [Rex Grossard], and I sold Freddie Summers to Coach Grossard on the phone.  And said, we need this guy, he's a good cat, you know, he's an unbelievable--I said, I can remember looking up at the--I was on the outside of the stadium.  I said, I remember looking up in the air, you know, and seeing the ball in the air and the lights still going, you know what I mean.  He took--Rex Grossard--
Speaker 1: Now, he was at Nebraska?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rex Grossard was my junior college coach [at McCook Junior College; McCook Community College, McCook, Nebraska].  He took my word and then went after Freddie and got him into Nebraska, junior college.  Freddie, all--junior college All-American.  First year, second year.  I get choked up thinking about it 'cause, I mean, he died because, I mean, he was All-ACC, All-ACC.  First black quarterback.  Drafted fourth round by the Cleveland Browns, and the SOBs drafted him as a defensive back because they didn't have no brothers playing quarterback, or one or two maybe.  And Freddie was smooth, pretty boy, didn't--wasn't about trying to get hit.  You know what I mean, he'd avoid contact.  I'd try to tear your head off, he'd avoid contact.  But the boy could play, you know.  And his records prove it.  He ended up not getting--he wasn't a defensive back.  He was with Cleveland--I forgot how many, just a couple of years and ended up going to Canada.  As a defensive back, he broke his neck up there and it caused him a lot of problems and it sort of ended his career.  And caused him a lot of problems, you know, off the field.  I mean, I'll never forget, I'll never forget that.  And there were a lot of brothers along the way that were put into slots, you know, because that was all that is available.
Speaker 1: So is it safe to say that history would be a lot different in the NFL [National Football League] now if people had been given the chances that you see.  It'd be a different game (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ah, heck yeah.  I mean, you look--now, they're raving about, you know, Lovie Smith, Herman Edwards.  I'm--I can't even--which is a great thing.  I can't--I couldn't tell you how many African American coaches there are in the National Football League or the National Basketball Association [NBA] or--I don't know if there's any--Dusty Baker, I mean, a few in Major League Baseball [MLB].  None of that existed, you know, back then.
Speaker 1: Alou and those guys, yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly, so there was, there was slots.  I mean when I was--I should've been a safety, it would've been the perfect position for me 'cause I had good speed, I could jump, I loved to punish people.  But you didn't have free--you could probably count the free safeties, if at all, in the National Football League on one hand.  Because white boys--they put--this is what they do and I go on camera saying this.  Back during that time, if you had wide receivers like Bob Hayes, you know, that were on the outside, they wouldn't put white cats on them to cover 'em, 'cause they'd get eaten alive.  Now is that a racist comment?  No.  Were there white boys that probably as fast, not as fast as Bob Hayes but, yeah, there were white cornerbacks.  But for the most part as the game changed, the demographics of the game changed.  So, now the free safety got different responsibilities.  You don't have to be as fast, you don't have to be a lot of things.  So linebackers, I mean, they didn't have that many black outside linebackers, you know, so as we got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you're saying as the game--as the talent changed the game changed.
Speaker 2: As the talent changed, the game changed.
Story_ID: 466649
Speaker 1: It's the same thing like in basketball now, where it's no longer as center-oriented, basketball players, as it used to be back in the day when the centers were highly important individuals.
Speaker 2: No question about it.
Speaker 1: Guards and forwards are what is important now, the game is a totally different game.
Speaker 2: That's it, you know.  And I heard--I was actually laughing.  One of the sports shows I was just listening to the other day, they were talking about Tyler Hansbrough, who was the starting, star player for the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  Which I don't--I'll go on camera saying I don't like to talk about the Tar Heels 'cause they ain't the Demon Deacons [Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and everybody knows the ACC [Atlantic Coast Conference] would understand that.  Now, I give them all props but Hansbrough and Kevin Love from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], there's this conversation about these great, white college players will they be ready for the next level because they might not be athletic enough.  And I'm going, come on, man, you know, it was legitimate conversation, you know, about race but I thought, you know, these guys are good athletes.  So they don't have to--they don't compare Hansbrough with Dave Cowens or--you know, it's just--but that's how society and the media in particular, which is my--which is what I'm doing now as a media consultant with my books and all that other stuff.  I've seen how we see it in sports, we see it in the political races now.  I mean, race has become, you know, such a phenomenal and integral part of our society, and then a lot of things are just starting--being started to being talked about now in 2008 at center stage, and it's been going on for years and years and years.  Now it's starting to get into center stage so to speak.
Story_ID: 466650
Speaker 1: So, now you get drafted by Dallas [Dallas Cowboys] in what position?
Speaker 2: Linebacker.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you go to Dallas, tell us about that experience?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was an interesting experience, not necessarily positive.  Which is something I don't even want--let me just say this.  I--Dallas was a great team, it was an honor for me to go.  I was excited because they had a very tough reputation.  Gil Brandt was the--this hall of fame, one of the great minds of--in terms of recruiting and drafting and all of putting teams together.  And it was an honor for me to go.  And my training camp, I mean, all my--all of it was positive for me but at the same time what sticks out with me, and it shows you a lot, 'cause I've got an interesting quote in my book about Tom Landry.  And he's renowned for it's either his way or the highway.  Not you got to understand, I'm coming from Boston, Massachusetts, having gone to Nebraska to North Carolina to Texas.
Speaker 1: So you're playing under Tom Landry?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Then it wasn't that long.  Now, I come in what--part of--some of my time in training camp I can remember one particular meeting, I'm sitting beside Pete Gent [Peter Gent].  Pete Gent, 'North Dallas Forty,' renowned author, et cetera, et cetera, turned into a movie, all that stuff.  Pete's sitting right here, I got a dashiki on, big afro and--
Speaker 1: Is this in the club room or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I forgot what it was, team meeting or something like that.  Linebacker, 'cause the linebackers and the ends--I forgot exactly--I know he was there, I just don't remember what else was happening.  He said to me, "You know, Tom ain't gonna like that, you need to--what is that?"  And it was really condescending.
Speaker 1: Your outfit?
Speaker 2: What I had on.  And I had--I can remember it was burgundy with a yellow, mustard colored belt, with a mustard colored border.  It was a dashiki.  And I had just, you know, I'd come from Wake Forest [Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  I mean, I'd purchased this shirt from some women, you know, the civil rights era, and people were becoming Afrocentric all of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had your fro on.
Speaker 2: Oh, man, and, I mean, they talk about Hollywood Henderson [Thomas Henderson], I was crazy, you know what I mean.  I knew I came to play and I'm making the team and that, end of story.  When he said that to me, it was an insult to me.  I said, "I don't care about what he thinks, I don't care about what you think."  Hey, I didn't like him, I tried to whip his ass every time I could as an end 'cause I'm a linebacker.  But he took--we're about sports.  It should all, it should just been about sports.  He's now messing with my, with my--
Speaker 1: Your whole racial consciousness (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, with who I was as a man.  So, I didn't fit in with the Cowboys so I ended--that's why I ended up leaving, got released, went to Oklahoma.  You know, the farm, what they call their farm team there.
Speaker 1: Farm team for the Cowboys?
Speaker 2: Cowboys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Played there a season, did pretty well, and went back--I don't know if I went back home, or went back to New York.  I just forgot exactly where I went.  No, sorry, excuse me, no when the season was over I went back to Wake Forest (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot--okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 466651
Speaker 1: I was contacted--from a football standpoint, I was contacted by Lloyd Wells [Lloyd C.A. Wells], who was the scout for the Kansas City Chiefs.  And I was really excited because, I mean, they were a class act.  And to go to get the chance to play for Hank Stram--and Hank Stram and Tom Landry were like night and day in terms of human relationships, you know, from my experience.  Like, I didn't sit down and have lunch or dinner with Tom Landry, I wasn't on that level.  But I sat down and ate, you know, watermelon and kicked it with Hank Stram, I know he was real.
Speaker 2: And this would be important because as a leader of the team, there should be interaction with the players you're saying (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, do you go to Kansas City?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I went and I ended up I got injured, I mean, I played, I ended up making the taxi squad, and I remember like it was yesterday calling my father [Overton's stepfather, Eugene Waterhouse] who didn't really know a whole lot about sports, and said, "Dad," I said, "I made the taxi squad."  Mike Garrett was my roommate from time to time and crazy Curley Culp played against him all the time, he was my nemesis.  And, I said, "This team's going to the Super Bowl."  I said, "But the kind of money they wanna pay me," I said, "I can't live off that."  In my mind--I'm the only child, I wanted to help my mother [Hessie Waterhouse] and father buy a house.
Speaker 2: So back in those days, the salaries were by no means what they are today.
Speaker 1: Oh, hell, you kidding me?
Speaker 2: I've heard that from several of our HistoryMakers.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, no way.
Speaker 2: There was normally a job attached with that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  So, in my mind, I'm trying to figure out how am I gonna stay 'cause I'm not gonna get my full salary.  I didn't really know; I didn't really know how it was going to work.  And I remember Hank saying to me, 'cause I mean, I was compared--I played behind Lanier [Willie Lanier] during training camp.  Lanier will go down as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, middle linebacker in the National Football League [NFL].  Now, imagine I got an article that was written on me about comparing me to Lanier when he was a rookie.  I've never said this on camera, most people don't even know this.  And--'cause I was like 230 pounds then but I was still, for all intents and purposes, a rookie.  And so when I found out what the money that was available that I was gonna get paid, it was like an insult to me.  But not really because coming from Hank it was different.  So I called my father and he's--I'm like seeking his counsel.  He doesn't know what to say.  And I said to him, I said, "Coach Stram said he understands my--the situation.  He said, think about it, he said, but at the same time, there's a team that's interested in you right now in Canada.  Their season started, you can go start there and get paid now."  Shoot!  I was gone.  But, I mean, the bottom line was I'm going--okay, I can help my mother and father with some money--
Story_ID: 466652
Speaker 1: So you talked to your father [Overton's stepfather, Eugene Waterhouse] about the deal that was pending with Kansas City [Kansas City Chiefs].  And the coach made you--another decision for you or helped you make another decision.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Stram [Hank Stram] basically, you know, presented it as an option, let it be my choice, and I made the choice thinking about nothing other than my mother [Hessie Waterhouse] and father.
Speaker 1: Helping them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, and, I mean--but the funny thing is and you got to know, and this is why, I mean, when I look back in retrospect--and that's why I sort of divorced myself, after I left the Canadian Football League [CFL], I divorced myself from sports, from football in particular.  'Cause I said to my dad, "I know they're going to the Super Bowl."  Had I stayed, I'd have had a Super Bowl ring right now.  Right now.
Speaker 1: That year they went?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely. You know, and--I mean, it's interesting, you know, just to be able to witness that and see that, and know that I was--that I saw that far ahead.
Speaker 1: What team did you play for?  Now, was this the CFL?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Canadian--I played for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for one--half the season or however many games it was, you know, which was a complete fiasco in comparison to being exposed to the Cowboys [Dallas Cowboys], being exposed to the Chiefs, National Football League [NFL] and then going to the Canadian Football League.
Speaker 1: Explain the difference, please?
Speaker 2: Well, as a linebacker, you know, and keep in mind I didn't play linebacker in college, so going to the Canadian Football League they send everybody and their mother in motion.  That confused the heck out of me, you know, when I first got there.  So I had to learn that game and I just--I found that there weren't a lot of blacks on the team, I found, I mean, the coach who had just come--matter of fact, Restic, Joe Restic, came from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] who was the coach there, I didn't particularly like him, very condescending, very arrogant.  And of course, now keep in mind, the season has started, you know, so I missed the Canadian training camp.  They have to take time, even though I come in, you know, as a heralded player what have you.  I mean--
Speaker 1: You had to learn the playbook and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, man, you know, so it was--and it wasn't as smooth transition.  And I didn't like it, you know.  And I'm really the kind of person where it's like in everything that I've done--and I don't think I'm any different than anybody else, you know.  You drive a certain kind of car and then you're forced by life's circumstances to drive another kind of car, it's an adjustment.  You live in one neighborhood, you know, and you're forced because of life's adjustments to have to live in another neighborhood, you don't particularly like it because you've been here.  You know, you're here and then you gotta deal with here.  National Football League is here, Canadian Football League is here, so, and--but you can't--you're a player, I can't say, well, how come the locker room ain't like this or how come it's not--you know, you hear people talk about, I mean, baseball players that have to go back down to the farm team when they're coming back from the injuries and things like that, travel on a bus, you know.  I remember when Michael Jordan, you know, talked about that when he wanted to play baseball, coming, you know, out of--stepping out of the National Basketball Association [NBA].  It's a big--naw, he had his own bus (laughter) but it was different.  You know, I saw all of those things and I didn't particularly like it.  And, and the manifestation of all of it, the culmination of all of it was here I am now being treated like a piece of meat, and that's what did it for me.  'Cause it wasn't--I had never not started in a game.  I have never, on the field, I had never--I don't get beat, I never get--that wasn't in my DNA.  I fight, I prepare harder than everybody else, I mean, all of that.  And it didn't matter if we were talking all-pros, in Cowboys, the Chiefs or whatever, that's what I did.  So here I am now.  How dare you say to me as a coach, "Well, you came up here to play, don't ask questions."  That's like me being raised, you know, speaking English and I go to Beijing [China], you know, and I can't ask questions about how to speak Chinese, what the--come on.  So, again, it was--but it was about power, control, you're just a number.  And it was like, bing, guess what Bill [HistoryMaker Bill Overton]?  And that spoiled everything in my--but that's because, again, that's my--sports is all I know now, all I wanted to do.  I--when that door--when that closed, in my head it was over.
Story_ID: 466653
Speaker 1: Were you the one that--you decided, decided to be through with it or was it a release, what happened exactly (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I got--I actually got traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders and I just said, I'm not going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm out of here.
Speaker 1: And was, was the money a big difference as far as how much money was available to you in the CFL [Canadian Football League] than it would have been in the NFL [National Football League] at that time?  Was there a marked difference in the amounts?  Was that part of the lure to go?
Speaker 2: Well, the lure to go for me was that, keep in mind, taxi squad, I wasn't getting a full salary, versus getting a full salary in Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was the full salary.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm going, yeah.  So, I mean, there was nothing to think about.  However, had I had an older brother or someone to say, you know what, didn't you say they--you think they're going to the Super Bowl?  You think they're having a winning season, blah, blah.  Well, you know, if you stay in the taxi squad, well, maybe if somebody gets injured, maybe this'll happen and maybe you'll get.  You know, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe you ought to stay.  You know, how many years--more years is Bobby Bell gonna play on the outside?  You playing in the middle, right?  Behind Willie [Willie Lanier], right?  Well, okay, but you, you backing up outside as well.  Yeah, I mean, something.  If I had had these conversations with somebody, 'cause, I mean, Stram [Hank Stram] didn't say it.  But, I mean, he wanted me to stay but, you know.
Speaker 1: And your parents [Hessie Waterhouse and Overton's stepfather, Eugene Waterhouse] weren't athletically to understand it.  They just--they were proud of you, but they didn't really know how to direct it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not a clue.  Not a clue, you know.  And I didn't trust my college coaches, I mean, I could have--I mean, I just, you know, it was (snaps fingers), it happened like that.
Speaker 1: So, is it safe to say that mentorship is very important?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean, I try to help, I'll do whatever I can for young student athletes now.  Yeah, no question about it.  'Cause they need to know.
Speaker 1: So you decide that you're not gonna go to Saskatchewan, and then what do you do now?
Speaker 2: I went--oh boy, I went back to Boston [Massachusetts]--I went back to New York [New York] because my agents had worked that deal out, with the Chiefs [Kansas City Chiefs]--I went to New York and I started working for a company called Pro Sports, Incorporated.
Story_ID: 466654
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what did you do there?
Speaker 1: --and basically I recruited athletes who were about to enter the pros.  And so I traveled--it was two lawyers that were considered the best in the country at representing talent.  So, I traveled the East Coast primarily, the historically black colleges [HBCUs] and--
Speaker 2: So you were a scout so to speak?
Speaker 1: I was a--well, I was an agent--not really a scout.  I was basically a recruiter so, for example, like my first draft choice that I signed, who I was real proud of, was Raymond Chester.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Number one draft choice, Oakland Raiders.  I mean, I would literally go in, sometimes under the cover of darkness, you know, and sit down with guys like--and try to explain to them that, you know, having good representation is as significant as getting the opportunity to play.  Because your contract is, you know, you can have a great year but if your contract is lousy, I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: So you were selling the firm?
Speaker 1: I'm selling the firm, yeah, Pro Sports, Incorporated is who I represent.  Yeah, they represented Bubba Smith, you know.  And I was the liaison--I was the--I did really well in terms of recruiting athletes at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], Grambling [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], all the way to Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I went to a significant number of the African American colleges.
Speaker 2: So these athletes were already bound to be going somewhere?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were--they had been drafted or about to be, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were there to get them the right representation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: How long did you do that job?
Speaker 1: About--just about two years.  Yeah, and I got--and at the same time while I'm doing that, 'cause I'm living in New York [New York], and I'm modeling.  I had just, I mean, shed about twenty-five pounds, at that time thirty pounds.
Speaker 2: How did that come to be?  You just decided one day or was it--
Speaker 1: Actually I went in to the Ford model agency [Ford Modeling Agency; Ford Models].  I think I weighed 205 pounds, I had some photographs 'cause people were telling me, well, you know, you should be a model.  Man, you're--they say you're a good-looking guy.  I'm going, well, first of all, I thought models were--it's kind of effeminate for me.  And here I am the total sexist jock, all of that.  Didn't sound like something I wanted to do, but when it comes to making money.  And then I got a little bit of exposure to it.  And I went and talked to the people at the agency, they kind of laughed at me, said, well, you know, you're kind of big, what do you think you gonna model?
Speaker 2: How much, how much did you weigh then?
Speaker 1: I weighed probably when I first went to the Ford agency, I think I was 215.  I dropped maybe fifteen pounds then.  And then, and they looked at my pictures and it was kind of like, (makes sound), and that made me mad.  'Cause here I am, now I'm looking at the pictures and I'm going, well, you look pretty fly in that suit, right?  But, I mean, I had big neck, arm, you know, so it wasn't gonna work.  So I went back and took off some more weight, then went back to New York.  I mean, I'm living in New York but, I mean, I got professional photographers because I'm now dealing with advertising agencies because of what Pro Sports did.  You know, I learned and I'm looking for, you know, opportunities to do stuff on the side, whatever I could.  And I'm, you know, studying at the Lee Strasberg Institute [Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, New York, New York] as an actor.  I'm doing everything I can when I'm not on the road.
Speaker 2: So you decided to use what I guess it was Mr. Shirley [Franklin R. Shirley]--to start using your communication skills in addition to what you were doing, cause it was basically a sales job also, what you were doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, absolutely.  Everything I was doing was selling.  I'm either selling the firm or I'm selling me, or to, you know, to an agent or to, I mean, or to an advertising agency or to a director for a movie, or play, or what have you.  So that's really what I was doing 24/7.
Story_ID: 466655
Speaker 1: And you're in the mecca of acting and communications in New York [New York] there.
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're doing things on the side.  So, continue please, describe what goes on from there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I started out at the Black Beauty model agency, and I got really lucky and was doing a lot of, you know.  I did some, some significant ads, you know, that were at that time, I mean, was--I got lucky, you know, I mean, like some major ads for Benson and Hedges, and Johnnie Walker Red.  I mean, like national ads that you wouldn't necessarily--you would see them now in New Yorker magazine [The New Yorker] or Playboy magazine, or U.S. News and World Report.  Some of the ads I did--some of them were the first where they started to allow African American models endorsing products to be used in, quote, mainstream publications.  So that was interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they were trying to appeal to a broader market with the product to possibly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: The rising black middle class or whatever?
Speaker 2: Whatever.  Yeah, I mean, you know, and Richard Roundtree, you know, I came right after him and he had some successes, you know, in--as a model as well.  And then he, when 'Shaft' took off, he was gone.  You know, and so--and, and I left the Black Beauty model agency similar to why I left the Kansas City Chiefs 'cause the money was funny.  And so, I had a chance to go to the Ford agency [Ford Modeling Agency; Ford Models] and--which was the best model agency in the country at that time, so I was told.  And the reason I got there was because when I would do jobs for J.C. Penney's [JCPenney] or Montgomery Wards [sic. Montgomery Ward], or Sears and Roebucks [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] and stuff like that.  And a lot of that was, you know, brand new opportunities for young, you know, African American models.  They said to me, you need to--the women at the catalog houses said, you would work a lot if you were with the Ford agency.
Speaker 1: So, you had been there before already and when to them and they, and they kind of snuffed you away, right?  So now you're going back to them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  And it was--and so what I did was I went to the Ford agency and said, "You know, I'm doing-I'm working for Sears, I'm working for J.C. Penney's, I'm working for Montgomery Wards, I'm working for Hanes underwear, you know.  And what happened with them was they sensed, well, here's a guy--and, of course, they got people that they talk to, they talk to the bookers and the other folk that handle--the clothes fitters and all that stuff.
Speaker 1: So in modeling there's all kinds of extra people there.  There's bookers as you said, there's a stylist and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, all of that.  Yeah, the stylist, that's who I was--the word I was struggling for.
Speaker 1: Right, so they're all there so there, there's a cadre of people that you have to get to before you actually do it.
Speaker 2: And I was, you know, I'm proud to say I was a nice guy that got along with people.  So they were looking out for me.  So, if a client says, "Well, hey, here's a--this guy, we like the way our clothes fit on him."  So, you know, the word trickles down and--but the bottom line was, and it's really sad but it shows you what happens in the world of representation whether it's sports, modeling, acting or what have you.  If you are represented by certain agencies, you get access to certain work.  And if you're not, you don't.  That's why in a lot of instances--and the money is predicated on that as well.  That's why when I'm recruiting athletes in the South, you know, a lot of times--I hate to say this.  Unfortunately, the black coaches were representing some of the black athletes, and the teams weren't giving the athletes the kind of deals they should have got 'cause the coaches were in the mix, you know.  So when some of the white, big time phenoms came along like Bubba Smith, they got serious money compared to the guys coming out of historical black colleges [HBCUs].  It's a--I mean it's really sad but it's the economics, which we can't get into all of that, but, I mean, that's kind of what happened with me.  So, when I found out that I could make--where I could work consistently as a model at the Ford agency, I was gone.  You know, and I got really lucky.  And I made money, saved my money, and you know, just all kinds of good things happened.  But I'm also pursuing, you know, the acting thing, then I'm now bicoastal because I got lucky and I got a television series and now I'm going, living in--I moved from--I spent half the time, year in New York and half the year in California--
Story_ID: 466656
Speaker 1: Now let's back up one moment.  Now the acting aspiration, had you ever done any plays or anything?  What were you doing to say, okay--to be even available for this television series?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd been doing plays in New York [New York], off-Broadway plays.  I mean--
Speaker 1: What school were you going to?  You said you were attending--
Speaker 2: I went to the Lee Strasberg Institute [Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, New York, New York], and then just before I moved to California I got lucky and I--you had to audition, I got admitted into The Actors Studio [New York, New York], which is, I mean, the ultimate.  You know, and I danced around the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC] for a minute but never really got involved, wanted to.  But I got a chance to work at The Actors Studio.  To me that's like the Ford agency [Ford Modeling Agency; Ford Models], or that's like, you know, and keep in mind, my background, you know, even today.  I don't like to be categorized.
Speaker 1: So do you think that possibly one thing or the interweaving of different talents is the way this thing really works for successfully for people.  Like, for instance, you were a--first started out as an athlete and moved into a sales--a professional then a sales position, which moved into the acting, which moves into--I mean the modeling, excuse me, then moves into acting.  Is the way you think things really--is this the usual formula for success?  I mean, we look at Paul Robeson, he also did many things also.
Speaker 2: Well, the, the only thing--the only way I can give you a comparison is, when I came to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], and I got lucky when I got out here.  I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: Explain that move for us, and when that occurred, and how that occurred?
Speaker 2: I would say early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, I mean, Jim Brown was a big star, had just come out of football, doing well.  Fred Williamson, big star.  My--[HistoryMaker] Bill Overton, my ego was, you know, I am a stage-trained actor.  I don't wanna be perceived as a football player wannabe.  So I avoided the stuff that they had to deal with.  But what's really crazy is that most of the roles I got cast in I was an athlete (laughter), which was really interesting.  Now, the first series I did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So now you're saying that basically, basically you shut down even talking about football or even bringing that into the mix.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely.  But they--because I didn't want, now keep in mind, I've--in studying the business if you were a New York actor, you know, there was a certain, you know, cache that went along with that, so I didn't--I never talked about sports.  I mean, I might look like an athlete but I, you know, I don't--it's real hard to get me to talk about sports.  What I'm doing today I just--I don't do.  You know, because, and again, the perception.  I didn't want people categorizing me, you know, in anything.  You know, so I avoided a lot of that stuff and then, you know, once I got lucky and, you know, started to work as an actor I--then I stopped.  And I found out--I can remember it like it was yesterday, Joey Hunter, who is a--who I called--I mean, a great guy and a good friend.  I don't see him as much as I like.  He was the head of the Ford model agency, and he said, "Bill, you're only gonna make X in this business no matter how well you do 'cause there's only a certain amount of money available for someone in your category."  When he told me that, I took my portfo- I went home, took my portfolio in the closet.  I never took it out again.
Speaker 1: So you have an ability to see the handwriting on the wall and shut it down?
Speaker 2: No question about it, you know.  And because we have to understand--and quite honestly I did the same thing as an actor, which, I mean, I'm not--said too much on.  I mean, I prefer, you know, I mean, I've worked on stage with Denzel [Denzel Washington].  I mean, I've worked with some very renowned people.  And I--but I remember clearly my most significant agent I had, who is one of the powers in the entertainment industry right now, his name is Rick Nicita.  He represents Al Pacino and a host of others, he's a founding member of CAA [Creative Artists Agency], which is the most--one of the most powerful agencies in the world.  He said, "Bill, you know, we can't create parts for you.  All we can do is try to help you and put you out there."  And, when he said that to me, I can remember like, you know what, they're not writing parts for young, black leading men like me.  So what are you gonna do?  You know, and I can remember--how many times did that go out where you're too light-skinned, you're too handsome for this, they want somebody street.  They don't know nothing about my history, you know.  But a white guy would look at me and say, well, you know, you, you're not this, you're not that.  I remember, I mean, auditioning for--I worked out for a week with, with Stallone [Sylvester Stallone] for 'Rocky.'  My agent at the William Morris Agency [William Morris Endeavor], he represented me.  I mean, I'm in the ring doing all this stuff with the trainer, the whole number.  The director [John G. Avildsen] comes back into town, says, "No, he--we want something, he doesn't look," he's too this, he's too that.
Story_ID: 466657
Speaker 1: So, let's back up for a moment.  Your first role, that role that you get--
Speaker 2: As an actor?
Speaker 1: As an actor, yes.  Your first significant role that you consider significant, you mentioned this television series?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I did a--I think I did a movie.  I don't remember my first, I think the first movie of the week I did was call 'Footsteps,' where I was a football player with Clu Gulager and Joanna Pettet.  And it was a Paul Wendkos--
Speaker 1: Richard Crenna?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, right, right, of course.  Richard was the star, big time star, great guy, loved him.  And that was--I mean, a really--a great opportunity for me.  William Morris [William Morris Agency; William Morris Endeavor] was--became very excited about my career, et cetera and, you know, I mean, we got some nice nominations and whatever.  I mean, it was--I was lucky in that regard.  I'd forgot about that.
Speaker 1: So, so you started in this--so now that was the entree into the business?
Speaker 2: Well, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], 'cause I had done commercials and national stuff in New York [New York] but L.A. it was the first.
Speaker 1: So, once that happens what do you decide, once you get this movie role?  Do you continue to be bicoastal?  What do you do for a while?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah 'cause to me it was about the money.  You know what I mean, 'cause I'd be bugging my agents, you know.  I mean, what's up?  You know.  I'm ready to do this, ready to do that.  I'm, you know, I'm ready now.  I'm ready.
Speaker 1: Now, to come forward, you know, you have a very extensive resume but you mention the fact that the agent [Rick Nicita] told you he couldn't create parts for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was an eye-opening for you.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, do you think that sometimes--now, today you'll hear things about somebody, you know, the thug looks.  And you'll hear them complaining about all I get cast is as a thug.  Then, now, you're saying the opposite that you never could really be the thug.
Speaker 2: Oh, I--man, I'd love to be a thug today.
Speaker 1: But they wouldn't let you be the thug?
Speaker 2: They would not let me be, you know, would not let me be.  I sure enough wanna be gangsta, you know what I mean?  They let--if Denzel [Denzel Washington] could be 'American Gangster,' you know what I mean?  I mean, I'm--I love Denzel.  Okay.  I mean, I didn't wanna be 'The Mack,' you know.  Ron O'Neal was tremendous.  I mean, I was too young then, you know, but they weren't giving the kind of parts that were available for--my contemporaries I guess would be like a Carl Franklin who got into a series and did well.  Philip Michael Thomas, who I loved, but, I mean, there were--Richard Lawson who was an amazing actor.  They just--I mean, for my era, they just--there were--parts were few and far between for black leading men (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because this was in the middle of the black exploitation [blaxploitation] era.  These movies are coming out.  'The Mack,' 'Super Fly,' things like 'Willie Dynamite' and just--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah, all of, all of them, all of them, 'Blacula.'  I mean, all--and so the older guys, Raymond St. Jacques, I mean, all of these guys that were, you know, ten, fifteen years older than me they're getting the leading roles.  So, I'm either gonna be their son or their--or whatever.  So what I got--when I got--like 'Backstairs at the White House' was a major opportunity for me to be in that.  Okay, what a six-hour, nine-hour miniseries was huge in terms of making money, but also doing something credible and historical, all of that.  But the honest to goodness truth was they were--the parts were, were not as consistent as I would have liked, as I would have thought.  And it let me know, again, that you need to do something else, you know, because I wanted to get--I was gonna get married one day.  I wanted--I loved kids, I was--I knew I was gonna have a big family 'cause I didn't have brothers and sisters.  I said, "I'm gonna fill the world up."  And, so it was about getting paid.  And I--so I didn't--and keep in mind, I think I said earlier about me abstaining from things that were too titillating or would get me into trouble.  So I just--I was careful, you know.  And to work as hard as I did, you know, and then find out again that I was gonna--and then having to come out of the experience that I went to--you know, going to white schools, coming, surviving, coming out of all that, working for a prestigious white law firm sports agency [Pro Sports, Incorporated] in New York.  Then I come to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and I'm gonna get cast now all of a sudden, you know, now I, now I got issues with--they're telling me I'm this, I'm too that, and blah, blah.  And I can't work in movies that are primarily black 'cause they don't have the kind of roles for, for me.  But, now, white folk who are comfortable around a brother that they think is halfway articulate then I get cast for that.  It was like a--lot of times an insult to me.  You know, I'd go out, you know, like a scene in 'Crash,' and I'd go out and recopy that somebody wrote, and I'm looking at--we don't talk like that.  You know, and the, and the part for me was, I mean, I wasn't a jerk but it really bothered me.  And I realized, I mean, and I wanna say probably ten years in, that I can't become an angry black man so I got to get away.  You know, so then I started, you know, I mean, the money I made I started investing in real estate and doing all kinds of stuff separate and apart.  Because until I could come back in the industry with some power and some control of my own destiny, I wasn't gonna let them screw up, you know, my creativity.
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard you mention, mention this--it's almost a theme that runs through is the perception of a white America to--you said they kind of hand-selected for athletes, then once we get into the acting thing, there's a perception of what you can do basically.  So, so these things that--do you think that a lot of our opportunities are basically, be they in music, art, whatever, are based upon white perception of what skin color, or shade of our skin might be?
Speaker 2: All the way to Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], is the poster child of--I love Barack, you know.  Name a dark-skinned African American that has soared and has remained, and is a vital part of the American fabric that is respected in this country that--and has some power that they have not killed.  Name one.

Speaker 1: So you're just about ten years in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you did--and in various roles.  I don't--you know, we could enumerate.  You had roles in--Slick in 'Grambling's White Tiger,' you know, Dave Myers in 'Riptide,' you know, all kinds of stuff.  Then in 1985, after you've gone through, you've done several, several different things, there's an opportunity you've really toed the line when it comes to the dating thing and being all of that.  So something happens in 1985, you meet a lady.  Or did you know her beforehand, Miss Kennedy [Jayne Kennedy]?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) I didn't know where you were going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Excuse me (cough).  Yeah, I met--I was married to Kathleen Bradley, great lady, mother of my first daughter.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And, what year did you marry her?
Speaker 2: Early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Kathleen's from Ohio, Jayne is from Ohio.
Speaker 1: Is Kathleen one of the Barker (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was on the Barker's Beauties.
Speaker 1: 'Price Is Right' ['The Price Is Right']
Speaker 2: 'Price Is Right' for ten years.  Yeah, great, great lady.
Speaker 1: Was she the first?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, everyone knows who that is.  She was the first African American model--she was there with--I forget all of their names, but I do remember when she came on, she was one of the first ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Kathy's fine as new money.  Still should be making money, that's a whole--I'm so mad--the industry, again, she was--Kathy, today, I tell her--I try to help her do some other stuff.  And she's great family, great marriage she's in.  She's never been utilized in the entertainment industry like she should have, you know.  And what's really difficult for me and sad for me, and that's why a lot of times I don't really talk--and for Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson] to trick me into coming and to do this, man, let me tell you.  It's hard to get me to--because, you know, I been around three sensational, devastating, beautiful sisters in my professional career.  Julie Woodson, which you don't even--I don't even see anything about--one of the top models in the early '70s [1970s], you know, pre- along with Beverly Johnson, first--I think one of the first or second in Playboy.  I mean, just out--scary fine.  I mean, just did all great--never you-- he did okay.  But she was not allowed to do, you know, what the Lauren Huttons [Lauren Hutton] or the Maud Adamses [Maud Adams] or Rene Russos [Rene Russo] or some of these other girls did because of the times.  Like Grace Jones, who I love.  Grace, I mean, had a hard--she couldn't get arrested in New York, man.  You know, and that--see that used to aggravate me 'cause I was always out there fighting not only for black people but for sisters in particular, because I--just, just because, you know.  So, like Kathleen, I tricked Kathy into leaving The Love Machine, it was her singing group that she was in, she was the lead singer, to come to stay home 'cause I was crazy about her, you know.  But I thought that America--that she was, if you see--she's beautiful.  So, if that--I'm around, I'm used to working with all these beautiful white women, why not use a sister, okay, that looks like she looks.  So, I remember Nina Blanchard saying, you know, we can't--there's no market for her in Hollywood.  I was shocked.  I was absolutely shocked.
Story_ID: 466659
Speaker 1: As we go forward in a minute to some of your interests, your love interests, I wanna go back a minute to who were some of the people that were around at the same time when you were being bicoastal, going back and forth when you were in the modeling and acting business early?  Who were some of the people that we might know who were your peers and, you know, coworkers at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, from a--and from a modeling standpoint Beverly Johnson was very successful at that time.  As was my girlfriend, Julie Woodson.  Renauld White for a male was very successful, African American male, still doing well.  From an actor's standpoint--and then the white contemporaries, I mean, Maud Adams, Lauren Hutton, Rene Russo was just blossoming I believe.  I worked with Rene a couple of times.  From an acting standpoint, I'm not--'cause I don't really--the question kind of threw me a little bit 'cause I was going back and forth.  I don't really know who was--there was really no star, there was no acting stars, I mean, you know.  When I got--I mean, I was probably 23, 24 or 25, I got really lucky with the series and some of the shows that I did.  So it wasn't like--I was a working actor but I wasn't, quote, a star, so I mean, guys like would fear when I walked, walked in the room.  Nor was I getting, you know, I mean, limousines coming to pick me up and take me here and there either.  It was a different time.  And then, keep in mind, for me I was sort of like a migrant worker, you know, I'm chasing--I'm following the seasons.  You know, so a lot of times people were envious of me because I lived in two places, you know.  And 'cause I wasn't about just being out, out when you're not working as an actor, going out to play tennis in Santa Monica [California], I mean, that's--and Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  That wasn't what I--I wasn't into that, you know, and like I say, if I'm not getting paid then I'm not a professional.  So let me get out of here.  I'd go back to New York [New York] and my apartment, you know, and I'd go to work, you know.  And, 'cause, you know, I was investing in real estate and doing all kinds of stuff like that.  So, I don't really know--I'm answering part of your question but some of it I don't know.  And I don't wanna slight some of the other people that--I got lucky.  Some of the other people didn't, and it wasn't because I was better than or whatever it was just the industry was smaller and, you know, the times were different.  The industry's bigger now.  I mean had I--who knows if what would have happened if I had continued to stay and work and work and work and work as an actor?  Would I be in an insane asylum?  'Cause I know some guys that have flipped all the way out, their lives were ruined creatively.  But, you know, Denzel [Denzel Washington] is continuing to soar, you know, but a lot of guys--I mean, I can't--Dennis Haysbert, who I love, is a talent.  He's doing really well.  But I wonder for every one--now, people say, well, you know, I mean, it's, it's tough, you got to stick with it, you got to do this, you got to do that.  I know so many marginal, mediocre, less than talented white actors, male and female, that are living real well.  Made a lot of money in all aspects of the entertainment business and sports business.  And on the--they're on the radio doing different stuff right now.  You--if you're an African American, I don't know too many people that are marginal in talent that are making a living which is, which kind of says a lot.  I've not really said that but I--when I've felt it, you know, but, I mean, I believe that to my heart.  'Cause I remember as a kid they said, you can't be as good as, you got to be better than.  You've probably heard that along the way too (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 466660
Speaker 1: How easy was it to get the proper representation that you needed?  Because, obviously, you said that it has a lot to do with the agencies and things of that nature.  How easy was it to get signed onto these people who could really get you to the next level?
Speaker 2: Well, a friend of mine in New York [New York] was the one that introduced--he knew somebody, Chuck Jones, good friend.  He's the one that introduced me to Rick Nicita at the William Morris Agency [William Morris Endeavor], you know, and that was my first big agent.  You know, Rick was in New York--now, Rick Nicita, he's a partner at CAA [Creative Artists Agency], his wife is Paula Wagner, who is--Paula Wagner is Tom Cruise's partner.  I mean, they are as big as it gets in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  And I have seen other people that I--Ron Meyer [Ronald Meyer] was my agent at the William Morris Agency.  Ron is the COO [chief operating officer] of Universal Pictures.  So I've seen certain folk, you know, on the other side of the tracks just take off at, at, at many different levels, you know.  And again, for me you got to--when I look at like from Wake Forest [Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] days, Lanny Wadkins became a huge, internationally renowned golfer, Curtis Strange, Ryder Cup, you know, captain.  Took off, you know, Arnold Palmer was my fraternity brother, you know.  And I've seen, having gone to Wake Forest, you know, you see the best of the best, and you see their--different people's careers take off.  Now, when they saw me, you know, see me on TV or see me in a magazine, they go, "Ah, man, Bill O [HistoryMaker Bill Overton]," O, they'd call me.  "O, you killing 'em."  Yeah, and I got lucky in a lot, in a lot of areas.  Yet and still there were opportunities that were available that--or should've been available that weren't.  I've never been the kind of guy to hang my head down.  I don't have a, you know, bad attitude.  Like I said, I didn't wanna become an angry black man, so I get to a wall sometimes, I mean, as a football player, I mean, I'll go through that sucker, but--and you know, when you become a husband or a father, you know, you just got to figure out another way, you know.  And so, I'm still looking (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you married, you married Kathy [Kathleen Bradley]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Do I have to?
Speaker 1: Not totally.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Kathy is a great lady.  Kathy, great lady, and we have one child, Cheyenne [Cheyenne Overton], who is--that's my baby girl.  Numero uno.  And, who's now a mother in her own right.  And, so we didn't--we were together longer before we were married, you know.  And, make a long story short, she has moved on, and great husband, Terrence [Terrence Redd].  She's got a son, Terrence, Jr. [Terrence Redd, Jr.].  She's a great mom, she's the ultimate daughter, you know.  'Cause her mom has had some very difficult times.  And she taught me a lot about what a human being should do, what a child should do for their parents.  And I will love her to the day they put me in the ground.  Just based on what I saw her--what I see her do with her mom.  And she still--
Speaker 1: Is she still here in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: She's still in Los Angeles and, you know, trying to do a book deal and trying to do some other things.  And she's become--she was more renowned as being Ms. Parker in the movie 'Friday' than she was for being a Barker Beauty [Barker's Beauties].  And, again, she--to me she was--and I tell her and I'll say it on camera, she's like Mary Tyler Moore.  She was funny.  You know, raised with four crazy brothers.  You know, talk--one minute she'd talk like a lady, next minute she'd talk like a truck driver.  And the industry, because they didn't know what to do with her, they didn't take full advantage of what she could have done, should have done.  Jayne [Jayne Kennedy], my present wife, same situation.  Who was--and Kathy and Jayne knew each other.  I knew Leon [Leon Isaac Kennedy] and Jayne reasonably well as a couple before, when Kathy and I were married.  And they ended up going their separate ways.  Kathy and I ended up going our separate ways.  Jayne and I worked from time to time modeling covers of magazines and things of that sort.  I always liked her more from a sister perspective as opposed to an attraction because first of all she was married when I met her.  And I wasn't thinking about her in that regard.  I never saw her on television so I really didn't know what she was doing, I heard about her but I'm not--once, well I think I said when I stopped playing football, I never owned a television.  I don't watch TV.  Anybody that knows me, knows me well, they go, "Bill watch television?  You must be crazy.  He can't even turn this thing on."  I read as much as I can.
Story_ID: 466661
Speaker 1: I didn't get caught up in the whole thing of what Jayne [Jayne Kennedy] was about, but when I first--but I know when I first saw her like it was yesterday.  And she--I was--I just happened to be in a club, I was out here visiting from New York [New York].  And she and her sister walked in the club, and I saw them come in the door and I followed them all the way around the room like, damn!  Who is that?  And I left.  I swear to you.  Because my mind was--I like, man, I liked what I saw and that's not why I came out here.  I left the club.
Speaker 2: You had this tendency to leave--Howard, Howard University [Washington, D.C.] (laughter) when you said to keep yourself off focus, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Man.  She--Jayne's scary, I mean, because see you got to understand.  If the models that I was used to working with, now what became the standard of beauty for me.  They were--most of them were tall and lanky.  Julie [Julie Woodson] was sort of voluptuous, that's why she ended up in Playboy, so that was the kind of--I liked women that were kind of big, physical, you know what I mean?  Just--
Speaker 2: Sturdy.
Speaker 1: Well, like they might have been my sister, as sick as that might sound.  So, if you look at Kathy [Kathleen Bradley]--and Kathy and Jayne look similar.  Both of them could maybe be my first cousins, maybe if you thought about it.  So when I saw a woman like--'cause Kathy weighed--she's 5'8 1/2", five--and almost 5'9".  I think Kathy weighed like 150 [pounds] when I met her, it was like--versus a model that I'm used to working with, might weigh 125.  I'm going, damn!  And Jayne, Jayne was 5'10" and big and voluptuous.  I'm going, ooh, boy.  So when I saw that I went, oh, no, no, no.  I got to go.  (Laughter) I don't want--no, I'm leaving.  And I don't think I saw her for maybe a year or two and ended up working with her.  You know, which is kind of funny.  But, I mean, and also when it comes to working, I would never say anything to models or actresses that I worked with over the years.  I've never done it.  You know, so therefore when I met her, I mean, when I worked with her doing jobs and stuff like that, I would never cross that line no matter what I might've thought, you know.  I can remember I did a book cover with Rene Russo, you know, and I was like a Mandingo or Mandinka--I can't remember which one--warrior.  So I'm on--and I mean on the front of a magazine, they had to put darker makeup on me.  I'm in New York, I'm buff, I'm ripped, right?  And Rene Russo's behind me butt naked, you know, with--they're using ice, hot ice to create steam and what.  I don't remember the theme of it but I remember that.  And I'm trying to figure if I could just be alien and turn my head all the way around, boy, but I--that's the, (laughter) that's about the closest I'd come.  But, you know, I just wouldn't do that.  There was a matter of professional courtesy.  You see all the stuff going on now with sexual harassment and all this other stuff.  I just--some things I would not do out of respect for women.
Speaker 2: What year did you meet or like start really seriously dating Jayne Kennedy?
Speaker 1: Ooh, I don't know the dates, man.  I mean, we've been married--
Speaker 2: Eighties [1980s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've been married twenty years so--
Speaker 2: Eighties [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Were you around when her little tabloid scare thing came out, when the tabloid--when the video and all that came out?
Speaker 1: I don't, you know, stuff like that I don't even deal, I don't even--I didn't deal with it then and I don't deal with it now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Jayne is the--and I have a--'cause I know Leon [Leon Isaac Kennedy] and like Leon a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I love my wife, okay.  She is the consummate woman, mother, all--daughter, I mean, you name it.  You know, things happen.  The media's crazy, that's part of my motivation for this book.  I mean, you never know what you're seeing, who did what, who did this.  And I know when I saw this stuff--things happening, I went--you know I just, I stayed away from it, you know, 'cause I know who I am.  I know who she is, end of story.
Speaker 2: And that's enough.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, her career 'cause she was doing a lot at that time too and, now, were things as tough for her because, because Jayne Kennedy would have been considered in my genre the modern day Halle Berry, the ultimate icon of a woman.  And now you've married her.  What was the buzz at that point, because you married in my time the Halle Berry?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you got to, you have to--for me personally, see, I didn't marry Jayne Kennedy 'cause, see, I'm a very private person and I liked her.  She was a friend, she was cool, you know, down to earth.  I could deal with her.  Philosophical, and Jayne is very private, low key, in spite of being glamorous and all the other stuff she's not really an outward-going person unless she has to do it professionally.  And so, you know, versus Kathy who's very out there, you know, very outgoing, et cetera.  Jayne could give a doggone if--about glamor.  Although when it comes to professionalism, et cetera, all about glamor.  You know, so we're just--the cylinders just, you know, were firing right, you know.  And I was at a time, you know, it was just--'cause I liked her, I mean, it really wasn't that complicated.  I was, you know, working with her doing some stuff and kind of fell into it, I mean, I can't even explain it.
Story_ID: 466662
Speaker 1: And you all decide to get married.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, for--you been married twenty some years, and how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: Three girls.
Speaker 1: Okay, and any of them in the business at this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, yeah, Savannah [Savannah Overton] works for 20th Century Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you give us all their names and their birth order for us, your daughters?
Speaker 2: Well, Cheyenne [Cheyenne Overton] is--say that again?
Speaker 1: Their birth order and their names.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, Cheyenne was the oldest daughter, Cheyenne Marie.  Savannah Re is second, Kopper Joi [Kopper Overton] is third and the baby is Zaire Ollyea [Zaire Overton], she's twelve.
Speaker 1: And you said that now Savannah is working in the industry?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she works at Fox studios, yeah, doing really well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Graduated from Pepperdine [Pepperdine University, Malibu, California], and Kopper's a freshman at Pepperdine.
Story_ID: 466663
Speaker 1: After you married Jayne Kennedy and during that time period, what are you doing, what are you doing professionally at this point, mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Still acting, you know, but then I got into to doing, you know, lot of real estate development.  Here, small scale, New England, major scale, you know, trying to--I'm just going out and exhausting my creative juices because at that point I had been in the industry, let's say for a conservative estimate, fifteen years, not including sports.  And I knew that there was nothing I couldn't do as an actor if I was given the opportunity.  I had hosted a--I'd hosted a show and a lot of people said that, you know, that--Muhammad Ali said some amazing things about me as a host, you know.  And so an African American producer, Emmett Cash put his money on the table.  I did a show called 'Point Blank' [ph.], and I interviewed some pretty significant names in--but I was too early.  You know, they didn't know what to do with it.  And so--'cause I was looking for a way to transition up, you know, as opposed to just going out looking for--on casting calls and looking for jobs, you know.  So, I ended up, like I said, the real estate development was I could go buy a piece of land, build something on it, and be paid based on my creativity, you know.  So I did new construction, old construction, you know, rehabbed mills on a lake.  I mean, I--and I basically went to communities, you know, that I was familiar with.  I spent a lot of time in Maine, you know.  And I'm real proud, I mean, I did as much creatively in the real estate business as I did in the entertainment business, you know.  And no one--and when I was out of the city, no one ever called me a black builder or developer, or a minority contractor.  The only time that ever happens is when I came back in town in the City of Boston [Massachusetts] or in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and tried to do some bigger jobs, you know.  And then all of a sudden that label was put back on me.  Oh, he's a, quote, minority contractor or black this, and I resent that and I didn't like it.  And I always fought against it, you know.  And I tell kids--I speak in a lot of schools, I tell--I don't believe in the word minority, I'm not minor in anything, you know.  But, again, you know, even now as an author, you know, you come up with a book.  My book is significant in the inclusion of all different kinds of races, you know, from the 19th century.  Well, Barnes and Noble [Barnes and Noble Booksellers, Inc.] said to me, this the first time they've took--taken a book by a black author and put it in another section that wasn't about--wasn't for black people.  I thought, you got to be kidding me.  This was when my book came out about say five years ago.  And now that I'm the owner and publisher of my own book, I own everything now.  I'm getting ready to, you know, rerelease it, do the film, do all kinds of stuff 'cause image, as you've heard me speak in the past, is I'm obsessed with how we and everybody else is portrayed.  I don't care what country you're from, I think that the, you know, the media can really do a number on you so I'm trying to break down some of these walls.
Story_ID: 466664
Speaker 1: Through the '80s [1980s] you start doing real estate development and different things into the '90s [1990s] and up 'til now.  Talk about the book that you've authored, what is the title of the book and what is the thrust behind the book?
Speaker 2: Well, thanks for the question.  The answer to your question is the book is entitled 'The Media: Shaping the Image of a People' [Bill Overton].  And, the book came from--I over--all this time I'm--as an athlete, I started in New York [New York] going back and forth from Boston [Massachusetts] to New York I stumbled on--in an antique shop, I stumbled on some old pictures and some old newspapers from the 19th century.  And it blew my mind because I saw pictures of blacks, Irish, Jews, Mormon, Chinese, Native Americans.  Folk that I knew but didn't know much about their history.  Some of these pictures represented my classmates in high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts], and we never studied--the stuff that I saw, I didn't know anything about and I questioned if they knew anything about it, 'cause they never said anything to me about Irish potato famine, you know, or the Holocaust or a lot of these things.  Okay, so I--this sort of became a passion and an interest.  I say, I'm gonna have a big house one day, I'll take these pictures, I'll put 'em in frames on the wall.  So, as I'm moving around five years, ten years, fifteen years, I'm buying pictures, putting em in storage in Boston, Maine, you know, California.  Fast forward, I see life changing in front of me.  I decide, as a project at Santa Monica College [Santa Monica, California], to take--to do something for kids 'cause it's a very diverse school.  I took the pictures out and had them--had some copies and put 'em in a gallery.  And the school flipped out.  And I went, wow, I'm really on to something.  So, I got a bunch of notes, comments in a book.  I put it away, put the collection away.  Two years later, I'm doing something--it's 1997, doing something at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  Mentoring students, doing whatever.  And I say, well, you know, I got this collection and maybe this could work.  So I brought it--brought some of the pictures, and they said, "Well, the only way we could do this at the museum here is you got to have it researched."  So they assigned five historians from UCLA to do the research on my collection.  And it was fascinating what they did.  And so they basically established the connectivity between the 19th century and present day.  And that time was 1997.  So then I took the exhibit to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] 'cause after I had showed it here for a month, I wanted to get an international feel, an international sense from people, travelers, what they thought about something like this.  So I was at Union Chapel [Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] on Martha's Vineyard and I had the exhibit there for a month.  People flipped out, from all over the place.
Speaker 1: Now, how large is the exhibit?
Speaker 2: It's--I had sixty pictures.  The pictures are 11" by 14", and some are 16" by 20".  So there's sixty individual pictures with display panels that are 3' by 5'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, the reaction to that was great.  I come back and many people said, "You know, we wanna buy something.  You're not selling anything, you got to do something."  So, I ended up talking to a publisher who was gracious enough to join me, write the check to get the book done.  And he got his money back relatively quickly.  The--I didn't have to--I didn't travel that much.  And some things happened within the company that I didn't like, and some things that I thought should have happened didn't happen.  So, I mean, I sold half, you know, half the inventory and the bottom line was I said, let me just--here's what I'm gonna do, 'cause I been--and on a daily basis I'm becoming more and more obsessed with the media, with what they're doing and what they're not doing.  'Cause I'm a bookworm and newspaper worm, and magazine worm.  So, make a long story short, I ended up buying the rights back, so this book then and--'cause what it is--and I missed a key ingredient.  The book is my collection, and then out of respect for you and Neculai [Neculai Burghelea], and Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson], I reached out to image makers of present day.  The sculptors, the painters, the--this is a tribute to Daniel Pearl, the photographers, the last quarter of the book is their work.  So people like [HistoryMaker] Lamonte McLemore who was renowned for taking beautiful pictures of women.
Speaker 1: He's a HistoryMaker (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the Jet magazine where David Kibuuka from Uganda, but lives in Toronto [Canada], spectacular, you know, paint, Jameel Rasheed, guy I grew up with who was like flesh and blood to me.  I had no idea he was an artist when we were growing up.  He did the picture of Rosa Parks, which they're trying to get--use as a stamp.  So I--not only do I have four--three of my homeboys and home girls, let's see, Jameel Rasheed, Hakim Rakib [ph.], Artis Graham [ph.] did a picture of President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] in the book.  And then Gale, Gale Fulton Ross is a phenomenal artist, lives in Florida now.  She did the picture of Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] in my book as well.  So this is a celebration of what the media does, what they can do, what they have done, and what they might do.
Story_ID: 466665
Speaker 1: So, when we're concerned now with the Paris Hilton phenomena, the Lindsay Lohans [Lindsay Lohan], you know, the impact of the Heath Ledgers [Heath Ledger], God bless him, we see our young people doing some things.  50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, P. Diddy [Sean Combs], Jay-Z, Beyonce, all of these folk now--excuse me--who are setting trends, shaping images, shaping minds by their actions.  I'm concerned about that, and I'd like them to know but I'd like the entertainment industry to understand.  We are shaping images, they're shaping images of black people and others, I mean, around the world.  So when MTV [Music Television; MTV] takes content that they create and produce and send it to Africa, folk in Africa think, well, hey, black folk must act like this, or American blacks act like this, or American whites act like this, or whatever because that's the way that images are being used.  I'm quite honestly sick of the way that the entertainment industry is misrepresenting our people.  And, you wanna look at the violence against women right now, I deal with it in my book.  The denigration of women I deal with, you know, the violence coming from our young men, black, brown, and otherwise.  Again, white men, killing women, killing families.  I mean, people have flipped the bleep out, you know.  And I think that too many of our people walking around with cell phones and iPods.  And my kids, my own kids, I'm on my kids' case all the time.  I mean, when they get in the car, each one of them got headphones.  They're not talking to each other, they're listening to their own music, and me and my wife [Jayne Kennedy] are just driving around, we're talking to each other.  But there's a disconnect.  I saw a guy almost get hit in a crosswalk on--he crossed, I mean, right at--the light was turning--had turned green, he takes off running.  He's talking on his phone and he didn't realize that the light had turned green.  So, I--see, we need to be in the now moment.  But media takes us where they want us to go. So, I think you can have both, my book is sort of a snapshot of from the 19--from the 1860s to present day.
Speaker 2: Give us the title of the book again?
Speaker 1: It's called 'The Media: Shaping the Image of a People' [Bill Overton].
Story_ID: 466666
Speaker 1: Now, this point, so are you lecturing?  Are you doing lectures along with your book now?  Are you doing things in the schools along with it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I been--I was just in Mississippi speaking at Piney Woods School [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].  One of I think the oldest--I think it's one of two or one of four African American boarding schools.  What a time I had.  You know, I spoke at Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi], a significant, historical black college [HBCU].  And they got issues in Mississippi they're concerned about with segregation, et cetera still.  The school system, they said, is as segregated now as it was forty years ago.  This is 2008.  You know, we got a lot a hatred, you know, and we got issues in Kosovo now, you know.  Issues in Africa now, issues in South America.  Hutus versus Tutsis, Palestinians versus Israelis.  You know, Shias versus Sunni.  It's--and a lot of it comes from imagery and the inability of people to accept and be tolerant, and be appreciative of each other based on language, based on race, based on religion, based on gender, you know.  And that's one of the things that I wanna do.  That's what this book is about.  So I have a curriculum that goes with it to get us to understand it's critical that we appreciate each other.  You know, so many people, you know, rave about Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know.  It's important that we not be judged by the color of our skin but the content of our character.  If I got a problem with a dark-skinned male, I'll never get to your character.  'Cause the image of what you represent is a problem.  You see what I'm saying?  So, if I got a problem with white people, I look at Neculai [Neculai Burghelea], he could be the greatest guy in the world.  If I have a problem with the white skin, something is wrong with me.  But it's the image, it's not what he thinks, what he feels, what he believes.  So, therefore, I say, you know, I don't want somebody typecasting me, judging me, right.  And, I say, I went through all of that as an athlete, as a model, as an actor.  Now I am in the real world and today, I mean, they're typecasting Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], you know.  Mitt Romney, who I respect as a businessperson, you know what I mean.  Lost--he got his butt kicked because he's a Mormon, which is sad, man, you know.  Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton], who I have a lot of respect and likeness for.  I like her.  You know, as a woman, why she's probably smarter than most men.  We got a problem taking orders from women.  And maybe I'm beat up 'cause, I can say this on camera, I get bossed around by so many women in my life, in my house.  Maybe, maybe I'm beat (laughter). But, you know, we have to understand, you know, that we've lost a lot in the world because we've kept people down.  When you keep people down, that one guy or that one woman that you suppressed might have the cure for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], might have the cure for cancer, might have the cure for, you know, to get us, you know, to be oil-independent, you know.  So, we got to stop, you know, we got to stop the insanity but it's--to me it's getting worse.

Speaker 1: What is your advice for someone that wants to go into either acting, sports, being an author, or whatever endeavor they might entail?  Because you seem to be somewhat of a renaissance man, what is your advice?
Speaker 2: If I have any advice at all, it always helps to have your own money.  The creative things that I'm the most proud of--I mean, I did 'cause I used my own money.  Especially like the real estate stuff.  You know, when you have to go--when you have to be subservient to somebody else, you know, you're at their beck and call.  And I, as an only child, I don't like that.  That's why I try to raise my kids to be independent.  You know, so you can be anything you wanna be in this--especially with the advent of the Internet and new media you can create all kinds of stuff.  But you got to have the marketing dollars to promote it because if you're gonna remain a secret you'll starve to death.  So the best thing I could ever say is, you know, be an actor, be a producer, but you got to have more than one, you got to have more than one career.  I'm still evolving.  I know what I wanna do, you know, but unfortunately I haven't hit full stride yet because I'm still chasing foundation money and other funds to get my book and to turn it into the icon that I think it will become.  But I'm close, you know.  Once I got the money there's no looking back then.
Story_ID: 466668
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first--to tie into what we were just talking about, the first book, excuse me, the first quote in my book ['The Media: Shaping the Image of a People,' Bill Overton] says, the law of culture is to be created all you were created capable of becoming.
Speaker 2: Say that one more time?
Speaker 1: The law of culture is to let everybody become all they were created capable of becoming.  So, if I see somebody that has some talent, man, I gotta--I must help them.  So, and it doesn't matter if it was my first significant girlfriend Julie [Julie Woodson] who I--who was a TWA [Trans World Airlines] airline stewardess that I dragged into the Ford agency [Ford Modeling Agency; Ford Models], said, you all need to work with her and she did great.  Kathleen [Kathleen Bradley], I mean, my first wife the same.  You know, yeah, she's beautiful, but I see something that I think would be highly appreciated.  And I was right.  Now, I mean, Jayne [Jayne Kennedy]--Leon [Leon Isaac Kennedy] and along with Jayne, he saw something and they went out and they paved the path.  I mean, I hoodwinked Jayne into thinking, you know, you could be a great mom too.  If you ever slow down, boy, I'm gonna be the one.  But I say that with a little bit of jest.  But, I mean, I've seen--now, Jayne is brilliant, you know, in terms of writing.  She can do all kinds of stuff.  But seems like the entertainment industry doesn't necessarily find or exploit, or allow people to, to exercise their creative genius.  Take it like--look at Jada Pinkett [Jada Pinkett Smith] is doing great stuff, you know.  But, you know, when you score, you know, I mean--when you score in the entertainment business, say if Will went from--Will Smith I'm talking about, went from a star actor in a TV series, you know, when you generate that kind of money for the networks, which are owned by parent companies, they find a way to keep you in the money-making system which is--they are smart.  Okay, Denzel [Denzel Washington] went from, you know, a TV series that was successful, crossed over into, you know, into film and became, you know, a huge star.  And it's happened with Ron Howard, it's happened with--oh, man--
Speaker 2: How about Terrence Howard?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Terrence Howard as well.  But, so, so for me, I mean, the reason I made some of these changes it was not by choice, it was almost 'cause I had to survive.  You know, I would--again, I go, I go back to--I would, I'd rather act and then do some other things as well.  But right--but I'm not and I will not go to Hollywood on their terms.  Hell with them.  Yeah, man, I know who I am.  So what I can--what I got to do now is for your kids or my own to say, okay, let me help show, you know, what is possible.  You know, let me help show.  So, I'm excited about that.
Story_ID: 466669
Speaker 1: What are your aspirations and hopes for the African American community in general in the future?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you, I'm scared to death with where we are as a nation.  And it's a sad state of affairs, but I think, I think America, institutionally, for what they have not done, we've lost so many black men.  And so many black young women who have settled for mediocrity and less, because the things that other societies have picked up on we've missed because we got caught up into living for the moment.  Our music is like that, you know.  A lot of our film and TV is like that, you know.  And the entertainment industry is part of the culprit, you know, which is, which, I mean, a lot of folk won't say.  I say it.  You hear Bill Cosby talking about, you know, the kids and the language and the parents gotta do a better job or what have you.  I mean the media is the biggest problem in this country right now, you know.  I'm, I like all kinds of music, you know, some rap music I like, some I don't like, you know.  But when you look at the creation and the creative talent and you match money to the impact that some of these young rap stars make versus the Denzels [Denzel Washington], the Forest Whitakers [Forest Whitaker], the, the Don Cheadles [Don Cheadle], et cetera, et cetera, and then, you know, find some of these young actresses.  You know how much talent we have?  Theater, stage-trained sisters, you don't know--where are they?  It's like the entertainment industry does not care.  And I remember there was a transition, I remember reading something that Sam Jackson [Samuel L. Jackson] caught, caught some flak because he said he didn't wanna work with rap stars as actors.  He said, "We got people that come out of Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] who are stage trained."  He wanted to work with his contemporaries, his peers.  See, I understood that because--but what happens is--because when the entertainment industry, and not black people who made that decision, so when the entertainment industry said, okay, let's go find 50 Cent, let's go find Ice Cube, let's go find--and Ice Cube has done some great things with, with the change in his career.  But the other actors like myself but a generation before me, all them have been forgotten and neutralized.  So if you went to Juilliard, if you went to all the schools and majored in speech and drama and all of that, and let's say now you are forty-five to fifty-five, you can't get arrested, which is really sad.  Now, so, where I go with that is we don't control much of the entertainment industry.  Now, I'm in the gym a lot, I was asking one of the guys the other day.  I said, how many Hispanic stations on TV?  He said, four or five, 24/7.  See, 'cause I like languages, so I'll watch some, someone speaking Spanish to seek if I can pick up stuff and I'm curious.  But 24/7, other than BET [Black Entertainment Television] and I think, well, now with [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, God, bless her, and Radio One [Lanham, Maryland] and I think she got a deal with Comcast [Comcast Corporation], I don't know 'cause I don't watch TV.  I don't really know what on unless I flip through channels when I'm drying off or doing something at the gym.  But, you got Korean Americans, got TV stations in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and other ethnicities.  TV stations owned doing programs specific to their culture.  African Americans, we have integrated into the mainstream to some degree and then others, but we don't control anything.
Story_ID: 466670
Speaker 1: I mean, we are still at odds in terms of who shapes our image.  And so I give it--I know an example, there's a channel called The Africa Channel, pioneered by James Makawa and Mr. Arback [Jacob Arback].  My mind went blank with his first name.  James from Zimbabwe, the channel is on 24/7.  I saw that channel, man, I got chills up and down my spine, because it was positive images done by Africans about Africa.  I mean, sports, soap operas, all kinds of stuff.  And I meant, I felt so excited, you know.  So I hope they become a significant part, you know, of the fabric here.  But I know they just broke in the U.K. [United Kingdom] all over the place.  Because people need to see the real world.  And that's a real manifestation of Africa as opposed to when I read the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] and some of these other publications about what goes on in Africa, all you hear about is HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].  You know what I mean?  And crime and graft and Nigeria's corrupt and this, and a lot of it is BS, you know.  But, you know what, we don't control the, the entertainment industry.  I mean, when I still hear people say that there's no--I mean, no black people in the entertainment industry that can green light a project in 2008, you got to be kidding me, you know.  So, and when you look at sports, you know, you see the progress, I mean, on, in, on, on, in the broadcast booth.  When I see guys like, you know Magic [Magic Johnson], Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley and Ernie Johnson [Ernie Johnson, Jr.], you got three brothers and a white guy.  And they're like--they could all be brothers.  They are so good at what they do.  And then you got other teams.  Now, James Brown and--
Speaker 2: Worthy [James Worthy] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, Worthy and Norman [Norm Nixon].  You got a lot and, now keep in mind, a lot of it's--some of it comes out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  I see, you know, Norman Nixon get a chance to do his thing.  You know, Worthy getting a chance to do his thing.  You know, Magic is doing--you know where you can--Magic evolved from, you know, sounding like he fell off--just came off the turnip truck to a first-class CEO that's a role model for everybody, everywhere.  And I applaud him for that.  So it shows you what is possible.  So then, why are we as a society, why is the dropout rate in Detroit, Michigan 25 percent?  I mean, the graduation rate, 25 percent.  I was at the L.A. school board yesterday.  What is the graduation rate in LAUSD [Los Angeles Unified School District]?  Forty-five percent.  I mean, all the money we have.  Now, we're supposed to be--we're going through a recession, we're having a hard time now.  What about the last five years, ten years, fifteen years?  Why have we allowed ourselves to become so mediocre, you know?  We got issues with immigration, you know.  We got all--we got so many issues.  The kids, the kids that are here, what are we leaving for 'em?  One of my favorite sayings, we didn't inherit this world, we borrowed it from our children.  Borrowed.  So what are we gonna give 'em back?
Story_ID: 466671
Speaker 1: Good question.  On that note, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Hm.  I guess probably this book ['The Media: Shaping the Image of a People,' Bill Overton] and, and the rollout of the book and the exploitation of the exhibit, the book, the curriculum, the film.  I want to do--my next step, I want to do the project at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], to turn it into a DVD-ROM and do what Michael Moore did with 'Fahrenheit 9/11.'  I wanna do that with my project.  You know, and then they can take me away, brother, 'cause I will have done it.  But I just wanna make sure, you know, that--and it's some good stuff happening.  But, you know, again, like I say, if I'm just in Jackson, Mississippi and that got concerns about segregation in schools.  Or you hear Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] talk about race and people act like he's the first person that talked about it and they glad he did it.  And I'm going, what!  Or you say, and I heard him say, it's quoted in my book that the, the ten o'clock hour, the church service on Sunday's the most segregated time in America.  I mean, we all pray--what God--I mean, come on.  You know, I look at--I had the privilege of going to Dubai [United Arab Emirates].  Phenomenal.  You know.  And I challenged them, I said, you know, we gotta do something about the way America sees the Muslim, Islamic world.  But you also got to do something in terms of your image and how--because we got to stop some of this insanity that's going on.  So, there's a lot that I'd like to do, you know.  And, again, it's all about resources.  That's why I applaud, you know, Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson], I mean, your boss, you know, for doing what she's doing 'cause she could--if she can do this, she probably could be doing situation comedies and other things like that and making a whole, goo-gob of money, you know.  But somebody has to have the tenacity and the depth to do something significant to make the world better.  And that's what I want.  And, probably, the other thing is maybe I'll be a stand-in for Barack if he wins, 'cause I got the same initials.  I'm the same height, I look better than he does.  He went to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I drove by Harvard, you know.  Maybe Bill Overton for president.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Exactly.
Speaker 2: This is the first time I get you to smile like that.
Speaker 1: Any final comments?
Speaker 2: No, man, I'm glad to be here, and hopefully I--if anybody takes the time to look at this they're not bored.  I'm just trying to do the best I can.
