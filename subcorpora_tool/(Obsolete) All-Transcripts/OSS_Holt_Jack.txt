 Gill and today is October 10, 2008. I   m visiting Jack  Holt in his home east of Norman, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE  Stories project at the Oklahoma Oral History Program. Jack,  can you share a little information about your early life? Where you grew  up, your family     I was born into a family that raised nine kids. I was born at Cashion,  Oklahoma, which is out west of Guthrie. My brother and I burnt the barn  down when I was about four years old and we moved right after that  over to the northeast of Guthrie in Mt. Summit School District, I think,  so we didn   t have to rebuild the barn. That   s where I went to grade  school up through the eighth grade and then we moved down to  Winnsboro, Texas   Northeast Texas. That   s just southeast of Paris and  where I went to high school. After high school, I went into the Navy and  spent four years in the Navy during the Korean War. I was stationed in  Yokosuka, Japan in electronics repair. When I got out of the Navy, of  course, I had the GI Bill, so I could go to college on the GI Bill. I chose  Oklahoma A M College since my folks moved back to Oklahoma City  and so I had in state tuition and I could go to college in Oklahoma.  Jack, your parents moved around a bit, what did you parents do for a  living?  At that time they were farmers, always been farmers until probably  when I was in eighth grade when my dad started doing some work in the  oil field. He worked the oil field for two or three years after that.  Basically, he was always a farmer, grew up on the farm and raised  there   he only went to fourth grade so all he knew was farming.  I understand there   s a story about how you got to OSU. What influenced  you to come to Oklahoma State University? Or at that time Oklahoma  A M.  5  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Well, this was summer of 1954 and I was working in Colorado Springs  with the Navigators. They were getting ready to move their office in Los  Angeles to Colorado Springs. I thought about college and I thought of  three schools: OU  University of Oklahoma , OBU  Oklahoma Baptist  University , and Hardin-Simmons. I sent off for all three of their  applications, was praying about which one and I couldn   t get any  clear   I wanted God   s choice, not mine, and I couldn   t get any clearer  decision on which one, any one. They were all three good but I couldn   t  figure out which one, I wanted God to tell me which one. So I spent the  whole night in prayer about it. I was walking around on the lawn in the  moonlight and I just opened up my bible and in the moonlight I could  see Luke. I thought,    Well maybe he   ll give me the answer out of Luke,     and I went over in the parking lot, turned on a dome light and started  reading in the book of Luke, I think in the eighth chapter I came to the     Parable of Sower    and I thought,    Well, you know, that   s Oklahoma  A M,    because farm kids, they   re sowers. All of a sudden I had a real  strong conviction and that wasn   t even one of the three, so I sent off for  an application to Oklahoma A M and started the fall of 1954.  Great Story. So you were there the fall of    54 and graduated in   ?     59. I stretched it in a four year college to four and a half years because I  was involved in the band and traveling and announcing and counseling  in the dorm. I had to take a light load and that made four and a half years  rather than four years.  Well you told me those years, particularly    57,    58, those were some  pretty significant years for Oklahoma State University. I mean we are  celebrating some anniversaries. The name change from Oklahoma A M  to Oklahoma State, moving from Missouri Valley into the Big Eight, the  Big Seven, we made it the Big Eight Conference.  Right.  Let me ask you Jack, what did you and your fellow students think of the  name change of the university? Was that popular?  Oh yes, of course. OU fought it tooth and toenail, they didn   t want it  changed. They didn   t want us to be a university. They really, really  fought it. But there was nothing they could do about it. The school and  the students wanted it to change to Oklahoma State University. Now you  know Texas A M went through a similar change, but they didn   t want  to lose their aggie status so they changed theirs to Texas A M  University. OSU could   ve kept it that way but they wanted to change it  to Oklahoma State so they went and changed.  6  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  You are an agronomy student, but I may be getting ahead of the story a  little bit. Did some of the ag students feel a little bit upset about losing  the agriculture out of the name? The    agriculture    in Oklahoma  Agricultural   Mechanical College?  Well, we understood that they were going to lose the    aggie    status.  Aggie jokes were really   I still tell aggie jokes  I miss that part of it but  basically it was an improvement on the school and they were stepping  up and they wanted that to happen. So I think the consensus across the  campus was, they were glad it was going to change. But they had to  change the mascot because they weren   t Aggies anymore. The school  had to add a lot of different programs to become a full fledged  university; there was a lot had to happen, not just a name change but a  lot of other things.  What about you moving into to conference, I mean was that exciting?  Well, they were in the Missouri Valley before that and went into the Big  Seven. They had to change it to Big Eight because they added one more  team. So for several years it was the Big Eight and then they changed it  to Big Twelve.  Was that considered more prestigious then by the students by the time  you moved into the Big Eight conference?  Oh yeah.  And did the students look forward to playing OU as a conference rival  then at that point?  Right, because we were in Missouri Valley before that and with different  teams.  Moving to a new conference kind of prompted a change from Aggies to  Cowboys, so we needed a new mascot and first, how did the students feel  about the name change? Did they like the name Cowboys? Did that  resonate?  Yeah, they really did. Of course they knew that Aggies, that was no  longer, because they weren   t Aggies anymore. Then they had the   do  you want to hear about the contest that they had?  I was just going to ask you     You were going to ask about that?  7  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  I understand you had a role in the selection so if you   d share that with  us, we   d love you to.  They had mentioned in the O   Collegian, the newspaper, that they were  going to have a contest to name a new mascot. Well the decal that they  still use was I think inaugurated in 1923, so it had been around for many,  many years; and they still use it. It   s really obvious that it would be good  to have a mascot character of that particular decal. So they had a contest  and the day it came out, it came out in the paper; a little tear out  application to enter the contest.  What month was this?  This is early    57. They just changed it that summer, school probably  started about a month earlier.  So Fall semester?  Yeah, Fall    57. I went over to the Student Union to eat breakfast one  morning and they had just dropped a bundle of papers by the door, just  tied up with string by the door of the cafeteria there, and so I picked up a  paper and went in. It   s about 7:30 and I had a class in the Classroom  Building which is the next building   I think it   s still there isn   t it?   at  8:00 so I just ate a doughnut and a cup of coffee and was looking at the  paper. While I was doing this, there is a tear out entry to the mascot and  then it said turn    em in at the bookstore, which is right across the hall  from the cafeteria. So I wrote out mine, a cowboy, with a paper machete  head of Pistol Pete after the decal and I couldn   t remember how to spell  machete so I just put    large.    I took it over there when I finished and  walked in to the bookstore. They were setting up a table and three guys,  actually two guys and a girl, they set this table up and that   s where they  were going to collect these entries. They were just setting it up that  morning, they put a cardboard box on the table. I handed in my entry  and he looked at it and he questioned me,    What do you mean by     large   ?    I said,    Well, it   s machete, you know paper machete head.    He  said okay and put it in the box. It was the first one in the box   I cast the  very first vote for Pistol Pete.  Great story. Let me ask you, did you have other options when you select  the mascot, did they have something else?  Yeah, the second choice that came in was a cowboy on a horse and I  think that is why they have Bullet. That was a second choice, it got a lot  of votes but the majority of the votes were for Pistol Pete with a paper  machete head.  8  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Jack, did they have options, like option one, Pistol Pete and the head   ?  No, it was just blank, you just put in what you thought would be a good  mascot. They said the majority of them were paper machete head with  Pistol Pete on the same as the decal.  Now did the students know we   d be called the Cowboys?  Yes, they had already decided on that and that was a good deal.  Was the mascot a big deal for OSU students?  Yes, it was. It really was.  Was it popularly received by the student body?  Oh, yeah.  They really liked the idea of Frank Eaton character with the paper  machete head?  Yeah, they really did. It was very popular and it got most all the votes. I  mean, there were just a few other suggestions. The second choices were  mostly, what would end up Bullet. Oklahoma being a cowboy state,  Oklahoma is right in the center of the cowboy era. The cattle drives from  Texas across Oklahoma to Kansas, the railhead for about ten years is  what established the cowboys. I mean there   s a few cowboys working on  ranches but those cattle drives was what really inaugurated and caused  the cowboy popularity to become what it is today and what it has been.  I tell people,    Oklahoma has always gotten the brunt of the dust bowl  days, poor Okie, and Oklahoma wasn   t the only one in the dust bowl.     Southern Kansas, Texas panhandle, Northern Texas and part of  Arkansas, I mean it was a big circle and yet we got nailed,    poor Okie     and everybody thinks Oklahomans are the only ones who are poor and  had trouble and dust and all this. The rich cattle men in Texas drove the  cattle across Oklahoma and got their money in Kansas and all we got of  it was when the cattle crapped on us all the way across. (Laughter) But  just the cowboy life and Frank Eaton was a typical cowboy. I mean he  was    The cowboy way is honesty in hard times and dust, tough and he  was the epitome of all that.  You make a good point. You were going say that Pistol Pete represents  the spirit of Oklahoma and of Oklahoma State University.  Oh absolutely, absolutely.  9  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Do you think it   s special that Pistol Pete, the mascot, is really a  character of a real life, Frank Eaton? Is that special to you as an alum,  that it   s not an animal or some kind of Jayhawk bird or something, but  that it   s a cowboy named after a real person?  Yeah, absolutely. Two other universities took off on it too and named  their mascot after Pistol Pete. Frank Eaton had a marvelous life; tough,  hard times but he was the epitome of a cowboy, a cowboy   s life and the  hard times they went through. He was a lawman; he was even a lawman  in Guthrie where I grew up in grade school. He has tremendous  character, and that they named the mascot of Oklahoma State after  him     Speaking of Frank Eaton, you were talking about we   re celebrating fifty  years and changes now so you   re sharing wit. He died in 1958?  Absolutely. He died the same year they started Pistol Pete the mascot.  So this is fifty years of remembering his death as well. It   s uncanny he  died the same year. It really is.  When he died, was that big news for Oklahoma State people in Stillwater  there?  Oh, yeah. It was. In fact they had a big write up in the newspaper and I  have a copy of that newspaper from the day after he died. That will be  part of the archives. It   s kind of yellow and faded. (Laughter)  Well, Jack, can you recall the first time you actually saw Pete with the  machete head on the field? Can you share that experience with us?  Yeah, I was glad to see it. Now I understand that   it may not be true or  may, but I understand that Disney labs made that first head for them.  But that   s just what I heard. I don   t know if it   s true or not.  I know that they make the head now. I don   t know if they made that first  one or not, but they do now.  I heard that. They must still do it then.  They do?  So I had heard that they did.  So was it a football game where you saw Pete?  The first one, and I think it was the OU game, but I   m not positive. But  10  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  you have that picture taken and I   m in that picture standing there. I was  standing there talking to LaNese Craft. She was married to a football  player, Gerry Craft, when they snapped the picture.  And that was the Fall of    58.  Fall of    58. Late fall, because people had coats on. I had a coat on.  Do you recall the crowd   s reaction to the first time Pete was on the field  or introduced? Was there kind of a buzz or anything like that?  No, I don   t remember that. I do not remember just when he walked out  on the field. It   s just not there, I just don   t remember it.  Now Pete   s become such a   we just call him Pete instead of Pistol  Pete     Yeah.  But Pete   s become such an icon of OSU and OSU sports that wherever  he goes, little kids and birthday parties and grade schools and out on the  field, he   s really a significant symbol. Did it take a while for that to  catch on? Did people identify pretty quickly with him as our mascot?  I think it took time, because that didn   t happen real fast. It grew because  they didn   t realize they could get him to do that. Once people found out  that they could have him come and do that then they   d tell their friends  and it just spreads. So it happened gradually. It didn   t just come real fast  I don   t think. It was a gradual deal.  In your student experience at Oklahoma State University can you share  a little bit about campus activities? Your involvement in programs you  participated in as a student at Oklahoma State?  First thing is, they called me in and asked me if I   d become a counselor  in the dorm because Dean James Miller was the Dean of Men and I  would work directly under him. They needed counselors real bad and  they knew I had been in the Navy. Typically, if they wanted to hire a  student, they   d have to wait until he became about maybe a Junior to be  a little bit older than those in dorms to counsel. But if they found  somebody who   s already older than he started me out as a counselor  second semester.  And now which     In West Bennett. I was counselor for the athletes. First floor West  11  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Bennett, all the whole floor was athletes. Football, tennis, wrestling, you  name it. They didn   t have an athletic dorm. That was it, and I was their  counselor. So that was the start of the activities. And of course I was  involved in the Baptist Student Center and we   d play touch football  games. I was involved in quite a bit of sports with the BSU, plus being a  counselor in the dorm. And then played in the band, so I traveled to all  the football games. And then I think it was my sophomore year that  Hiram  Henry  asked me to announce for the band when the announcer  graduated. So I started announcing as well as keeping the   and I  announced for the band, the symphonic band in the spring when they  would go on tour. I   d travel with them and announce for them.  Now you were drum line?  I was a drummer, yeah. Snare drum. Played in high school and college.  What was your favorite song?     Stars and Stripes Forever.    Man I   ll tell you, that raises chill bumps on  my back.  Tell us a little bit about your announcing. Did you   now the guy says     The Cowboy marching band       Is that     The main phrase that we used back in those days, right at the end you  would say:    The most colorful band in all the land.     Can you give us your line Jack?     THE MOST COLORFUL BAND IN ALL THE LAND      That   s great.  In that picture you saw where they still had A M on all of the uniforms.  But you noticed they had an OSU patch on the shoulder. It took a  couple, three years before they got new uniforms. They just didn   t have  the money to buy all new uniforms. But that took place over time and  they got new uniforms. But those that we had were beautiful.  Now Hiram Henry was he the     Hiram? Yeah, in fact he was the director the whole time.  So was that a little unusual or was that common that students would  announce the band?  12  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  At that time, yeah, they always chose a student.  They chose a student.  What do they do now? Is it somebody other than in the band? A former  band member or something? Or just anybody they can get whose a good  announcer?  Well they   ve got somebody who   s got the voice, they have to audition,  but it   s not a student.  I see. Yeah, at that time, only students did it. We only had, I think 96  members in the band and now they   ve got over 200.  So how did that work Jack? If you   re announcing it   if you   re playing  the drums and announcing it, are you doing it from the field? Or would  you go up     We would go up in the press box.  Okay, so you would not then participate in the half time ceremonies  typically.  No, I was announcing for it at half time. They were marching on the  field and I would tell each formation and what they were doing. They  don   t do much of that anymore, do they? They don   t tell what every  formation is. But we had a write up. In fact I have a lot of those plans  that there in that office up there. I kept those. It shows the design and  what the formation is and what I said and the whole deal. And there   s a  picture of me in the press box announcing down there at the microphone.  Did you get to make some trips with the band then?  Oh yeah.  What was your favorite trip? Have you got a memory of a special trip?  OU. Hoping we   d beat them. Hopefully, we   d beat them.  Did you get to go out of state?  Oh yeah. Wherever the band went, I went. The first year, of course, I  was just playing in the band. But after that I was announcing.  So Jack, your major again was in?  13  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Study of agronomy with a soils major.  A soils major.  I told people I just wanted something down to earth. So I majored in  Soils.  Well, are there some special professors that you remember? Are there  some administrators that were special in your development and your  student life?  I always admired Dr. Thorn, he was the head of the department. I   ve got  a picture of him and he signed a paper. This is my wife Donna. But as  far as individual names, there was one professor that I remember. We  had   it was the day before the finals and we had a flood in Stillwater. I  was a good friend of Dick Reynolds who had a trailer out on the east  side of town on Stillwater Creek. So we were out there and we heard that  they were flooding in Norman. There was a house there next by that had  handicap kids in it. A dam broke in northern Stillwater and it roared  down through and flooded the east side of Stillwater and that creek is  just east of Main Street. We couldn   t get back to town. It was four feet  over the top of that bridge. We had to spend the night out there in a farm  house, and it happened to be the assistant band director   s house. Slept on  the floor, I had a final at eight o   clock the next morning in soils, my  major.  The creek went down just enough so we could get across and I made that  eight o   clock final. And I flunked it. I had a straight A going into that  final and I flunked it so bad. I was so tired, I couldn   t think and I flunked  it and almost flunked the course. It dropped my whole grade to a D  minus; I just barely passed. He called me in and he said,    Jack, what  happened? You had a straight A going in, and you failed the final so  bad.    So I related the story of the flood and how I spent the night  sleeping on a hard wood floor. I said    I was just so tired I couldn   t  think.    He said,    I   ll let you take it over.    I said    No, that grade will  remind me of what I went through and what happened that night more  than if I had an A on that transcript. So I let it stay. So I remember him. I  think his name was Brown, but I   m not sure. He offered to let me take  that final over again, but I refused. I said    No, I   ll just keep it.     Back to your activities again, you were in the dorm as a counselor there  at the resident hall West Bennett. The band, any other student activities  you were involved in, Jack?  Well, I ran for president of the senior class my senior year. Bob Doty,  who you   ll read about in that story in the middle of that notebook, was a  14  Gill  Holt  football player. He came to me and said    Jack, we don   t have time to be  running for no President. We have to spend all this time with students  helping people.    So I dropped out. My opponent won it without any  opposition whatsoever. I would have been president of the senior class,  because I was well known and he wasn   t. But that   s just a story.  Did you have some favorite places on campus? Favorite buildings? Or  favorite places there on the campus?  Yeah, I like sitting by Theta Pond. Just watching the water and ducks.  And BSU, Gallagher Hall and the football stadium. I was a counselor in  West Bennett, Hanner, and Thatcher. At that time, they were men   s  dorms. Both those were men   s dorms. I was counselor of all three of  those. The reason I was asked, Dean Miller called me in one day, he  said,    Jack, I have a special assignment for you as a counselor.    He said     We   ve got a unique situation going on over in Thatcher Hall.    Now at  that time I was in Hanner Hall which is right there close to the  Classroom Building. Well anyway he said,    We   ve got eight guys over  in that dorm firing firecrackers.    He said,    Now we   ve got some Korean  War Veterans over there and every time a firecracker goes off, it ruins  their whole evening of study.    He said,    A lot of them will just dive  under the bed. They   re all shell shocked.    He said,    I want you to go  over and   they   ve run off three counselors already. I want to see if you  can take it and do something with it.    He said    Now if you can catch  them at it, if you can actually catch them in the act of firing firecrackers,  we   ll expel them. But you   ve got to actually see them doing it.     I don   t know if you   ve been to either one of those dorms, but there are  just two floors. There   s a stairway at both ends that goes down to a  landing and goes down. I found that I could go down there and get on  that landing and I could look down and see the bottom floor and look up  and see the top floor. I could guard both floors at the same time. Their  favorite way of firing these firecrackers was they   d go in   they   d wait  until about one o   clock in the morning, go in the men   s room way down  at the end of the hall, light the   they were firing cherry bombs. Do you  remember the cherry bombs? I mean they were really dazzling equal to a  fifth of a stick of dynamite. They   d light one of those things, open the  door a little bit, and hit that terrazzo floor and ricochet off the wall and  go off clear on the other end. Then the students would come out of their  rooms and say what happened or whatever. We nailed seven of them.  We got all seven of them one at a time, but I had to lose a lot of sleep to  do it. I would get three or four hours of sleep a night. We nailed all but  one. The last guy was from California. He was a senior, graduating. I  never could catch him at it. He took a test for another guy and the  professor said this was not him   he knew all the students and he knew  that wasn   t the student whose test he took. So he got a yearbook and  15  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  went through and found that guy   s picture. And that was the eighth guy  who was firing firecrackers. They expelled him and he never got his  degree. He went to California and received his degree. So we nailed all  eight of them, but I wrecked my health doing that.  Great story  Speaking of dorms, did the men in their residence halls  have any hours that they had to be in a certain time? A curfew     No, there wasn   t any curfew or deadlines. They had a lot of panty raids  going on at that time. Do you remember the old panty raids? Well, a lot  of the football players were in on them. So that story is in that    Parable  of Sower    notebook. But I mean it wasn   t a serious thing, but it got a lot  of them in trouble.  Did you have activities in the resident halls in those days? There   s a lot  of programming and activities that go on today. Did you have...  Well, of course Homecoming was a big deal. Decorations for  Homecoming was a biggy. We had what we called house meetings, and  have a rally or something and sing. Like out in Bennett, there   s that big  lobby right in the middle of the dorm on the first floor. They   d sit on the  stairs and all around and everything. Not too much, but once in a while  we   d have something. Have a band come in or something.  The residence halls at that time, did they build floats for Homecoming?  Oh yeah. I remember one year we played Air Force for Homecoming.  From Jets to Atoms or something. So we hung a big old ball of atom out  there in a tree   this is in Thatcher. An airplane was diving in to the  ground, and crash and there   s smoke, and had a fire going with smoke,  you know. (Laughs) We won first place for residence hall for that year  for that thing.  For creativity, if nothing else.  Yeah.  We talked about on campus, what about some off campus   what were  some student hang outs at that time? What was popular at that time? Go  out to eat, or date, or hangout, or drink soda pop?  The Eulas Keyless Caf   down on Main Street. Now it took me a long  time to figure what in the world that meant. Eulas was her name. E-U-L-A-  S. Eulas Keyless Caf  , means it never closed. They didn   t need a key.  I had to ask them what does that all mean, but they told me. Eulas  Keyless Caf  . So it was a popular deal, because they stayed open  16  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  twenty-four hours a day. Students could go down there at night and four  o   clock in the morning and study or whatever. It was a popular hangout.  Now there   s a place that opened that you might have heard of in 1957  called the Hideaway.  Yeah.  The original location. Did you   ?  I never went in there, but it was popular.  It was popular?  Yeah.  So you weren   t a pizza lover, huh?  No. There was a place on the east, right across the street from Thatcher  Hall on the east side was a two-story house. The man that owned it  started a little caf   and all they served was chili and beans. Chili with or  without beans for lunch. Just lunch. I mean, students would line up  plumb out to the street to eat at that place. It was very, very popular and  it was very, very good.  Another place on Knoblock was Swim   s. Going pretty strong at that  time.  Yeah.  Would that have been just pretty close to Thatcher as well?  Yeah.  On Knoblock?  Yeah.  And it was a popular hang-out at the time?  Uh-huh. And there was a caf   down Knoblock too that was very, very  popular. Anything that was within walking distance because a lot of  them didn   t have a car, and I didn   t have a car either. I thought   first of  all I couldn   t afford one, and secondly if I needed a car, I knew two or  three guys that had cars and I would borrow their car, and even if I just  went downtown for a reason or go to the laundry or something, I would  17  Gill  Holt  Gill  fill their tank up with gas. They were begging me to borrow their car. I  never had trouble getting a car. I mean   and they always needed gas,  you know. But it was still cheaper for me rather than owning a vehicle,  and it helped them too, so it worked out great. So I never owned a  vehicle all the way through college.  Looking back and thinking about all the things we   ve talked about in  your OSU experience, are there special memories for you? Are there in  special highlights or events that stand out in your student career?  Yeah there are several. One was I wondered if   I talked to Neill  Armstrong who was one of the assistant coaches and he also played  before I ever got there, back several years. He was on the coaching staff  and I asked him,    Hey what do you think is the possibility of getting  Billy Graham to this campus?    He said,    Well, probably. Why don   t you  go talk to the President and see if they   ll invite him?    So I went in and  talked to Dr. Willham and they wrote him. He said,    Well you need to  get me their address, I don   t know who to write.    So I got them the  address and he wrote Billy and they got an answer back. I think Grady  Wilson wrote the letter back to him and said our schedule was such   he  told him when we wanted it, and this was in 1958, and he wrote back  and said they   re booked up solid, they can   t come but maybe at a future  date. They sent me a copy of that to Thatcher Hall, and that letter you  will get a copy of it in your memorabilia stuff. That   s one of them.  Another one was   I wondered if we could get Fellowship of Christian  Athletes to come and give some testimonies. I had met Donn Moomaw  who was All-American at UCLA. He came to Colorado Springs to Glen  area when I was there. I went in and talked to Neill Armstrong again,  and Neill was a fine Christian man. So I said,    What do you think we  can get Fellowship Christian athletes to come and talk to the athletes?     He said,    You need to go in and talk to Henry Iba.    So I went in and  talked to Coach Iba and I said,    What are our chances of getting  Fellowship Christian Athletes here?    Unbeknownst to me, he had a big  part in the formation of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, so he was  very receptive to the idea. He said,    All right, you invite them, and I   ll  get the athletes there.    So I wrote them and they were going to send  Donn Moomaw, Don Botsford who played for a Canadian Football  League and Ray Thompson who was All-American at Rice in track.  Those three were going to come. Something happened, a death in the  family or something, and Donn Moomaw couldn   t come. But the other  two came. We had a meeting and I mean when Hank Iba says you go to  that meeting, they were there. We had a great time. No response or  anything but he got the athletes there.  Did you ever meet Don McClanen? Wasn   t he the one who founded   ?  18  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Yeah he was one who founded   yeah and he left. He was there a year  before me on the coaching staff. Coach Iba   I have that whole story and  all the details. But Iba got him a job at Southeastern at Wilburton   Eastern Oklahoma State College is in Wilburton . So he left just the  summer   I got there in that fall and he left and went to Wilburton and  that   s where he actually got it off the ground. With Iba   s encouragement  and everything, why he got it established and that   s where he stayed and  got it started. But the idea he got at OSU. It was A M then.  Did you maintain your relationship with the band after you left? I mean  there   s Alumni Band and so on and being a student announcer did you  maintain contact?  No, because I went to seminary. I was totally out of the area and had no  contact with them after that.  Well, can you share with us, maybe just briefly a little bit about your  career after you left Oklahoma State University? Have you managed to  stay connected with the University over the years?  I mentioned earlier that I wrecked my health trying to catch those guys  firing firecrackers. Being an ex-serviceman I had a real heart  understanding for those Korean War Veterans, because I was one. I lost  so much time and sleep that I couldn   t sleep. By the end of that semester  in    59, I couldn   t sleep. I was a bundle of nerves. My nerves wouldn   t let  me sleep. So when I went to Glen area after that to work out there, they  saw my condition and they said,    We need to get you out of here, you  don   t need to be here. You need to go somewhere and get some rest.     They got a request for somebody to go over to Yuma, Colorado. Mr.  Carl Hoke had eight sections of wheat and he needed somebody to drive  a combine. They said,    Well maybe you can go up there and not have  any responsibility and you can just sleep at night. You   ll be tired from  driving a combine, and that will take care of it.     Well so I went up there and started driving this combine, but I still  couldn   t sleep at night. Mr. Hoke was in his upper 80   s. A big old  German fellow, a real tough farmer, as old as he was. But he was  concerned about my health. He had had an employee before that had a  thyroid deficiency and he thought that was my problem. He took me to  Denver to a clinic after we got done combining. He told them,    Now, I   ll  pay for it, but I want you to find out what   s wrong with this man. I  mean, find out. If you have to test him three times and everything to find  out and cure him. Do whatever you need to do to solve his problem.    So  they did, they ran all those tests, everything three times. They came in  and the elderly doctor, grey headed, and he was nervous as a cat. He  said,    Jack we tested you every which way. There   s nothing physically  19  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  wrong with you.    He said,    You have lost so much sleep and you have  run your health down to the point.     He showed me on a blackboard. There   s a big old curve down here  there   s a line, he drew across there, he said,    That   s the break down  line.    He said    Most people, if they get as tired as you got when they get  to that point they have a mental or physical breakdown. Total physical  breakdown. You are in the worst shape of anyone I have ever examined.  You are down here at the bottom.    He said,    Son, you could die sitting  there in that chair.    He was afraid that was going to happen. That was  why he was so nervous. He thought I was going to die in his office. He  said,    Now we have a new tranquilizer we   ve come up with and it   s not  habit forming, no side effects.    He said,    I   m going to put you on it four  a day.    He said,    We   ve got to turn your nervous system off so you can  sleep. So you can recuperate.    He said,    I want you to take four a day  for a month, then three a day for a month, then two a day for a month,  then one a day for a month. And by that time, you can sleep at night.  Your body will recuperate. Now,    he said    It   s just like dropping a vase  on the floor, you can put it back together but it has still been broken. If  you ever get in this situation again you   re going to die. It will kill you.    I  mean, he read me the riot act. So I went on those tranquilizers and it got  me back past that line to where I could rest on my own. But that   s how  close I came to dying.  Did you go directly to seminary after that?  Yeah, right after that, I went straight from there to the seminary in Fort  Worth.  Southwest Baptist?  Southwestern Baptist Seminary in Fort Worth. We were holding Youth  Revivals. In fact Gerry Craft, a former OSU football player and Shelby  Wilson, a wrestler who won a gold medal in the    60 Olympics was there,  all three of us. We started this group where we   d go out and hold camps  and conferences in churches. I met a young girl in Shady Oaks Baptist  Church out in Hurst and she was the only teenager in that church. Now I  asked the Pastor   this is on the edge of Fort Worth.    How come you  only got one teenager in this whole church?    He said    Oh we used to  have lots of them.    I said    What happened to them?       They all went  over to Bellevue Baptist. They built a family life center and they wanted  to be there where they could play basketball.    I said,    Well how come  she didn   t go?    He said,    She figured somebody ought to stay here and  be a testimony to these younger kids.    I said,    I want to meet her.    So I  met her. She was a drum major at Belle High School band, a senior at  Bell High School. We dated, and I had to wait until she graduated out of  20  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  Holt  high school to marry her. I was 32 years old. So I was 14 years older  than she. But she was very mature for her age and I was immature for  mine so that put us together. But that   s where I met her. She   s been a  wonderful wife.  Kind of reflecting on what   s happened at OSU now, have you been on  campus recently?  Oh yeah.  Campus development? Do you feel pride? Or what do you feel     Very.     about all of the construction and the facilities, and what   s going on?  I say it   s about time. Yeah, you betcha. Very, very proud of it. OSU has  a tremendous history of   I remember when SMU won the first national  championship in baseball, you remember? The very first one. I thought  we won so many, and I think OSU is second in the nation in the number  of national championships of athletic teams they   ve won. But yeah, very,  very proud of them. They   ve won in every event, except football.  Football it seems like it   s been a real tough road to make it in football.  Mike   s off to a good start this year.  Yeah, you betcha.  Well, there are some other sports highlights; did you see the famous  Kansas game against Wilt Chamberlain?  I was at that game. Let me tell you a little bit about that okay? At that  time players could freeze the ball. They could just dribble out there and  go as long as they wanted to. That was the most exciting bunch of fans  I   d ever been in a   they were screaming just about the entire game. Of  course Wilt Chamberlain   he changed his name to what? He changed it  to something else didn   t he? He wasn   t Wilt Chamberlain when he got in  the pros. He changed it to   I can   t remember.  I think the Lew Alcinder that changed     Yeah, well he took a Muslim name or something. He wasn   t Wilt    The  Stilt    anymore. But that was his nickname in college, Wilt    The Stilt     Chamberlain. Mel Wright was   in fact Eddie Sutton was on that team.  He was a player. But the score was tied up and just went back   it was  the most perfect basketball game I ever saw. I think there was only one  21  Gill  Holt  Gill  foul in the whole game. It was almost a perfect game. Very, very tight.  They would score than they would score   and just back and forth the  whole deal. It came down to seven minutes of the game. The picture  they took of the end when it was over and the ball was going towards the  hoop and Wilt was looking at it as it went over his head   do you  remember that? It   s in that calendar. You   ll get that calendar, it   s in that  calendar. I was behind that camera sitting back up there in this corner.  Seven minutes before, the score was tied up and they froze the ball. It  was on the south end, and Mel Wright was standing out there just  dribbling, froze it. For seven minutes  It seemed like an eternity.  Students   everybody was standing up just screaming at the top of their  voice. You couldn   t hear anything. With about six or seven seconds left  on the clock you could hear Hank Iba stand up and holler,    SHOOT       And you could hear him above the crowd now and they were all  screaming. Mel Wright shot and the guy jumped and it missed his finger  tips about three inches, or he would have blocked the shot. Just as it  went through the basket, the buzzer went off and we beat them by two  points. They only lost two games that whole year, Kansas did. That one  and the national   the last game of the national finals are the only two  games they lost all year.  Great memories. Any thoughts about Boone Pickens and his academic  gifts that he   s made recently? Pride in that as alum?  Oh yeah. You bet. I was glad they were able to keep the framework of  the stadium. That they didn   t have to tear it all down and start over, they  could utilize   I think that   s a real credit to the architects that designed  the whole thing, to be able to save the framework and use that, it saved  them a lot of money. It meant a lot to have that in the heart of that  stadium. It   s beautiful and everything and you hardly even know it   s  there. But they utilized it. Sandblasted to paint it and covered a lot of it  in concrete. But it   s great. It really is a credit to them to be able to do  that. You know this last game with Texas A M, I walked in and they  had finally finished the west end. I mean, just that difference. It was just  like you   re in a different stadium. It just made that much difference. It  was   it changed a lot before that but when they closed that west end in  and they put all those suites up there and everything, you had a whole  different feel. It   s just amazing. Just took your breath away. I talked to a  few people from Texas A M that had been here before, who had been  here the year before last when we played them, and they said this is  beautiful. They just couldn   t believe how pretty it is. It   s Class A, I  mean it   s really top class.  We   ve covered a lot of things, and I really appreciate it. Is there  anything that we haven   t covered that you would like to share? Are there  22  Holt  Gill  Holt  Gill  any special memories or things you have?  Well yes, there is something. I mentioned that Frank Eaton died fifty  years ago. That   s the fifty year memory of him. Pistol Pete started fifty  years ago, that   s fifty years. The other fifty involves me, and that is     God used my time at OSU in the soils department to give me technical  background about planting and sowing and reaping and harvesting.  There   s a lot of chapters and verses in the Bible about that. There   s a lot  of different stories about sowing and reaping and so God put me at  Oklahoma A M College which became OSU to get that technical  background and learn technically about sowing and reaping. And that  was one part. There were three parts and one was I was raised on a farm  so I got a lot of firsthand experience about sowing and reaping, and then  technical experience at OSU on sowing and reaping, and then plus added  all the scripture in the Bible. So all three of those things, in a fifty year  from 1954 to 2004 I came up with   I put all that together in a notebook  called the    Parable of the Sower    to explain that parable. So I   m giving  ya   ll a copy of that today.  I look back now and I just realized that this month, after looking back  and seeing the whole picture that it was God   s choice for me to be there  to get that technical knowledge. He chose Oklahoma A M College out  of all the universities in the entire world, for me to get that training. So  to me, that   s God   s approval about that school. I think that I had a part of  sowing some seed in that football team. And you   ll read that in that  story, in that notebook I gave you. So if that   s true, we may be  experiencing the harvest that we sowed seed fifty years ago on that  football team, on that field. So if that   s true we   re going to see a lot of  amazing things happen on that football field.  And we   re ready for it. Well Jack, thank you     We   ll see if that   s the case.  We appreciate it very much. This concludes our interview. Thank You.  -------  -------
