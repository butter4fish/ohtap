DUNHAM: Today is July 6, 2014, and this is Tape 1 with Mary Giannone. We&#039;re here
in her lovely home in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Thank you so much for inviting
us today. We usually start at the beginning, so what is your full name and date
of birth?

GIANNONE: Mary Maietta Giannone.

DUNHAM: Is Mietta your maiden name?

GIANNONE: Mary Maietta is my maiden name; Giannone is my married name. I was
born in Burlington, November 21, 1920. So now you know how old I am.

DUNHAM: So you have a birthday coming up this fall.

GIANNONE: Right. I&#039;ll be ninety-five.

DUNHAM: Can you tell me a little bit about your family history? Do you know when
your family first came to the United States, how far back?

GIANNONE: My mother was a child when she came to the States, and she grew up
here, more or less. My dad came here from Naples, Italy when he was a young man,
nineteen or twenty years old, I don&#039;t know exactly. They were both immigrants;
they didn&#039;t speak English at all. My mother more or less grew up here; she was a
child when she came over. They were married in Burlington, and my father was
kind of--I don&#039;t know what you would call him--a tile setter in different
churches. He was a simple, quiet man, rather tall. Mama was small. They had
eleven children. They were all born and brought up in Burlington.

DUNHAM: Where do you fall in the eleven children?

GIANNONE: I fall as the third.

DUNHAM: What brought them to Burlington?

GIANNONE: Workwise. I had an uncle who came from Italy also, and he worked on
the railroad. The Italians came over to help to build all the railroads, and my
dad worked for them. Then he didn&#039;t like it, so he went into a different
occupation. They were a quiet Italian family. I lived in an area where there
were groups of Italians, mostly from Italy, and they were quiet people. I can&#039;t
say too much about the family background other than they enjoyed being here in America.

DUNHAM: Your mom came young, so did she come with her parents?

GIANNONE: Yes, she came with her mother.

DUNHAM: Did you know your grandparents on her side?

GIANNONE: I just knew my grandmother; my grandfather had died over there in
Italy. I don&#039;t know too much about the background of my father&#039;s side because he
was very quiet and withdrawn. He came from a poor family and didn&#039;t want to go
back there. There was nothing there for him. Mama came from a very well-off
settled family. Her father was in the jewelry business. Other than that they
were very close-mouthed. You know what I&#039;m saying. Very deep involved in their
own way of life. But they were good people, honest people, hard working.

My school days were in Burlington. I&#039;m a graduate of Catholic High School. I
come from a Catholic family.

DUNHAM: Was your school predominantly Italian American then?

GIANNONE: No.

DUNHAM: What was the mix of your school?

GIANNONE: It was just Irish. I went to an Irish Catholic School. Eventually
also--I must say this--my parents gradually began to learn to speak English.
When they came over here they were young, they were ignorant. Other than
finishing school, high school, two years after finishing high school I met my husband.

DUNHAM: Could I just interrupt you for a moment? How were the Depression years
for your family?

GIANNONE: Those were very sad years, very hard, 1930s, I don&#039;t remember too much
of that.

DUNHAM: But you had eleven siblings among you, so was it--?

GIANNONE: Yeah, as I said, my father was a hard-working man. He would work seven
days a week. My mother was a good, decent, honest woman. Quiet. That was their
style of life, Dave. They didn&#039;t have money to go anywhere. They didn&#039;t have a
car. They didn&#039;t have anything--we didn&#039;t know what it was to go to a movie
because there was no money. We were poor. But we were clean and decent. That&#039;s
what made me proud.

DUNHAM: What was life like in Burlington in that time? Can you describe it?

GIANNONE: At that time, like all American small towns, quiet hardworking people,
everybody being neighborly, friendly. The Italians grouped, more or less stayed
by themselves. Most of them were laborers, or they worked on the railroad to
build up the railroad.

My brothers and sisters were very quiet. That&#039;s the way we were brought up.
There was no such thing as what you hear today: gangs, people not getting along.
You didn&#039;t hear that. People helped each other, they respected each other. This
was America. And those who came from Europe were glad to be here. That&#039;s how my
parents felt.

DUNHAM: Did most of the children in your community go to the Catholic school
that was predominantly Irish? Yeah, so there was a fair number of Italians, but
the majority were Irish.

GIANNONE: It was a mixture, Dave. People just were quiet and minded their own
business. They helped each other. Food was cheap. Stuff like that.

DUNHAM: Did you learn Italian growing up?

GIANNONE: Yes, I speak Italian. Parlo Italiano, poco.DUNHAM: Did you ever have
to do translation--or your siblings--translation for your parents?

GIANNONE: No, because my mother and father spoke Italian among themselves, but
they made a mistake in not teaching their kids enough Italian. They wanted to
learn to be Americans. That was the way the immigrants came. Even today the
immigrants come and they want to learn American; they want to speak English, in
other words. No, they were just proud to be here, Dave. It&#039;s all I can say.

DUNHAM: Do you know what parts of Italy they came from or where your family--?

GIANNONE: Yes. My people were from Naples. My husband&#039;s people were from Sicily,
which is south of Italy.

DUNHAM: You never went though as a child to Italy.

GIANNONE: No.

DUNHAM: But later in life you&#039;ve had a chance to visit a couple of times.

GIANNONE: Right.

DUNHAM: Your one grandmother that you did know, did she live in Burlington with you?

GIANNONE: Yes, she did.

DUNHAM: What was life like for her?

GIANNONE: Hard. Because she came here--her first husband died in Italy, she came
here due to the fact that one of her brothers helped to bring her here. She was
a widow with three children. She settled here, bought her own home, took in
borders to get along. Life was poor in those days, but it was clean and decent.

DUNHAM: She had her own place and borders there in Burlington. Was she nearby,
though, in the same neighborhood?

GIANNONE: Yes, right.

DUNHAM: Having eleven children, your dad was working seven days a week. It must
have been very demanding on your mom.

GIANNONE: It was.

DUNHAM: You were third oldest. Did you play a role in helping raise your younger siblings?

GIANNONE: Not really. My mother was a strong, independent woman. She took care
of us good. She had her good days and bad days like all women do. [laughs]

DUNHAM: What would a typical day have been like for your mother when you were
growing up?

GIANNONE: Dave, what a question to ask a woman. It&#039;s hard. She worked. She took
care of us. She fed us. She cooked.

DUNHAM: It&#039;s hard to imagine now. I&#039;m trying to imaging having eleven children
in the 1930s.

GIANNONE: They didn&#039;t have electric dishwashers, they didn&#039;t have electric
washing machines, we didn&#039;t know what television was. We were lucky if we had a
small radio. That was life, Dave.

DUNHAM: When you weren&#039;t in school what did you did for fun? I know money was
tight, you didn&#039;t go to the movies and stuff, but--

GIANNONE: If I had a nickel to go to the movies, Dave, I was lucky.

DUNHAM: What did you do instead?

GIANNONE: My enjoyment in life was, I used to love to roller skate, ice skate.
When I was in high school I was kind of athletic.

DUNHAM: What did you play?

GIANNONE: I played basketball for four years.

DUNHAM: That&#039;s our favorite sport.

GIANNONE: I played basketball for four years. I love music; I was in a choir,
all-state choir. I was just the average high school girl. But I loved it. I
loved it. All my brothers and sisters were the same way. Except my oldest
sister. She didn&#039;t&#039; care for school so much. She went to work in the mills. But
my brothers and my other sisters, they all fought their way through, with
school. School was important.

DUNHAM: What was Catholic school like then?

GIANNONE: Wonderful. Quiet. A lot of art. You didn&#039;t hear about what you hear
about today, gangs of kids on the streets. Life wasn&#039;t like that. Life was more
or less very American, very quiet, everybody working, doing their share of everything.

DUNHAM: What year did you graduate high school?

GIANNONE: Nineteen thirty-nine.

DUNHAM: What came next for you then?

GIANNONE: The war was creeping from Europe; Hitler was getting dangerous.
America was trying to stay out of it, minding our own business. By the time &#039;40,
&#039;41 rolled around, Dave, it was getting frightening. Boys were getting taken out
of school, out of college. A lot of it seems so far away, but I was a happy
young woman, especially when I met my husband.

DUNHAM: Which was after the war started?

GIANNONE: No. Ralph was--it was 1940, &#039;41.

DUNHAM: Did he grow up in Burlington?

GIANNONE: No, Ralph was a Middlebury, Vermont boy. But he went to UVM after he
graduated from Middlebury High School. He was an athlete. He played football for
four years; he won a scholarship. He loved school. He played football when he
was in college. So then the war was getting bad. It was getting bad, so a lot of
the boys were volunteering. As I said before, Ralph would volunteer, but he was
going to school. As I said before, he beat the draft by one day. There&#039;s a
picture over there that shows you where he was saying goodbye to me.

DUNHAM: We&#039;ll take a photo of that. How did you meet?

GIANNONE: How did I meet him? That&#039;s a long story, David. I was working
in--remember the story about the old Woolworth stores? And Kresge&#039;s?DUNHAM: I
don&#039;t know Kresge&#039;s.

GIANNONE: Well, that was another big company like Woolworth. I was torn
between--when I got out of high school I went into office work for a while. I
didn&#039;t like it, and the war was getting bad. So I thought, &quot;I&#039;m going to
volunteer to work in the defense plants.&quot; And I did. We had to be trained. Now
remember, you&#039;re in a dark area. All over the country was dark. Anything that
was done, it was done at night time. So we used to have to get up in the morning
to meet this truck. They would pick up girls who were volunteering to go to the
school to be trained to learn how to work on these necessary, I would say, gears
that the boys would use and need. As we were trained we were shipped to a
special plant. And the plant we were shipped to from Vermont was from Burlington
to Springfield, Vermont. I worked in the plant for one year--

DUNHAM: This is the Fellows Gear Shaper Company?

GIANNONE: Yes, in Springfield.

DUNHAM: So the training, you could have gone to several different companies from
where you trained?

GIANNONE: Here from Vermont we had our own big plant, so it was Gear Shaping.
But I had a dear friend who went all the way to California because she wanted to
get into one of the big plants out there. These are the girls who worked on the
planes themselves. But with me, the girls I worked with, we were trained to work
on these big machines in these big factories. Like I told you in my letter, the
plant never closed.

DUNHAM: How long was the training, do you remember?

GIANNONE: About a week.

DUNHAM: And were you paid during the training?

GIANNONE: Oh, yes. If you earned ten dollars in those days you were earning big
money. This is how we were trained, by going to one of these schools. They
called them schools.

DUNHAM: Did you join a union?

GIANNONE: No.

DUNHAM: Were all the people in your training local, or were some people coming
from other parts of the country?

GIANNONE: No, the girls--if you were from Vermont, like my sister-in-law, she
trained, she worked with me. I had a dear friend who worked the night shift. But
mostly--in the plant at night there was mostly the men that worked. The girls
worked during the day. It was frightening, Dave. It was hard.

DUNHAM: How was it frightening?

GIANNONE: It was frightening because we had to get up at 5:00 in the morning to
be in the plant by six o&#039;clock, and it was dark. You&#039;d work until noon. You&#039;d
have your lunch. And remember, we had to wear uniforms, and as you see [shows a
photo] that&#039;s the way we looked.

DUNHAM: Can you describe the uniforms you wore?

GIANNONE: Yes, it was like a blue dungaree, like a blue linen, whatever you want
to call it. And shawls on our heads, just like you see the pictures of Rosies.
They were calling us Rosie the Riveters because we girls worked on these big
machines. We made gears. Different types of gears that went on the planes, the
tanks, the big trucks, the Jeeps, and all of our stuff was--

DUNHAM: How did you make them? What were you actually doing?

GIANNONE: I worked on a machine, a duo-press, and this machine was big. You were
given these gears. They were not finished, and the machine you worked on
finished these drills. Now, the men worked on the big gears. The women worked on
the small gears.

DUNHAM: When you first started working there were any of the men giving any of
the women a hard time? Sometimes we&#039;ve heard--

GIANNONE: Yeah. No, it was not like that. No. The women were shown very much
respect. Because we were needed. Let&#039;s face it, we were needed. Our boys were
all going over there.

DUNHAM: You said frightening. Frightening in what way?

GIANNONE: What was frightening was when night fell, everything was dark. There
was nothing open.

DUNHAM: Right, It was blackouts and you had to cover your headlights.

GIANNONE: Exactly. And you peek out the window, and you see these men walking
the streets to check to see if everybody&#039;s house was closed, dark. Because
Burlington had the air base, Ethan Allen Air Base, the fear of planes coming
overhead was scary. Every house had a star in their windows to show that they
had a boy who was in the service. That was hard for many mothers to see their
young boys, nineteen-year-olds! They were drafted, the war was so bad.

DUNHAM: That was particularly hard for your mom.

GIANNONE: It was. It wasn&#039;t only for my mom. All moms, and sisters, and young
brothers. But it was war, and we were proud to fight.

DUNHAM: How did you get news of the war and/or stay in touch with your loved ones?

GIANNONE: I don&#039;t think--they had the big theaters that showed--you&#039;d go to the
theater for a nickel or a dime, and you&#039;d see on the Pathé News it would show
you what they were able to get there in the wars. And there was the great Ernie
Pyle, who was a reporter.

DUNHAM: I saw the article you sent. Can you tell us about him?

GIANNONE: He went out to the Pacific, little bit of a guy, and he took pictures
and shipped them back to the States. That&#039;s how we saw--and sometimes we&#039;d get
the news report by the papers. There was no TV. None of this modern stuff you
see today. We didn&#039;t have that. We didn&#039;t have that. Life was quiet in those
days, so different from today, so different.

DUNHAM: I know your family, Italian Americans, several of you serving, and all
in the community around you. But were there ever, since the Executive Order 9066
did come out and mostly affected Japanese who were incarcerated. But did you
ever hear of any Italian Americans or German Americans out here who were incarcerated--

GIANNONE: No, mostly the Japanese people. Because of the attack on America. We
did no harm to them.

DUNHAM: In your community did you--you had relatives back home too. Was there
ever any challenge of communication or worrying about them over there since
Italy was also on the other side?

GIANNONE: There was a bitterness that the Italian Americans felt against the
people over there. Mussolini became--well, I think very hard to say that. But he
got involved with Hitler, and it was a big mistake on his part. The American
Italians resented what he did to America. There was a bitterness against Germany
at the time. It was hard, and it took many, many Americans a long time to
appreciate what the Germans were at the time. I&#039;m not going to say any more than
that, Dave, because that goes way back.

DUNHAM: I don&#039;t want to belabor this much more, but we have a relevant
researcher who&#039;s really interested in the Italian American community. Were there
any--that you&#039;re aware of, and maybe among the elders in the community too--who
had any split within your community?

GIANNONE: Not in my community, not in Burlington, Vermont. In fact, I feel this
way: all Italian Americans, Irish Americans, English Americans, they&#039;re
practically American. This was a land of opportunity.

DUNHAM: Yeah, I appreciate that. I&#039;m wondering too if despite the fact that you
had sons in the military, daughters serving in the plants, did you or others
that you know of ever experience any prejudice towards Italian Americans, again
because of presumption?GIANNONE: Never, never, never. If there were I knew
nothing about it. No, there was no resentment, Dave. We were proud to be
Americans. We were proud to know that our country was being protected.

DUNHAM: No, I understand that. Sometimes, even if you are doing that, it doesn&#039;t
mean that somebody&#039;s not going to single you out based on your ethnicity.

GIANNONE: If they were, Dave, I know nothing about it. That&#039;s the honest truth.

DUNHAM: You were starting to tell me--you said it was a long story--how you met
your husband. Was that connected to your working at Fellows?

GIANNONE: No. Ralph was at school when I met him. He was in his third year at
UVM, and he used to come into the store where I worked. He was looking for
another girl. Finally he saw me. He kept coming back. [laughs] That&#039;s how I met
my husband.

DUNHAM: What store was that?

GIANNONE: Kresge&#039;s.

DUNHAM: And then you started dating in the early part of the war, this is?

GIANNONE: This was in 1942. I married him in 1943 when he was able to get off
the base. Then I followed him to Maxwell Field on a troop train.

DUNHAM: What was that like, riding on a troop train?

GIANNONE: Wonderful. I was the only woman. I was still in my bridal outfit.

DUNHAM: Was he with you?

GIANNONE: Yes. That&#039;s the respect the men had for women. I was the only woman on
this train from Burlington, Vermont all the way to Maxwell Field. I stayed on
the base with him until he was shipped back to Maine. Then he was back to me, I
followed him, and then I couldn&#039;t follow any longer because I was carrying my
own first child. Then from Maine Ralph was shipped all the way back to Georgia.
From Georgia he was shipped overseas.

DUNHAM: When you went down to Maxwell Field--that&#039;s Alabama?

GIANNONE: Maxwell Field, Alabama.

DUNHAM: What was life like for you there? How long were you there, and what was
it like?

GIANNONE: It was great.

DUNHAM: Were you just on the base, or were you in the community too?

GIANNONE: I was on the base for a while, and then when the war was getting real
bad--this was 1943 now--we were not allowed to be on the base any longer. So I
had to come home.

DUNHAM: But did you get out in the community in Alabama at all?

GIANNONE: No, it was dark at night. There was no social life going on in those days.

DUNHAM: So you&#039;ve already worked at Fellows at this time, or is this before you
went to work at Fellows?

GIANNONE: No, this was after--I was married by this time.

DUNHAM: So it was after you were working at Kresge but while you were dating
when you started working at Fellows. Is that correct?

GIANNONE: Yes. I left Kresge&#039;s to go up to Fellows. And Fellows is still
operating today, I think. I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m not sure

DUNHAM: I looked it up, but I wasn&#039;t sure about that. I know the founder, Mr.
Fellows, passed near the end of the war, I see. So you worked the day shift your
whole time there; is that right?

GIANNONE: Day shift.

DUNHAM: You mentioned lunch, twelve o&#039;clock. Did they have any type of events or
music or patriotic type of things?

GIANNONE: Nothing like that.

DUNHAM: How many of you were working on a team together?

GIANNONE: I can&#039;t remember how many women. But it was wonderful. Everybody was
willing to help. This was our home. We were attacked.

DUNHAM: Sometimes things happened; do know how injuries were handled when they
occurred? If someone had an injury on the job.GIANNONE: They had doctors and
nurses right there to take care if anybody got hurt on the big machines.

DUNHAM: What was the most challenging part about working at Fellows?

GIANNONE: That&#039;s hard to answer. I think the most challenging thing was you were
scared because everything was so dark at night, and during the day.

DUNHAM: How long a ride was that in the truck that you came down in?

GIANNONE: From Burlington to Springfield? Maybe three hours, three-hour
ride.DUNHAM: That was five days a week?

GIANNONE: Oh, no. When you left school and you were brought to Springfield you
had to find a place to stay. The plant would be about a fifteen-minute walk from
where you lived.

DUNHAM: I thought it was too far to commute, but I didn&#039;t get that, so that&#039;s an
important distinction.

GIANNONE: I left the plant because my husband was able to get a furlough, and we
had planned to get married the first furlough he got. So I left the plant to
come back to Burlington to get married.

DUNHAM: So let&#039;s talk about Springfield a little bit because you&#039;ve lived in
Burlington your whole life. Is this your first time--where did you live in
Springfield? Did you have shared housing with other workers?

GIANNONE: Yes. People opened up their homes to accommodate girls, and men, who
were leaving their homes to work in the plants. I think that went for every
state that was associated with helping out during the war. Then there were the
people that were helping out, the movie stars. They were trying to sell the
bonds over the radios, through the movies, the war bonds.

DUNHAM: What was life in Springfield like? Who did you stay with?

GIANNONE: I stayed with my sister-in-law because she worked also on the day shift.

DUNHAM: So not with another family, but she had her own place.

GIANNONE: No, no. We boarded out. See, people opened up their homes. Say I had a
big house and girls were in town looking for a place to stay. This is what it
was like.

DUNHAM: And the two of you stayed with the same family there. Okay. And you say
you had about a fifteen-minute walk to work.

GIANNONE: About that.

DUNHAM: We haven&#039;t talked at all about winters in Vermont. Winters can be very
hard, right? How was that?

GIANNONE: You coped with it. We&#039;re Northerners, you know? You get used to the cold.

DUNHAM: Was Springfield about the same as Burlington?

GIANNONE: Oh, yes. Exactly.Fukumoto:What was your job at the plant?

GIANNONE: I was a drill press--I worked on a press machine that was called a
presser, that made, helped make gears.

Fukumoto:What did you actually do; did you have the tools, and you were--

GIANNONE: Yes, you were trained that way. You had to measure the gears that you
were making to adjust to your machine. And you worked with magnesium.

DUNHAM: Were you working in pairs or as individuals?

GIANNONE: Each girl had her own machine.

DUNHAM: How long were your shifts? Eight hours with a lunch break?

GIANNONE: We had to be at the plant at six o&#039;clock, and you had lunch at noon.
You got off at 5:30, six o&#039;clock so the night shift could come in.

DUNHAM: So you worked like eleven hours or so; is that right?

GIANNONE: We worked long hours.

DUNHAM: So they didn&#039;t have three shifts; they just had two shifts. The day
shift and night--

GIANNONE: As far as I remember, yes.

DUNHAM: Did you ever have any problems with how the night shift left things, on
your equipment or anything?

GIANNONE: No. Everybody did their own thing. You had that feeling, &quot;I&#039;m helping
the boys.&quot; This war&#039;s got to come to an end. It was frightening, Dave. It was.

DUNHAM: So this was this clear sense of patriotism. But you also were making
much better money.

GIANNONE: [laughs] Well, I remember coming home one day, and my envelope had
sixty dollars in it. Because you worked a long time, long hours. And that was
big money in those days.

Fukumoto:What did you do with it? Did you save it?

GIANNONE: Not really. I gave most of it to my mother and father.

DUNHAM: You still had a lot of younger siblings who were still in school.

GIANNONE: Right. Right.DUNHAM: Most of your co-workers were from Vermont?

GIANNONE: Yes.

DUNHAM: You mentioned one that went out to California.

GIANNONE: That was a dear friend of mine.

DUNHAM: Do you know much about her experience, how it went from there?

GIANNONE: No, because once Jean left here I never--

DUNHAM: You think she went to Southern California maybe to one of the aircraft
companies, Douglas maybe?

GIANNONE: Douglas. Jean worked in Douglas. She wrote me a couple of letters, and
then I didn&#039;t hear from her any more. She never came east again. She just loved
it out there.

DUNHAM: How did Springfield and Burlington change during the war?

GIANNONE: Burlington didn&#039;t really change for a good many years. I left
Burlington in 1957 when my husband went and visited us here in Pittsfield. I
can&#039;t tell you too much about Springfield because it mostly involved working all
the time. There was no vacation with pay, none of that. People just were willing
to work.

DUNHAM: Did you have weekends off?

GIANNONE: You had Sunday off.

DUNHAM: You were working six days a week. What did you do on Sundays?

GIANNONE: Rest. Wash clothes. Clean your uniform for Monday morning.

DUNHAM: Did things change in terms of what food you were able to have access to
during the war, what things you were eating?

GIANNONE: Yes. You couldn&#039;t have butter. Very little meat. Vegetables you could
have plenty, but most of the stuff was saved and sent to the boys.

DUNHAM: Did you most miss anything?

GIANNONE: Not really. I was never a big eater.

DUNHAM: Did you grow up having traditional Italian meals, or what types of
things did you grow up with?

GIANNONE: Half and half, Dave. Half and half.DUNHAM: Once your husband was--when
you were separated while he was in the military could you correspond with him?

GIANNONE: All the time. I had such calluses on my fingers I&#039;ve still got it.
[laughs] I wrote letters every day. When the boys wrote letters, their letters
were censored. They couldn&#039;t tell you where they were.

DUNHAM: Would they literally have sections crossed out?

GIANNONE: Oh, yes, definitely. Especially when my brother Frank, who was in the
infantry, was stationed in Florida all his letters were crossed out. Then, of
course, when the boys were shipped overseas, you didn&#039;t get any mail. Everything
was censored. One good thing--I must say this before we end this--we had the
best president in the world. Roosevelt.

DUNHAM: Tell about how you felt about President Roosevelt.

GIANNONE: He was great, brave.

DUNHAM: Did you listen to his addresses?

GIANNONE: All the time. On the radio. People respected him; they admired him. He
was a true democrat. He was a good man. And his wife Eleanor. In fact, I think
Reagan makes you think a little bit of like Roosevelt was. A deep, devoted
president. Enough of that.DUNHAM: I know you had your uniform that was for work.
What you wore in your non-work time, which I know there wasn&#039;t a lot of, did
that change at all during the war years. Sometimes I&#039;ve heard that women&#039;s
fashion began to change.

GIANNONE: Dress for women did not change. It isn&#039;t like today. Women went to
church with a hat on--let&#039;s put it that way--and were dressed. The girls in my
days, you didn&#039;t wear dungarees. You wore your skirts. In other words you looked
like a woman. And the boys were the same way.

DUNHAM: When you got back up to Burlington and you were pregnant with your first
daughter what was that like? Were you living back with your parents?

GIANNONE: Right. Because where could I go? I couldn&#039;t wait for my husband to
come home.

DUNHAM: How was that? Can you describe what health care was like and that
process was like back then?

GIANNONE: In those days it was hard because you were separated from your
husband, and girls from their boyfriends, not knowing if and when they were
coming home. The experience I had watching my brother Frank come home seriously
injured, good thing he wasn&#039;t married. I was fortunate that my husband came home
alive and safe. My brother-in-law Mario, who was in the Marines and fought in
the Pacific, he was fortunate. He won&#039;t talk about what he experienced because
it was too horrifying.

DUNHAM: What about your husband? Where was he during the war years?

GIANNONE: They shipped him from one place to the other. He was office personnel
in the Air Force.

DUNHAM: Did he stay domestic, then, or did he go overseas?

GIANNONE: My husband went to Panama. He followed the troops that he was
associated with.

DUNHAM: And then he was in a little after the war, you said.

GIANNONE: No, my husband came home in 1945.

DUNHAM: Oh, he did get to. Do you remember hearing about when the Italians
surrendered in &#039;43? Was that notable for you and your community?

GIANNONE: You&#039;ve got me there, Dave. I can&#039;t remember the exact date. It was, I
think, in 1944. I&#039;m not sure.

DUNHAM: I&#039;d read that they surrendered September 8, 1943. So I just wondered--

GIANNONE: I was married in 1943. It was shortly after I was married that the
Italians did what they did to Mussolini. They were angry at him for what he did
getting Italy involved in the war. But you know, France and Britain, the
English, were good allies. The boys from Australia. In other words, I always
felt that everybody tried to do the best they could.

DUNHAM: When did you give birth to your first daughter?

GIANNONE: Nineteen forty-five.

DUNHAM: When was it?

GIANNONE: It was in January. We were cold, all alone, and my husband didn&#039;t see
her until--oh, my God, I was still in the hospital, she was a matter of days
being born.

DUNHAM: So he was able to come visit.

GIANNONE: Yes. But then he had to go right back to Alabama. Then he didn&#039;t see
her again until she was walking. See, that was the fear that we women at that
time lived with, was the fear of not having them come home. Because we used to
hear so much. The invasion in Normandy was terrible.

DUNHAM: What were those first months of raising--was your mom able to help?

GIANNONE: No, when my husband came home--I was still with my mother and
father--he quickly in the middle of winter went searching for a place for me to
stay until he got really free from the service.

DUNHAM: How did you first hear about the job with Fellows, or the training
opportunity? Did you see images of Rosie the Riveter and that type of thing back
at that time?

GIANNONE: No. Rosie the Riveter didn&#039;t start until we girls were already at the
plant and the girls who worked on bigger machines and stuff like that. No. Let
me think.

DUNHAM: Do you remember seeing those images later in the war at that time, or
after the war?

GIANNONE: After the war.

DUNHAM: How do you feel about--?

GIANNONE: Proud. Proud that I did my share.DUNHAM: You mentioned some of the
other women went on to work on the bigger machines. So if you had stayed there
longer, do you think you might have as well?

GIANNONE: Maybe, if I&#039;d stayed. But once I got married I didn&#039;t want to go back.
I wanted to follow my husband.

DUNHAM: Did you keep in touch with any of the women--did your sister-in-law
continue to work there?

GIANNONE: She did, because she was still single. My friend Millie, who
worked--these girls are all passed away now--she did the same thing.

DUNHAM: Now you had already met your husband, but were some of those women
dating, either there, meeting folks at the company--?

GIANNONE: No. My sister-in-law Mary was not involved yet with anybody. She had a
lot of responsibilities to take care two younger brothers and a sister. That was
her reason to finally give up. My friend Millie Auclair, she just worked a
certain length of time; I don&#039;t remember how long she worked. But she&#039;s no
longer with me now either.

DUNHAM: Looking back, the experience at Fellows, do you think that impacted you
for the rest--?

GIANNONE: Ever.

DUNHAM: Tell me about that.

GIANNONE: It stuck with me. It&#039;s because--I think it was the being alone so long
and having dear ones over there. Remember I had a brother-in-law, husband, and
brothers. Then after that war I had a brother who fought in the Korean War, and
one in the Navy. And my brother Joe also, who was a Marine. My brother Joe, he&#039;s
still living. And my brother-in-law Mario, he&#039;s still living. Both these boys
were Marines. Any questions there, Dave?

DUNHAM: I&#039;m looking through your notes because you wrote such a lovely
introduction. Let me ask, if you don&#039;t mind, when your brother Frank came home
severely wounded I know it was of course hard on your mom and all of you--

GIANNONE: He wasn&#039;t bitter. No, he was proud. He did his share. He was a
wonderful young man. A lot of them were young men. I had a brother-in-law who
was in the Navy; he was so proud to be there. In fact he was seventeen years
old, he lied about his age, he wanted to get in. And he loved the Navy.

DUNHAM: Did any of the women who worked at the Fellows plant, did any of them
lie about their age to get in, do you know? Did you have to be eighteen there?

GIANNONE: No.

DUNHAM: Sometimes--I&#039;ve heard stories where employers were more than happy to
look the other way, same as the military probably was.

GIANNONE: I don&#039;t know.

DUNHAM: Looking back on the other women who worked there at Fellows and
elsewhere you&#039;ve heard about working, how do you think it might have impacted
opportunities for women and impacted their lives going forward?

GIANNONE: I think it made women more courageous, more than--&quot;I can do it.&quot; A lot
of girls did men&#039;s jobs. There was only one thing that a lot of girls picked up
the habit--girls didn&#039;t smoke in those days; they began to smoke. Some, not all.
But some. I don&#039;t think, Dave, that anybody felt resentful. They were willing.
We all were willing. Yes, it was hard to see our young men come home crippled,
stuff like that. But it was war. What could you do?

DUNHAM: Some women we&#039;ve talked to--I know you were already married and with
child--were working up till the end of the war and then didn&#039;t necessarily want
to give up their jobs, or couldn&#039;t necessarily afford to give up their jobs.

GIANNONE: That I don&#039;t know too much about. I was one of the lucky ones. My
husband came home, and he took care of me and my young daughter and got involved
in working and tried going back to school to finish in night school, so as to
finish his senior year at UVM. But it was too much for him. He couldn&#039;t do it.
So he just gave it up and went into business for himself in the restaurant
business in Vermont. Then we left Vermont because he had a bigger opportunity
here in Pittsfield. We came in 1957, and we&#039;ve been in Pittsfield--what, this is
2014, so we&#039;ve been here a long time in Pittsfield.

DUNHAM: You raised your children--

GIANNONE: Well, three of my girls were born in Burlington, and my youngest was
born here. I&#039;ve been fortunate. I have very good girls. They were quiet girls,
they did what they had to do, they were well-educated.

DUNHAM: Was there anything else, before we close today, that you&#039;d like to
share, either about the war years or in time since then?

GIANNONE: No, I think this has been a privilege to have you come here. How I got
involved with Rosie the Riveter is somehow I&#039;ve--oh, I heard about the
convention that was going to be held in California, so I wrote to the office and
said I was a Rosie the Riveter member. That&#039;s how I got involved.

DUNHAM: Have you visited the national park out in Richmond?

GIANNONE: No, the invitation came in 2010, but I couldn&#039;t go. It was too far.

DUNHAM: Well, you&#039;re always welcome. There&#039;s a beautiful national park there
with stories like yours, and soon your story will be there too.

GIANNONE: Really?

DUNHAM: It&#039;s a beautiful park, and it has permanent exhibits now up.

GIANNONE: It&#039;s in Richmond. Is it a big area?

DUNHAM: Richmond went from 20,000 to 120,000 people during the war. There aren&#039;t
that many people there now, but, with the Kaiser Shipyards mostly, it was--they
had four shipyards there, and it was really booming--

GIANNONE: And is the Douglas plant still open, the plant that Jean worked in?

DUNHAM: Douglas down south. Yes, Douglas is still active, and in fact there&#039;s
one woman who still works part time who was there in the war years who got some
press recently.

GIANNONE: Well, you must have pictures of girls working on planes.

DUNHAM: Yes, absolutely.

GIANNONE: I was sure you did because my friend Jean went there, and she made big
bucks. [laughs] Never came back either.

DUNHAM: We&#039;ve interviewed several, and there were several other projects. Well,
is there anything else you&#039;d like to ask?

GIANNONE: I just wanted to say, I bless all the doctors and nurses and all of
the ministers and rabbis and priests who were there to help our boys, and I just
feel that veterans should be taken care of. If there are any still in Walter
Reed Hospital, God bless them. And I&#039;ll end by just saying, I&#039;m just darn proud
to be an American.

DUNHAM: Thank you for sharing your story today.
