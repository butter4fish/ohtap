Speaker 1: First I'm going to ask you a couple of People magazine-ish type questions, and they'll go fairly quickly.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Soul food.  You want me to be more specific than that?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: All right, chicken livers are good.  I like salmon croquettes and grits and still eat 'em, you know.  Amy Ruth's [New York, New York] is a great place.  You got to find that place if you haven't been there.
Speaker 1: Yes.  What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The islands are good.  My wife [Aminta Griffith] is from Panama so that's a lovely place.
Speaker 1: And what's your favorite phrase or saying?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: It's stumping me on that one.  Favorite phrase.  Probably no, I don't have one that I would use over and over again now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  If you think of something while we're talking today (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --would you just revisit that?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 443122
Speaker 1: We'd like to talk first about your parents, I'd like to start with your mother.  If you could tell us your mother's name and perhaps spell it, and tell us where she was born?
Speaker 2: Minnette Tillman [Minnette Tillman Delph], born in Concord, North Carolina.  Tillman, T-I-L-L-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: And do you know anything about your mother's upbringing?  And did she tell you any tales about her youth that you could share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get a lot of family history from my folks.  It was, evidently, very uncomfortable down there in the South, and at that time, they weren't very comfortable about talking about it either.  A lot of horror stories, but they survived and got out of North Carolina.  My dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] was from Georgia, got out of there as soon as they could and came up to New York [New York] and they met up here.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your--what did your mother do?
Speaker 2: Mom worked in Chase Bank [Chase National Bank], that became Chase Manhattan [Chase Manhattan Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.], and what have you.  After my dad died, she went back to banking to get me through med school, very unselfishly.
Speaker 1: How did she become a banker or someone who worked in banking?
Speaker 2: She was one of the first black ladies to graduate from Hunter College [New York, New York] back, I guess, in the '20s [1920s] or maybe '30s [1930s], I guess, early '30s [1930s].  How she got into the banking, I'm not sure.  She was a very smart lady.
Speaker 1: So about what year would you say that your mother left North Carolina and came to New York?  You said they did as early as possible.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was born in 1914, right before World War I [WWI], and I'd imagine she got out of Concord by the time she was eighteen or so, so twenty years later, in the '30s [1930s].
Story_ID: 443123
Speaker 1: And your father, what's his name and when and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Also Dr. Walter Delph, Sr. [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.], born in Augusta, Georgia in 1895.
Speaker 1: And did he share with you any stories about his upbringing in Georgia?  I understand that you said that the pickings were slim but do you have any sense (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dad had some interesting stories, you know, but, you know, as far as roots, he didn't talk much about other family.  Evidently, a very small family down there, on my mother's [Minnette Tillman Delph] side also, but dad had a great story talking about, 'cause he was an old-fashioned general practitioner here in Harlem [New York, New York] and he'd do everything from deliver babies to, do minor surgery, and I remember him telling me about his circumcision.  You'll have to excuse urologists talking freely about these kind of things, but dad took a lot of pride in saying that he assisted in his own circumcision when he was probably about seventeen or eighteen.  That would have been something under local anesthesia (laughter).
Speaker 1: And how did your father come to become a doctor?  Where did he do his training?
Speaker 2: Dad was educated down there in Augusta and there was, evidently, a very famous school down there, Lucy Laney [Lucy Craft Laney High School, Augusta, Georgia] and where Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] started, in Augusta, Georgia, and then moved to Atlanta.  So, Augusta was very important for young blacks coming up and Lucy Laney [Lucy Craft Laney] was evidently a tough, you know, headmistress but she got a whole lot of folks educated, and dad was very smart.  It was classical education.  He had Greek and Latin as a kid.  Left Lucy Laney and went to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], and then Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] for med school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said here he was a general practitioner and I know that he was a real estate investor in New York [New York].  Was he involved in similar real estate endeavors before he came to New York?
Speaker 2: When he left Augusta, I get stories about my father all the time from people but no, there was no property down south on either side that I know of but dad did very well in Harlem in those days before health insurance and stuff, and all the politics and, of medicine, and send money back to Lucy Laney High School and supported the football team and everything.  He was a special guy.
Speaker 1: So, once he moved to New York and became a general practitioner, how long did he engage in that?  What was his career like be--
Speaker 2: His whole life.
Speaker 1: --before?
Speaker 2: His whole life.  He worked in medicine until he died, 1960, of stress along with, you know, he died at age sixty-five, a young man, but his whole life was general practice of medicine in Harlem.
Story_ID: 443124
Speaker 1: So how did he [Delph's father, Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] come to become involved in real estate development?
Speaker 2: He was smart, and you know, the monies that he would gather together, he would buy property in Queens [New York] or Long Island [New York] and in Harlem [New York, New York], and the most important thing that he did was, I like to tell the story this way that 1945 or so, shortly after I was born in 1944, dad decided, well, I've accumulated some cash here, and what am I going to do with it?  I want to do something.  I want to give back to the community, and those were the days when folks did look back and help others and did things unselfishly for the community.  So, dad, in 1939, left Striver's Row, and his office always was there on 139th Street, and moved the family up to Hamilton Terrace, just about four blocks away up on--where City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] is.  And we bought this brownstone and next to the brownstone, at 21, was a vacant lot and he said, "Well, I'm going to buy that and I'm going to put a building on it," and he got, I think it's George Tandy [sic. Vertner Woodson Tandy], the only real black architect in the city, to do the plans for this building, a seventy-two-unit apartment building [Ivey Delph Apartments, New York, New York] that he wanted to create moderate income housing for Harlem and, of course, Harlem was booming in those days and there were shortages of residential housing.  And dad was certainly probably the, I think the first man to get an FHA [Federal Housing Administration] mortgage from the government to do this building.  So he got the money and he started the building and found out very shortly why that lot was empty over all those years 'cause there was water running under it.  And so it was up on Sugar Hill [New York, New York], right, and so the water would run down the hill, down St. Nicholas [Avenue], and Harlem is--all over Harlem, underneath, there's lots of water tunnels going through.  And so as he was building this building, he ran into structural problems immediately and so he had to put in piles in so that doubled the cost of the building right there.  And then they ran into the water problems.  Got the building up, a lot of stress doing that, still running his practice, and then plumbing problems in the building and the boilers and so there was just one thing after the other.  And the stress of it, I think, took his life early.  In 1960, he passed.  Mom [Minnette Tillman Delph] tried to keep the building, kept it for another twelve years, but when I went off to the [U.S.] Air Force, in the '70s [1970s], she sold the building.  It still has his name, it's still standing there, grand building, and lucky to have some patients that are from there still.
Speaker 1: You mentioned that your father had accumulated some wealth, and so he was utilizing it to purchase real estate in some of the different boroughs.  Did he use any other monies or did he glean any support from other Harlem movers and shakers in order to put (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that's an interesting story too.
Speaker 1: --this building together?
Speaker 2: Dad was a loner, okay, he was not a joiner, and when he started running into money problems with this building and, you know, it's three-quarters finished, it had to get done, he reached out to some of the neighbors.  And the neighbors weren't so nice about coming forward and saying, yeah, well here's five thousand dollars or whatever but he got it done.  So, they kind of abandoned him there.  They were very proud of him once it finally got done and the opening was all there and all that, and the politicians came out and all that but it was quite a struggle for him, and my mother, too.
Speaker 1: How was he able to acquire the FHA mortgage funding?
Speaker 2: Well that was all done before it got started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everything was fine.  I don't know.  I know he had to go down to Washington [D.C.] and they chose him to testify in front of the housing authority, or something like that, in those days, we have those papers, but actually how he got that politically, well, he was connected.  So, you know, the folks here liked the idea and I'm quite sure were very helpful in the plenary part of it and, no, dad tried to do it all out of his own pocket which was, nobody does that anymore.
Story_ID: 443125
Speaker 1: Do you know who some of your peers, some of your father's [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] peers were while he was acting much alone in the Harlem [New York, New York] community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You name 'em, you name 'em.  Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] and his wife, Hazel Scott.  They were my grand--my godparents, and Ralph Bunche and Thurgood Marshall and Langston Hughes and, well you name it, they were all, you know, neighbors, and came to our house Thanksgiving dinners and stuff.  We had incredible days, those, I was a kid, of course.  My two older sisters [Minnette Delph, Jr. and Susan Delph], they ate it all up, they loved it.  Then, you know, I grew into it later on.
Speaker 1: What am I going to ask next?  I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.  So, once the houses were built, I'm assum- you said your father continued his practice and that perhaps the stress of the building led to his demise.  Was he involved in any other real estate projects between the Ivey Delph building [Ivey Delph Apartments, New York, New York] and--
Speaker 2: Well, any other real estate that he purchased was just, you know, maybe some multi--two-family, three-family houses out in Queens [New York] or in Brooklyn [New York].  My mother's sister, Carolyn [ph.], and her family, lived in a beautiful house in Jamaica, Queens that dad bought, and when he died, he gave them the deed, which I thought was very nice.
Speaker 1: And was your father the manager of all of these properties?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Pretty hands-on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He'd go out Saturday mornings and make his rounds, not in the hospital, going around to all of his properties.  He didn't have a lot.  I mean, he had maybe four or five.  It was enough to, you know, augment that income for him and he was doing very well, obviously, even though he only got seven dollars a patient visit.  He did very well in those days.
Speaker 1: And so he did that by having a number of patients and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --just really maintaining a strong practice.
Speaker 2: Enormous practice, enormous practice there on 139th Street.
Speaker 1: Who, who would he have served?  I mean, what, who was coming to use his services?
Speaker 2: Well, Powell was certainly a patient, Lionel Hampton.  Who else can I think of?  Ralph Bunche.  I can't think of others right immediately.
Speaker 1: And it's my understanding that these types of real estate projects were happening nationwide in different ways, whether housing projects or insurance companies or, essentially, black people providing for themselves.  Do you think that your father felt that he was a part of that wave?  Do you think he was influenced by others who were--
Speaker 2: Well, it was right after World War II [WWII], and sure there was boom in building and throughout the country and, yes, I remember him talking about what was going on in Atlanta [Georgia] at the time or what was going on in San Francisco [California], and a couple of individuals, now, we're not talking like today where, you know, groups get together and they have all this financial backing, we're talking about, again, individuals doing these things, on their own, giving back to the communities, all over the country.
Speaker 1: So Robert Taylor [Robert Rochon Taylor], perhaps, being one of his peers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That name sounds familiar, yeah.
Speaker 1: He also has some homes in Harlem.
Story_ID: 443126
Speaker 1: One other thing about the real estate.  Was that, at all, related to your father's [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] interest in providing healthy environments for the people who might come to live at the Ivey Delph [Ivey Delph Apartments, New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Harlem [New York, New York] had been built by then, you know.  Harlem was built at the turn of the century, so most of those buildings were up and there wasn't a whole lot of additional housing available, and with Harlem booming, there was a need for more housing.  And so, he built that building for that need.  And other projects were coming up, but they were more lower income and city projects kind of thing, which were necessary, and they got them done, and ruined a whole lot of the Harlem Renaissance in building the areas over near Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] now where the Cotton Club [New York, New York] was.  They just tore it out and just put up these projects, but that's the way it was, that was progress in those days.
Speaker 1: And would everyone who lived at the Ivey Delph be a black person?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember taking off a day from school 'cause Jackie Robinson was coming by to take a look.  He wanted to maybe get an apartment there.  Nat King Cole was looking, and they both went to Connecticut, as I remember, but Jackie Robinson walking up that street and then I had shaken that hand, boy, that was something, in those days.
Speaker 1: And did you meet any of the other people that I've heard mentioned, like Marilyn Keets or Buck Clayton or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Buck Clayton lived in the house, 19 Hamilton Terrace.
Speaker 1: --Ted Sturgis.
Speaker 2: Trumpet, great trumpeter.  I think he played with Cab Call- that wasn't Calloway [Cab Calloway].
Speaker 1: Buck Clayton, Count Basie.
Speaker 2: Count Basie, yeah.  Nice man, too.  You know, these people just, you know, after dad died in 1960, just to try to keep the place going, I helped out a little bit.  I was only sixteen, seventeen, a sophomore in high school [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] but my summers I kind of helped out there, trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you do there in the summers?
Speaker 2: Well, my uncle, Raymond [Raymond Delph], was the manager and he put me to work, you know, doing saddles under the doors or, you know, some of the plumbing problems needed to be done, or people that got themselves locked out, three o'clock in the morning, I'd go get their keys and let 'em in.  So that was fun.  It taught me some basic things.  Didn't get paid, not a penny, just what was supposed to be doing.  When I was fourteen, I remember my first little job was working, I guess it was freshman or something like that in high school, working in Mr. Reid's [ph.] dry cleaning business on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and 130th Street.  Sarah Vaughan was one of his clients, and she would have these gowns and they would fill up this little shop, and he'd take 'em downtown when she was in town.  I didn't know anything about Sarah until later and I said, wow, those days, incredible.
Speaker 1: It sounds very impressive--
Story_ID: 443127
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe we could talk now a little bit about your early history, kind of take you back and then come forward where we'll still include your parents [Minnette Tillman Delph and Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.].  Can I hear, what is your earliest memory if you can kind of, we could get you to go back?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of Harlem [New York, New York] after you were born?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember it much, but I remember it through pictures and stuff.  They said that my first haircut was kind of an important event, and my dad invited all these folks, you know, from the Harlem Renaissance into the house, and they took it out in the backyard.  Robert Craft [Robert J. Craft] was, Dr. Craft was a neighbor, and between dad and Craft behind the houses up on Hamilton Terrace, they put in all this land and Craft had this garden back there.  And so, everybody was out there, had me up on this chair and cutting my hair and, of course, I was crying, I guess, yeah, I didn't like it, but I do remember some aspects of that.  I remember, started school with three-year-olds at Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York].  Didn't like education in those days.  Hard to learn anything, and Dalton was a very progressive, liberal school and they said, "Well, let him go, you know, he'll find it sooner or later."  Unfortunately, I came out of there not knowing how to read or write or anything but the only thing that they didn't teach me, or lead me to, was science.  So I had this kind of feeling for science, but it wasn't until high school and college [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York] that I got into science.  So after Dalton I went to Riverdale Country School, up in the Bronx [New York].  I didn't like that too much either.
Story_ID: 443128
Speaker 1: Can I get you to back up a little bit--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --so we'll, can we talk just a little bit, you told us about the haircut, can you just tell us a little bit about the environment of your neighborhood, you know, what was it like?  What did it look like?  How did it feel?
Speaker 2: Hamilton Terrace, still one of the nicest areas in Harlem [New York, New York], up on Sugar Hill, from 141st Street to 144th Street, and then had an el [elevated train] going into 144th and into Convent Avenue.  So it was totally surrounded by churches, and St. Luke's [St. Luke's Episcopal Church, New York, New York] was up on the top and St. James [St. James Presbyterian Church, New York, New York] was down at St. Nicholas [Avenue].  Convent Avenue Baptist [Convent Avenue Baptist Church, New York, New York] was out there on 145th [Street], and Convent Avenue, in those days, had convents, and there were nuns there.  And my parents [Minnette Tillman Delph and Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] said, "Ah, you can go to any church you want but you're going to go to church."  So I ended up going to St. Luke's, which was Episcopalian, and confirmed and baptized and was an acolyte there and choir boy.
Speaker 1: How early did you make this decision about which church you personally were going to go to?
Speaker 2: Well, in those days, it wasn't much about God, but St. Luke's had a boys' choir that was exceptional, all-black, and we were singing, you know, 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel] and, you know, Mozart's [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] masses and stuff like that along with the adult choir and before I joined that choir, I remember sitting there and watching how Butch Lohey [ph.], one of the choir guys, was singing, and he was just going off on this music, and I'd say, wow, I want to join that.  So, I joined the choir and Mr. Jones [ph.], I think, was the choirmaster, he gave us very good instruction, breathing techniques and how to, you know, voice over from parts of it.  It was truly a beautiful choir.
Speaker 1: And did you attend that church with your parents at some point, or did your parents attend somewhere else?
Speaker 2: Well, dad went to Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York] with Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.].  Mom went to St. James down the hill with Rooks, Shelby Rooks [Charles Shelby Rooks], as the minister.  My sisters [Minnette Delph, Jr. and Susan Delph], my older sisters, attended St. Luke's too.  They ended up going down to St. James 'cause the Presbyterian church was a little different.  The Episcopal church was all this awe, you know, and the echoes and stuff.  The Presbyterian church was more down to earth, you know, and had all these different committees and put the people to work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Shelby Rooks came out of the Baptist church, you know, and down south and he was a fiery minister.  He was interesting.  He put Wordsworth [William Wordsworth] into his sermons, you know, and all this thing.  Great stuff, great stuff.
Story_ID: 443841
Speaker 1: So, a bit repetitive, if I can ask you, did you know your grandparents, and do you have any information or legendary tales that were told about your family before your parents [Minnette Tillman Delph and Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: I didn't know my grandparents.  My mother's mother [Dicie Ann Tillman] was alive but she was very elderly when I was born, and my father's mother [Sue Delph] was dead, already.  He was much older.  You know, my dad was 49, 50, when I was born.  Mom was in her thirties but, in those days, before the '60s [1960s] when people talked openly about their history, my folks weren't so proud of what they had to come out of down south, and being a light-skinned black man, there obviously was a lot of raping going on by the slave master or what have you.  So I didn't get that history, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm, I read all these books now about it, you know, Bell [ph.] down there in South Carolina and all these things and, whatever.
Story_ID: 443842
Speaker 1: So let's move back to New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and let me ask you if you would start, we're now talking about your childhood, so if I can get you to tell me the organization of your family, who your brothers and sisters are, and their order, and I'm making the assumption, but I would love it if you say that you were living with your parents [Minnette Tillman Delph and Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.], how that worked (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, so, I had two older sisters, I was the baby and they--
Speaker 1: What are their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, Minnette [Minnette Delph, Jr.], named after my mom, Minnette Ivy, I-V-Y, no E on it, and Susan [Susan Delph] is my middle sister, she's now out in the West Coast, and cousins from my mother's sister side.  I mentioned that family a little bit out there in Queens, in Jamaica, Queens [New York], and that was Ray [ph.], Jeannie [ph.] and Linda [ph.], and we just lost Jeannie but Ray and Linda are still alive.
Speaker 1: So were those people that you, perhaps saw on holidays and special events at your home, do you have any holiday memories you might want to share with us from your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the big holiday was Thanksgiving, and I think it was my mom that said, you know, we're not going to do this on Thanksgiving night 'cause everybody's with their family, we're going to do it on the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  So everybody was available.  She would have this dinner, they would get out of the house early, so they could go to work on Monday and that's why she was able to attract all of these folks that were in Harlem [New York, New York] to come.  The ministers, obviously, were just regular folks in the house, but Thanksgiving dinner, everybody would come in, and I'd take their coats, you know, and put 'em in the coatroom and they'd go on upstairs and I'm ten years old, eleven years old, I don't know who these people were, but these were the royalty of the black world, coming through the door.
Speaker 1: Do you want to mention a couple of specific people?
Speaker 2: Well, Langston Hughes, a family friend.  Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], we talked about him already.  Thurgood Marshall, before he was with the [U.S.] Supreme Court, before the Civil Rights Movement and Marshall, in those days, was I guess working with the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  I didn't know who he was but there he was, you know.
Speaker 1: At your house?
Speaker 2: At my house, having Thanksgiving dinner.
Story_ID: 443843
Speaker 1: In the milieu of your whole neighborhood, could you tap into any sights or sounds or smells that remind you of your childhood when you encounter them now?
Speaker 2: Well, Harlem [New York, New York] has changed.  So, the sounds and the smells were from back then in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: How were they different?  What--
Speaker 2: Well, we were lucky enough to have a lady that would help us out, named Sarah Bishop, and Sarah was a lovely lady who could cook her brains out, all right, and Sarah was from Maryland and she could do, my mom [Minnette Tillman Delph] cooked, but Sarah would cook on Thursdays and Sundays, sometimes, and we had this chicken and dumplings, you know, and chicken and noodles, and lamb and, you know, and lamb smells, you know, especially when you put a whole lot of garlic in it.  So, I remember those smells, very easily.  And 'cause I was growing up in Harlem, I also remember a lot of, you know, fire engines and police cars going up St. Nicholas Avenue 'cause my room was in the back there, and looking down on St. Nicholas Avenue, a lot of noise, but I grew up with that noise.  That was just home to me, which was fun, and I liked to tell the guys that I grew up with on Hamilton Terrace, the ones that have survived, there are only a couple of us left, certainly we were a part of Harlem so we had a whole lot of statistics there.  Guys that got killed and died early of strokes, and all kinds of terrible stories.  But Robert King [Robert A. King], who is now an architect, Paul Burnett [G. Paul Burnett] is a shooter for The New York Times, Frank Villard [ph.], working for the city.  And we go out and have dinner every other month now.  Of course, we're getting older and some of us are having hip operations and knee operations so we can't do it quite every two months.
Speaker 1: Do you eat at Amy Ruth's [New York, New York] every time?
Speaker 2: Absolu- no, no, no, we go to all of the different restaurants in Harlem.  We do stay in Harlem, giving the money back, you know, but we got a lot of great restaurants in Harlem now, you know, but Amy Ruth's is certainly my favorite, go there all the time, a couple of times a week.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You have your own menu item?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you saw that?
Speaker 1: Do you order that exclusively (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Or do you move it around?
Speaker 2: I never had that as a matter of fact but, especially their breakfasts, if you get there before eleven, they're fantastic there.
Story_ID: 443844
Speaker 1: Can I ask you about where you went to elementary school, which is Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So we talked about Dalton School.
Speaker 1: Yes, and who was the head, who was at the head of the school at the time that you were there?  Who was there with you, and what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the name of the lady who was the head.  Vaguely, I can--it may come to me but Dalton in those days, we're talking about the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s], tried an experiment.  They said, we're going to reach out, we're going to look up to Harlem [New York, New York] and ask some of those folks to come in down here and give them scholarships, I guess.  My dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where is Dalton located?
Speaker 2: Dalton is 89th Street off of Park Avenue and so I was a part of that experiment for this liberal school and they invited the Delany family to come, and Sam Delany [Samuel Ray Delany, Jr.], who is now a great science fiction writer, big white beard and all, he's a grand guy, and his sisters, and, of course, the Delany family had a lot of different parts to it.  You know, I think there were four or five Delany brothers and they all kind of went to Harlem, to Dalton, as this, part of this experiment.  Folks out of Riverton apartments [Riverton Houses, New York, New York], Henry Gammon [ph.], my favorite best friend, was a classmate, but there weren't many of us, but we all kind of got bused down.  There was a bus that would come up and pick us up and go on down to 89th, and we would go back by bus every day, bringing blacks into this lily-white liberal environment that had some incredible teachers in it.  Pete Seeger and his family, okay.  Elizabeth [Elizabeth Seeger], I think, was the sister.  And Dalton had some of the first black teachers to teach these white kids, which was, we're talking about the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], that's stretching, but they tried to do that.  Didn't learn anything but, you know, it was an interesting new year, if you would.
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you didn't learn anything.  What kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a terrible student.  I didn't like to study.  I didn't start studying 'til I got to college [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York] and then I, you know, something clicked and I just, wow, it was, it was incredible.  Everything was just like a gestalt happening, you know, some biology teachers and chemistry teachers and physics teachers, all made it so interesting--but I'm going ahead of my story.
Speaker 1: So, as a kid, what kind of a kid were you while you were at Dalton?  Were you getting into trouble (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was out hanging out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was hanging out playing stickball on Hamilton Terrace.
Speaker 1: Not downtown?
Speaker 2: Nah, I just, I didn't have much in common with those folks, you know, so, you know, the folks that were there at Dalton, we kind of were in a clique.  It was the beginning of Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], if you would, the very beginning of Jack and Jill when that group of families kind of brought everybody together and we would party together, what have you, and experiment and look at what the rest of Manhattan [New York] had to offer, all these great museums and stuff.  That was great in those days.
Story_ID: 443845
Speaker 1: So at that time, I wanted to ask you, what were your dreams and aspirations?  Did you have any or were you just sort of making it day by day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: --at, in elementary school?
Speaker 2: --was so prominent, so I said, "Well, I guess I'm going to be a doctor," but it wasn't until college [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York] when I became a serious student and I really took all these great courses that really made sense to me all of a sudden.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned at Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York] that you didn't learn anything, but that your interest in science was not marred there, so were you not doing any science classes?
Speaker 2: There wasn't any science so if they didn't give you a science, I guess I had that craving for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, when I got to Riverdale [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] in high school, they had some science courses.
Speaker 1: And who was in charge of Riverdale?  Where was that located and what was that like?  Was it a bit improved over the Dalton experience?
Speaker 2: Not much, but bigger, and had a great athletics department.
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: Riverdale, in the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was kind of athletic.  I was always tall and so, you know, basketball and played football and baseball and track and all that but at the high school level, now it's a little more competitive and Riverdale had all of that.  It had an undefeated football team for sixty games straight.  It was like seven years running.  Frank Bertino was the coach.  Calvin Hill, a couple of years behind me, he was so good playing football, he was recruited out of Baltimore [Maryland] to come up and play at Riverdale.  He was so good, he could play any position on the team.  When he was a running back in those days, he was, he wasn't an enormous guy but he just ran so easily over these white guys from prep schools.  He played quarterback and all that and, of course, he became All American at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and went on to Dallas Cowboys and all that, and his son, Grant Hill, is still playing basketball to this day.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Was there anyone specific, sort of on the day to day at Dalton or at Riverdale who influenced you greatly or were those just kind of moot points?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I wasn't much of a student.  I think of Dalton more as a social kind of roots thing, you know.  It was, we were the prominent families coming from Harlem [New York, New York] and we were mingling with Richard Rodgers' son, okay, these millionaires' children that were there.  So it was an interesting experiment that they were doing, but they also had all the great liberals in those days.  Alger Hiss' family was there.  Later on, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte and Diana Ross and all those kids came to Dalton, but when I finished in '58 [1958], they were just kind of coming in, got to Riverdale, I was the third black to graduate out of Riverdale.  So, you know, Alan George [ph.] was the second to graduate, and Alan was from Harlem, little guy, very smart, turned out to be an engineer, and he was the one that kind of got me going into the track team.  And he was a little guy, but he could high jump, and so he taught me how to high jump.  I couldn't high jump very well but, as I said, high school was much more competitive and had great teams and so we had a lot of fun there.
Story_ID: 443846
Speaker 1: And when you were at high school, was it understood that you were going to attend college?  What did you--were you thinking at that time about your college and ultimate career goals (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, Riverdale [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] was sort of like Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York].  Again, it had all these rich kids and they were on their way to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], and I wasn't the student so I was lucky to get to Adelphi [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York], and luckily I did.  They let me in and started studying all this biology and chemistry and physics that just clicked.  The teachers were so good that it was interesting, and luckily I was able to major in biology and I minored in art.  Again, I think Dalton gave me all that background, art and music and things like that.
Speaker 1: And did your parents [Minnette Tillman Delph and Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] have any influence, your father in particular, already being a doctor, did they have any influence on what your career goals were?  How did they feel about your not being a student, as you put it?
Speaker 2: Well, that was an era of being permissive.  So they didn't kind of come down hard on me.  They thought eventually it would click 'cause I had the IQ and all of that.  So they said, just give him time, he'll get around to it and I guess I did.  I got around to it and college, thank God, did turn me on, I became a student and I spent hours getting into these books and, you know, physics' not easy but it was interesting stuff.
Speaker 1: It worked for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, hydrodynamics follows me right now, it's the study of water, and all the physics of water and urology, it's the same thing.
Speaker 1: If we could just step back again a little bit to your high school before we go to college.  Oh--
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, high school wasn't a whole lot of fun but I remember the prom.  We went out after the prom and [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, was it 1960 we're talking, no, yeah, 1962, she was young and she was appearing at The Carlyle hotel [New York, New York], all right, small room, and a group of us went there after the prom to hear this woman sing right into our face, and to this day, Nancy Wilson is just a goddess to me.  So the JVC [JVC Jazz Festival; Newport Jazz Festival] is about to salute her at age seventy and next month, no, June, I will be there.  I will definitely be there for Nancy.
Story_ID: 443847
Speaker 1: But I need to ask you during your sophomore year in high school [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] about the passing of your father [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] and how that affected you and sort of what came out of, what was the resulting organization of your family and perhaps who did you then turn to for mentorship?
Speaker 2: Yeah, good, that's a good question 'cause I was lost after dad died.  I was only sixteen and, again, at his funeral, all these dignitaries of Harlem [New York, New York] would come by, you know.
Speaker 1: Where was that funeral held?
Speaker 2: Was it at Benta [Benta's Funeral Home, New York, New York]?  Probably at Benta, you know, which is still in existence.  No, no, no, no, Delany's Funeral Parlor [Levy and Delany Funeral Home, New York, New York] on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the Delanys had a dentist, they had a funeral director in the family, had doctors in the family.  The Delanys were very prominent.  But when dad died, it crushed me for a couple of years.  I guess I got very introverted and what have you, and, again, I wasn't a student and I kind of, just kind of struggled through those last couple of years, but I remember a lot of the folks from Harlem reaching out for me.  They didn't want this kid to kind of, you know, drift away.  So, people like Aaron Wells, who started his practice running errands for my father doing house calls, and Aaron Wells is not doing well now, health wise, but was a true mentor of mine, and, of course, coming out of med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], I mean, he just literally took me by the hand, and brought me through.  The Delany family, I go back to that.  Harry Delany [Harry M. Delany], who again you should interview, great man, chief of surgery at Jacobi hospital [Jacobi Medical Center; NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi, Bronx, New York] and was a full-time surgeon at Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York].  When I was in high school, I remember a couple of summer jobs at Montefiore, and they taught me how to operate in the dog labs, and Sol Furman [Seymour Furman] was doing his early work on pacemakers for the heart and so I learned how to do, put pacemakers into these dogs' hearts.
Speaker 1: These are high school summers?
Speaker 2: This is high school still.  And Harry Delany was the one that got me into that job and they taught me how to tie and use these instruments and work with both hands and all that, things that were essential, you know, for later on in my search for life.
Speaker 1: Did anyone in particular take over your father's practice or did it just sort of go with him?
Speaker 2: No, nobody took that over.  It was lost, and, you know, I remember, you know, and I remember it very clearly that when dad died, he was owed all this money by all these folks but that was the way it was done in those days, you know.  He, you needed something done, come on in, pay me later, and, but that was the way, he was giving back to the community.  So, yeah, he, it's hard to make money, or to really have any kind of a, certainly today in medicine, there's no money in it anymore, and it's all this bureaucracy and Medicare and Medicaid and insurance industry and stuff but you're still giving back to the community, that was the thing I wanted to do.  When I finished training at Montefiore, they wanted me to stay up there and, you know, work with one of those hospitals in the Bronx [New York].  I said, "I'm going back to Harlem.  That's what I wanted to do when I got here, and that's what I'm going to do," and my chief got very angry at me, Selwyn Fried, a little guy, liked to scream and yell, but he wanted me to stay up there and gave me a hard time going back into St. Luke's Hospital [Mount Sinai St. Luke's, New York, New York], Jewish to an Episcopal hospital.  That wasn't--that didn't work so well but St. Luke's was a great hospital, I'm going ahead of myself, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: You're fine.
Story_ID: 443848
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask, you had mentioned earlier something about your father [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] and insurance.  So when your father's practice was booming, there was no insurance involved?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was just, just--
Speaker 2: No, he died in 1960, Medicare started in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Medicaid later.  So, dad would charge seven dollars for a house call, house call, not an office visit, and he made lots of house calls.  He had all of the elderly people in Harlem [New York, New York].  He would go and I would make rounds with him.
Speaker 1: Did you accompany him?
Speaker 2: I would make rounds with him, and we'd go meet Mother Brown, or Mother Jones, or whatever, and we'd go up into her house, her apartment, walk-ups, you know, fourth floor or something like that, and I'm walking behind him, going up these stairs and dad early on was always a teacher, you know, so I'd say, "What's wrong with her?"  You know, she had a little flu or something like that, you know.  And so he was grilling me already, you know, think about how to help this person, you know, what's wrong with her?  And so, I always felt very uncomfortable about all of that, and I remember one of the ladies said after, you know, he gave her the prescription and we were ready to go out of the house, she gave me a fifty-cent piece, this is for you, and I didn't feel comfortable receiving that, you know.  This woman had nothing, you know, and I didn't want to take that fifty-cent piece.  Dad said, "Take the fifty cents, she really wants you to have it," and so I took it and to this day, I have difficulty taking money for what I do, that's why I have Pat [ph.] outside 'cause she is incredible.  She does all the business so I don't have to worry about it.  I just take care of just taking care of the people.
Speaker 1: And that made you uncomfortable because in your father's practice, a lot of people, it was difficult for them to pay?  Sort of--
Speaker 2: Sure, they didn't have any money.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then combined with that idea of giving back to the community?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, and again, I was brought up with all this liberal, socialized kind of thing behind me, schools, and, you know, all the blacks in Harlem were very liberal, of course.  So, sure, give back to the community, that's just the way it is, and if you have privilege, you're going to reach back and you're going to bring two more people with you.  If you break open a door, you're going to keep your foot in the door so that others can get through that door and that's the way it was in those days.  Most men were, they had these enormous egos.  I remember them having big voices than all of us.  They were very intimidating to me as a little kid but that's the way they were.  They, they broke doors open.  My godfather, Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], had more bills passed in his tenure in Washington [D.C.] because it was the days of discrimination.  So he had an anti-discrimination part.  So it was always a Powell part of a bill of non-discrimination added to it, and so Adam ended up with like three hundred bills, you know, having his name on it.  And he broke doors open, and then, you know, we're talking the Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] days, you know, Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], then Eisenhower and Truman [President Harry S. Truman] and then Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], all those doors were now really starting to open up and there was a momentum, and then the Civil Rights Movement started and, you know, by that time, I was in med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  I'll get back to that.
Story_ID: 443849
Speaker 1: Just a little bit more with you and your father [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.].  You said you went on house calls with him.
Speaker 2: Went fishing with him too, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanted to know about other times--
Speaker 2: --great fishing.
Speaker 1: --sort of what was your--
Speaker 2: I can't get my sons [Walter I. Delph III and Channing Delph] to go fishing.  We're going fishing, Father's Day, but dad liked to go fishing.  Go out to Sheepshead Bay [Brooklyn, New York], you know, and he had patience and they had a little boat or something or go out to Montauk [New York].  Get up at two o'clock in the morning, drive all the way out to Montauk to get out there and start fishing for codfish or something like that.  But we had fun, great time.
Speaker 1: And with your mom [Minnette Tillman Delph], did you spend time at home or did you accompany her to Chase Manhattan [Chase National Bank; JPMorgan Chase and Co.]?  How (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Later on--
Speaker 1: What kind of--
Speaker 2: --but, no mom was a housewife.  In those days, the wives stayed home, and there were kind of bridge parties and stuff like that and teas and things.  And she was a great bridge player, very good, but mom was very social and very cultured.  I learned a lot about music and art from my mom because she just loved that aspect of it.  And I just, early on, was gravitated to that, and I didn't mention Duke Ellington, you know, but Ellington was a friend of the family and so jazz was a very, very early part of my life.  I mentioned Buck Clayton but Ellington was truly a duke.  I mean, if there's royalty, Duke Ellington living up on Edgecombe Avenue, eight blocks from us, that man was a duke.  He was revered in Harlem [New York, New York], and ended up going to high school with his nephew, Baby James, who's still around, and Baby James taught me how to play drums a little bit, a little bit.  We had fun, though.
Story_ID: 442935
Speaker 1: After you attended Riverdale [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York], what did you decide to do for college?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I was still depressed, you know, dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] had died and mom [Minnette Tillman Delph] went back to work for getting us all through school and Adelphi [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York] said, "Okay, well, come on out," and not only I became a student but I also got involved in campus life 'cause I lived out there in the dorms, which was fun.  So I joined all the clubs, electronics club, and the glee club and the small chorus and, what else, I never could write so I didn't do any of the journals or the newsletters or any of that.  But there's a jazz club, so I would join that, and that was fun too.  So that got me involved in campus life, which I had never done before, you know, and Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York] didn't have anything and Riverdale [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] was just the white group, but Adelphi had black students and they had fraternities and sororities and stuff, you know.  So I joined a local fraternity at Adelphi, the second year, first year, the only fraternity with a brother in it, all right.  So, Jimmy Chestnut [James Chestnut] was the school athlete, and he was in DPhiG [Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity] and he took pity on me, I guess, and said, "Come on, join us over here," and taught me what a brother was supposed to be about, you know, and it turned out that fraternity was, yeah, the best fraternity on campus.  They had no nationals, it was all just little local groups, but we had all the athletes, we had all the scholars, we had all the musicians, everybody was in that fraternity, so, and we had all the women, too, don't forget that.  So we had a great time at Adelphi, it was fabulous.
Speaker 1: When you said that your father, you said it a couple of times now that your father was not a joiner--how did you become a joiner 'cause it sounds like even at Dalton, you were sort of in the midst of the clique and being social?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  I started having interests.  I didn't have interests when I was growing up, I guess, but I went to the electronics club because Hi-Fi became stereo all of a sudden.  You got two channels and the sound, you know, was magnificent.  So, we joined this club to learn how to make an amplifier and a pre-amp and all these great things, you know, that you can make with your hands out of a little kit.  So that was fabulous, and then all of a sudden you could play records.  And they threw me out of the dorm 'cause I had these big AR [Acoustic Research] speakers in my little college room playing Ellington [Duke Ellington], you know, and Miles Davis in the dorm.  They threw me out of the dorm, well, I guess junior year for a semester 'cause I just didn't get that.  It was supposed to be quiet so they could study and I'm playing, "Listen to this part," you know, and I'm turning up Miles Davis and 'Kind of Blue' and stuff like that and they said, "No, you can't do that here."
Speaker 1: So you didn't get kicked out of school but you did get kicked out of the living arrangement (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, just, nah, out of the dorm, out of the dorm.  So I played--I stayed in a, in a nice family's house in Garden City [New York] for that semester, and then they let me back in the dorm.  I said I'd be better.  Luckily I didn't get in any trouble in all of these years.
Story_ID: 442936
Speaker 1: So you said you became interested, very interested in the sciences at Adelphi [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York].  So tell us about that again.
Speaker 2: Well, biology.  Biology was, and I don't remember the names of these teachers, but biology is the study of life, okay, and you can do that by looking at frogs, you know, and rats and whatever, and learn comparative anatomy and how they're all the same even, you know, a tadpole goes through stages that the human embryo is going to go through too.  So that became fascinating, especially embryology, and therefore that's Darwinism, and I said, this is spiritual too, this is life, this is something more than just what's out of this book.  So I learned about the kidney, of course, and how frogs got kidneys, right.  Ants have kidneys, or they had at least urinary systems.  And so I saw in comparative anatomy how all of that kind of grew and evolved from the lower animals right up to the human beings and it was just fascinating to me to see all this happening because, of course, it was at the college level so it wasn't, you know, entry level stuff, it was getting down to the cellular level.
Speaker 1: And did you have any mentors or teachers who influenced your--
Speaker 2: I don't remember their names but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your career?
Speaker 2: --they were all great folks, and we're talking about the early '60s [1960s], we're talking, you know, the beginning of DNA, you know, and, you know, all of that that's, you know, so important nowadays.  It was the infancy back then.  And I remember sociology and psychology, stuff that was just blowing my mind, you know, how baboons grow together as a group, you know, and how there are leaders and there are drones, and they have a social story to tell in their little groups, and that was fascinating to me.
Speaker 1: And so did you have a sense while you were at Adelphi that you were going to attend medical school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  By now, I said, "This is interesting, I want to do this," and, of course, my dad's [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] influence kept going back about giving back and what are you going to do.  And so, medicine, I applied to all the medical schools, you know, and we're talking the '60s [1960s].  There was still, I didn't realize it, you know, in Harlem [New York, New York] where I came out of, there wasn't any problems, social problems, it was just fine.  So I applied to all these schools and they rejected me right and left, and I was good.  I was dean's list at, at Adelphi.  I said, "Why'd they turn me down?"  So, you know, mom [Minnette Tillman Delph] was there and she tried to say, well, let's, let's try Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And Howard said, yeah, we got a place for you.  And, yeah, I was a legacy, you know, dad went there and did well.
Story_ID: 442937
Speaker 1: When I--can I go into med school?
Speaker 2: Well, actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not yet?
Speaker 2: --actually I wanted to ask you a little bit about the, your sense of self within the space, especially having gone to Dalton [The Dalton School, New York, New York] and to Riverdale [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York], you know, what was your sense of yourself as a black person throughout this educational trajectory (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, not yet, not yet.  I, college was, again, the place where all of that awakening started.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're talking 1962.  So 1966, beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, and I'm impressionable, you know, and I'm still a student, so I'm not down there on the picket lines, but I'm watching all this stuff evolving that was taking place.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was coming out, you know, and all these things were happening and, you know, again, Adelphi [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York] was the first place that I was going to school with a lot of black people, you know, not a lot but, I mean, there weren't just three of us anymore, you know.  We, the Richardson sisters, they were twins at Adelphi and they ran it all.  They were president of this and they were, they were fantastic and they were black.  So I had something to look up to.  I said, "This is fantastic," and so they kind of opened the doors and I just kind of followed through.
Speaker 2: Can you name any other people who were at Adelphi with you who were black students there?
Speaker 1: Oh, I cannot name names but I certainly remember folks that, you know, by the time you get to college, it's not just a little hobby anymore, these people are starting to really dig into things.  So I ran into kids that were philosophers.  Kids that were writing symphonies.  Kids that were, I mean, really heavy young people--
Speaker 2: Young stuff.
Speaker 1: --and I'm saying, I'm, where am I in this?  And so, somehow I found myself in this.  College is also the time when you can't just study alone anymore.  There's so much work, so I had little groups to study with, and we'd go through our notes and all this and, again, that kind of helped all the stuff to go in so it stuck with me as far as the sciences and, you know, black kids too.
Story_ID: 442938
Speaker 1: So, Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] let me in, and I can remember my first day at Howard med school.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: So we are standing on line, you know, it's a, they're kind of giving this, the rounds of, well, you're going to get your microscope over here and over here you're going to get your bones to study for the skeleton for anatomy, and I'm in line, everything's alphabetical, and I'm waiting in line for the microscope and a guy in front of me is a C, you know, Collins [Edward James Collins], and I was a D, so I was behind him and he's up in the front and had this low voice and he started talking, and it turned out to be my best friend for the rest of my life, okay, also a urologist out on the West Coast.  And, again, incredible black teachers now, okay, Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb], this was a renaissance human being.  He was the chief of anatomy, but he was an anthropologist and a M.D., and so he is also a different type of teacher.  He's teaching us about Imhotep and the pyramids and the papyruses and the beginning of medicine, not just anatomy.  He was fantastic and, of course, he was a friend of my father's [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] too.  He was, I think, a couple of years behind my father at Howard med, but when I got to med school, the chief of urology was a friend of my father's, Boney Jones [R. Frank Jones], okay.  And so, again, these folks just greeted me in.  I mean, they were family, bringing me into this incredible environment for learning.  And so, I remember Montague Cobb, you know, you hear these stories about Cobb, he would pay the--pay back the students that would study late, midnight, on their cadavers, you know, by serenading them by playing his violin at midnight, and walk around, and there were students out there at midnight studying cadavers and, yeah, I was out there and yes, Montague Cobb would play his violin in the middle of the night while we were studying anatomy, incredible human being.  He was a thespian.  He wrote plays.  He wrote poetry.  He was everything I've ever seen in one human being, in one person.  And we had Moses Young [Moses Wharton Young] who was an anatomy teacher for neuroanatomy, the hardest part of anatomy, the brain and all of the spinal nerves and all the little nerves.  And he, Moses Young broke it down.  If you can count to one, two, three, we'll get you through this class.  And he'd say, "Well listen, you got a bus route that goes down G Street, so what's the name of that bus?  That bus is called the G Street bus, all right.  So you got a vagus nerve, and a vagus rim is the tenth cranial nerve and it runs from here to da da da da da da," and boom, boom, boom, and it just clicks.  Howard was a surgical school, you know.  I learned later that the hospital typically is either medically run or a surgeon was the top of the people, especially in those days--
Story_ID: 442939
Speaker 1: So I ran into these incredible black surgeons that were great teachers [at the Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], like Frank Jones [R. Frank Jones], we had mentioned already, in urology, and LaSalle Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.], who went on to become the first black head of American Cancer Society, head of the College of Surgeons [American College of Surgeons], first black, and we're talking the '60s [1960s], late, but he was the first and Leffall would, everybody wanted to be in his class.  He just finished a book of his life and now that's a story you got to get if you don't have him.  He's in Washington [D.C.], he just retired and he's available and a lot of fun.  And like Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb] and Moses Young [Moses Wharton Young], he would teach in very visual ways so that they were indelible things, and I remember going rounds, they would, you know, you'd be prepared, you know, Leffall's going to ask you, is going to ask everybody in the class, give me twenty-five reasons for an acute surgical abdomen or twenty-five reasons for a non-surgical abdomen, you know.  Why do you operate and why don't you operate on that patient.  So, you know, there are twenty-five reasons and after a while, you know, you kind of got all twenty-five of 'em, including the bite of a black widow spider, an acute sickle cell anemia crisis causing infarction, but you don't operate on it, you see.  A kidney stone, it hurts like hell but you don't operate on it, typically.  And then, of course, you have all the other surgical reasons for the acute abdomen.  Fabulous teachers, and again, these guys were not just good but they were known to be good.  So, black or white, we got an extension to go to Memorial hospital [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York] my junior year, and spent six weeks at Memorial, and I just gave a talk at Memorial and talked about, haven't been there in forty years, almost forty years.  When I was a student there, the summer of 1969, when they landed on the moon, what a hell of a summer that was.  Summer of Woodstock [Woodstock Festival; Woodstock Music and Art Fair], and I went to Woodstock.  Incredible summer.  And I was also an extern at Memorial Hospital, and in those days, again, everything was very surgical so it wasn't a whole lot of chemotherapy.  There wasn't a whole lot of radiation therapy, it was all, we go in and cut it out.  And so they were doing big, big radical surgery. Hemicorporectomies, which is, if you got cancer here, you've got to take off the lower part of your body, and you're just going to be in a bed with your arms and your trunk, and that's the way surgery was in those days.  It was very radical and, of course, it tamed down later on and now it's all chemo and radiation and surgery combined.  So, but in those days, especially that summer, 1969, it was something.
Story_ID: 442940
Speaker 1: Now you've told us a little bit about the summer.  What else did you do while you were in medical school besides now be a student--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) which it sounds like you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, again, I was, I was wide open and I had this big Afro, you know, and I was riding a motorcycle in those days, and I got a chance to--oh, and I was radical too, coming out of all that liberal schooling, you know.  I was very radical, you know, and so I was beginning to get into photography, which is still one of my hobbies.  And so, I remember meeting Leonard Tillman [R. Leonard Tillman], who was running the laboratory for the electron microscope at Howard, and he was doing the photography.  And he had a darkroom and so as I was getting into photography, I got a job to work in the darkroom and they paid me to do it.  And Tillman taught me all the little techniques and the secrets of how to get, you know, appealing to you, you know, a photograph is one thing but when you get a black and white photograph, half of it, the final product of the print, is done in the darkroom 'cause you can do so much with a good negative.  So they taught me how to get a good negative first and then what to do and how to embellish in the darkroom.  So that was fabulous, and I did that for about two years at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and they paid me to do it too.  That was fabulous.
Speaker 1: And did you do any dating (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dating?
Speaker 1: --during high school or college or medical school?
Speaker 2: Well, that will have to be a whole another tape because I don't know how much I can tell you.  Yeah, I did a whole lot of dating at Howard.  medical stu- well Howard, first of all, is a real social school, all right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, medical students were prime, you know, so, yeah, I had lots of girlfriends and I told you, you know, when I was a kid, I was in, in this choir at St. Luke's [St. Luke's Episcopal Church, New York, New York], so I learned how to sing early.  And so from ten until about fourteen or so I sang in that little choir and I got to Riverdale [Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] and I started singing in the glee club and I got to Adelphi [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York] and I sang in this big choir that they had, run by Rasmussen [Lawrence Rasmussen], great conductor, teacher and, again, we were singing 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel], and all this and my voice was changing so I could sing 'Messiah' in soprano, alto, tenor and bass all at the same time 'cause my voice had an enormous range.  I ended up being a bass, of course.  So by the time I got to Howard, I'm still liking to sing, and they have a little glee club, so I said, "I'm going to join that glee club."  And they had a talent night too.  So, all of the medical students would come out and do whatever they could do, and so they had a little jazz thing and I played the drums a little bit, too.  So I ended up conducting the choir at the med school.  Now, you guys are too young to know, but Howard had a gospel choir and this is the beginning of, you know, 'Oh Happy Day,' and, you know, all this great, great gospel music that was hitting me when I got down to this black environment.  So, junior year in med school, I said, this choir, in the med school, is going to go join the gospel choir.  So we went up and we sang in that gospel choir, and it just made your hair stand up.  I already had a 'fro but it was just standing like this.  It was fantastic.  And in my senior year, we traveled with the choir.  We went all through the South, through Texas and Alabama singing 'cause they were a great choir and they were known.  So, that was fantastic, just making the rounds and, of course, it's gospel music and, you know, it's riveting, you know, and you get the spirit, and I'm looking around and, wait, they didn't do this at Abyssinian Church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York].  They certainly didn't do it at St. Luke's, and people were going off, you know.  And the Baptist church folks getting happy, and I'd never seen that before and one of them was my girlfriend, too, and she was going off and falling down on the stage and everything and I said, "What is going on here?"  And it was fabulous just to be a part of all of that.  And they were very intense people 'cause these aren't children any more, these are young adults really feeling themselves, coming to being, if you would.  So, it was also the beginning of my real spirituality.  I had that, those roots early on from this, from churches in St. Luke's and St. James [St. James Presbyterian Church, New York, New York] but now it was starting to make some sense, you know, that God was here and God was in me and I could start feeling that, so, that's yet, we're going up a little ahead because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, we can talk about it some more.
Speaker 2: --we'll talk about that another time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I do--
Story_ID: 442941
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I do want to ask you about getting married and if you did that during medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, been married a couple of times now, you know, and yeah, I, my first marriage was in medical school.  I was a sophomore, and my daughter was born, thirty-eight years ago, and she is beautiful, beautiful lady.  Of course, I went on from med school to New York [New York], and her mom stayed in Washington [D.C.] and, yes, there was a divorce.  And so Andrea [Andrea Delph], unfortunately, was there in Washington and I was up here for internship and residency and then the [U.S.] Air Force and all that, and so there was a separation.
Speaker 1: Andrea, being your daughter?
Speaker 2: The daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I only have one daughter, two sons [Walter I. Delph III and Channing Delph] and one daughter.  So I wasn't there for her in those early years.  We'll get to that, but later on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --I certainly brought her into the family, the second family, and my wife, Pam [Pam Delph], was very, very willing and open to bring her in and make her a part of the family and bring her up from Washington and spend holidays with us and what have you and travel with us and vacation with us, lovely times.
Story_ID: 442942
Speaker 1: You've mentioned that you were in the [U.S.] Air Force so, I guess, now I'd like you to talk a little bit about what happens to you after Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], so long as you have told all of your exciting stories about Howard, I know that's--
Speaker 2: Oh, only a lot more, you know, but we'll move on, we'll move on.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you decide to do for your residency, and how did you manage to get into the Air Force?
Speaker 2: So, again, I'm surrounded by all these great surgeons, so I was going to be a surgeon, you know.  One of the things my dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] did, again, in general practice, man walked into his office with his bandage on his head and said, "I got a knife in my head."  He was stabbed with a butcher knife and was broken off in the back of his head and there was an x-ray and, yes, there it is.  And my dad was certainly not a neurosurgeon but he said, "I think we can get this out," and it had been there for a long time, too.  No abscess, no infect--and all that time was over and so my dad operated on this man with a knife in his head and got it out of his head, and he lived, he did fine.  And made the papers, of course, you know.  He did very well with that one.  So, again, early surgical experience for my father got me, and then the Howard situation, got me very interested in surgery.  So I went to Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York].  I knew I was coming back to New York [New York], so all the other opportunities, I wasn't interested in.  Montefiore, remember I had learned how to cut and tie and work with both hands and all the instruments were there.  So I said, okay, I'll go back to Montefiore.  And Harry Delany [Harry M. Delany] was there.  Again, now, not, I wasn't in high school now for the summers, now I'm an intern.  And internship was hard.  We're talking hundred hour weeks and, you know, working all weekend long and, you know, just physically draining, and plus the mental, you had to study and read all this stuff, and four o'clock in the morning you have got a patient in pulmonary edema, you got to take care of him and there's nobody else.  The chiefs are gone, I mean, and you got to get him down to x-ray, you got to get him dried out.  So you learn a lot.  You learn, they don't allow that any more, working a hundred hours at a time, working all weekends.  Now the residents have it much easier where they can only work, you know, sixty hours, you know, they're still overworked, it's a lot to learn but because you can make a lot of mistakes at four o'clock in the morning, too, if it's not, you're not supervised.  So, internship was difficult.  The [U.S.] military, we're talking about the end of Vietnam [Vietnam War] now.  So, at that time, they had this Berry Plan so that they deferred you until after your internship before they drafted me.
Story_ID: 442943
Speaker 1: We're at tail end of medical school and talking about your movements at Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York] and doing your residency there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --now thinking that you're going to be a surgeon.
Speaker 2: Right, but maybe before we get into that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we go back a little bit to med school because we talked about '69 [1969]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but 1968 was probably one of the most pivotal years in global history, and I was in Washington, D.C., and I'm looking out of my window and watching Washington, D.C. burn.  I'm seeing tanks on the streets of Washington, D.C., I'm seeing buses lined up, toe to toe, to protect the White House [Washington, D.C.], okay.  We were as close to revolution in this country as we have ever been since 1776.  That was tough times, 1968, interesting times, and so it was also the year that Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] was killed, and the year that King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, and I am a junior in med school and all of this is helping to cement what I'm going to do for the rest of my life, okay.  I'm saying, why are we burning down our own communities?  Why aren't we burning down, downtown, huh?  So, and we are burning our own homes and burning out these little grocery shops and, yeah, there was a reason why but I didn't know why then, you know, but we're just acting out of anger.  All of these years of anger that are built up from the racism in this society.  So, 1968 was very, very important and coming out of seventy--'69 [1969], when I'm going on into the surgical field, and Memorial hospital [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York] externship and now Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] also has dog labs and doing experiments, and I'm working with LaSalle Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.] in the surgery department on experiments as a medical student, fabulous stuff, fabulous stuff, learning, we know the veins in the arteries but I'm learning about the lymphatic system, the little teeny vessels that allow this fluid that goes through our bodies that help clean our bodies.  We don't know about that stuff.  We still don't, but I'm learning how to inject these lymphatics to see where they are, and also where cancer is going to metastasize to, and how cancer spreads from one organ to a next through these lymphatics.  Fabulous system.  So, all of this is what is helping to mold me as a young surgeon, if you would.
Speaker 1: And now are you at all interested in urology at this point?
Speaker 2: Don't know anything about urology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Urology was very exotic, and not until I get to Montefiore, if you would, and then in the [U.S.] Air Force do I really see what urology is about.  But you got to know about it, it's on the boards, it's all in the tests, you got to know all of these things about things so that you can get through medical school, but you don't have any hands-on experiments with it, not until the Air Force.
Story_ID: 442944
Speaker 1: Let me back you up because you're doing a sort of a step by step through the Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York], so if we could go back to your being there, you're back to a place that you know, which is great, and then sort of take us through there before you leave for the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 2: Well, I was at Montefiore for just the one year.
Speaker 1: Okay, I understand, I understand.
Speaker 2: The internship, and it's just a whole lot of work--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then, boom, I get this letter, you're drafted--
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: --you know, and the Air Force wants you and, yeah, I had a whole lot of friends going to Canada, running away from this absurd war [Vietnam War].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What are we doing over there?  As Muhammad Ali says, you know, nobody over there is calling me a nigger, huh?  Why am I going to go over there and fight those people, these other colored people?  And Ali came to Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] campus and sat with us as med students.  A fantastic man.  Still, everybody knows his history.  So, I get this letter and I said, and I'm not sure why I said it but, I said, no, I'm not going to run away to Canada, you know.  They want me for two years and I'll go in.  And they offered me a location and, you know, I said, yeah, I'd love to see the East, I don't want to go to Vietnam, even though it was very good surgical training, you know, there's a whole lot of traumas coming through and you got to learn how to stop somebody bleeding right away.  But they put me in Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], a little island south of Japan, which is where they fought the last major battle of World War II [WWII].  Okinawa is about forty miles long and about ten miles wide and had two hundred thousand American troops on it, along with the Okinawans, because it was four hundred miles from mainland China too and believe me, we were watching China very closely.
Story_ID: 442945
Speaker 1: I'm a general medical officer in the [U.S.] Air Force, in Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], and I'm not very pleased about being there, not being in the Air Force, but I make the best out of it.  I get to see the Far East.  I got to travel.  I got to see Japan and to see that very different culture, and to see the austerity of those people and their--even though they're coming out of World War II [WWII], their dignity, their ability to come off of a failure in a war and still have this resilience of their culture that made them so strong and still make them strong.  So, I got to see Hong Kong.  I got to see India.  I got to see Nepal, before they closed those doors, and I got to see Thailand in these two years.  Fabulous.  And these different kind of cultures than American cultures.  I'm, I only knew American.  I go to Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and I see black America but now this is global.  So this is also forming this mind coming out of the '60s [1960s] and now we're 1970, now.  So, I'm divorced, and I'm going over there as a single guy, and I met a lady during internship from Jamaica named Pam [Pam Delph], and somehow Pam goes to Okinawa with me, which was okay, and we have a great time of sharing these cultures with somebody.  And come back and get married, and this lady gives me two magnificent sons, two, just human beings that are, I remember when Walter's [Walter I. Delph III] born, you know, one son is one thing, Channing [Channing Delph] comes out and I say, two sons.  I was just overwhelmed, started crying and all, it was just incredible, and, yes, I experienced the birth of all of my children in the labor and delivery room, which is a must for every human being.  Every male should be a part of that birth.  So now we're, we're moving along, it's 1971 and I'm, 1973, I'm coming back and the riots are going on in Harlem [New York, New York], right, and people are acting out and very angry and the city is in almost bankruptcy, right.  Bad days for New York City [New York, New York].  So, when I'm in the Air Force, I had the opportunity of, so I'm a general medical officer in this, this, it's not a clinic but Kadena Air Force Base [Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan] had a, I'm blocking on the word, it's like an infirmary, if you would, and I was the one doing the little surgical procedures there and I'm doing little things, and I come across an interesting case that obviously you can't do under minor anesthesia, local anesthesia, and I have to refer the case down to the [U.S.] Army hospital and the brothers down there say, "Well come on down and operate with us," you know.  So, that's the way it was.  So I go down to Kue [U.S. Army Hospital Camp Kue, Okinawa, Japan], the Army hospital, I guess it was Kue, and I'm starting to see urology for the first time.  And I'm seeing pediatric urology, children with kidney problems, obstructions, and what have you, and a very good white urologist, Army trained urologist, Doug Soderdahl [Douglas Soderdahl] is his name, and he was doing all these operations on children with obstructed kidneys, children that have recurring infections and there are many of them have a problem where their bladders aren't developed enough to maintain the urine there, and the urine infected goes back up into the kidneys by reflux, just like an acid reflux in the stomach, well you can have reflux from the kidney, from the bladder to the kidneys, and these kids get sick and they can't get well.  So, there's a surgical remedy for that and you go in and taper down these urinaries and re-implant them into the bladder into a way so that the bladder is now competent, and it doesn't shoot this infected urine back up anymore, and this young guy is doing a whole lot of these operations, and I'm saying, wow, I didn't learn this in medical school.
Story_ID: 442946
Speaker 1: So, there was urology, I write back to Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York] 'cause they were holding a surgical spot for me, and I said, "I'm now interested in urology and when I come back I want to talk to Selwyn Fried, the chief, and I'm going to ask him for a slot in urology."  So, that's how I go into urology (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And did, in addition to your interest, did you think that urology was something that was needed in the Manhattan, Harlem [New York, New York] community?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  We didn't have a urologist.  We didn't have any urologists.  My father [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.], in his final days, ended up having all kinds of surgery.  Had this big neck tumor and had to have that removed, so had head and neck surgery, and we didn't have any head and neck surgeons, nobody who was trained in that.  So, it was a neurosurgeon who was an outstanding surgeon that did that operation on my dad at Sydenham Hospital [New York, New York], which it just closed a while ago.  So, he also couldn't urinate during this hospitalization.  So, another general surgeon takes out his prostate 'cause there were no urologists there.  So, another reason why, well, there's a need.  And so, I go into urology with Selwyn Fried, and these Jewish fathers up there, a couple of black younger urologists in those days, trained by this man who was again, open.  He was a mean old sucker, but he was open and he said, "Okay, yeah, come on in, I'm going to train you," and even though New York [New York] had fourteen urologic programs in it and seven medical schools in this immediate area, not many were opening their doors to blacks for residency.  Selwyn Fried allowed me in, and again, worked my tail off and that, those were some hard years, physically and now you are studying the kidney at a microscopic level.  You're not learning normal kidney, like in med school, you're not learning abnormal kidney, like pathology in med school, you are actually taking care of human beings that their kidneys aren't working.  So I ended up doing a year of transplant surgery, fellowship at Montefiore again, transplanting a kidney from a normal person into a person who had no kidney function anymore, on dialysis, beginning days of dialysis too.  So, 1970, Veith, Frank Veith, was the head of vascular surgery at Montefiore and he said, "Okay, you can do that fellowship before you go into urology."  So I come back and I have a total of five years of more residency when I come back from the [U.S.] Air Force, five of the hardest years of my life, okay.  Med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] was fun, I learned a lot but, I mean, I'm working very hard for those five years.
Story_ID: 442947
Speaker 1: It was the infancy of transplantation too.  So, I'm not learning only how to take a cadaver kidney and put it into a patient with a need because their kidneys are not working, because the diabetes in their bodies has killed their kidneys, you know, and the high blood pressure that is rampant in our community is killing their kidneys.  So we're putting these cadaver kidneys from somebody who had a head accident on a motorcycle, his brain is gone but his heart is still beating.  So, I'm learning how to go to New Jersey to harvest this kidney and learning the early solutions, Tay-Sachs [Tay-Sachs disease] solution to preserve the kidney while we're bringing it from New Jersey and using it at Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York] and it's just the early days and only 33 percent of these kidneys functioned in those days.  Now we're up to 90 percent but in those days it was, you're watching those people in the transplant, ICU [intensive care unit], every day, every hour and you're learning quite a lot in that one year of transplant, and so the next, and pediatrics too.
Speaker 2: You're doing pediatrics?
Speaker 1: Pediatric transplant.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So you got a little kid sick, got no kidney function, and putting in a cadaver kidney into a child.  And they didn't do so well, and you ended up doing a lot of surgery on these little kids to keep them going because if they didn't have that transplant, dialysis wasn't, hadn't grown enough to include little children.  So, you know, that was difficult for me, just emotionally, spiritually, even though the need was there, I found it very hard to continue that way.  So, it was an important year, but going into the residency was actually a break.
Story_ID: 442948
Speaker 1: The residency at Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York] was an excellent residency.  Selwyn Fried was an expert on kidney cancer, something one of my kidney--one of my cancers was a kidney cancer.  So, and the answer to kidney cancer then, and even now, is surgery.  You go in, take out that kidney, no matter how big it is, you, the kidney's this big full of cancer, and you go in and take it out because the patient will do better without that big mass in him, and then give him, there's no chemo, there's no radiation, it's only, get it out.  If it hasn't metastasized to his shoulder, you go in and take that out surgically. You can't give him radiation, you can't give him chemotherapy.  There were no chemotherapy drugs in those days for kidney cancer or prostate cancer.  So, the residency, not only did I see that there was a need in Harlem [New York, New York], obviously I was going to come back to Harlem to practice, no urologist there, and then PSA comes out.  PSA's prostate-specific antigen.  Every male after the age of forty, starts getting this blood test every year, and we can detect prostate cancer very early, and again, this is just, when I'm beginning to go into urology.  So, prostate cancer, a disease that affects black men in this country, higher than any place else in the world.
Speaker 2: Do you know why that is?
Speaker 1: We don't know.  As you can hear what I'm saying, medicine is evolving while I'm still growing, and we're still working on that, but yes, the black community is disproportionately representing prostate cancer for, we don't know why.  Is it stress?  Is it what we eat?  How our lifestyles are, whatever, but the highest mortality rate for prostate cancer, in the world, is in the African American male.  So, another good reason I went into urology.  And so after urology training, and very difficult years, difficult examination, hardest exams I've ever had to take because we're talking not general surgery, we're now talking a subspecialty under surgery.  So, as a neighbor said, you're an end person, it stops at you.  You've got to be the expert because there's nobody else you can go on to for the answer.  You've got to come up with the answer for these people.  So, I finish Montefiore and I come back and I work at St. Luke's Hospital [Mount Sinai St. Luke's, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: And is anybody else of importance or influence or friendship there with you at Montefiore or doing their residency elsewhere in the Manhattan [New York] area?
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, we've got fourteen surgical programs in urology in the New York [New York] area, seven medical schools, so you have the mecca of urology right here in this city.  The best brains in that time were right here in New York.  Now that has spread out throughout the country and throughout the world now so urology is not so centralized into New York City but in the '70s [1970s], 1975 through '78 [1978] when I did my residency, we're talking the best in the world was right here.  Memorial had the best experience, Sloan Kettering [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York] I'm talking about, had the best experience in prostate cancer.  The chief there, Willet Whitmore [Willet F. Whitmore, Jr.], died of prostate cancer but started the idea of putting pellets of radiation into the prostate as a treatment.  It didn't work well back then, but then a group from Seattle [Washington] years later goes back and studies that a little bit harder because that's a good idea.  A good idea's a good idea, it's always great, business or medicine.  So they studied it better and they said, "What we have to do is unify this so that everybody doing that operation's going to do the same type of operation."  So they brought in physicists to measure and study how to get those pellets in, and then we had sonograms for the first time so we could see the prostate with a sonogram as we're putting the pellets directly where we want them.  And now we've got radiation therapy with pellet treatment rivaling surgical survival, 80 percent, ten years later, are alive and doing well with a smaller operation than a radical prostatectomy, which is a big operation.  So I'm trained in all of this stuff by the best in the world, right here in New York City, and we have none in Harlem.

Speaker 1: So, sure, I come back to Harlem [New York, New York] and they want me to be chief of urology at Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York].  I don't want to be chief.  I want to go out there and work with the people.  I want to run a practice and I don't want the academics of it which is what, you know.  I guess there's a need for that, too, but I knew I had to take care of prostate cancer in the community as a physician.  So, that's what I chose.  I chose to open my practice and ran into early understanding that you're not going to make a whole lot of money off of our people, all right.  You're going to make money, but not like my dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] made money or made that profit margin anyway.  So, my practice was basically what the people had, and they had Medicare and they had some Medicaid, they had some private insurance, and so I accepted that.  I never refused a patient because he couldn't pay, just like my dad never refused a patient because he couldn't pay.  I learned that lesson early.  He's got a need, you're going to take care of that need, and you're going to do the best for that person, the best you can.  And then I realized later on that, you know, I was trained pretty well but I wasn't the best in the world at it.  I wasn't one of these great professors.  So, luckily, I'm surrounded by real experts around me at a place like St. Luke's Hospital [Mount Sinai St. Luke's, New York, New York] and Roosevelt Hospital [Mount Sinai West, New York, New York].  And so if I couldn't do it, I could get on the phone and get some help, or I could get somebody to come and help me with that operation 'cause there's some difficult operations.
Speaker 2: So what kind of procedures do you specialize in?  What have been, what have you done the most?
Speaker 1: No, general urology is kidneys, bladders, prostates, we like to say, the plumbing, okay.  You got to keep the water running, and water will find its level, and so if you can't allow--if you don't allow water to come out of you, it's going to back up, get infected or it may just come out of you when you don't want it to come out so that's incontinence.  So you've got all of this aspect of taking care of people with urology.  It was fabulous.
Story_ID: 442950
Speaker 1: Has that been what you've done in your practice throughout your life?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's now going on thirty years now of urology--and that's a knock on the door from the lady who has been with me for twenty-five of those years, Pat.  Is that Pat?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Been with me for twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold it.  Go ahead, sir.  Who is this?
Speaker 2: Pat Arjune [ph.], my office manager, my right and left hand, doing the stuff of the business of medicine so I don't have to worry about that part of it.  I just take care of the patients and she does all the billing, she does, and she's got a memory that is incredible.  She knows all the patients, by name, over these years, fantastic.  Thank you, Pat.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Nice to meet you.
Speaker 2: It was so nice to meet you, Pat.
Speaker 1: (PAT ARJUNE):  Nice to meet you too.
Speaker 2: She's lovely.  See you Monday.
Story_ID: 442951
Speaker 1: So, where were we?  We're talking about difficult cases, we're having experts to pull from to help me--
Speaker 2: Right, and I'm more interested to know about, similar to, when we were talking about your youth and your education, you know, who were your peers in the doctor communities, specifically your friends, other black elite doctors (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good, all right.  I think the best way to handle that is to talk about the National Medical Association.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I come back to Harlem [New York, New York] in 1978 and Harlem has still got a group of great black physicians in people like Muriel Petioni [HistoryMaker Dr. Muriel Petioni] and Cap Brown [Charles A.P. Brown] and Aaron Wells and John Holloman [John L.S. Holloman, Jr.], Mike Holloman.  And all these great people that are here and a part of the National Medical Association, and I didn't know anything about that.  So, the problem with our local group was that it was run by a guy who meant well, and he ran it for twenty years, but he only kind of brought everybody together when there was a crisis, and there were plenty of crises but what you needed with black physicians was to meet every month, have a regular thing so that we could really talk and dialog about all of the community's needs, and so I saw that was necessary.
Story_ID: 442952
Speaker 1: Were you a member of the American Medical Association [AMA] in the late '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Well, so I'm finished residency, and, yes, you're supposed to join the societies, the associations.  I was already a part of the NMA [National Medical Association] as a student, the SNMA [Student National Medical Association] and the AMA, which was the white medical society, had a student AMA branch at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] 'cause we had plenty of white students at Howard, 'cause it was a good school and white students wanted to study there too.  I ended up being president of the SNMA, and going to Chicago [Illinois] for the national meeting the week before, again, 1968 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you spell out those letters?  Explain to--
Speaker 2: SNMA--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: --Students of the American Medical Association [sic.].
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: That's SNMA, so the conference was in Chicago.  It turned out to be the week right before the national convention [1968 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois] for the Democrats, and all the rioting in Chicago broke out, okay.  That was just the week before, so I'm seeing all these picketers getting on line, what's going on, and then I'm leaving, and then you watched the rest on television 'cause that was history.  The NMA was always a very conservative group, but that was our society.
Speaker 1: What does that stand for, NMA?
Speaker 2: National Medical Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, I finish residency, I'm all gung-ho now, and I know a lot of the doctors in Harlem [New York, New York] because they were friends of my dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] and dad died '60 [1960], so, this is '78 [1978], eighteen years later, a good number of 'em are still around.  So, I said, "Well we need a little organization here with this, you know."  We need to meet every month and we have to have it so that all the different folks can come together and talk about the different needs, not just in a crisis when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] gets stabbed in Harlem, on 125th Street, all right, or when Sydenham Hospital [New York, New York] closes because the politics just weren't there for us.  And then Lutheran Hospital [Lutheran Hospital of Brooklyn, Brooklyn, New York] closed and every hospital that we had up here was closing.  So the payoff was North General Hospital [New York, New York], and Cuomo [Mario Cuomo] was the governor, and we floated a bond issue, $150 million to build this new hospital to replace our others.  So I tried to work with them for twenty years, difficult hospital, with a very important mission, but they just can't--they're having difficulty surviving, again, because the reimbursement rate, getting paid to the hospital is from Medicare and Medicaid, primarily.  And then, later on, the HMOs [health maintenance organization] come in and they pay even less so that poor little hospital has nothing to work with but it's surviving.
Speaker 1: So you start meeting regularly--
Speaker 2: Ah, the NMA (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and what kinds of things come out of that?
Speaker 2: Well, we need a structure first.  The guy that was calling everybody together was a psychiatrist who meant well, but we didn't have a president, a vice president, a treasurer, secretary.  So we had to kind of form all of this.  And so, we had a decision to make, again we're talking radicals here, my generation versus the established black physicians in Harlem.  So I said, we can either form a young NMA section--all you need was seven doctors and you have your own little group--or we could try and work with the older guys.  And God has a way of saying, look, I'm going to put you in there because they know you because of your dad, and you know the young guys, so I was a perfect melding.  So we tried to do it that way, and so the Manhattan Central Medical Society took on yet another era in its history, which started back in 1938 when black doctors only could work out of Sydenham Hospital, if you would, the Lutheran Hospital, small hospitals, and some selected to go to Harlem.  Harlem was not full of black physicians, Harlem was mostly white physicians from Columbia University [New York, New York] that would donate their time there, come down from the ivory tower, if you would, and work at Harlem and help take care of black people as a volunteer thing, they got a little paid.  Into the '60s [1960s] they started to get contracts to get paid.  So, the hospitals soon opened up so that all of them were open for black physicians and that's when I'm coming through, so I can apply to Lenox Hill Hospital [New York, New York] and get privileges.  It took sixteen years to get it but I got into Lenox Hill.  What am I going to do with Lenox Hill?  My patients are coming out of Harlem, I'm working mostly here at St. Luke's [St. Luke's Hospital; Mount Sinai St. Luke's, New York, New York], so even though the doors were opened, and yes we brought in other urologists and other physicians to Lenox Hill, and they all did well, the folks wanted to stay in the community.  They wanted to be here, be taken care of so that the families could visit them.  And so, St. Luke's worked out best for me, and North General.
Story_ID: 442953
Speaker 1: So I became president of the Manhattan Central Medical Society, through Muriel Petioni [HistoryMaker Dr. Muriel Petioni], Aaron Wells.  They helped, the older guys say, "Yeah, he can do it, give him a chance," and I brought in the younger guys with all the energy and all these brains, you know, 'cause we're starting to train more and more black physicians that wanted to stay in Harlem [New York, New York].  So, Manhattan Central started to grow again, and after I was president--
Speaker 2: And what years were, was that?
Speaker 1: We're talking '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981].  I had difficulty finding somebody to--the vice president wanted to become president.  They didn't want to make that next step 'cause, you know, we're kind of conservative people.  We don't necessarily want to make that big step, but we're working with the right people, and found Meredith Sirmans [Meredith F. Sirmans] who said, "Okay, I'll come in," and so he did a two-year stint and we put that down in bylaws, we're not going to have a president who's going to run for twenty years anymore.  You're going to change presidents every two or maybe four years at the most so that you have that mix.  And so, then we had Valentine Burroughs, another man you must get to interview.  He is over at North General [North General Hospital, New York, New York] and by that time now, Manhattan Central is really clicking, and under Val, becomes the best, most active branch of the National Medical Association [NMA] in the country, was right here in Harlem under Val's tutorship.  And we started bringing in medical students to the meetings, and we had a medical student forum so that the medical students could meet with the young black attendings and talk about urology and talk about pediatrics and talk about cardiology with these young guys to the students.  And they never had that opportunity before.  And so, again, under Val, that grew so big we couldn't handle that anymore 'cause we're just doctors trying to do something.  We're not business people that have all this organization together.  So, that went on for still some more years but it just got too big.  It should have continued, and it's continuing in other ways now.  So, the NMA was a very, very important part of those early years as I was a young attending.  I stayed on after being the president and was the treasurer for fifteen years.  That you didn't have to change every year.  Vice president had to change, the president had to change, but your executive committee that helped try to train these young guys coming in, how to run a meeting.  So it turned out to be a very good way for young doctors, who don't know anything about Robert's Rules of Order and anything like that, it was a breeding ground for how they could start learning how to run a meeting because later on, they're going to run boards of their own.  So it was a very important early training ground, it still is, for young physicians to come out of their medical side and kind of get into the business side, and then therefore the politics because Albany [New York] and Washington [D.C.] are now starting to dominate what's happening to medicine.  And we've lost all control of it now through what's going on with the politics, with health insurances and with the pharmaceutical companies.  The doctors are now this big compared to the big corporations that are really running medicine, which is a shame.
Story_ID: 442954
Speaker 1: And during this period, if I can take you out of the hospital and the medical world for a moment, what's happening with you at home, you've got two sons [Walter I. Delph III and Channing Delph], they're growing, are you still married?  How--
Speaker 2: Still married.
Speaker 1: How's that working?
Speaker 2: Twenty-three years with Pam [Pam Delph].  She survives twenty-three years with me 'cause, you know, that's tough, tough years and I wasn't so easy to kind of leave all those problems at home.  I also realized that I couldn't continue with that because bringing up those two boys was too important.  So I didn't go--the next step of running a local group was to go and work with a region and work with the national body [National Medical Association] and I said, "No, I'm not going to do that."  And so I stayed back and went to the football games and the baseball games on Saturdays and tried to be the dad, which was very, very important.  It takes two to bring up children, not just one.  You've got to have a whole lot of input.  It takes us--it takes a village.  That's another call I'm missing.  So we're bringing up the kids, the kids are getting really well educated in Westchester [Westchester County, New York] schools, had the choice of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're living in Connecticut?
Speaker 2: No, Westchester, Scarsdale [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, New York.
Speaker 2: Could have moved back to Harlem [New York, New York] with the kids but, again, we're talking the '70s [1970s].  Harlem's not such an easy place to live, certainly not to bring up kids.  So the decision was, all right, we can get great schools if we go to Scarsdale, we're twenty minutes away from the hospitals and the practice, so the commute's not that bad.  It was bad, but it wasn't all that bad.  So the decision was, we'll move to Scarsdale.  And so, we did that and I moved to Scarsdale because it had the most prominent black people in it.
Speaker 1: Who's there?
Speaker 2: It had Broderick, Dr. Broderick [sic. HistoryMaker Dr. George Clayton Branche, Jr.], who had children, he was a doctor, functioning out of Harlem but his children come through the Scarsdale school system, and one becomes a Rhodes scholar and one [George Clayton Branche III] becomes an orthopedic surgeon.  You had Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] and his sons coming through and living in Scarsdale.  So all these great--Chester Redhead [R. Chester Redhead], another very interesting story for you, a dentist, who grew up out of Harlem and gave back to Harlem, and he's still alive at eighty-three now.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And still practicing, too.
Speaker 1: And you said the Harlem community had changed quite a bit, it was a more difficult place (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, the doctors aren't living in Harlem anymore--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they may be working here but now they are out there in Long Island [New York] and Westchester and New Jersey, so that was a reality too.  So I said, okay, I will bring the kids up, up in Westchester.
Story_ID: 442955
Speaker 1: And what's happening in late 1970s or early '80s [1980s] Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, Harlem is trying to get back, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The city is bankrupt in the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s] and they're trying to get back, and, of course, I'm still mostly in Harlem anyway.  The kids are up there in school and, you know, Pam [Pam Delph] is up there and all that nice life up there with Scarsdale [New York], but I'm mostly in the city, in Harlem.  So the marriage kind of falls apart.  It falls apart for a lot of reasons, but finances started happening.  The best years of my life, financially, were in the eight- middle '80s [1980s] and then what happens?  HMOs [health maintenance organization] come in, 1988, and my practice goes 40 percent down, financially.  Patients are there, but now the patients have HMOs and they're paying little to nothing, almost $7 a visit like my dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] was getting, that kind of stuff.  Medicaid was paying $7.20, very close to what my dad was getting forty years before, that's how bad that reimbursement system is.  So, money goes down, I got three mortgages to pay, my mom's [Minnette Tillman Delph] still alive in Harlem, and she can't walk those steps there on Hamilton Terrace anymore, so we've got to get her into a place, so we get an apartment there on 110th Street, get somebody in there to help her, but there's another mortgage and then I took a mortgage out on the old house, and then I have the mortgage up in Westchester [Westchester County, New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Just couldn't handle it and the money wasn't coming in.  Forty percent loss in the revenue.
Speaker 1: And kind of a throwback question that I had written down from earlier was to ask you about, after your father's passing and his real estate, did you maintain any of that?
Speaker 2: No, no.  All of that was sold--
Speaker 1: Except for your parents' house?
Speaker 2: --because dad didn't have any insurance.  So, yeah, the only thing left was my parents' house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's why mom had to go back to work, and so mom worked so I could go to med school.
Speaker 1: And when you moved your mom from Hamilton Terrace to 110th Street, did you also sell her house or did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eventually, yeah.
Speaker 1: --help to maintain that?
Speaker 2: It's worth millions of dollars now--
Speaker 1: Oh, I bet.
Speaker 2: --but in those days, Harlem real estate was down.  That was the time to buy.  We're talking 19--it was a recession, 1980s, the end of the '80s [1980s], that's when I bought that apartment.  I bought too much, had to spend too much for it, but it turned out to be okay.  And so, that's that third mortgage and that's a lot of stress on me.
Speaker 1: Right, and on your marriage.
Speaker 2: And the marriage.  And so, yes, that ends up in divorce too, and I took that hard.  That was a tough marriage because a thirty-three year investment with a good woman, with this family structure, so that was difficult, and that was also the beginning of the health problems.
Story_ID: 442956
Speaker 1: I end up with--
Speaker 2: Your own health problems?
Speaker 1: Right.  My wife has breast cancer, surviving now, fourteen years, but both of us have cancers, and then later on I end up with kidney cancer which really took a lot out of me.  That hurt and that slowed me down quite a bit.
Speaker 2: And did it hurt you, I mean part because of your career choice, working on the eliminative systems--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but yet.
Speaker 1: The health insurance people know that doctors are committed to taking care of patients, and we're going to take care of patients no matter what they pay us, and they realize that early.  And so we're doing our practices and they're paying us less but we're taking care of our patients.  We're not only taking care of our patients in Harlem [New York, New York], as black physicians, but white physicians are that way too.  We are kind of led by our hearts instead of the business aspect of our minds.  We're getting a little bit better with that, later on, but during that period of taking care of our patients, we're not going to Albany [New York] or Washington [D.C.] to lobby like the insurance companies.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I tried working with the New York State Medical Society, and I went up there a couple of times but you're leaving behind your patients and appointments to try to get up there, spend the time, what do I see?  I see for every doctor lobbyist that's there in Albany, the Blues, Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association], has got thirty more.  They are outspending the doctors as much as doctors have to spend on possibly politics and political action committees.  The insurance companies are spending a thousand times as much, controlling the politicians and making the laws, and Washington's even worse.  So I said, this doesn't make any sense, and most doctors said the same thing, we've got to take care of our patients.  We've got communities to help with, and we lose control of health.  Medicine is now run by these insurance companies, run by pharmaceutical companies, and run by Washington.
Story_ID: 442957
Speaker 1: Did these health problems that you suffered change your spiritual positioning?  How did that--
Speaker 2: Good question, good question.  Yeah.  Being a physician--and I end up with a tumor here in my neck, I know the best people in the world, and they're right there at Memorial Hospital [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York].  So I go to Jatin Shah [Jatin P. Shah], the chief of head and neck surgery, and he does the operation and he calls me two weeks later and says, "I got to go back in, this is a cancer."  We didn't think it was a cancer.  So I go back, and oh now it's a bigger operation.  So they take off half of my neck and that's why I got this beard, it covers up all of this underneath here, but that was small compared to the kidney, which happened just four years ago.  And so, again, I know who's the best in the world.  Even though I was trained with kidney cancer, now the evolution of urology has gotten down to not doing the big operation the way I was trained where the patient stays in the hospital for two weeks in pain and all this, now we're into laparoscopic approach.  So it's just four little holes and everything is done with television monitors and stuff, and the best in the world is the Cleveland Clinic [Cleveland, Ohio].  So I go to the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Gill [Inderbir Gill], who is the best in the world, meets me at the hospital.  The hospital has its own hotel, and he's there to meet me.  That's the way medicine should be run.  They even have financial problems, even out there.  And so he does this operation.  I go out of the hospital in two days, back to New York [New York], and stupidly I try to go right back into the operating room ten days later because, you know, the patients are starting to mount up and that's too much.  Luckily I didn't have a heart attack but I said, "Umph, I can't do this by myself anymore."  So we're talking 19--we're into the '90s [1990s] now, okay, and not only am I having all of these financial problems, divorce problems, my mother [Minnette Tillman Delph] dies in 1990, all of these things are coming down on me, I found Jesus.  I said, "Lord, I can't do this anymore by myself.  I am going to give you these problems because you're going to help me with them," because by then I'm starting to meditate and I'm seeing that Jesus is inside of me, and I can have a relationship directly with him, and Wyatt Tee Walker [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker], the head minister at Canaan Baptist Church [Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, New York, New York], comes off the plane, he's got a little blood in the urine and I said, "Wyatt, I want you to baptize me."  And I just, all of this stuff just was washed off of me and, yeah, two years later, I go through bankruptcy, all right, but it's only money and everybody kept telling me, it's just money, and it was, but I'm going through the humiliation of a personal bankruptcy, and I'm giving this to Jesus and that was the best thing I ever did in my life, okay, because with that structure inside of me and I was, that's twenty years ago already that I'm starting to meditate, I'm reading the Bible every day and praying because I'm having all these problems, believe me, I'm praying, but I'm also finding God again, and I'm just going back to where I was when I was a kid, right?  Mom and dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] say, "You're going to go to church.  Oh yeah, I don't care which one you go, but you're going to find one of these churches 'cause that's going to be important to you," and it certainly is the most important thing in my life now.  So, I'm coming out of the operation at Cleveland Clinic, four years ago, and I'm not telling the family what's going on, you know, 'cause a lot of things can go wrong.  And that was stupid, I should have, you know, told everybody, "Look, I've got to have this other operation."  Now the second cancer, and I met another young lady.
Story_ID: 442958
Speaker 1: When you say you don't tell anyone, do you mean your kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My children, yeah, I didn't tell the kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just had to get it done and if something happens, okay--and I met another young lady, a nurse, Aminta [Aminta Griffith], my wife now, and the image I can still remember coming out of anesthesia in the recovery room at Cleveland [Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio] is Aminta washing my face and soothing me because she's a great nurse and, again, God supplies all of this.  I mean, it's just the synchronicity, if you would, of my life and others' lives.  Now it's just a dance.  There was a little something before, but now it is just a rhythm of life.
Speaker 1: So did you feel that, from your--at some point in your childhood you became maybe more like your father [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.], sort of a non-joiner, you're doing things on your own and you kind of let your spiritual background or your church regularity kind of fade a bit?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things I learned from meditation was that as Paul [Paul the Apostle] says, the Kingdom of God is inside of you, huh.  All you have to do is get in touch with that.  So all these people traveling all over the world trying to find mystics and whatever, it's right there at your heart, but you got to slow down to realize that.  So meditation allowed me to do that every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was able to develop a direct relationship with God through meditation and I heard about this guy, Howard Thurman, who was one of Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] teachers at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Came across a little letter in my father's papers from Channing Tobias [Channing Heggie Tobias], who was, at the time, a big head of the Harlem YMCA [New York, New York] and the national YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], and he wrote my dad, Channing, it's my youngest son's name [Channing Delph], and it was my father's cousin, so he wrote, one of the cousins that I know about, so he wrote my dad saying, "We want you to meet this young guy, 1950, his name is Howard Thurman and he's going to be here in New York [New York]," and so and so and so, signed Channing Tobias and that's where my youngest son's name comes from, Channing, and he mentions this guy, Howard Thurman, to my father in a letter.  So, look at this connection.  So, I told you that guy in front of me in med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] when I was getting the microscope, is named Collins [Edward James Collins], and he's from California.  So in med school we ended up driving around the country, second time I did that, and we spent some time out in California and I meet Chip's father, Chip Collins [Edward Collins], the guy in front of me, his father was Dan Collins [HistoryMaker Dr. Daniel A. Collins].  Dan Collins, very soft-spoken man, dentist out there, who was the chairman of the board of Freeman's Church [sic. The Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples, San Francisco, California] which was Howard Thurman's church, huh.  Now how does that kind of come together?  So I meet this man, this was an enormous human being, soft-spoken, played the guitar, classical guitar, he's ninety-one now, not doing well, but still hanging in there.  And so Dan Collins liked to teach people by kind of giving you a little pearl the way they do at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  He didn't go to Howard, I don't think.  And so Dan, on the other side of the country, becomes like a stepdad for me, all right, and he introduces me to the Howard Thurman Foundation [San Francisco, California].  And so Thurman is already dead by now, and his daughter [Anne Spencer Thurman] is trying to run the foundation from her home where he lived, and I go and visit the home.  So, I get to see some of his books, and he wrote quite a lot and Howard Thurman was a mystic, a Christian mystic.
Story_ID: 443850
Speaker 1: Okay, so if we could get you to go back to the synchronistic experience that you're having in California, and you're meeting, although he's deceased, your mentor, Thurman [Howard Thurman].
Speaker 2: So, Dan Collins [HistoryMaker Dr. Daniel A. Collins] gives me the address for Howard Thurman's home, where the foundation [Howard Thurman Foundation, San Francisco, California] is, where his daughter [Anne Spencer Thurman] is, and they have, you know, a little bookshop there, you know, and they sell little things but, you know, she really didn't develop until later.  And so I get to sit in Thurman's library and in his rocking chair, and he collected little penguins and stuff.  So I'm sitting there and I'm meditating, and literally I am a part of this man's environment and I feel this.  And that's fifteen years ago and I'm still reading Howard Thurman, virtually every day.  Right now I'm reading a biography about him and his, and how he--let me tell you this story, okay.  Again, Channing Tobias [Channing Heggie Tobias] talks with this young minister by the name of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and he says, "You know, there's this guy in India that ran the British out of India, all right, his name is Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi] and we're going to go and visit him."  So, Channing Tobias, my father's cousin, invites Howard Thurman, before Martin Luther King, and they go on behalf of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and they sit down and meet with this guru, Mahatma Gandhi, and Gandhi kind of is hard on them because, you know, how are you as black people taking all that mess over there?  We ran the British out of this country that it was ours before and is now ours by peaceful means.  We didn't have any guns, we used, help me with the expression--
Speaker 1: Spiritual forces.
Speaker 2: --King's method, you know, of allowing folks in peaceful terms to sit down because they were representing the truth.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Civil disobedience.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, civil (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Civil disobedience.
Speaker 1: --if you would, because they're standing by the truth and the world is watching.  The British didn't have a chance.  So Gandhi is telling Howard Thurman and Channing Tobias how peaceful disobedience, if you would, there's a better term, I forget, works, and it can help black people in the United States.  Howard Thurman comes back, and this is in the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s].  Howard Thurman comes back and is at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], goes to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and ends up at Univer- at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] where he meets King again and teaches King about civil disobedience, okay.  And the day King died, he had Howard Thurman's, one of Howard Thurman's books in his bag, that's how close they were.  So, I don't know if King could be classified as a mystic but certainly Howard Thurman taught King quite a bit.  And, again, standing on the truth, and the world is watching, the Civil Rights Movement occurred and we won the war, we're still trying to keep the peace on that.  That's not over, not hardly.
Story_ID: 443851
Speaker 1: Well you were talking a little bit about what you thought about affirmative action earlier.  Could you maybe repeat some of that on tape now?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I came through a period back, again, in the '70s [1970s] when some of those affirmative action cases were hitting the courts.  University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] is saying, you cannot bring in black students to the University of Texas just because there aren't any blacks here.  Affirmative action is asking, well, we're asking for three slots, not to take over the school, we want just three blacks to have the opportunity to be doctors at the University of Texas.  And, is it Bakke [Allan Bakke] or whoever it was, said, "They don't have to," and we lost that case and we lost the next one and we lost the next one, one after the other, and affirmative action was virtually dead.  What came out of it was in the '90s [1990s], the chant for reparations.  Look, again the truth, look at what you have done to the African American.  You have taken him out of his country in Africa, you have brought him here, you have separated him from his culture, you have demeaned him, you have taken his spirit through slavery, through hundreds of years of slavery, and you owe us something, that's reparations.  It's not going to happen.  It should happen, but not in this system.  The tradeoff may very well be that affirmative action may still have a chance there.  We're not asking for $5,000 each to level that playing field, we're just asking for the opportunity for three of us to go to the University of Texas, that's all.  And so that's where affirmative action, again, it's truth, it will happen, it's just not going to happen under Republicans.
Story_ID: 443852
Speaker 1: So if we could shift now to some of your--I don't know if I should be calling it, political movement, but some of your board membership, whether that be social or professional and here in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, I, as a young attending, not only are there medical society needs to take care of but the Harlem Y [Harlem YMCA, New York, New York].  They asked me to join their board and I worked there for a couple of years on their board.  Again, learning new styles of how to run a meeting and run a committee.  And we were studying back in the end of the '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s] about teenage pregnancy, that far back, okay, and I was able to run that committee.  So, that wasn't, that's mostly social service but still had medical connotations to it.
Speaker 1: So you're running the committee on teenage pregnancy?
Speaker 2: For the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)].
Speaker 1: And is that rampant in Harlem [New York, New York] in the late, in the '70s [1970s], it's out of control?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Yeah, it still is, you know, but I got to work with the social workers, and once I started working with social workers, then I met the folks in the Urban League [National Urban League].  So Harlem YMCA on 135th Street, the beginning of the Urban League took place, 136th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they asked me to join.
Speaker 1: And they were aware of your father [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.], who they've honored in 1950 for his contributions (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure, so they asked me to join the board there and so I worked there for the tenure of four years and tried to help with the needs, again, not from social service aspects, which is the Urban League.  And met this guy, not so much from the Urban League, but Charles Hamilton [Charles J. Hamilton, Jr.] right now represents one of the pillars of the Urban League, nationally.  And Charles was a neighbor up in Westchester [Westchester County, New York] and my kids ended up being babysitters for his two young sons who are now both at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, those guys are going to be your next generation, all right.  So, Charles Hamilton, again, Howard Thurman, again.  Whitney Young drowned in Africa.  He was Urban League president and died mysteriously.  How are you going to drown in the water, in the ocean in Africa?  To this day I think there was something about that.  But Charles Hamilton, at the time, was a young Harvard student and a part of the national board of the Urban League and they sent him over to the funeral, or sent him over to bring the body back, that's what it was.  So Chuck is sitting on the plane coming back, and next to him is this man named Howard Thurman.  And so they're talking, and Chuck is talking to Howard Thurman, Howard Thurman is planting all these little seeds of mysticism in his head.  So, that's thirty years ago.  So, just to show you how everything is just kind of one big chain, beautifully written, controlled, so Chuck ends up, during all those difficult times that I had being very helpful on the law side, he is a true authority in real estate law.  So he helps me with all these mortgages and stuff, doesn't get me out of bankruptcy, that was just going down no matter what but was a real bulwark there for me when times were tough.
Story_ID: 443853
Speaker 1: And so after the Urban League [National Urban League]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the police department [New York City Police Department].  Chester Redhead [R. Chester Redhead] was a police surgeon, okay, and he said, "You know, we could use you at the police department," and the police department's a mess, but better being with them than against them.  So, I become an honorary police surgeon in 1981.  Had to pass my boards first, then I could become a surgeon.  So, it took me three years to get through that board.  That was a tough exam, and the board for urology is in two parts.  You got the hardest written part that I've ever seen in two parts, morning and afternoon, and then two years later after you've done a couple of mistakes, they do an oral test.  Then they give you your pathology, and all your radiology, and then you sit with a professor, white professor, you know, and he's throwing x-rays up, and you, they just want to see how you function under stress.  So they're just watching my hands and my hands are perfectly still, you know.  A lot of people, when they get nervous, are like this.  So I'm just sitting there like this and I'm talking to John Glenn [ph.], who was a professor in North Carolina, and he's asking me all these questions, and luckily I had all the training in radiology at Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York] so the x-rays--and this is before sonography and CT scans, it was just x-ray, had to get it all in x-ray and maybe contrast in this area.  So, that was easy for me and so I got through the boards, 1981, and so once I had the boards, the police department said, "Okay, you can come on in," and Clarence Robinson [Clarence G. Robinson] was the head of the police surgeons in those days, a black man, who knew my dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.], again, and so Chester made that introduction and I became a police surgeon.  This year they're honoring me for twenty-five years with the police and the American Cancer Society, okay.
Story_ID: 443854
Speaker 1: You have Harold Freeman [HistoryMaker Dr. Harold Freeman], who is chief of surgery at Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York], and the second black to be president for the national body of the American Cancer Society, and Harold and I are on the boards there of the Harlem [New York, New York] branch, American Cancer Society.  It turns out I worked with the board of ACS three times over my thirty years and I'm still on the board now.  They don't like that, you know, you rotate.  You know, you work for four years and you rotate and somebody else comes in but somehow they called me back three times.  So, Harold Freeman, in the '80s [1980s] says, "Harlem is a third world nation as far as cancer statistics.  Our infant mortality rate in Harlem is that of Bangladesh."  That made the papers.  Here we are, in New York [New York], a village of Harlem in the richest country in the world, the most powerful country in the history of the world, and Harlem is a third world country, it really is.  And when you get to cancer statistics, where patients have no access to all of this grand healthcare, we see cancer so late so that cancer mortality in Harlem is a highest in the world, right here in New York City.  And Harold Freeman is the one that brought that to the--the image for the world to see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, national--
Speaker 1: So, Harold was a great mentor too in those days, and just last Friday we're down at Memorial [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York] with American Cancer Society talking about prostate cancer and the African American, and we're now talking almost forty years later, at Memorial, where I did that externship when I was a third year medical student, and now I'm coming back as the moderator for this panel of experts on genetics and cancer surgery, and we had a patient survivor for the first time tell his story last Friday.  So, we're bringing it right up to date for you.
Story_ID: 443855
Speaker 1: And you said, perhaps briefly, that you were a member of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].  Can we get you to just--
Speaker 2: Well, dad [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] was not a member (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) say a piece of that.
Speaker 2: Dad was not a joiner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right, but when I was in college [Adelphi College; Adelphi University, Garden City, New York], you remember I ended up joining all of these different things and so the Reveille Club asked me to join back in the '70s [1970s] while I was still a resident.  And then the fellows, not the fellows, the Guardsmen [National Association of Guardsmen] asked me to join their club, and that's a group of African American men, again, all of these millionaires, but they travel every three months and I can't travel with them, you know.  So, that doesn't work out, and then the Boule asked me to join and, again, all the cream of the crop of the African Americans are right there in the Boule, and it's Zeta Boule, this is Du Bois' [W.E.B. Du Bois] chapter, all right.  That's the man for Boule.  And so I joined Boule and I'm surrounded by all these judges now, the supreme court judges, state judges and, again, all these great doctors and all these great lawyers and these big business people that are, that are building Harlem [New York, New York] up now after the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s], now the renaissance is happening again.  And so, I'm in the middle of all this stuff and I'm saying, "What am I doing here?"  So they just say, just think of it as a shield, you know, it's not intimidating, you're just kind of here and you're surrounded by all this greatness.  So then I joined the empowerment zone [Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation] board, Muriel Petioni [HistoryMaker Dr. Muriel Petioni] was the only doctor on the board.  And Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel], that's Charlie Rangel's baby, he got the Republicans and Democrats in Washington [D.C.] to get together $150 million for the Harlem one to learn how to leverage it so it's $300 million so that we can rebuild Harlem.  And Harlem had one, Cleveland [Ohio] had one, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] has one, Atlanta [Georgia] had one, so that all the burning down that was happening during the riots is now the, those, the tough days are over and we can invite commerce to come back into Harlem.  And so, I worked six years with that board to help funnel monies into these, these projects.  Harlem is being taken over by very big interests, big business interests but some of that is being channeled to African Americans through the empowerment zone, and just left that board last summer.  I was very proud to work with that group, and again, the board, that structure was just incredible as far as the people on that board.
Story_ID: 443856
Speaker 1: Right now, could you talk a little bit about your practice and what you focus on now?
Speaker 2: Practice now.  Well, now I'm sixty-three and my health is not so great.  Luckily I can get up and get to work every day but that kid- last kidney cancer, that took a lot out of me.  And so I'm going to retire in another two and a half years, and I'd love to be able to spend some time in New York [New York] 'cause New York is a part of my soul and I enjoy this town.  This town is a lot of fun and all kinds of things are happening.  So I got to have a little Harlem [New York, New York], always, but my wife is from Panama and so, and she's got property in Panama so I will spend time in Panama.  I'd love to do six months and six months but I got a funny feeling, financially, I just can't afford to retire in New York.  So, Panama is a--if you've ever, never been there, you must see Panama once in your life.  It is not just the Panama Canal, it is a magnificent country of 3 million brown people that are very Christian-based, family oriented people, lovely, lovely people.  I don't speak Spanish very well.  I guess I will learn a little bit and that'll just come with time.  So, you know, with Aminta's help, and God's lead, maybe we'll have some of these final days there with a little rest in Panama.
Speaker 1: Can I just ask that you spell her name for us?  Her full name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Aminta, Aminta, it's actually Egyptian, A-M-I-N-T-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she still has her maiden name, Griffith, Aminta Griffith (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, fantastic, from--
Speaker 2: And we're married now just four years.
Story_ID: 443857
Speaker 1: Sort of to wrap us out, I'd like to ask you about what we were speaking about earlier, about sort of a philosophical end to our talk.  So, I really have, sort of, maybe three questions that I want you to merge together.  If you were speaking to the youth, what messages would you want to give them?  Do you feel that, I think the answer is, yes, due to your revelations about synchronicity, but do you feel that you chose the right career and social pathways to bring you where you are now?  And, what would you say that you want your legacy to be once you have passed on?
Speaker 2: I don't know about a legacy, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I will let those that knew me handle that.  My practice now is slowing down, I'm not operating as much as I used to, but to the young doctors anyway, as I was telling you before the tape started, if I've learned anything about this life, mine, that it is truly a--it's all connected.  When you're young, you don't realize it, and God brings all of these great things in front of you and you might recognize some of them when you're young, but you'll probably remember them as you get to be older.  And all of that stuff gets replayed as you get older and I see that very easily through the patients that I see, my practice, 'cause I still have patients that I've seen from, luckily, some cancer patients that are surviving that long 'cause you can get it early.  If you can get it early, you can do anything with cancer, and the future on cancer, I understand, is we're probably going to be able to treat cancer like a chronic disease in probably ten, fifteen years.  So that should be great instead of it just killing people like it does, and we've become as a people much more cognizant of what environment is doing to us and what the foods that we eat and the air and the water that we drink, and how important that those substances are.  I'm not turning green here but I think we're talking about our environment that must be kept as clean as possible so that, you know, the air that we breathe, which is probably the closest thing we have to a connection to God, just the way we breathe and you take it for granted but your breath is a very spiritual thing.  So, as the patients that I have seen over the years come in to me and sit down and give me their problems, I have seen some really incredible human beings.  I've had to operate, do some enormous operations on very brittle people as they get older, and I have experienced phenomena at an operating table that does not occur in textbooks, that's all I can tell you.  I have, I think, felt the presence of God, leading me and my hands in doing what I had to do.  And the young students and the young attendings that are coming along now, once you find God and you give your life over to God and start recognizing all of these things that are happening right in front of your face every day, and try to see what God is trying to teach you, and we're not listening most of the time, we're just not listening.  But He is leading us every step of our way, every breath that we take.  So if there's a legacy, my father [Dr. Walter I. Delph, Sr.] taught me that opening the doors are important, keeping the door's open even more important, and reach back and bring ten people with you.  That's important, not just like the new generation of, "Well I'm here and I'm a millionaire and I can't, it's all about me," no.  It's about everybody around you.  Get that door open, put your foot in it and keep it open and bring ten people with you.
Speaker 1: Maybe that's your favorite phrase.
Speaker 2: I've said that a couple of times, yeah, maybe, maybe so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We've gone there.  We want to thank you for your time.  We really appreciate you taking the time, it's been a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: Well I've enjoyed it.  It's, this, this was enlightening.  I didn't remember a lot of these things until you actually asked me, so, thank you.
Speaker 1: You're very welcome.
Speaker 2: I really enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: You're very welcome.
