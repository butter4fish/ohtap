Story_ID: 10991
Speaker 1: And your siblings in order?
Speaker 2: No siblings, I'm the only child.
Speaker 1: Let's start with, how much do you remember of either one of your grandparents?
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Edgar Williams] was, had already passed before I was born.  I remember my grandmother [Gertrude Williams].  She, she had moved to New York when--in fact she was already in New York when I was born.  She had moved from Chicago to New York and I went there as a small child and I can't remember what year.  But I remember meeting her once, once.  And my father [Guy Moore] only--he had a sister and she was in New York too and I met her and I, I, I came back to Chicago.  I went there for I think during the summer, I remember the summer and I came back to Chicago about couple of years and my--or one or two years later my grandmother had passed.
Speaker 1: And you were about how old?
Speaker 2: I guess about, I must have been about three or four when I went so I must have been about five or six, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Your mom, what do you remember most about your mom [Violet Williams Moore]?
Speaker 2: My mother was not very well educated.  She, she, she could read a little bit and she'd write her name and everything. But she--she was in, in her early days she was in a carnival.  In fact my mother was a violinist but she was a learned violinist you know like when you see the movie, the TV series they had, Roots, she played violin like Chicken George did.  So, but she didn't play there.  In fact she mentioned that, that by me being the--I knew she was in a carnival but she didn't too much mention, I didn't hear her mention too much that she was a violinist because she also knew a lot of other skills like gambling.  And when she came to Chicago about the time she came to Chicago it was kind of rough then and by the time I came, I was born when the, the stock markets fell.  So she put that skill to work cause there was no jobs and that's how she made her living.  She went to bookie joint after bookie joint and would come home like she was getting a paycheck so I remember that and about 1938 I think that she started getting sick.
Speaker 1: Did you know what was wrong?
Speaker 2: Yes, she had a, think she had cancer of the uterus.
Speaker 1: And your mom and dad--?
Speaker 2: Okay, no my mother--my father at this time back there about 1930, '31 [1931] they separated and he went into the merchant marines.  And by the time that she had died at this particular time I think they were--he was out on the ocean somewhere and the problems they were having back then, think they were having problems with Germany then and couldn't get in touch with him.  I didn't hear from him until later on in the '40s [1940s].  So my mother was--and she wanted me to be with her relatives there.  I had relatives here too but she rather for my aunt to raise me cause that was my grandmother's, my grandmother's sister and her daughter, they raised me till I guess I was about nine.  I, I, I was, well I was a teenager when I left.  I was about eighteen, nineteen when I left New Orleans.
Story_ID: 10992
Speaker 1: I got some of my--I had a little bit of elementary here.  I went to, I started at Doolittle [James R. Doolittle Elementary School] and I went to Raymond [Benjamin W. Raymond] School.  And when I, I was in fourth or fifth grade when I left, then I went to New Orleans and I went to a school called Thomy Lafon [School].  And then when--I had already been at another school, McDonogh [Elementary School] on 36th, that's where I first started.  Then later I went to this other school, Thomy Lafon.  But meanwhile when I was at McDonogh I took up piano and my--one of my great uncles' wife was a piano teacher so she taught me.  And I gave it up because my aunt wanted me to play--I didn't mind playing for church but she didn't want me to play--at that time jazz was really hot, it was back in the early '40s [1940s] and she didn't want me to play, she didn't want me playing jazz in the house so I gave that up.  Because I took up the bell iron when I went to Thomy Lafon and I played the bell iron with the marching band, elementary band.  Then when I, about the latter part of--I graduated from elementary school there, it was about the latter part of my graduation that I got into a little band in school.  And then I went to Booker T. Washington High [School] and I was in the--meanwhile before I went to Booker T. Washington I also ran away from New Orleans.  I was about thirteen and ran away.  I didn't like it down there.  It was too hot and I came back to Chicago.  So I went--when I come back to Chicago I went to Copernicus [Elementary] School in Englewood and I went there for a while.  Then when I went back to Chicago and I didn't run away this time.  The next time I come back for the summer and I wanted to stay a little while longer so I went to Englewood just a little short time then I went back to New Orleans and stayed there until I was around eighteen, nineteen, about eighteen.  I left, when I went back I graduated from Thom, I went back to Thomy Lafon and I graduated and I went to Booker T. Washington High School.  That's when I had taken up with the music department, got into the school band.
Speaker 2: So you were born here in Chicago--?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but a lot of your youth--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 1: Was in, in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: In New Orleans--?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: --until you like got through high school?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 10993
Speaker 1: Tell me what are the sights, sounds or smells that remind you most of your childhood?
Speaker 2: One of the sights I remember I used to like the sights of the Bud Billiken Parade when I was younger here in Chicago.  And then I really, one thing I really liked when I was in--I never could get used to New Orleans but what I really liked was the Mardi Gras, that was really--and the smells down there, the Creole food, I really enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: In Chicago, what neighborhood did you grow up in and what was life like in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Okay, that was in, okay I grew up in--well first I was born in Cook County Hospital and my mother [Violet Williams Moore] and father [Guy Moore] stayed over there until, until I, I think when my father had left and went to the merchant marines.  My mother--I was five.  I was almost ready to go to school and I would come over to the west, south side and I went to [James R.] Doolittle [Elementary School].  That was at 35th and Rhodes.  And, and then later on she moved over to 36th Place between Indiana and Michigan.  And by the way I had a couple of other musicians that I came up with, Leo and Bobby Blevins, they were right there on 36th and Indiana.  And Buddy Young lived right next door, the football player, he lived right next door to me.  And I think this girl was named Joanne Henderson, she is a singer and I do remember she worked at the Club DeLisa years later.  And I'm trying to think of somebody else.  Oh, one of the fellows, Clarence Williams, his father owned a grocery store right there at 36th Street and he became an alderman.  I don't remember what ward.  So--and Josephine Jefferson that had the Pumpkin Room, she was also with Larry Smart, I think, Affair, Smart Affair [Larry Steele's Smart Affair] or something like that.  So I came up with kind of nice group there.
Story_ID: 10994
Speaker 1: During your elementary school years did you remember, do you have a favorite teacher or what kind of experience in your elementary school years stand out?
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago or both?
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I do remember a teacher at [Benjamin W.] Raymond School, her name was Ms. Adele (ph.), I remember her most outstanding cause she took more time with you know teaching us.  And, and I remember a teacher in New Orleans by the name of Ms. Prentice.  She was another teacher that took a lot of time with me, those two teachers.  And my band instructor in Booker T. Washington [High School, New Orleans] really was a, a--I admired, she was an inspiration because I really didn't have no idea of being a musician.  That was just something I liked and I just took, took up with.  I had no idea of being one as an adult, being a musician as an adult.  But I admired her because she took so much time in teaching us.  And really I wanted to play that violin first.  At that time I didn't know my mother [Violet Williams Moore] was a violinist until I got grown because my, my cousin and my aunt, they didn't want me to know that she was a violinist because they didn't approve of her playing in the carnival.  And in fact they didn't approve of playing that type of music.  They were kind of religious you know.  So they didn't tell me.  I didn't know until one of my, I had a great-uncle here and he told me.  And he waited till I was grown to tell me you know.  So I really wanted to play the violin and that, this instructor that was, the band instructor in Booker T., she was a cello player.  And she had offered to teach me that cause she said she didn't have enough children wanting to play violin at that, that particular time and she couldn't teach it, you know, there in the school.  So she said, but I'll give you private lessons.  My aunt wouldn't let me do it.  So she said, when I got in, she said what instrument would you like to play?  So I hadn't played nothing but the you know, I had a little knowledge of the piano and the bell iron. The bell iron, it's like a, a xylophone only it's a marching xylophone.  They call it a bell iron.  So she said, the bell iron, she said is already taken.  She said, only two instruments I got left, she said three, clarinet, trombone and drums.  So first I said clarinet.  I took that home--by the way my instructor was named Doris Duvino (ph.).  But just before I left school she married and her name was Doris Bothie (ph.).  So I took the trumpet home.  When I took it home to practice on it, my aunt hit the ceiling.  Why do you want to play an instrument like this?  She said this is the one that that boy, that man played that had, his jaws stick out.  She was talking, she was talking about Dizzy Gillespie.  So I said, well I would like to play the clarinet.  So I'm loading--and at that time I got a clip in the paper about it.  My embouchure wasn't too well, you know, developed yet.  I had just started so my jaws poked out.  Oh no, you're taking that back.  So I took that back and I told Ms. Bothie, Ms. Duvino I said I can't, I can't play.  My aunt said I can't play.  She said she won't let you play the violin, she won't let you play the trumpet?  What you want now?  I said give me the trombone.  I took the trombone home.  So my embouchure wasn't too--you don't have to use that much wind like you do with the trumpet you know.  So it still was poking out a little bit, she still--so I got so disgusted and she thought I was going to say well I won't play nothing.  I took the trombone back.  I said I'll tell you what, give me the snare drums.  So I took the snare drums and I didn't like the way the snare drums sound, the musical instruments that they had there in the school you know for us to play, but I played on them a while and I got me a job in the summer.  I worked as a bus girl and my cousin she worked in one of the restaurants down in the French Quarters and I got a job down there with her as a bus girl and helped her wash dishes and things.  So I bought my own drums that I liked the sound with cause I thought, she tried her best to get me out of that.  Don't let them play drums.  Don't nobody play drums like that but boys.  Boys play drums.  I said well I'm gonna be a boy cause I'm playing this one.  So I started playing the drums in school and got into the marching band and I went on into the concert band.  And--.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you started your music?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I started in elementary school I must have been about thirteen, fourteen years old and about fifteen on up when I got in high school.  And I played in a concert there.  I didn't play in a jazz band.  I, I tried to play a little jazz when I was in, on, on the bell iron but I wasn't too hot on that, you know.  But when I got into the, high school and I tried to do drums, my coordination wasn't so hot so I just stuck with the snare drum and I played a little bit of the kettle drum, you know the tympanis.  I played a little bit of that and the concert drums.  So when I left school I didn't graduate.  I left for, before graduation.  I was, and when I left I was, I was in the twelfth grade when I left.  I had just got into the twelfth grade in September and I think that October I come back to Chicago.
Story_ID: 10995
Speaker 1: What made you leave school?
Speaker 2: My aunt did--was the kind of person, she did something that I didn't particularly like.  She moved in with somebody her mother and I both didn't like.  I tried to get my aunt to go with me because she moved in with a gentleman and it was her boyfriend or something and his wife was elderly and we didn't, we didn't like this very--and I definitely didn't like it so that's why I moved, I left and I came on back to Chicago.  Now--and she stayed there, she died about, I think she died about four months, four or five months after I had left because it, it bothered her.  She already had a, a heart condition you know so she died about that time.  So I came on back here to Chicago then I went to Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School], I went to Phillips to finish, to get my diploma, ended up in the high school, in the Wendell Phillips night school band and we were mostly a concert band.  While I was in the concert band, some of the fellows got together and had a, a jazz band.  So I still wasn't up on jazz and I met this fellow named Al Knighten, played bass and he thought I had a--he said you got a good left hand for a drummer.  He said you, you playing now?  I said no, I just, I come here to get a diploma so he got me interested in--cause the school had a drum set and he got me interested in playing cause I was in the concert band but I wasn't playing a set yet.  Got me interested in that and he got me a, a, a tutor for the drums, his name was Frank Kirkland.  And later on in years he played with Bo Diddley and he taught me to play the set.  And from then on forgot about the diploma and everything after the, after we got out of night school band, got into the jazz band and we would--when I started playing professionally then I started playing the blues players, John Brooks, Sunnyland Slim [Blues Band], and then you know from then on I went on you know to better things.
Speaker 1: So you were about eighteen when you actually started playing professionally?
Speaker 2: Well now I was, professional I was about twenty, twenty, twenty-one something like that, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And the years between when you left school and when you started playing professionally, what did you do in those years?
Speaker 2: Okay, when I--at twenty I had no time in between.  I had met a man [Walter Reed] much older than I was and he was a, a, a tailor and had a cleaners.  So he was interested in, in--he had heard me play in one of the blues places and he, his tailor shop was really right around the corner from where I lived.  I lived on 39th and, and, 39th and Dearborn and his tailor shop was right around there.  So he started talking to me and we started going out together and everything.  And I had gotten pregnant with a little girl [Deone Moore] so I--later on my, I was staying with my--my mother [Violet Williams Moore] had a stepsister that lived here too.  She was born, think she was born in Mississippi, I done forgot.  Anyway, I stayed with her and she told me, she said that, she said you better marry this fellow.  Said he got a pressing shop and some kind of security for your child now, cause I wasn't really deeply in love you know or nothing like that at that time, just somebody taking me out.  And he took me to the best lounges you know and I wanted to go hear these different bands and everything.  So I did and, and my daughter was born November 21st, nineteen, 1952.  So I had the, I was already pregnant when I was playing with the blues fellows then, um-hmm.  And then, then I got into the union in 1953, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Was it difficult getting in the union?
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh.  We--at that time it was all-black union called Local 208 so, and it was located on 39th and State Street.
Speaker 1: What kind of benefit was the union offering?
Speaker 2: Well at that time and still it's not too hot now.  It's a little better than what they used to-- you really didn't have too many benefits other than getting jobs.  They would get you nice, pretty nice jobs.  I got some pretty nice jobs out of it but we didn't have no kind of insurance or nothing like that.
Story_ID: 10996
Speaker 1: How many children do you have?
Speaker 2: I just had the one girl [Deone Moore].
Speaker 1: Oh just one?  Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, and cause him [Walter Reed] and I separated about a year later, um-hmm.
Story_ID: 10997
Speaker 1: You'd have to have an agent back then or the union--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: The union would you know, here in Chicago at least you know.  But to tell you the truth back there in them days a lot of musicians would go and get their, you know, own jobs and everything cause when I worked with this one fellow Phill Cheatum, he booked his own gigs and a lot of the other musicians did too you know.  Some of them might have got agencies to go into the larger clubs or nightclubs or something you know.
Speaker 1: What were the wages like for musicians then?
Speaker 2: Oh okay.  A lot of times like when I first started playing we didn't, we didn't go through the union.  And I think I played in a little club over, a little lounge over on 40th and Cottage Grove and I got about four, four dollars an hour on that, about three or four dollars an hour.  We played about three or four hours. And, and then I really don't remember what the wages was for, if you went through the union because we had to pay union dues plus taxes on it and everything.  So I don't remember what--I think it might have been about fifteen, twenty dollars.  I know it wasn't an hour, maybe be a night or something.  I can't remember you know about the wages back there then too well but it wasn't that much you know.
Story_ID: 10998
Speaker 1: How old was your daughter [Deone Moore] when you went on the road?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And who kept her?
Speaker 2: Okay.  When I went on the road my mother's [Violet Williams Moore] half-sister kept her and between her and her, her father, she would go you know back and forth to her father and they kept her.  And then when I'd come back I would stay with my aunt all the time you know come back to her place and stay.
Speaker 1: Now did your husband, was it a problem with you going on the road and--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: No, the problem with him--he was a, a drinker.  Then I found out later that legally I wasn't married to him.  He hadn't divorced, he had--I was the fifth and he had a fourth wife and he hadn't divorced the third one.  So--and I approached him with it and he said, he said I didn't think I had to, you know whatever.  But I didn't--the main thing I would have made it legally but I couldn't put up with the, that drinking cause that made me, that's why we separated.  We might have been together maybe a little longer than a year, but it wasn't too long.
Speaker 1: What was your husband's name?
Speaker 2: Walter Reed.
Speaker 1: And your daughter's name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Deone Reed but she changed it to my name, Moore.  She's--her name is Deone Moore.
Speaker 1: Is that D-I-O-N-N?
Speaker 2: No, D-E-O-N-E.
Speaker 1: So Deone was a young baby--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --when you started really getting into your music.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You were becoming professional--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Well when I, when I left her she wasn't a baby cause I was be, maybe go to Milwaukee or something and back and on my gigs my aunt would keep her you know and everything.  She wasn't really a, a baby when I was--she was about three years old I think cause I took her with me to Kansas City when I had a, a--we had a job in Kansas City at a, what they called them then, strip, called them strip lounge, strip joints.  We had a strip lounge.  And we also did extra lounges.  This fellow Phill Cheatum he was the one got them so they called us to come to this strip joint first and we did a little outside job.  Like we worked during the week, on the weekend we would do a--Phill would give dances you know and we would, we had pretty good work and I took her with, with me.  So his wife would take care of her while you know I would work and everything.  So she stayed with me until the--I think she stayed with me until I was, she--I'm trying to think.  She stayed a little bit--almost a year then she--he went, he left Kansas City.  I stayed cause I stayed there working in this lounge and he had to go back.  Somebody in his family died.  So then his wife asked if I wanted her to take her back with her.  She said, "Probably I could keep her for you, you know while you're still here." So she did.  She brought her back and she kept her for me for a while and then later on my aunt she, and her daddy started keeping her.
Speaker 1: What was life like on the road for a young woman musician back in the early and late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: It was kind of, it was kind of nice and it was kind of rough too because I would have fellows come up and try to degrade me you know, that I wasn't a good enough drummer you know.  And like I would, I--when Phill left and came back to Chicago, I got with a guitar player and he was a blues player so I played blues with him for a while, cause during the week I would play in this strip joint and that was a mixed piano player, he was white and the bass player was black and I think we had a horn fellow, I think he was Hispanic or Indian or something.  So that was mixed but during the weekend I would play with another, with this fellow.  We played blues and everything.  And so we got to be tight.  We got to be boyfriend and girlfriend and the only thing with him he was real jealous you know.  I couldn't talk to people you know and then he'd get somebody in the, the band, maybe somebody, a, another guitar player or bass and he would find fault because sometimes the men would be jealous of you too you know because you would be taking attention from them you know.  So I had a little problem with that especially, I'd say mostly horn players.  When I, when I was in with Cheatum I was, I was an asset to him you know.  But some of them didn't too much like me taking attention away from them because, especially--and one of them told me I didn't have to play solos.  He said I didn't have the, this back, background so I knew what that was about.  So those were the kind of problems I had mostly.
Speaker 1: How did you deal with it?
Speaker 2: I did all right cause at that time I would, I--when, when you're out there--I wasn't into drugs but I drank quite a bit and I'd take me a drink and forget about it and go and do my thing.  So I you know just learned to deal with it, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: How long did it take for that kind of sexism to lighten up?
Speaker 2: Well I tell you I didn't go through--that's the only time that I had problems mostly and a few times in Chicago.  That was the main time when I--mostly when I was in Kansas City I had that problem.
Story_ID: 10999
Speaker 1: When I, I left Kansas City, well I was there at the particular time, I was at a, after hours, it used to be a little fellow had, his name was Phineas, he would have an after hours jam session in his basement and I'd go to the jam session.  They would meet every Saturday.  And these two fellows came to the jam, and asked me would I like to--did I read.  I said yeah I read fairly well.  Said would you like to come to Lincoln, Nebraska and work with the Summer Stock Company with us?  Said, our drummer's got to leave.  And said if you could do it right away which was, it must have been on a Wednesday cause I got there on a Friday.  I loaded my drum, I didn't have a car or nothing I loaded my drums on the Greyhound bus.  Took the bus to--they met me at the station in Lincoln and I got in the Summer Stock Company.  The drummer was also the choreographer with the, with the show, and they had just finished a show and they was going into another one, into a musical.  The name of it was 'My Sister Irene'.  And so the drummer was so glad to see me he said cause I got to leave in a couple of days for New York and he was going there not as a drummer cause he was just filling in.  This was something he did.  But his main thing was a, he was a choreographer so his name was Bob Fosse by the way.  And so he showed me the run down and everything on the, on how the show goes and everything.  He left in a couple of days and went to New York.  And I stayed and I finished up, we finished the show and everything until the end of the summer and then the band, the, the director, the music director, he formed a jazz band.  Because when we would be, before we'd go on the show we'd have a little jam session.  We got us a little jazz band, jazz quintet.  One of the actors also joined us.  He was the, a tenor player.  He played tenor and he'd act so he joined us when the, the Summer Stock show broke, broke up.  It was called Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska Summer Stock Company of 19--it was called the, the company was called The Hayloft Company (ph.) '56 I think, yeah in '55 [1955] or '56 [1956] or something.  And I'm so sorry, some kind of way I lost the brochure to that, for the whole--I, I didn't go into, I wasn't there for the whole summer.  They started in June and I didn't get there till about August.  But they had some really good actors.  That was the most enjoyable.  I had no problems.  The fellows welcomed me you know and everything.  I stayed, when after we left there we went, left there we went on the road, we did a few things.  I think we went to Fresno, we did a, some kind of convention they had there.  And when we left Fresno, California we came back through, we kept--and whenever we was in a town he would go ahead and book another job somewhere and we'd come through Colorado cause the bass player was from Pueblo, Colorado.  I think we--I can't think of the town when we was in Colorado.  Then we came on back to Nebraska, Lincoln--not Lincoln, Omaha and I'm getting mixed up.  We got a gig in Lincoln, Nebraska and we left, we left the Summer Stock and a supper club called Italian Village.  And after we did a few weeks there then we went out to Fresno and then came back through there and then come back to Omaha.  We got in Omaha, we got into this lounge called The Blue Note Lounge and we stayed there quite some time, a few months, I'm not sure.  Then we went around I think maybe Montana.  Then we came to Des Moines, Iowa and worked there for a while.
Speaker 2: So those Nebraska years lasted from what '55 [1955], '56 [1956]?
Speaker 1: Fifty, let's see, the latter part of '55 [1955], fifty, the first part of '56 [1956] I think up until '58 [1958], '59 [1959], something like that.  And then I came back and I went back with Phill Cheatum, went back to Chicago.  We broke up in, in Des Moines.  They came to, they went on cause the leader he was from, Shellie Thomas was from the Bronx, New York so they went back to New York and I came back to Chicago.
Speaker 2: What was life like for African Americans in Nebraska during that period?
Speaker 1: It was pretty, it was pretty rough then.  You had certain areas you know you could go to.  But now when we played at this Italian Village, this supper club, they were very nice with us.  We played some, we played some act--we were the house band and we played for different acts that would come there and we didn't have no problems with them you know because it was, mostly it was white clientele though.  We, we didn't, I didn't see any blacks come in there.  But when we went to, when we worked in Nebraska in Omaha, was strictly a black club, um-hmm.  Now with the one in Des Moines, I can't think of the name of it, we--it was like an after hour club cause some of the big bands that would come in they would come over there and sit in with us and--so it was pretty nice.  It was mixed and we worked from eleven to about four, three or four in the morning.

Speaker 1: So after the Nebraska years, what was happening with you personally then after you finished?
Speaker 2: Well mainly I had to come back to Chicago.  My daughter [Deone Moore] was of age of going to school then and I really--they, they wanted me to go, the band wanted me to go to, back with them to New York cause everybody went back to New York.  Well me and the bass player he was from Pueblo, Colorado so he went back there and I came back to Chicago.  And my main, I would have went back with them to New York then but my main thing was coming back to see that my daughter get in school.  I wanted to be the one to do that you know so I came back home to put her in a school then.  And I stayed here--I got, you know around these, you know some of, a lot of, I worked a lot up in Wisconsin then so I got a few jobs in and around Chicago up until '61 [1961] when I got with Lady Bird.  I had known her.  Her name was Verletta Davis, I had known her for a while.  I had seen her around my earlier years you know.  She was, she had been, she used to play with Sweethearts [International Sweethearts of Rhythm], her and [Ernestine] Tiny Davis, they played with Sweetheart and they had, they had an all star group.  They work, worked at the Crown Propeller [Lounge] and everything.  So I had been--seen her and I had met her and then, so when I came back and caught up with her she asked, she was trying to get her own girls' group and they had a lounge there on 66th, 67th and King Drive called Robert's Show Lounge.  And at this particular time Robert's was--was kind of going down in business and Dinah Washington and Dick Gregory came in there, helped him out a little bit, got a little piece of you know, joined in with him.  And so Birdie had been on tour with Dinah Washington and so Birdie teamed up--wanted to bring all girls' group in here and kind of build the thing up.  So she organized the girls' group with us and one of the ladies you'll see on the pictures, she's in this group I'm with now.  Her and I play, she plays trumpet, Margaret Murrells (ph.).  She--we're the oldest ones in this group now but we played together and we had a nice--I think we were there about six weeks, maybe eight and it came out pretty good.  You know we had, we played about some, behind some of the acts.  One of them was, I think the first one we played was Moms Mabley, we backed her.  Nina Simone came, we had little acts too from Chicago too.  We backed Nina Simone.  She came but she, she had a piano and a guitar player with her.  She was just on the package with us.  And then Roy Hamilton he came through there and we played with him, played behind him.  And Herbie Hancock was just starting, he was about eighteen years old and his manager came, I remember his managed came and asked Herbie could he you know sit in with us and do a little something.  So he did two or three little songs, tunes and we backed him up.  And like I say we stayed there about, about maybe eight weeks, about two months.  And I think at that time we was there they had a room they called the, the Penthouse was up, it had a little upstairs.  If I'm not mistaken Redd Foxx was playing up there.  We never got a chance cause he was there at the same time, and we would leave before he left so we never got a chance to meet him or nothing.
Speaker 1: Where does your professional career--which musicians did you find or performing artist period, did you find most impressive?
Speaker 2: That I worked with?
Speaker 1: That you worked with?
Speaker 2: Well Lady Bird was one of them, one of them and this fellow, Phill Cheatum, he was very impressive to me and a very nice person.  And each time I'd go on the road and I'd come back he'd get me to play with him again you know.  So he liked me being--because I would, I would draw, I was a drawing card.  And he said I, and he told me he said I, I want you to get one thing straight, I'm not, I'm not getting you just to be a drawing card he said I also like the way you play because he said I don't care how much a drawing card you might be I still want you to be able to play.  So he let me know up front that he wasn't getting me for--but I had, in between back in the years I did have a few musicians would get me as a drawing and I wasn't that good a--I didn't feel that I was that good yet because I had no, the experiences you know that I should have had.  And in that article I had, I did, sometimes I would feel like I was in a cage, something like in a freak act because people would come up and stare at me like I was something at the zoo or something you know.  And I knew that's what they would--cause two or three of the musicians would complain cause my timing wasn't even that good you know.  So I knew that, that he was trying to get me, you know, these fellows were trying to get me to play with them just to get gigs, you know.  They wasn't going after my ability as a musician.  But Phill let me know that I was a good enough musician to be with him.  And another one was Alvin Cash, I worked with him and he also got me for my ability.  And The Organization [Ensemble] that I'm with now, that's the name of it, the band I'm with now, The Organization they were the same.  Dave Anderson was the lead tenor in that.  So they were very impressive to me.
Story_ID: 11001
Speaker 1: When you came off the road because your daughter [Deone Moore] was going into college--?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: How did you shape your career then just to be part time or just whatever you--?
Speaker 2: I--well see at that particular time jazz clubs and lounges and clubs were going out, you know going down.
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: This is in the latter part of the '60s [1960s] and the road was really, you couldn't find too many gigs at that particular time you know.  So--and it, I said well it's about time for me to you know see to my, help my daughter in college and everything so I just came on off.  So I, I knew I probably would have to get what we call a day job so I had, I had to have more experience in the summertime with working in plants as a punch press operator.  And when I came off the road I said well I got to get a job so I went into the field you know I, I was familiar with.  Well when I first went I went to a plant called, plant they called Selfix.  They made towel racks and hooks and things that would glue on the wall.  So I would, I got this job punching the backs of the hooks and towel racks and somebody else would glue them so they could be, so when you bought them they'd stick on the wall.  And that was a big drop of salary from what I was used to because I think I was making about sixty-nine dollars a week at that time.  So--.
Speaker 1: At Selfix?
Speaker 2: Huh, yeah at Selfix, yeah.  So I said I got to get some--some girls were there and they had been out to, they had been out looking for jobs see cause the union wasn't--you know we kept asking said we need some more money you know we need a raise now.  And the, the people that owned the company, the, the boss's wife she was--I, in between I was playing little gigs on weekends and I played with--[Ernestine] Tiny [Davis] had me play with her.  Her drummer had to leave town and she had me play in her drummer's place.  She had an all girls group down in Old Town and she had me play there a couple of weeks and my boss's wife came down to hear me and she was all, she really liked it you know.  So she really liked me and when I finally decided to quit cause the girls had found another place where you--piecework and it was more money you know so I told her I was leaving and she said well if you want to come back you can always come back here.  I said okay. So then I went on and I got this job, it's called United Air Filters.  It was on 97th and Cottage Grove.  And it was much bigger machines than--and the machine I would--these air filter machines, it was air filters like for a washing machine, the, the canister that would hold the filter-- and for cars.  And I had to punch this punch press down to cut some of the rim around the, the canisters.  I had been there about two weeks and I was working on this particular machine.  I had to do two machines in there cause the people didn't show up.  So one of the machines would punch the whole in the canister where--this was for the cars where you'd put the, the top of the, the cover on the carburetor I think and I punched the hole in that and then I had to throw that down and then I'd go to the other one.  After I punched so many holes I'd go to the other side and take the rims off of the, the pans.  And this particular night I had these cables which go on your wrist and that cable hit that stump, that machine for that machine to come down to cut this--when you hit that, when you first put your foot on it this cable will jerk your hand back.  The cables would jerk your arms back.  That's to keep you know from you getting hurt.  So, but this particular night they had a, this chute, I would, after I would get through I would throw them down the chute and the chute had tin on it and at the end of it, it had a little piece of tin was off and when I hit that machine that night that cable caught in that machine and took a, a joint off of one finger, a, a half a joint, a joint off the other and one off the other and it was, it was a miracle that it didn't take my, all my fingers.  You know all my whole fingers could have come off cause a girl before me had went on one of the machines, wasn't at that particular machine, took her whole scalp off.  And so, and it happened so fast that I didn't feel nothing but a sting.  So I had gloves on and they rushed me to the front and they called the ambulance and part of my fingers and parts of--was in the gloves.  So they rushed me to Jackson Park, was it Jack, yeah Jackson, Jackson Park Hospital.  And when I got there the doctor--I had to go with the orthopedic surgeon and, and waited and waited cause they was going to try to save you know put them back on.  And waited--this was in 1969 and waited and waited and they didn't come so they couldn't put them back on.  It was two hours before they got there.  So then I was laid up for a while and the doctors, they tried to build this finger up by taking skin off of my arm and that didn't take.  And you talking about--now that really, that was the worst part of it, when they did that to try, when they took that part off my finger that was dead that finger ached me.  And at that time they had what they call Darvons and they didn't do nothing.  I suffered for two nights with that finger like that.  But the doctors told me that I couldn't play  no more.
Story_ID: 11002
Speaker 1: Let's go back to the Darvon and pick it up from there.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, okay. The Darvon wasn't helping and your hand had rotted.
Speaker 1: Yeah the part that they had put on there, okay. And--.
Speaker 2: Yeah the, the part that they had taken from my arm and put on my finger, it had rotted, it didn't take.  So I took this Darvon, the doctor gave me the Darvon and it didn't work at all.  I suffered for two nights, that one finger hurt.  So--and I went back and forth to the doctor.  He told me I couldn't play anymore.  I couldn't, I couldn't play--I asked him could I play drums, he said no.  He said something about the--in my arms, you know because when this accident happened I was hurt more up my arm on this side was hurt more than the finger was.  And he said it's something about my, I forgot what they said it was, my leaders would keep me from playing.  So, but by this time I'm getting kind of despondent and everything--.
Speaker 1: How old were you there?
Speaker 2: That was '69 [1969].  I was, I was thirty nine going on forty and I was getting kind of despondent and everything.  So I said I got to pray.  I got to go back to him.  I can't stop now not, not at this age, you know.  So I went and I, I got a little better.  I went--a friend of mine got me a job at Northwestern [University], on Northwestern campus at one of the sorority houses called Sigma Delta Tau.  I worked as a, I was a--where I used to fix the breakfast for the girls in the, in the sorority house and sometimes I worked as a housekeeper.  So I stayed there about three, three, three years.  I forgot how many, but then I left there and I went to another one and--no, I stayed there until my daughter [Deone Moore]--my daughter didn't by the way, she did not go to college.  She decided after I got hurt she wanted to you know--cause she was staying with my aunt in New Orleans and--I mean my cousin in New Orleans and she, when I got hurt she didn't want to go, she wanted to come here.  So she went, instead of going to college she went to Cortez Peters Business School.  But anyway I went to Northwestern, I worked on campus there and in seventy, until about, yeah I worked on the campus there from '73 [1973], I started in '73 [1973] I think, '72 [1972] or 3 [1973] I'm not sure, but it's between that time and I worked on campus.  Meanwhile I have some cousins that were musicians, one played bass and one played tenor sax and another one he was, him and I were kind of raised up together here in Chicago and he played tenor sax.  His name is Walter Clark.  And they got together and had me come and rehearse and had me--I still had my set of drums and everything and they got me back on my feet and I started playing.  I did all kind of exercises because I kept saying, I said I, I said my play from, when you're playing drums you play from your wrists.  I don't need fingers, you know.  I, I, I might have need--if all my fingers had--I'd found a way to hold it with my thumb or something you know.  I said but I play from the wrist so how is that going to stop me from--?  So I started and I got back to playing and I was still at the, I was still at this sorority house called Delta Zeta so I stayed there for a while.  And 1976, and I--meanwhile 1974 I got with the group, this other group that I'm with now The Organization [Ensemble], Bill--Dave Anderson and Bill Radford was the leaders of that group so I started playing with them and they got a lot of gigs you know, mostly affairs.  I, I, I was through with the lounges you know.  So we mostly played during the, during the weekends and then I stayed with my job too cause I was, I liked it kind of where I was doing pretty good and got a good salary and everything.  So then I was a part time musician.
Speaker 1: What did you do to get yourself through that period of depression after your injury?
Speaker 2: I, well I did a lot of praying and I would listen to DJ, jazz DJ, I stayed with my jazz and I listened to them and then I would say I got to, I have got to get myself, get my mind together and don't let this you know bother me and get on back to playing.  So the--and then my cousins they helped me.  When, after they got, when they was through helping me before I got with The Organization, another friend of mine, Aaron Moore, he, he was a little blues piano player and he sang a little bit so he helped me and he had a little job out on 103rd Street or something, had me come out there, just him and I would play and that helped me a lot to get--so I finally, and when I got with The Organization I was, I was ready then to come on back, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So later the combination of working at the sorority house and the weekend gigs--?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --kind of evened you out?
Speaker 2: Right, it did um-hmm.  It was a lot of help.  And later on we got some jobs out of town you know like they wasn't far, no distance.  Like we used to go down to Louisville and little part of Memphis, I mean Tennessee, Clarksville I think and we played so The Organization really helped me more than any, any group that helped me.  They really got me back.
Speaker 1: And physically doing the drumming itself, how did you--you say you played with the wrist?
Speaker 2: Well see, in '76 [1976] I developed arthritis and that, at that particular time it was mostly in my knees so I started having problems with that and I did all right for a while.  Then the arthur started spreading and it got to the shoulders and it lodged in the lower part of my back so I, I had a little difficulty at that particular time.  But strange it is, never has it ever been in my wrists or my elbows cause this is what you need in drumming you have to have good wrists and elbows.  I can't solo as well as I did in my earlier days but I still keep up.  I can't--Rita at KCR [Ladies Jazz Ensemble] she said, she calls me the timekeeper so I'm, I still, I just can't solo like I want to.  That's the only thing that bothers me.
Story_ID: 11003
Speaker 1: That challenging experience [her hand injury] was the vehicle in a play by Regina Taylor.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us how that came about?
Speaker 2: Okay, like I said I'm still with The Organization [Ensemble].  We don't play as much as we used to and Rita Hassel is with the--organized KCR, her and Charlotte Jones.  She got in touch with her--she plays in a band with Roland Brown, The Merchants [Big Band] and Roland who knew the leader of our group, they in fact--we have played in, for Roland.  He had some other gigs, he'd get us to play for them.  So he got in touch with Dave [Anderson] and said that Rita was trying to get some girls together for a play and so Dave had told him said that, told me about it and gave me the number.  So I called Rita and we met out to Roland, Regina Taylor met us out to his house and let's see, Irma Thompson, Margaret Burroughs, Betty Dupree and myself and Darlene Payne [Wells], she, she's a blues drummer so she was there.  And so she interviewed each one of us and she was very impressed cause I guess I had the most experience one in there.  She was very impressed with my story.  And when she did the play, we had to wait about, this was 1994 so, and she, I guess she was still doing her research and we had to wait about, about four years, almost five years when she approached us.  She had got all the material from us that she needed then she approached us and let us know the play was coming on in nineteen, in '99 [1999].
Speaker 1: And when you say, see tell us who she is.
Speaker 2: Regina, Regina Taylor.
Speaker 1: And the name of the play?
Speaker 2: It was Oo-Bla-Dee.  It was a, it was a song, it was a tune written by Mary Lou Williams and that's where she got the idea of naming the play after Mary Lou Williams' tune Oo-Bla-Dee.  In fact Oo-Bla-Dee was played on the, the music background Oo-Bla-Dee was on.  And what is this TV series where the little boy had Downs Syndrome?  Some--I cannot--have right on the tip of my tongue.  He had Downs Syndrome and it was a family.  Oh I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Is that the series Regina Taylor--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: No, no, that was the series where they played Oo-Bla-Dee background music when they bring the series on.  So it was a very popular tune you know.  And we, she had us come there.  We didn't play in the, in the play itself none of the band.  What they did they played recordings and the actors would do the pantomime.  We had a girl do my part on the drum which was hard, I knew it was hard for her to do you know on the drums.  But they had each girl act like they were playing the instrument, each of the actors, the instrument and I can't think of the girl, she played as Sondra [Huxtable Tibideaux] on, on the Cosby Show, the oldest daughter, Sondra.  Her name, her last name is Le Beauf, Sabrina Le Beauf, that's her name, she did the narrating of the play.  And that particular, was a particular time where these girls are showing how they struggled coming through life as women musicians and at that era what I was telling you in '69 [1969] when the jazz thing was going down, she--this girl said she, I had to come off the road cause I had two children.  I had to come off the road and I had to get a day job and in this day job, it was hard for me.  I lost my fingers you know and that's, that's, that's the story line they used.  And what was going on in your mind when that play was performed?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was really bringing back, it was bringing back memories because some of the things you know I was going through.  And by the way when Regina Taylor wrote this play she didn't just get, she got all of the rest of the girls and she put a little bit of everybody in it, plus some of it she got from other parts of the country you know talking to other women musicians too.  So she got some--and then I, I went through some of those same experiences and I enjoyed it.  I said wow.  I said this is magnificent.  And I couldn't thank her more for bringing this out and I said cause people need to know what women, you know black women went through.  Not only did they go through the experiences of Jim Crow but experiences with our male counterpart, counterparts.  They gave us a little problem you know so we went through quite a lot.  I wasn't the only one.  A lot of other women went through that you know.  But I didn't go through it as much as some of them that I heard you know really had difficulties because they had, some of them, some of the women had families you know and if they wasn't having problems from their husbands and their other families you know they were having outside problems.  So I didn't, it wasn't as bad as--mine's wasn't too bad.  The worst part is me getting hurt--injured, that was the worst part of my career.
Story_ID: 11004
Speaker 1: What would you say, what would you mark as your greatest achievement as a musician?
Speaker 2: The one that, the one part in my life I enjoyed and I thought that I really, that was great was when I went to Lincoln Nebraska Summer Stock Company.  Then I knew, because really I kind of doubted myself you know later on.  I always doubted I wasn't good enough you know and I turned down some things.  At one time, was it, Hank Williams came through when I was in Kansas City, came--I was sitting in at a lounge called The Tradewind and I was sitting in.  I think Eddie, his name was Eddie Chappell, he works around here in Chicago now.  At that time he was in Kansas City too and that's where I first met him before I run into him here in Chicago.  I was sitting in with--and his name was Eddie McDowell and I was sitting in with him.  So some fellows there was sitting at the bar and when I got down to go they asked me to come over there and have a drink and I did and one of them was Hank Williams and he asked me would I come with his--he wanted me to come.  And I know he would--and that, that kind of was an achievement too because I know he didn't want me for just being a girl.  I must have did something that he liked in my music you know.  So--but I turned him down because I was really, I really, I had to pass.
Speaker 1: Did you regret that later?
Speaker 2: Um-um.  Um-um, never regretted it.  I had a cousin that did it and she worked at Marshall Field's and well she was much older than I was.  And she tried to get me to you know do it also and she said you can be anything, you can be Hispanic or you can be--I said I want to be what I am.  I said I'm Negro and that's what I'm going to be from now on.
Story_ID: 11005
Speaker 1: How did the female, African American female musicians deal with sexual harassment in those long ago periods?
Speaker 2: Well I only had the one time when I was in Kansas City with this guitar player.  We were, we were doing all right until some, some people came from Chicago and was in this club.  It was on a New Year's Eve and I was talking to a couple of the fellows who were from here.  I had met, the first time I met them and I was glad to see somebody from my own town and he acted a pure-d fool with me and I had to take--he was so bad he swung at me.  I don't what he swung, he hit me, but I was taking my instruments, I, and I reached down and got my cymbal and I threw it and I cut him cross the nose cause I wasn't gonna take no beating.  So that was the only time that I really the, really had a problem with sexual, because the fellows I played with, most of them was gentlemen, was really gentlemen, I'd have to give it to them.  None of them came out the way cause most--Phill [Cheatum] he was married, Alvin Cash, he had a girlfriend and Dave [Anderson] and Bill Radford they had wives you know so I didn't have that problem.  And the fellows in the band you know they were all right and a couple of them, one of them you know, but I set him straight cause after that experience in Kansas City I said I'd never go with any other musician that I played with and I didn't.
Story_ID: 11006
Speaker 1: Let me take you back for a moment to the time, this period leading up to your mom's illness and death.  What kind of relationship did you have with your mom [Violet Williams Moore]?
Speaker 2: I had a pretty good relationship with my mother because like I say she, she made gambling a, a, a career.  And what she would do like when I was out of school in the summer time, I ought to hate movies cause back there in them days back in the '30s [1930s] you know the theaters would be open early, they open in the morning.  She'd drop me off.  Like one of the bookie joints that she would go to would be right next door to the theater.  It was called The Lewis on 35th between Indiana and Michigan.  She'd drop me off there until she got ready to leave and then she'd pick me up.  So we had a good relationship, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: For you as a young child of nine or ten, when she died what do you remember most about that period?
Speaker 2: For one thing I did not want to leave Chicago.  The kids when I got ready to leave I was right, I was staying right there on 36th Place and the kids were saying, you going down South?  Say, they hang you down there.  They say, they say they hang you down there.  And you, you, you can't, you can't go on the, they thought you couldn't ride the buses or street car at all.  Say you can't ride the bus or street car down there.  So I said I'll bet you I'll ride it you know and that kind of discouraged me for really not wanting to go you know the way they were talking.  So when I got there I found only thing you, you had to put a, you get on the street car you had a little block or something you had to always have that block in front of you cause on the block would say for colored only.  And you would always have to be behind that, on both sides, seats on this side and seats on that side.  And while I was down there, I was about sixteen, seventeen, where my mother stayed, the landlady, her son was in, at this particular time World War II had started and her son was in the service.  And they would send most of the, the fellows from the North to the South so he was in a, I think he was in some camp out there in Biloxi or something Mississippi, somewhere.  So he came there in New Orleans and I was walking down the street and he said, he said Geraldine?  I said yeah.  He said you remember me?  He was in uniform.  I said yeah, William.  So I--we would go to the show and go to different places.  He had a little buddy and his little buddy and I'd introduce him--he introduced me to his buddy.  I introduced him to one of the girls in the neighborhood you know, we'd go to the show and everything.  And we'd get on the car, on the street car and they could not get used to that board and they would take the board every time and scare us to death, take the boards and throw them out the window.  And one of the conductors got off the street car one day and went into a drug store and called the police.  And I had told, I said you'd better get off of here I said cause he's going in there to call the police, so they got off the car.  But every time, they said every time even though when we wasn't, when me and this girl wasn't with them they would do that every time they'd get on a street car.  They would get on there and then when you go to the movie we had to walk, oh, about I don't know how many stairs, go upstairs.  But later on before I left there, finally a lot of the, see a lot of Creoles were down there and a lot of them are light skinned, they come in all different colors, lot of light skinned, they would go in through the white side.  And I said shoot, let me go through there too.  I'm tired of walking, I'm tired of walking through--so somebody saw me go, and my cousin she said girl if you, don't, don't you ever do that, said you'll go to jail for that.  I said they put you in jail?  She said, yeah.  And I said--she said if you caught, if you caught sitting on that car, on that street car in front of that, that little piece of plank, said they'll take you to jail.  Said if you caught going in there--I said well it's a whole lot of light skinned blacks going in there.  I said they'll have the whole wagon full of us then, you know.  She said well I don't want you going in there so I stopped going there.  But that was, that made it worse and made me not want to go cause we did get caught on the street car cause I was, when I was about nine or ten I would go downtown you know by myself cause, cause the street car would come right along there in Indiana and I'd go downtown by myself.  We could get to sit anywhere and I couldn't get used to that, and if there was any seats in the front and that board, I couldn't sit up there, you couldn't sit up--you had to stand up.  That's what the, what's her name, Parks, [Rosa Parks], that's what she went through, um-hmm.  So I knew just what she was talking about.

Speaker 1: Does your daughter [Deone Moore] have any musical--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: She did when she--cause she went to the same high school and she kept asking me she wanted to play flute.  And I told her, I said now, I said I don't want you just play flute to be playing flute.  I said well you're going to play a--that's part of a woodwind instrument.  I said well you're going to play flute you should learn to play the clarinet first.  I said in that way if you play the clarinet you can play any of the other, you can play flute, oboe, French horn, bassoon, any of them, I mean not French horn, English horn, any of them, sax, any, any of the sax.  You know in them days we had the one they have now the straight sax, what they call it the soprano sax, they even had that then.  And I told her I said you could play anything.  I said the flute would be much easier for you if you played the clarinet first.  She didn't want to.  She wanted to go straight to it so I said I'll tell you what, if you bother me enough I'll let you.  So she didn't bother me like she should have cause I had a flute.  I had an Armstrong flute cause I was fooling around with it myself and I said if you bother me enough I'll give, I'll give it to you.  And that flute was--I probably would have sent it to her but it was stolen from me.  And she never, she never bothered me too much you know she bothered me for about six months and then she got in, she got into the drill corps at school.  So she didn't bother--she said she wanted fool with, she would like to do it now cause she have, she, when she came up here she went to Cortez Peters [Business School] for a while and she had four kids, had two boys and two girls.  And she's, now that all her kids is grown now she said I think I want, I got time for the flute.
Speaker 1: And so what instrument did she play?
Speaker 2: She didn't play any instrument, she just got in the drill team you know where they drill and everything.  She didn't play any instrument and none of my grandchildren got interested in it.  I tried to get my, all--my two grandsons interested in this rap stuff you know and I tried to get my oldest grandson into guitar but he didn't do nothing with it.
Speaker 1: Give us your grandchildren's names in the order of birth, name and age.
Speaker 2: Okay, Robin, Robin Ball, she's, she's twenty-nine, Christopher Moore, he's twenty-five, Asia Stalworth, she's, she just made twenty-three in May and the youngest one is Aaron Garrell, he's twenty-two.  So the two girls, the two girls have, my youngest granddaughter has a baby, sixteen months and Robin she has three kids and their ages is twelve, she has a son, twelve, a little daughter ten, another little daughter eight.
Speaker 1: So you got great grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-mm.
Story_ID: 11008
Speaker 1: --profession and your hobby.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What you do for enjoyment as well as work.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hmm, right because when I got, when I got hurt I had to quit my job, I mean not when I got--when I got with the arthritis I had to quit the university and I had to get on social security.  And thank God that I had a lot of gigs.  Because see a lot of jobs musicians played especially here, you didn't, you wasn't working for, you'd get paid cash with no social security or anything was taken out you know especially when you're working local places.  The only thing was taken out was when I played at Robert's [Show Lounge].  But on those other jobs out of town you know I had social security plus I had about eight years or so with the university, Northwestern [University], so that gave me social security.
Speaker 1: Plus Nebraska, would that have--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hmm, yeah that was too.
Story_ID: 11009
Speaker 1: What would you like to be remembered for or what do you think you will be remembered--?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered, remembered for as like one of the pioneers like the [International] Sweethearts [of Rhythm] were.  Now that's one group when I was coming up and trying to be, was interested in music I really wanted to get with the Sweethearts in Rhythm.  I liked, it came to New Orleans and they played a big dance there and I admired them so much and that inspired me more than anything you know with them.  And somebody asked me, say would, would you, do you like to be with--I said yeah.  So this particular girl her mother knew one of the ladies and asked you know could, how old did they say, they--somebody that was managing the band said I would have to be an adult you know to be in the band so I wasn't an adult yet but I really admired it.  When they broke up I was just beginning to be an adult but I really admired them and I know that, I considered them one of the pioneers of women musicians and I would like to be admired as taking off where they left off, taking, taking it on where they left off at.
Speaker 1: Give me a little background on the Sweethearts of Rhythm?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Rita [Hassel] has a nice tape here with them.  They, I know they started in some little town in Mississippi and by the way the Lady Bird [Etta "Birdie" Davis], she was with them a while too.  She, she went to one of the schools, AME [American Methodist Episcopal] something down there somewhere in the South and she started with them.  And her and [Ernestine] Tiny Davis both, in fact Tiny Davis is on the picture over there with them and I, I got to play with both of them you know and I really enjoyed them cause they--I, I learned a lot from them.  But I really, cause she was one of the pioneers too.  I say she was one of them and I admired her thinking enough of me and my ability to take me on with her group cause she had the all girl's group.  She got the organ trio [Lady Bird Organ All-Girl Trio] and then later on she got the [Lady Bird] Two Plus Two [Quartet] you know.  So--.
Speaker 1: How many were in the Sweethearts of Rhythm band?
Speaker 2: It was about maybe fourteen um-hmm, maybe more.
Speaker 1: Was it all African American?
Speaker 2: All African American, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Who started that band?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  It's in that book, that Oo-Bla-Dee, that Regina Taylor--she got the starting of it.  She did, she did a lot of research that I didn't even know about until after I read you know what she had written about.
Story_ID: 11010
Speaker 1: Is there anything about your personal life or professional life that I didn't ask you that maybe I should have?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think it is.  I can't think of nothing at the time right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, then we'll close with this question, your legacy, what will your legacy be?
Speaker 2: What I, what I would like to be remembered as, not as just  a musician but as one of, a percussionist, a woman percussionist that had the courage enough, to, to get out there with all the people that was against me playing like especially my family that didn't want me to play drums and a lot of other people didn't think I should have been in that life because mostly I think they were worried about me being on, at that particular time musicians was known then as being the dope addicts of the day in, in music, any kind of entertainment you was a drug addict.  And I think that they would, they was worried mostly about that than the music itself.  But later on in life they found out that I wasn't into drugs or nothing you know so I didn't have no problem with that.  And I would like it to be known that every woman or young person that get into music don't have to, because it's out there don't mean you have to use it.  That--and, but I would like to be remembered as one of the first pioneers in the percussion part, that's what I--in percussion.  I would like to known, that would--I'd like for that to be my legacy cause it was not hardly any women drummers, not even white then.  And the only white drummer I seen was when this girl came out, I think she came out the same time, not the same time but later on, I think it was, Ida Mae Sutton (ph.), think that was her name, it was an all white girl group and she was the only drummer that I seen except for the drummer that played with the [International] Sweethearts [of Rhythm].
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much Ms. Moore.
