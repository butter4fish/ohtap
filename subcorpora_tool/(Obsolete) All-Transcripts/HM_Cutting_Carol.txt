Story_ID: 39969
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five light-weight questions that we ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like pink and green.
Speaker 1: Okay, a.k.a. (laughter)
Speaker 2: Absolutely (laughter); or green and yellow--girlfriends colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere out of Springfield, Massachusetts would do well.
Speaker 1: All right.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have a--I have a number of them; I love to quote Booker T. Washington and some of the things that I like to live by, and a lot of biblical scriptures; I use those for encouragement and to keep me going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you have a favorite, or one you wanna quote us now?
Speaker 2: I'll do--I'll start with the 'I can do all things through Christ strengthens me,' because in order to get to where I am today, I relied heavily on the strength that I receive through prayer and praise of God.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39970
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately, and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mattie Dawson Moore Hall, and it's pretty much--it spells pretty much the way it sounds, Mattie, M-A-T-T-I-E Dawson, D-A-W-S-O-N, her maiden name, Moore, M-O-O-R-E, her married name, and H-A-L-L, another married name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Livingston, Alabama--Oh God, December 17th--no, that was her father's birthday--December 18th, 1927.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what are the stories about what they were doing?  You know, what kind of occupations did they have, what did they--did they go to school or did they have, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's grandfather--I can go back to my grandmother's father and his father.  He--his name was--well first of all, my grandmother's name was Laura, L-A-U-R-A Dawson, and Laura was married to Toll--Tolliver, but everyone called him Toll, T-O-L-L Dawson.  My mother's mother--maiden name was Powell, and so I can trace the Powell's family back and the Powell--as far back as I can go, it started with my great-great-grandfather's mother.
Speaker 1: So this is your great-great-great-grandmother, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: It's my grandmother's father, and his name was Jack Powell.  Jack Powell's mother was Sarah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, according to the genealogy, Sarah was Native American and his father was a Powell, and all that I know is they called him White Man Powell.
Speaker 1: Well does that indicate that he was a white man?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he, he was.  From our--the stories that he used to tell us, he, he was definitely--his father was definitely white, his mother was Native American, and as children, we would spend a lot of time there because we caught the school bus there at his house, and so he would talk about things long, long time ago, and would talk about how at certain times, his mother would have to hide in the ditch if, you know, people were passing by--whites were passing by; she would hide in the ditch with them, and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Why would she hide?
Speaker 2: She was Native American with children who were mixed, and she would hide sometimes out of fear.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm trying to figure out--so she's Native American--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and her husband's white.
Speaker 2: I didn't say her husband because I don't know that to be the case (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay.
Speaker 2: --I just know that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--or the man that she's with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--the man who fathered the children.
Speaker 1: Your ancestor Powell who--so her--okay, he's white and she's Native American--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --but there was some problem with them having children?
Story_ID: 39971
Speaker 1: We're talking Alabama, back in the 1800's.  And so--yes there were problems.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You wanted to know whether or not they were white.  Sometime years later, part of the--the white Powell's came to visit and just to, I guess introduce themselves, not to make--not to have any kind of long-standing relationship or anything, but I guess they were just curious.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So your grandfather [Tolliver Dawson] was part Indian and part white; he wasn't African American at all.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But it--you found in the south during that time, there was that kind of mingling, and they would affiliate with or consider themselves mixed or colored or what have you, and that's why--that, that's the tendency.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So your grandfather's--this is Jack Powell?
Speaker 1: That was Jack Powell.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, okay.  So are there any stories about what life was like in those days?  Is there a--'cause you don't--let's see.  So those ancestors were not in slavery 'cause they weren't black, right?  They weren't African American.
Speaker 1: And they were not, they were not slaves; as a matter of fact, they--my grand--we called him Grandpoppa, owned land--he was given land, and owned, you know, quite a bit of acres where the children, his descendants, then many of them built houses on the property and what have you, and that's how part of my growing up was in that, that particular, you know, segment where there were aunts and uncles who were living all around us because I spent a lot of time with my grandmother [Laura Dawson], my mother's mother, as she was going away during the summer to get her education or, or--because of her work schedule, spent time with my grandmother and aunt who also lived there, my grandfather, and so we had a big extended family in--on--in those hundred or so acres of land.  And it was an interesting time growing up; it was a wonderful time growing up having everyone close by, and we would walk from my grandmother's house, about a mile or so, to catch the school bus at my, you know, my great-grandfather's house.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So you didn't know Jack Powell, right?  He would have been back too far, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.  That, that--yes I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, now he is--
Speaker 1: He is my mother's mother's father.
Speaker 2: He's your great-grandfather, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay, all right.  So he would have been born sometime in the 1880's, I guess, or something-- 1870s or '80's [1880s]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.  And is there a story about how that side of the family acquired land?
Speaker 1: It was given to him, I think, by his father.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  There are a lotta stories like that certainly.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because ever since--all that we have ever known is that was his property, it was called The Powell Place, and his children lived on that property, and some of the grandchildren grew up there; we had lots of cousins and what have you.
Story_ID: 39972
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories on your mother's side of the family about what was going on in Alabama in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was an interesting--interesting per--matter of fact, my whole family--her, her sisters and brothers and what have you.  My mother was a school teacher, and during those days, if you graduated from high school and were pretty smart, you know, they--during a certain period of time, as I understand it--as I understood it from them, there were different pockets of the community, black community, where they had established schools; the churches established a school for that particular community and they were just all over the county, and my mother taught at one of those schools (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, I just wanted to ask you what school did your mother graduate from, and did she go to school there in Livingston?
Speaker 2: Yes she did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she graduated from Sumter County Training School and she--the, the interesting thing about the, the training schools--the African American schools were training schools.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that quite a bit.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so when she came out of Sumter County Training School, did she go on to college?
Speaker 2: Well that was part of the story, absolutely.  My mother was a stickler for education; she was very--very bright, very motivated, and very inclined to continue to improve herself, and so she started teaching at one of those little schools--one-room schools.  And as a matter of fact, I was very, very young, not of school age, but my sister and I would go to school with her because she'd have to get to school early in the morning before the children came in so that she could start the fire.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm--so did--she didn't have to go to college to teach?
Speaker 2: During that time, I think there were some special arrangements--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that, you know, they, they made in order to supply the teachers 'cause there was a shortage (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, that's not unusual (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --during that time.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--in the south either for those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right.
Speaker 1: But several--but a lotta teachers didn't get a chance to go.  So she graduated from Sumter County Training School and started teaching right away?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know about right away, I don't know the time line; I just know that when I was three years old, I was trailing behind her, and so was my sister.  We were in school; no such thing as day care at the time and so we went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was my first teacher.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what did your mother tell you about growing up in Livingston?  Did she talk about what it was like when she was growing up or the difference between what it was like when she grew up and when you came along?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She spoke about the fact that at least the school bus came to my grandfather's [Tolliver Dawson] house; that was not the case with them.  Her siblings, you know, they--her siblings had to walk to school for miles, and I'm sure you've heard that story too, probably.  And through the, the back roads, the country, through the town of Livingston, because the school was on the other side of Livingston, and so they would have to go by the white schools, and a number of stories were told in terms of, you know, what they had to go through in order to get to school sometimes, and how they were teased and called niggers and all of the, the, the derogatory things that would have been occurring during that time.
Speaker 1: Now these were the days of separate but not equal, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  And she had cousins--one cousin who was very--I remember her--them telling us this story--who was very, very fair, as a matter of fact, she looked white.  And so they were all walking to school together.  The, the, the cousin was confronted and asked, 'Why are you walking with these niggers?'  And of course she was part of the family and continued to walk.  But there was a lot of--they were pretty--some of the family members were very fair, I'll put it that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it occasionally created some confusion I guess.
Speaker 2: I don't think among the family members, but perhaps someone who was observing them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--as in the case of them walking to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, right.
Story_ID: 39973
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Bill Moore, M-O-O-R-E, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his father was Bill Moore, Sr.
Speaker 1: Now what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Sumter County, as far as I can make out.  He was born in Sumter County and his date of birth was July 14th, 1927, I think--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: I had to think about that a little bit.
Speaker 1: So how far back can you trace your father's side of the family, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My father's--I, I, I personally can't go back as far as I could--can go back with my mother's father and mother, but I do know that he was, you know, the only son, and his mother's name was--well they called her Willie; Willie Ann Moore.
Speaker 1: W-I-L-L-I-E?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just as it, as it sounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: and he, he was a farmer, his father was a farmer, and she was a home maker and a care giver.
Speaker 1: Now did Bill Moore, Sr. own his land or was he sharecropping?
Speaker 2: You know what?  He, he did not own his land; he, he in fact--and he wasn't sharecropping either, but he, he did live on the, the land that was owned by the family that he helped to take care of.  But he worked with the--what they called the saw mill there?
Speaker 1: Okay, so were these white people who owned the land that he worked on?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, and they didn't work, work the land; they helped out because it was an old, old couple and--no, it wasn't a couple; it was a son and his mother.  And in fact, early on, when my mother was working before I got big enough, she took care of me--Miss Holly (ph.) was her name, and his name was Mr. Oscar.  And they cared for me--at least she cared for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Holly's (ph.), H-O-L-L-I, H-O-L-L-Y (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Ollie was her name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Ollie, Oh.  O-L-L--
Speaker 2: O-L-L-I-E, and his name was Oscar, who was her son.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time, my parents were, were married, and so they lived over there on that property in a, a house.  And so she would care for me while my mother was working.
Story_ID: 39974
Speaker 1: So what did your father [Bill Moore, Jr.] say about growing up?  Did he have any stories?
Speaker 2: My father grew up in a family of--he had two sisters and he was the, the boy, the baby boy.  Again, we grew up with lots of relatives around us; he did also.  Very close knit family.  My mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] had--I mean his mother had a number of siblings and they were nearby and so, so was his father--father's (ph.); he was the one who moved away; one of my--one of his aunts moved to Las Vegas early, early on and I think she had like 16, 17 children out there, and they're still there in the Las Vegas area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Now did your father have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: No, he did not because as was the popular thing of the day, he in fact had to work--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so he never did get an education, but he was a wise man; he was a very kind, gentle man.  I don't think he ever raised his voice at me but he was, he was a very well--very well-loved man, and very well-respected.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your parents met, or did they just know each other from growing up in the town?
Speaker 2: I think they just kind of knew one another; I, I don't know that there was no significant kind of story, you know; they, they just knew one another.  It's a small--between Livingston and York, Alabama, there's not a lot going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they attend the same church?
Speaker 2: No, no; not to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But (unclear) suppose they had to meet around there 'cause it's a kinda small place (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes.
Speaker 1: Did either of your parents discuss, you know, what attracted them to the other, or--
Speaker 2: No.  I, I think--it wasn't--it's a conversation that I would have now, but--or some years later, but never sitting down and just kind of talking about how we met; they don't have the kind of story that maybe my husband and I have of, you know, how we met one another and, and that kinda thing.  I guess it just wasn't thought, thought about that much.  They were both--my husband--my father was a very good-looking man and my mother was a very attractive woman, so I just figured they found one another appealing.
Story_ID: 39975
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' talents, their dispositions, their sense of humor or their things they were interested in, how they walked, how they talked, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I would probably say my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well why?
Speaker 2: Why?  Because my mother had a certain drive and determination; she was kind of a nonsensical kind of person, no nonsense.  When it came to teaching us, it was the same way.  She was very meticulous about the handwriting and the, the, you know, making sure you covered your lesson thoroughly, and the pride that she took in education, and it didn't just stop with us; it carried through until the day she died I think.  She always had a passion for learning and would hear and support, and encourage anyone because to her, education was just so critical.  I think it was because it took so much to gain an education for her, so it was, it was important and she always stressed, stressed that.
Story_ID: 39976
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your siblings.  How many siblings do you have, and can you name your brothers and sisters or--I don't know how many there are, but--and place yourself in order for us.
Speaker 2: Easily (laughter).  I have a sister; she is older.  Her name is Laura Pearl Moore, and she's the oldest, I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: So that's it, it's just the two of you.
Speaker 2: Just the two of us.  The, the, the thing about my sister is that during the time, polio happened--so as a baby, she had polio, and so I remember a lot of times them taking her to the clinic because she was--she had certain handicaps, and so that is what, you know, was, was different; that, that polio, which happened a lot, I guess, during, during that period of time--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --from the time that she was born--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and we were born at my grandmother and grandfather's house--my mother's parents' house--by a midwife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was born in the, the country, on the farm, and a lot of time spent there because my mom also continued her education and in order to do that, we would spend time on--with my grandparents--my, my grandfather Toll [Tolliver Dawson], as well as my grandmother Laura [Dawson].  By the way, my sister was named after my grandmother Laura, and my--the time that we had was really very unique I think.
Story_ID: 39977
Speaker 1: All right, well tell us about your mother's [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] pursuit of education.
Speaker 2: Well, as I told you, she started teaching right out of high school, but she continued to pursue her education.  She attended Alabama State College in Montgomery, and she traveled at least three nights a week by herself, many times, to get her degree.
Speaker 1: How far away was Alabama State?
Speaker 2: It was about 100--at least 150 miles one way on narrow two-lane highways, country roads, through Selma, Alabama, through--to Montgomery [Alabama], Demopolis [Alabama], Selma [Alabama], Montgomery, and all the time when she would go there in the evening, she would come back that night, get up, go to school, teach during the day, and go back to school at night.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, that's a lotta dedication (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It was, it was, it was, it was just determination, I would say, because of the importance of education.
Speaker 1: Now did other local people go with her?  Did she go by herself or what?
Speaker 2: Many times she went alone--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --because class schedules didn't, didn't--and sometimes she would find someone who could go with her, but that was rare; for the most part, she traveled alone.  Now just recently, I was--recently, I would say in the last 12 years or so, after she retired from teaching, I would ask her, 'Why weren't you afraid?'  And she would just say, 'Well I did what I had to do.  The one thing I did, I made sure that my car was well-maintained.'  You know, the, the, the oil change, the brakes, all of that stuff, because the area that she traveled--again, during that time, there were only two lanes--mainly country, no, no real cities that you're going through; little towns like Demopolis [Alabama] or Selma [Alabama], which Selma [Alabama] really isn't that big; across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, along Route 80, to get to school.  She would work--I mean she'd go to school, turn around after class and come back.  That accounted for the reason why we lived with our grandparents during the week.  On Sunday evenings, she would, she would make sure we had our clothes ready for the week; ribbons pressed and everything lined up so that by the time we got back on Friday, you know, school was out on Friday, she'd pick us up and bring us home--my sister and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39978
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up then--now how many years did you and your sister live with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: We lived--we lived there a good part of our school, school time.  Then as I, I learned to drive, my mother would, you know, no longer had to be responsible for our getting to school, and so she would allow us to--before we got to that though, there was a place where the, the bus--still the same school--there was a cut-off point so a number of us would go to that--get to that point and be picked up by the school bus.
Speaker 1: This is the furthest point that the bus (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That the bus would travel, near York, Alabama, which is where we were living at the time.  And a number of our neighbors--there were like four of us--four or five of us whose parents were teachers also, and they sent us to that school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we'd reached a point where my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] would say, 'Look, I've been driving you long enough.  Here is the car; you take the car and go to school' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And how old were you?  Were you of legal driving age?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, 16.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Story_ID: 39979
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  Now you grew up in two homes, I guess, right?  You know, but mostly with your grandparents.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, it was a farm.  During that time, we did not have--on the farm we did not have running water or electricity for a time, and when my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] went to summer school, we were there, you know, periods of time during the summer also.
Speaker 1: So what were the sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Home-cooked meals, the sound of a farm, you know, with chickens and cows and that kind of thing.  There was a period of time where we did not have running water so we had to walk quite a little distance to get water for drinking and what have you.
Speaker 1: Was it from a well?
Speaker 2: A well, yes, yes.  One of the cousins--all I can say is like up the hill, down the road and up the hill--had a well, and so that's where we got our well water from.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Oh, just the sound of crickets and the cows and roosters and--yeah, that kind of thing--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: and it, it was (laughter)--my husband [Dr. Gerald B. Cutting] teases me because during the summer time, it was a treat to go into town and my grandmother and--my grandmother had a friend who had a pickup truck, and we all had little rocking chairs, and so (laughter) in order to get to town, we would line--I mean they would line up these rocking chairs in the back of the truck and so we would go to town in our rocking chairs.  It's--it, it was a good--it was good--it was a good feeling during that time; it was--but as I think about it now, of course they weren't driving no more than maybe 10, 15 my--I don't know, but very, very slowly on these country roads, and that was, that was a time I should say that by my--lining us up on the back of this truck, I had an aunt--my mother's sister also had a son who lived there, his name was Eddie--Eddie Dawson, and my other aunt had another daughter there, and so her name was Ellen Delores, and we all grew up together there, you know, so we were like one, two, three, four of us.
Story_ID: 39980
Speaker 1: and we were like brothers and sisters and, and what have you.  We played together, entertained ourselves with simple, simple things like watching the, the airplanes go by and, and yelling up to the airplanes, asking for ridiculous stuff or, you know, like, 'Bring me some ice cream,' and stuff that kids--candy, and all of that (laughter).  So I remember those, I remember those times and, and the, the peace, and just the care-free nature of the times.  But when we'd go to town, it was very--we were protected because we went into the typical Southern Court Square with the white and the black, oh no--'Colored' and 'White' water fountains and I don't even think there were bathroom facilities there; if there were, we were never allowed to use them, and so they were very protective when we did go into town; went right to their destination, did what they had to do, and came home.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That must have been a sight though, the rocking chairs in the back of that pickup truck.
Speaker 1: No, no, it was fun; I mean because children--we had to entertain ourselves, we had no Nintendo's or any of that kind of stuff.  We had--we had ourselves, we played games, we laughed, we made fun of stuff we passed along the way.  No, and each one of us had our own separate rocking chair, so you couldn't argue over 'That's my seat' because I know what color mine was, my sister's and, you know, we all had different ones--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that we used.
Story_ID: 39981
Speaker 1: Now what about church?  Now where did you go to church and was that a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes it was.  There, there was a country church; I call it a country church but a lot of the family members went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What was the name of it, and what denomination?
Speaker 2: Well--Johnson Baptist Church was one, my fa--my grandfather went to First Baptist Church in Livingston.
Speaker 1: So did you all go to Johnson Baptist the most, or did you go to your grandfather's church?
Speaker 2: We really--during the summer time, because there was no transportation, we really didn't go to church that much.  Very religious--momma was very particular; we had the radio, and that was pretty much it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--okay so the family church, I mean the church you attended was Johnson Baptist, was that the one?
Speaker 2: Well, we really didn't--we personally didn't attend that much church as children--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --little ones, at that age.  My church ended up being First Baptist Church in York because my sister [Laura Pearl Moore] and I would go to that church on the weekends, and that's the church that I would say was my church, and I joined church very, very early on my own, own accord; my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] didn't--my mother and father [Bill Moore, Jr.] didn't go to church every Sunday, they didn't hold offices at that time in the churches or anything like that, but they were having revival and we were always encouraged to go to Sunday School and participate in the activities and what have you, and so one revival--when I was like eight, I went to all the revivals, I went to revival, sat on the, the bench and went up and joined church--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because, you know, I just felt very, very strongly about it as a child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, well how do you account for that?  I mean were you--were there friends of yours who were--or were there people that you looked up to in the community that were involved in church on that level?
Speaker 2: No, you didn't have to be involved in church in order to, to know God and to know how to live your life and be taught certain biblical principles, and so we had those.  And I wanted to be--to do the right thing; I wanted to be a good person and I wanted to follow God and so as a child, I, I decided that I would join, and my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall]--and later my sister [Laura Pearl Moore] joined, but my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall], when I went home and told her that, she was very supportive and encouraging and that was my church through the time that I was baptized and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there wasn't any particular mentor or person that, you know, that you looked up to that was a part of the church, I guess, that--
Speaker 2: I would say the family because although they may not have been attending church--bringing us to church, I'll put it that way because they found their way to church.  My mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall]--my grandmother [Laura Dawson] did, and she was very active in the Masonic Order and so, so they knew and they went to church, but again, we weren't there on the weekends; we were back in York, and so they always made sure that we got up and we went to Sunday School and, and what have you, and of course the people within the church were very embracing.  We had friends, we could walk there together and it was a part of our social lifestyle because what else was there to do?  There was nothing else to do in York, Alabama during those, during those times.
Story_ID: 39982
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school?  What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school, like I said, was the school that my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] had to go in early for to--and we walked there in the winter time and what have you, so--
Speaker 1: Well what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: It was, it was Payneville.  Payneville, P-A-Y-N-E-V-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Oh, Payneville--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, P-A-Y--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: N-E--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe that was the name of it, Payneville.
Speaker 1: And was this supported by a church, or did the state support it or county?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I don't know that much about it, I just know that she would tell me that they had established, so I don't know if it was the state or who had established these little small community churches for the colored people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: So this was the Payneville School, and was it held in a regular school house, or in a church, or what?
Speaker 2: It was a one-room school; that's where I started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's why she had to go in early to start the fire in the wood stove so that when the kids came, you know, the room would be warm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all the--how far did they go in terms of grades in Payneville?
Speaker 2: I think it was like the third or--third grade.
Speaker 1: So it was a primary school basically? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have--at that age, did you like school?
Speaker 2: I, I did; I loved to learn, and I, I would say in many cases, my mother was very encouraging, I mean about, about learning.  We were taught as if we were like any other student in that school, whether it meant making sure we learned what she was teaching, that we learned the, the cursive writing that we had to learn, and the little spelling that we had to do; we had to know it.
Speaker 1: And--well okay, this--so you actually were there--I'm just clearing this up for anybody that's watching this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You all were there before school age, the regular school age, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With your mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so as what, three year-olds or four year-olds?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--my sister [Laura Pearl Moore] older so, yes, yes. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--As long as, as long as she could, I guess, you know.  I was kept by this--the white woman who lived on, on the place, this elderly white woman; and as an infant growing up then, you know, when I became, you know, toddler, you know, walking, talking, of age, that I could go to school, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your mother was the only teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.
Story_ID: 39983
Speaker 1: So where did you go after third grade, or fourth grade? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--We went to--she made arrangements for us to go to a school in Livingston, Sumter County; that's when we began living over at our grandmother [Laura Dawson], grandfather's [Tolliver Dawson] home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Sumter County Training School, like a lot of the schools in the south, it took you all the way through high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did it take you all the way to high school graduation?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --now that's different from--there are some schools that only take you to 10th or 11th grade, and then you'd have to go to another bigger school to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Now this was the county school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it served the entire county for, for, for African American students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Now at Sumter County Training School, in the early days there, were there any particular teachers that, you know, stick out as really being--that you really admired or took a special interest in you?
Speaker 2: I, I would say the unique part about getting that kind of education was the, the fact that they took interest in you and I would say most of my teachers--most of my teachers were very interested in the students right through, right through high school, and that's why we knew that we could not do anything wrong; we'd better not look funny at anyone because they had the kind of relationship where they would call your parents and let them know; more than that, we were disciplined in those schools.  There were, there were students who were--well I guess you might call it corporal punishment now; I mean they had that little board.
Speaker 1: (Inaudible response).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how we grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So was there a particular subject that you were more interested in than another at the grade school level?
Speaker 2: I liked science and math.  We didn't have the best facilities, we didn't have the laboratories, we didn't have all the fancy things that most schools would have; in fact, we had books that were tattered and torn and broken and what have you because they were given to us after they'd run their course at the white school.  We would get the second-hand books.
Speaker 1: Emm.
Speaker 2: And we were situated on the outside of town, kind of beyond the town, and so the school bus brought us to--you know, brought us there.  We had to wait until the white buses passed before we were allowed to leave the school, so we waited on the buses.  I don't understand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now this is so you would not be on a highway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--This is so that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--end of the white buses? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Exactly, exactly; or we wouldn't pass the white buses.  I don't know, maybe they thought someone would throw an egg or something at the, the white kids or, or whatever.  But it, it's so irrational; it made--but segregation made no sense, and some of the rules during that time made absolutely no sense--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --none whatsoever.  We didn't have--we didn't have a cafeteria at school for years, years, years, but the other schools were better supplied; they had the cafeterias, they had the this, that and the other, and the new supplies.  But that did not stop us; it did not stop our desire to learn in spite of all those obstacles.  I loved math and science and writing and reading.
Story_ID: 39984
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a library in your school?
Speaker 2: We had a small library, you know; you can call it a library (MOTIONING QUOTATION MARKS AT 'LIBRARY'); it wasn't very adequate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Now I'm sure that if there was a county library, you probably couldn't go, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Favorite--I favored the teachers who really took an interest in and encouraged me and, and helped me to understand that this wasn't the end, along with, with my family.  They encouraged us to, to learn; they, they--the science projects.  There was a teacher who would come up with different ways that would teach us how to, to learn and understand science, and he even started a science club.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember their name?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I can't quite remember; I think it was--I don't wanna say.  But I also know they, they, they had several rolls because he was also the advisor to the junior class because during the junior senior dance, he was the advisor there.  But I can't remember his name; I don't remember.  I'll remember it later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 39985
Speaker 1: All right.  Now you mentioned you had a radio at home, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was this like a battery-powered
Speaker 2: Well by that time, we did have electricity (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--We did have electricity and what have you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Well, when you were about--when did you get it?  When you were about--
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Eight, nine, ten?  You know, I don't--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't remember exactly, but before then I do know that we did have a, a battery-powered radio; the big kind; the console kind that you'd gather around and listen to, to the music and what have you.  And my parents--my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall], when she went away to college in the summer time, would--she--my aunt also went to Alabama State [University], and so they would come back in the summer time and I remember the car radios blasting, and they were pretty peppy young ladies and they would teach us all the dances; they'd come back and, you know, show us how to do all these dances like the various ones of the day--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but that was from the car radio that we're listening.
Speaker 1: All right.  So was there a station that played African American music?
Speaker 2: We would listen to Randy's Record Mart in Knoxville, Tennessee.  I think that must have been the most powerful radio station (laughter) in, in the south because it covered--it blanketed the area.
Speaker 1: I think it was from Gallatin, I think.
Speaker 2: Galveston, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: No, Gallatin--Gallatin.
Speaker 2: Gallatin, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Randy's Record Mart and the--that's when the Hallsman (p.h.) and all that, you know, was going on?  I don't know.  I don't know if you remember all that but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't remember Horseman (p.h.); I don't remember the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--We could get it in Ohio (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --late at night.  We could get it all over the--well, big part of the country--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --black people knew how to find that station--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --before we had black stations--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --locally.
Speaker 2: And it was, it was an AM station, but it had the power that was amazing, and that's where we learned all the music and what was going on.
Speaker 1: Right.  So--and you could buy--they offered different record packages and you could order through the mail, right?--If I remember.  A soul package, a gospel package, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Perhaps; I don't recall, and I know we never ordered anything, I just remember that was the station.
Story_ID: 39986
Speaker 1: Now, did it ever cross your mind that you would want to own a radio station when you were little?
Speaker 2: Absolutely not; never, ever.
Speaker 1: So what were your aspirations say when you were 10 or 12?  Did you have other aspirations?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't know that--I don't recall that there was--like, like my husband [Dr. Gerald B. Cutting] when he was 10, he knew he wanted to be a veterinarian because he loved animals and, and all of that; he knew what he wanted to do.  No, I didn't because I didn't know what was out there, to be honest with you.  Graduating from high school, I did not know what I wanted to do, or what I wanted to be, so I went away to, to college and broke the mold because most of my family went to Alabama State [University]; I went to Tuskegee [University].
Speaker 1: Now before we get you to college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Okay.
Speaker 1: we have to get you outta high school (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And I wanted to ask you about high school.  Now were you involved in clubs in high school?  Were you a popular student?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --'cause you seem like a kinda person that would be, you know, very social and be involved in a lotta different kind of organized activities.
Speaker 2: That was not--I was not a very social, that kind of social.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I was very shy, but I was involved in various activities.  My other cousin that I grew up with she was the social one; she was very outgoing, very popular.  I was quiet, but I also was involved like in the science club, I was a majorette with the band, and did all those kind of things and I, and I have to, I have to tell you this, that it reached a point where my mom [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] was just tired of driving and all of that, so she would let us--she would let me drive, let us go to the football games, the basketball games and what have you, so we drove ourselves.  But she would always say, 'Don't bring me no basketball babies or no football babies.'  And that was because, you know, she--well we knew better; I mean I was just too scared to, to do anything except go to the game and come back home.
Story_ID: 39987
Speaker 1: Now did you have--now, when you were in high school, was your mother still teaching--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --in the same little school?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no.  Those, those schools had been closed and she was teaching at a junior high school and--
Speaker 1: Was she in the same school, Sumter County?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I never, ever went to the same school with her again, but my mother was very active though--at those schools because she was like the basketball coach, and this and that.
Speaker 1: Now was she--had she graduated by the time you were in high school?
Speaker 2: oh yes, I mean--oh yes.  She'd graduated from college and, you know, quite a while.  I mean I was young when she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay.
Speaker 2: --going to college to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the exact year, but yes, she had graduated early on but she continued to pursue her education toward, toward her Master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: So in high school, were there any--did you have any mentors in high school?
Speaker 2: I would say my--the math teacher, the counselor, but she was also my history teacher, I think--Miss Weaver, I remember her name, and Mrs. Hughes, I remember her name.  You know, tho--those were mentors but we had mentors coming along; there were always people who were interested in encouraging us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So did you take (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--and so I was the kind of student--I think I--for several years, I never missed a day of school, so I got perfect attendance and--so by the time that I graduated, I still had no idea what I really wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Well, you mentioned Miss Weaver being the counselor.  Did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--She was a teacher also.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but did she advise you to go to Tuskegee [University]?  I mean how did you come up with the idea of going to Tuskegee when you said everybody else had gone to Alabama State [University]?
Speaker 2: I went to Tuskegee [University] because I was led to go there.  I, again, did reading and what have you, and that whole Tuskegee [University] family mystique it just brought me into the whole Booker T. Washington experience.
Speaker 1: Now did you know anyone else in your town that had gone to Tuskegee [University]?
Speaker 2: I believe maybe some of my earlier teachers may have even gone to Tuskegee.  As a matter of fact, I'm sure at least the agricultural teacher went to Tuskegee and so, you know, there were other teachers who graduated from there but not encouraging me or persuading me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're a senior in high school in '66 [1966], is that true?
Speaker 2: No, '65 [1965]; '64 [1964] or '65 [1965].  Graduated in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were kinda skipped a year I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was because I started school so early and I was just there and able to do the work and, and in--in fact, do the work well.
Story_ID: 39988
Speaker 1: So you graduated in 1965.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the era when you were in high school, basically, when the Civil Rights Movement was really kicking up in Alabama (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And the Montgomery Bus Boycott took place when you were about seven, I guess, right?  And what was the--and the March on Washington took place in '63 [1963] when you were in high school.  Was there--what was the family discussion, and were you interested in the Civil Rights Movement in those days?
Speaker 2: We couldn't help but be because of the conditions that were there during that time.  My--during that time--because my church was, was active and there were freedom riders coming through there all the time; it was a kind of a scary time too because it was a, a time where people were being killed.
Speaker 1: Did freedom riders come through your church and speak?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were, there were people who came through the town and various churches in the area.  That's where a lot of them got the support that they needed while they were traveling, and so there was some activity there.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any voter registration activity?  You know, door to door by SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] people, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I do but I, I remember it being--you had to be very careful, if you will, because there was that counter-threat of trying to make sure that you didn't get involved in those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Because your mother was going to Alabama State [University]; now that's in Montgomery [Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: During the days of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, I would guess--yeah, if you were real little, and she would have been up there just prior--or just--or during.
Speaker 2: Prior to--as a matter of fact, during the summer time, they would attend Dr. [Martin Luther] King's church.  I remember her saying that and yes, it was, it was a time when it was important for my mother though, to be able to go to school, and I remember her talking about the fact that she maybe only had three dresses (laughter), and she talked about one being a dotted Swiss dress and by the time the summer was over, there were no dots on the dress because, you know, she had to wash it because she had to do what she had to do in order to get that education.  In other words, she sacrificed a lot in order to, to do what she had to do during turbulent times.  And that's why I asked her, 'Weren't you afraid during that time?  Supposed your car broke down along the way one night?'  I mean people were being, you know, hung by the neck; they were being killed for no reason, or missing and never found again.
Speaker 1: And the year you graduated was one of the worst years--'65' [1965]; that's when the Selma [Alabama] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--A man was killed in a town adjacent to Selma [Alabama], you know, while the voter registration campaign was going on in Selma [Alabama] and there's a lot--the march from Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama] took place in '65 [1965].
Story_ID: 39989
Speaker 1: And prior to that, Viola Liuzzo--she was a freedom rider from Ohio?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Detroit
Speaker 1: Michigan.
Speaker 2: Detroit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Detroit [Michigan]--was killed along that road, and there were a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's the same route, Route 80, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, the same route.  So it was not an area that you could feel secure driving in, especially at night; or even in the daytime because she was driving in the daytime, you know.
Speaker 2: She was shot by the [Ku Klux] Klan.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  So, so, so those were, those were times when we were looking to the future and for better things, but in the meantime, there were certain things that--do you know my parents tried to be protective of us; she would not let us babysit for anyone.  There were certain things she would, she would say and that I even do today and tell my grandchildren.  'Never leave a store after you've paid for something with something in your hand.  You always get--have them put it in a bag.'  You know, lots of little tidbit things--survival techniques so that we would not suffer some of the indignities.  She would never allow us to babysit for, for the white children because of the things that she had heard about what they do and, and what was done to, to the babysitters and, and--so she was trying to be protective, motherly and what have you.  And she also recognized the dangers of what was happening.  She knew that during the time that the, the--I still don't--I mean I never learned to swim because the option was--there was a white pool and there was the creek, and every summer, one of the kids in our school died from drowning, and so when they had to open the pool for, for everyone, they filled the pool in so that you still could not use the pool in my town, York.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I just wanted to point that out that these are tension-filled times when you were on the verge of graduation down there and I didn't know specifically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--All my life.
Speaker 2: --what happened to you, but I just wanna make sure that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yes, all my life.  We knew about it, and you would hear the old folks--the adults' children sitting around not--even when we weren't supposed to listen, but we were hearing the stories of some of the things that were going on or things that had happened to people that were not pretty, you know, who--just because they were African American or what have you, the [Ku Klux] Klan, the this, the that.
Speaker 2: Did you have instructions for going into town, what you could and could not do when you went into town, and had to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--At what time?  As an (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--White people--as a kid growing up, as a youth growing up did your mother or grandparents give you instructions about how to conduct yourself downtown and in town or what?
Speaker 1: Well when we were going in, as young children, on the back of the truck--and I use that as an example of something that happened, but you know, the family also had, had a car, you know, there too.  But anyway, we were protected because we were with adults; we were with other adults then.  And so as I got older and I lived in York and could--and we lived in town, I could, I could walk to town, yes, but that's when those rules came into play.  Yes, you can go in and, and get your candy or what have you, but you had to make sure that you got the receipt as well as had it put in a bag so that no one could ever say that you stole it because that happened a lot.
Story_ID: 39990
Speaker 1: Could you try on clothes in the stores?
Speaker 2: We--no, I never did because, you know, my mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall] took care of all those things and we would, we would shop not in York, in the town that--we were right on the Mississippi line, right on the Mississippi line, and most of the shopping was done in Meridian, Mississippi.  And so we would go there with her, and that's where we bought clothes.  Never--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not the safest place either (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I never said it was safe but--in, in fact, was the bigger--biggest area with the most, you know, variety.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you grew up in the segregated south with the white water fountains and the black ones and the white and black everything.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, with the, the segregation, the Ku Klux Klan, the--everything; I mean and there were stories that were horrendous, you know.  And so when I would go into town--I shouldn't say go into town.  When my friends and I in the summer time, we'd walk down the street because we were older now, we're in high school, and we would just--nothing to do, so we would walk to the Post Office, get the mail, and come back.  But we knew we'd go in groups, my sister and friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you knew it could be dangerous.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was dangerous.
Story_ID: 39991
Speaker 1: So now Tuskegee [University].  Now you decided to go to Tuskegee because it was the reputation of Tuskegee [University].  Had you read 'Up from Slavery,' or any of the books about Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness yes, everyone.  I mean there were more--there are more Booker T. Washington schools all over the country because of the foundation; just what this man did, what he accomplished was, to me, amazing.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a scholarship to Tuskegee [University] or--
Speaker 2: I had, I had a partial scholarship, I worked, and I--my mom was able to supply a certain amount, you know.  It was a sacrifice for her because again she--they--teachers did not make very much money there, and I knew that I had to study, study hard and do what I had to do to make sure that it was easier for her, and that's what I did, I, I worked.  My husband [Dr. Gerald B. Cutting] used to laugh because again, getting back to that being very shy, my mother brought me on campus my freshman year, and I never stepped off the campus, foot off the campus, until she came to pick me up. And mind you, there was a place called The Block, which was right outside the gates of Tuskegee [University], you know; they had the, the fried chicken place, they had the ice cream place and that kinda stuff, but I never left the campus (laughter) of Tuskegee [University] until she came to pick me up my freshman year for vacation, you know--school break.
Speaker 1: Okay, now.  Well, on the campus, I mean did you get involved in any campus activities?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  I was very--I, I was active; I went to Chapel every Sunday, sang in the Tuskegee choir--the Tuskegee Institute Choir, and was selected to travel with the choir and--
Speaker 1: Now this was a famous choir out of which came the--well, no; I guess that's not the same one.
Speaker 2: William Dawson.
Speaker 1: William Dawson, okay, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Wrote a lot of fabulous music and Tuskegee's choir was very well-renown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So they traveled and did performances in the other black schools, or other towns?
Speaker 2: Usually they did--when I was there, we did a tour; it was either the East Coast or the Midwest, during break--during school break?  I think it was spring break that we traveled, and as a matter of fact, early on, we, you know, one of the tours we did was to New York, to Nyack, New York, to Rye, New York; we sang at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, and that was one of the tours that we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: That's one of the traditional ways that the school, you know, generates revenue too?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not sure, except it gave an awful lot of exposure, and perhaps it raised money for scholarships at some of those locations because they took care of our, our accommodations and food.  I remember some places we may have stayed in a hotel, but there were instances where we stayed in homes like Rye, New York and Nyack, New York or long Island.

Speaker 1: Now what did you decide to major in?
Speaker 2: I went to, I went to Tuskegee saying I was going to major in math because I would not become a teacher; I did not want to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Now what did you have in mind as a math major?  What did you think you would be doing?
Speaker 2: That's the sad part; I had no idea if--you know, what I know now is different, but coming from where I came from, there were no computers; I couldn't do any research or anything.  I had no idea, I had limited exposure and so I went there majoring in math, and then found that to be a little, little boring.  I don't know; I didn't know.  Okay, so you got the numbers, you got the calculus, you got the this; now what are you gonna do with it?  And so at that time, I didn't realize you could be an accountant, you could go into--
Speaker 1: The engineering (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--the engineering, or any of those things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Any of the sciences (ph.).
Speaker 2: --and didn't even know what--I didn't know what was involved in those, those areas; that's how naive I was.
Speaker 1: So did you--you were a math major up to a certain point and then changed, or what?
Speaker 2: And then I, I fell back on what I knew (laughter)--teaching (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I majored in secondary education because--no elementary; I, I knew that there was a greater opportunity to go into something else with a secondary education, and so that's what I majored in.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well who were some of your favorite teachers or mentors at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't, I don't know because I was--I don't know that I had any favorite teachers; there were some that I liked and some that I did not like.  I mean--and there was one that I really didn't like.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you have a worst teacher?  (Laughter).  You wanna name them, or tell us what they did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't even remember this man's name.  I know that it was in a writing class, creative writing class, and my, my grandparents--there was an incident at their house and I think they had a kerosene lamp or something like that, and so they were going through the house and the lamp fell and broke, and the house burned down.  And so I wrote this story about it, about what had happened based on what they had said, and my recollection, and the, the, the professor said, 'Oh, no; that isn't true, that could never have happened.  This makes no sense,' when it actually happened.  And I explained to him, 'But this is what happened; this is how it happened, this is what happened.'  And he, to this day, just never said that that was a possibility, and I'm so glad that that didn't, didn't discourage me; it did for a while because I, I love to write creatively and the use of language and, and all of that.  But for him not to believe me I, I just thought, 'You know what?  You don't experience--you have not lived my life.'  I--because I talked about that.  'You have not lived my life, you can't relate to my life and what's happened.  I've lived a good life, but there are certain things that happened and this is one of those.  They were using kerosene lamps in, in that place, and based on your white experience--white male experience, you can't relate to this situation; you don't believe it happened.'
Speaker 1: So this is a white male teacher at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 39993
Speaker 1: And I just, just thought (laughter).  Now, today, I probably would have handled it differently, but I was still a little shy and, you know, maybe not as--maybe I could have, should have been a little more militant by then; militant in a nice way, or I should have spoken up for myself and been more persuasive maybe, but I did.  I spoke to him several times about it, but he still denied it and wrote on the paper.
Speaker 2: Now did you have a--like convocation speakers at Tuskegee when you were there?
Speaker 1: Oh gosh, yes.
Speaker 2: Who do you remember that came that was memorable in terms of their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, I, I don't remember, I just remember some of the greatest people coming through there, the great music that, that Tuskegee brought in; people who came through like Mohammad Ali in his very early ages, and being able to walk through campus and, and talking with him because he was very personable, very outgoing and, you know, the, the, the music that, that we were exposed to.  The speakers were incredible; I don't remember the specific ones but I just remember because I was--again, I sang every Sunday with the Tuskegee choir, and so a lot of fantastic speakers were there.
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know; I think he may have been younger than you, but was Lionel Richie on the campus?
Speaker 1: Lionel Richie, at the time, was at the children's--yeah, the campus on--the school on campus.
Speaker 2: So he was in the--he was a little guy in the school?
Speaker 1: Not, not really because he didn't graduate that much further, you know, from when we did.
Speaker 2: That's why I was asking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, but the Commodores were in existence during that time.  As a matter of fact, his, his grandparents lived there and they were very active, and Lionel was always--was on campus.  And the other Commo--members of the Commodore (ph.), they were, you know, more our contemporaries so, so we knew them; we knew them personally, more personally than Lionel because I think he was a couple of years behind us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So there weren't any teachers that you were particularly close to, I guess, when you were on the verge of graduation?
Speaker 1: No, not that I can, not that I can recall.  I do remember though the, the choir director during that time was very encouraging and, and what have you, and there were definitely people who kind of helped you along the way who encouraged you.  I joined a sorority during that time and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So that's the Kappa Alpha's, right?
Speaker 1: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen Sixty-Seven [1967]--fall of 1967.  And so we--so I had a great experience there at Tuskegee; was very involved in various--in different organizations there on campus, I worked in the library there as a freshman, and so that put me where I enjoyed long books and, and what have you.  So, so it was a, it was a really good experience with the activities and (simultaneous)-
Story_ID: 39994
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now was there--in terms of what you're doing now, was there an African American operated radio station there in Tuskegee in those days when you were in college?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not owned, or operated.  We didn't listen to radio really; I think we listened maybe out of Montgomery--Alabama State [University] may have had a radio station, but there was a lot going on on campus anyway, except I didn't spend a lot of time.  I guess one of my regrets has been--I left Tuskegee not knowing how to play cards (laughter), and I understand (unclear) that's supposed to be one of your prerequisites (ph.) for graduation, but--anyway, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--When I was in school, it was one of your prerequisites (ph.) for not graduating.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) oh, okay.
Speaker 1: (Inaudible Response).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--But at that time, though, during the, the cafeteria, during lunch time--again, the way that people were allowed to be creative and what have you, we were entertained by, you know, records being spun by Tom Joyner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what he did.
Speaker 1: Was he a student there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  He was a student also--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's what he did during--so his--he--I guess he knew what he wanted to do early on; I just didn't.  So he would go into the--there was an elevated area there at the cafeteria, that's where he would set up his little turntable and spin records.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He didn't have his theme song yet, but he (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, no, no, he didn't. He later became the--he took it on to the next level, obviously.
Speaker 1: Right, so--yeah, he went on to work for WJPC [FM] in Chicago--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --Johnson Publications Station in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, and also in Dallas, Texas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Mid-'70's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--and he was flying back and forth, and he was called the Fly Jock--
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: --American Airlines, yeah.
Story_ID: 39995
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating from Tuskegee [University], what were your thoughts?  You were gonna go and teach in high school, you were gonna apply for teaching positions, or had you thought about going to graduate school or--
Speaker 2: No.  By that time, my husb--well, I married my husband [Dr. Gerald B. Cutting] during Christmas break December, 1968--
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--and we graduated together in 1969--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so it wasn't about me at that point; it's where he got his job which was Springfield--East Longmeadow, Massachusetts, and he in fact had the job, and so I--we came up here together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's how you get up here to the Springfield [Massachusetts] area.
Speaker 2: That's how I got up into the Springfield [Massachusetts] area.  I had spent some summers in Boston [Massachusetts] working; I had relatives there in Boston and so I worked there several summers and so I--but that was Roxbury, this was Springfield, Massachusetts and when we moved here, we didn't know anyone here; we didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--'Cause your husband is from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he, he was born in Boston [Massachusetts] and grew up in New Haven, Connecticut so he was familiar with New England; I was to a little extent from the summer time spending the summers here, but I--we didn't know Springfield [Massachusetts].  We, we had no idea where anything was, and so when we moved here in June of 1969, it was like, 'okay, so where are we?  What's happening in the community?  How do you connect to the churches?'  You know, how does one who comes to this area find out about the, the social life or--here?  You know.  Where do you get your collard greens?  Where do you get your hair done?  Where do you go to church?  We didn't know, and we didn't know anyone who knew because his primary frame of reference was not--was primarily in the white community, from the edge of Longmeadow to East Longmeadow [Massachusetts]; that's what it was about.  And so we didn't have a radio station and we didn't have public television at that time; we didn't know (unclear) maybe had two radio stations--I mean two television stations at the time here.
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: And so I thought coming from Tuskegee [University], a place where you've got all kinds of commerce and things going on, and you could listen to radio station even if it wasn't owned by African Americans, I found it very--very depressing.  I thought we were coming to liberal New England, and so I found it to be rather separate.
Story_ID: 39996
Speaker 1: So now there's a black community here in Springfield [Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: But we didn't know.
Speaker 1: Or did you--I mean--well, give us some idea what you discovered here in Springfield, I mean in terms of--so you eventually did discover the black community, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There was a gentleman here, his name was Robert Hughes, who got word that this new black veterinarian just moved into town; he was the kind of person who would pick up the telephone and call, and so he connected us.  In addition, when we were riding down the street, we couldn't find--when we were riding, we didn't see any black folks, but he was able to connect us and put us in touch with, with other African Americans in the community, and he told us where the section (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, so there is a particular part of Springfield that's the black part of town?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: What part of it?
Speaker 2: At that time, it was called the Winchester Square area of Springfield, which is where we found our barber shop, you know, beauty parlor, the church that we joined--later joined, and still are members of, Saint John's Congregational United Church of Christ.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is called--what was the square called?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: It was called Winchester Square (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Winchester Square, okay.
Speaker 2: --which was named--it was--and the interesting thing about Winchester Square is this land, this area was donated by a black person; an African American person in the Springfield community donated a lot of land here, and they, they called it Winchester Square because the mayor at the time, I believe, name was Winchester.  It has since been renamed as Mason Square, which is for the person who donated the land, Primus Mason.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Primus Mason.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Now Springfield, I've been told, is the home of gun manufacturing--a lotta gun manufacturing here; Winchesters, Springfield Rifles--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Savage--and all that.  So the black community lived--well, the business districts surround Winchester Square but did they live in that area too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: The Winchester Square, all the old neighborhoods, you know, in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: But you all didn't, I take it; you lived in another part of town.
Speaker 2: Yes, we lived on the Longmeadow [Massachusetts] line because the apartments that we moved into were just being built and they were part of the apartment; it was in Longmeadow--the gates were in Longmeadow, and was in the Forrest Park section of Springfield [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you try to find a job as a teacher immediately, or did you just--or were you having children by that period in time?
Speaker 2: No.  I began--my first job was with--as a counselor, coordinator for one of the agencies in Springfield [Massachusetts] that Robert Hughes founded called Northern Educational Service, and at the same time, I was--I entered into graduate school.  I went to Springfield College and graduated in 1971.  My--our first child was born October, 1971, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you got a master's degree in '71 [1971] and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in what?  What was it?
Speaker 2: It's called Community--it, it was Leadership and Development.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From Springfield College.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your first child was born the same year?
Speaker 2: The same year, '71 [1971].  So I was pregnant with her.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: She says that's why she's so smart, but anyway (laughter).
Story_ID: 39997
Speaker 1: So had you thought yet about radio?
Speaker 2: I thought about radio and what's goin' on in this area when we came here, and we had no idea, you know, where is everything?  Where is the music?  You know, and began to research, and found that there were only two radio program--black radio program stations; they were AM daytimer stations; one was in Boston [Massachusetts] and one was in Connecticut. They went off at sunset, came on at sunrise, and the winter time you had very little anything.  We couldn't hear--get those stations anywhere very clearly; we couldn't get Boston [Massachusetts] at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you say you're sort of information-starved in this city in terms of what's going on in the black community.
Speaker 2: Initially we were; absolutely we were.
Speaker 1: So was there a black newspaper?
Speaker 2: We didn't know of any black newspaper, no.  I don't know.  We weren't connected to receiving--we got the regular paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're kind of feeling this lack of a station, but--
Speaker 2: That desire was there, yes.
Speaker 1: So when you really start really thinking about, you know, applying for a license for a radio station?
Speaker 2: Well, at that point, I was just trying to figure out, well what does it take?  What's involved?  And my class mate--oh, no, I don't mean class mate.  But one of my roommates from Tuskegee's father was in Springfield [Massachusetts]--came to Springfield; her name was Carolyn Williams, his name was Dr. Jasper Williams, from Chicago, and he, he came by the apartment to visit us and we were talking.  I was telling him about my, you know, my interests and all of that, and he had been--he had bought a radio sta--or a television station I believe, in Wisconsin--Rhinelander [City], Wisconsin.  So he was into broadcasting too, although he was a physician and, and so he was very encouraging.  'Well, you should go about doing it; follow up, follow through,' which is the kind of thing that you got when you went to a school like Tuskegee [University], which is very pro--you know--
Speaker 1: Entrepreneurial, right?
Speaker 2: Very entrepreneurial and--as well as just go out and research.  There is a need, and so, so go for it.
Story_ID: 39998
Speaker 1: So that's when I--the, the idea really was--I can't say it was born; it was born when I got there, but it became more, more active; so over the years, I did.  I did the research, I went to various trade shows, I mainly did the inquiring; I, I inquired as to what it would; what it would take, and then tried to do that.  One of the things I found over the course of time was an AM station became available in the Springfield area.  One of the things that I was told after researching--after it was researched, 'Look, you do not want AM station; that radio station has various issues, various problems.'  And knowing from research that AM stations was not the thing at the time, I was highly recommended that I, that I pass that opportunity up.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: This was in the '70s [1970s]; '72 [1972], '73 [1973], something like that.
Speaker 2: And what year was it that--or roughly, what year was it that you talked to Jasper Williams.
Speaker 1: It was around--I think he came to visit us in 1970.  But one thing I found is patience; you've gotta be very patient about these kinda things.  But more than that, you've gotta be prayerful because that--as much as I wanted it, that was not the thing for me at that time, and I had to recognize and realize that.  So that, that went through, still continued to go to various, various places, meet with people, go to DC to, to conferences, and also to National Association of Broadcasting (unclear) meetings; even went to a couple of those.  And then, in 1984, the frequency that I ended up applying for became available, and in fact is the one that I applied for.
Speaker 2: In '84 [1984], okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen Eighty-Four [1984].
Speaker 2: I have a note here that one of the people that you consulted with, and you say she probably won't remember it, was Gayle King, who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Where did you get those notes? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--working for the Hartford Radio Station, right?
Speaker 1: This took so long, and mind you, we had a young family, we had no money, and I didn't even get into the part where during the time I was pregnant, the person that he worked for went bankrupt; we were broke, couldn't even pay our rent or anything, the check that the guy gave us bounced, and--but again I, I say by the grace of God the, the bank that we were doing business with said, 'Don't worry about a thing, you've got to eat,' you know, 'we'll cover your rent, we'll cover your checks for you.'  And that enabled him to eventually open his own--decide to open his own veterinary clinic and that's what, what happened in 1979.  So we opened that veterinary clinic on a prayer and a $50.00 Visa credit--or was it MasterCard?--one of those.
Story_ID: 39999
Speaker 1: What was the name of the clinic?
Speaker 2: Memorial Drive Animal Clinic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was faith.  I mean we were--we knew that--well again, it goes back to my faith and my--and our belief.  So we opened it, opened the veterinary clinic and that is what sustained us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, so you worked there too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, initially.  I mean my belly was hanging over the, the operating table or the examination table, trying to help them little animals or whatever--cleaning, whatever (laughter).  And we sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: So that's one family enterprise that gets started, right?--is the veterinary clinic--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then you still have this dream of opening up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't even know if it was a dream; it was still that--okay, so what does it take?  It still, it still lingered there and still doing the research on it and what have you, as we do in the momma duty--the baby momma duties and all that, and still supporting him by helping at the veterinary clinic and, and doing all of that, but it was a commitment.
Speaker 1: So what year again did you apply for a license?
Speaker 2: Nineteen Eighty-Four [1984]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: the license to build a construction permit through the Federal Communications Commission.
Speaker 1: Now this construction permit allows you to do what?
Speaker 2: Upon approval (laughter), it allows you to test and build a broadcast facility and begin broadcasting.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But at this point, you hadn't--you didn't have a frequency yet, right?
Speaker 2: No, that was the whole point, you applied for it; there were other--there were others also applying for that frequency.  One included an existing broadcaster who had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, who had--one was an existing broadcaster; he had the resources, we did not.  When I applied for the construction permit, when we indicated--you had to put your financial situation there, your resources, and we didn't have much.  We had very little, and so we based ours on saying, 'Well, we'll also get,' you know, 'used equipment where we could, and we'd rent, and all of that.'
Speaker 1: And I'm confused though.  Is a construction permit the same or different, or include the license too, or what?
Speaker 2: The construction permit is approved by the Federal Communications Commission--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --then you have to build the station.
Speaker 1: But what about the license?  Is that something else?
Speaker 2: The final approval.
Speaker 1: That's the final approval--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --the license, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 40000
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--There was a frequency available, and there was competition for that frequency.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In other words, we all applied, we all had to go through the comparative hearing process.  It came down to myself and an existing broadcaster who met with me.  He was a white broadcaster who met with me and, and said, 'Join with me and in a couple of years,' you know, 'you move out.'  You know, that's it.  And as I explained to him, that was not the idea of applying for the construction permit; the whole idea was so that there could be another voice in the community and better representation here in the community.  And so he then told me that 'I will financially litigate you out of the process.'  In other words, each--at each level where I would win, he would then appeal to the--which was his right to appeal to the next level.  And so this went on for years.
Speaker 2: So I've read that--there's an article that your daughter wrote--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --about, you know, celebrating you on Mother's Day for what you've done, that I read in an article that appeared in Lioness Magazine?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have it here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay.
Speaker 2: --so she indicated that you--it was like 30 years of--was it that long?
Speaker 1: I was 15 years from the time we applied to the time that we began test broadcasting--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So it was during this period of time you had to fight this war of legal attrition with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--With no money, with no money.  But again, that was--God is--I would always pray.  'If this is going to be, just show me how.'  And there were times when I really didn't know what I was going to do because the legal bills were--he had an attorney on retainer, so it wasn't an issue for him; he was an existing broadcaster.  We were just raising children, and my husband was working hard to support his family.  So we didn't have expendable, you know, income to just, you know, pay a lot of--to pay for this, to be honest.  We didn't have a radio angel or anything; never have, still don't
Speaker 2: Did you have a regular lawyer that dealt with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You had to have a regular lawyer, and you also had to have a specific attorney in DC that was able to argue your case before the Federal Communications Commission.
Speaker 2: Now did you get any assistance from--was that NABOB [National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters]?  Was that the National Organization of Association of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Black-Owned Broadcast (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Black-Owned Broadcasters.
Speaker 1: They don't--you mean financial resources or what?
Speaker 2: I don't know; legal resources, I don't know what they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--No, no. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--can provide, so that's why I'm asking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--No.  The support, I mean you know--encouragement, and I would go to some of their conventions, to some of their meetings and what have you, and it became, you know, kind of, kind of fun because they would say, 'Are you still fighting those people?  You still have not gotten your frequency?'  And in fact, I had not.  So that was the kind of support; you knew that there were more and more--a few more black-owned broadcasters due to the, the, the rulings at that time.
Speaker 2: FCC [Federal Communications Commission] was--at that time, there were several developments with--in FCC [Federal Communications Commission] that were designed to encourage--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --minority ownership of radio stations, right?
Speaker 1: That's right.  We were not a part of that particular one, but there were; and there were people who were coming in filing for their things, and they were, you know, they were on the air and I--you know, I kept saying, 'Lord, why me?  Why not?  Why, you know, why haven't I gotten a final approval?'
Story_ID: 40001
Speaker 1: So it was basically because of the opposition of this one person?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He, in fact, took me through the entire comparative hearing process; he appealed all the way to the [Washington] D.C. Court of Appeals--the final one, where I also prevailed.  But by that time, it was years later and, you know, no resources.  And I can say that there was a broadcaster--an existing broadcaster by the name of Ed Perry, who I would not have this station had it not been for him because he went, he assisted me through the process.  When there was a need to argue, he came to [Washington] D.C. in our favor, so I can just say that he was responsible for helping, helping me through this process.  Now there was time when--during this time, you know, we'd have to pack up the kids and put 'em in the car, and my husband would drive us to [Washington] D.C., he would, he would then take the kids off sightseeing; they're thinking they're on a field trip, and I'm going to the, you know, to the courts, and being called everything except a child of God because it was that strong--I mean they wanted that frequency so badly that whatever it took to try to litigate me financially out of the process was being done, and so I can say that Ed [Perry] was there and he was--and he owns a radio station in Marshfield, Massachusetts--WATD; and he's still a friend to this day.  He went to college in, in Amherst, Massachusetts and knew the area.
Speaker 1: What's his last name again?
Speaker 2: Ed Perry.
Speaker 1: Perry, okay.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: He's the owner of WATD?
Speaker 2: WATD, in--here in Massachusetts, Marshfield.  Not only did he, did he do that, but he also--finally, when we were able to, to get things going he, he was there and helping to oversee things, 'cause he was all--not only was he an owner, but he was also an engineer--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --so he was able to help me with the technical part of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it was during those years of trying to get this station, and having to go to [Washington] D.C., that--there was no one in this Springfield [Massachusetts] area that I could talk to that I could--who could relate to what I was going through because no one in the Springfield area knew what I was doing.  It was very quiet, and so I knew that it was taking a toll on my family, terms of the resources, and so it became--well, is it, it is, is it worth it?  And so that was one of those times when I called--out of the clear blue sky called Gayle King; she's probably not even aware of the fact of the impact that she made, but she was an anchor at Channel Three, and I called her and said, 'You don't know me at all,' I said, 'but I'd like to know if I can meet you.'  And--'because I have--I'd like to discuss something with you.'  And I shared wi--and she said, 'Oh yes, come on down to the studio.'  And I did, and she--I was able to share with her some of the things that I was going--and my--what I was going through; my dilemma.  Is it fair?  My children are growing up, we're taking resources from the family, and you know, is that, is that fair?  Should I just forget about this and move on to some other thing?  And--but she was very encouraging, very supportive, knew that there was a need, and encouraged me to, to stick with it.  And that was a word that I need because I couldn't--it's hard to go to your husband when you're--I needed someone who was neutral, someone outside, who could look at it and give me advice, and she, and she did; I've never been able to or never had the opportunity to really let her know what, what her words meant, and how much she encouraged me and--to move forward, and what has happened to even now.
Story_ID: 40002
Speaker 1: Okay, so you finally were able to open this station in 1999 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--We began test broadcasting in '99' [1999].
Speaker 1: What was the--I mean is there any particular incident that the family broke you through, you know, I mean what was the breakthrough?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh gosh, there was such a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--or did the other person just get exhausted or die?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--No, he, no, he--we actually--the construction permit was granted in 1994?--1994; but then there was opposition to my locating the antenna on an exist--another existing broadcaster's tower, which I had been paying tower rent and the whole bit, but when I--but they never expected me to, you know, to complete this process and so when I was ready to mount my antenna, you know--again, more delays and so not only was I not able to mount my antenna, but he had been adding stuff on the tower that made the possibility of my putting anything on there dangerous.  So again, more legal--local legal, legal, legal things come into being--arguing that I am legally--I have the legal right to the space on this tower.  I'd been paying rent to hold that space, and I met with the owner who came in from New York and, and he told me that it'll be a while before I ever get my antenna on the tower.  I was trying to skip all of this, but that's what happened.  And so we went through this whole thing; I tried to find space to build my own antenna.  When I found the space, the land--you know, my attorney felt it was right to let him know since it was close proximity to his tower.  He then went to the town and said, 'Look, I'm going to build.'  They were gonna build a new tower and there would not be any other tower in that town but theirs, and so when he did that, with housing around and what have you, and the concern for the radiation and all of that, that eliminated me from being able to build a tower in the location, and so there were lots of delays with that.  Then he decided he was gonna build a tower, which took years; in the meantime, when I got the permission to build the radio station--I'm excited, I've gotta find a location, a space and what have you, get my office set up, get this used equipment and all of that.  And so I did, I did that, thinking 'okay, in a few months, you know, we'll start this whole process, we'll get the radio station going; it didn't happen, so I had to continue to pay rent for four more years--telephone, rent, light, utilities, the whole bit.
Story_ID: 40003
Speaker 1: when it--and I had to continuously apply to the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] for extensions--more money.  And finally, they extended as, you know, as long as they could; they got the, the, the thing up on the air--they got the tower built, and my friend Ed Perry oversaw the placing of the antenna, and in order to do that--because we had a deadline at the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] or I would have lost the construction permit.  And so in the snow and the ice, Ed said, 'Well I don't know that we can make it up there,' and I said, 'Oh yeah, we gotta make it up that hill--up the mountain so that we can at least plug in, you know, test and report back to the FCC [Federal Communications Commission].'  And so he was wonderful and he did that, and we--that satisfied that so that eventually we began to build everything and, and that's, that's the story; it's about persistence--
Speaker 2: So when was it finished, and when were you able to start broadcasting?
Speaker 1: I began broadcasting late 1998--test broadcasting, because you, you know you have to test it for a while, and so that's when I began test broadcasting.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--When?  What year?
Speaker 1: December--the winter of '98 [1998], '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  There we go--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --'cause we've got to get that because this is history (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yes it is, yes it is; winter, '98 [1998], '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And this was--that was a milestone.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is a long protracted struggle.  And do you care to name this individual or what station they were associated with, or do you think they might sue you for doing that, or--
Speaker 1: For the truth?
Speaker 2: No, I mean yeah, I mean you haven't named them yet, so I just wondered why you hadn't, you know.
Speaker 1: Why I hadn't named--because I don't usually--during interviews, I just--I just don't because sometimes you have to put stuff, stuff behind you, and that way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Okay, if you prefer not to it's all right, but I just wondered, and this is history so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is, so that's difficult. (Looks off camera) what's his name?
Story_ID: 40004
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what was your format, going forward, for your station?
Speaker 2: Well one thing about it is after 15 years, you had lots of time to research and all of that, and I found that there was a niche for us; there was no one doing the adult kind of music that was also jazzy and cool, and so we, we ended up programing it for that particular adult audience that was--and so we, we came up with Cool Jazz, Smooth Sounds, and a Touch of Soul, and with a cutting edge blend.  And so by blending all those different musics (ph.), you could come up with something that was--I think for a lot of people, that gave you the opportunity to hear something soulful maybe from the past, or even current, yet still hear the smooth jazz, you know, the instrumentals, the vocals, and then we throw in the, the cool jazz, the, the kind that may be a little more contemporary because one thing I found was jazz is such a specific niche that if we wanted to try to be successful in this market, we couldn't play straight-ahead jazz; we couldn't just play jazz, and that's how we came up with this cutting-edge blend, so that we could play just about any kind of music that kinda fit within there, and focusing on the smooth jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And--so it's basically music, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have other programming other than music?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We began broadcasting as a music format; we've had lots of opportunity to bring in infomercials and all that stuff, which adds to your revenue base, but for me it was important for us to build that brand, to build the product, to bring people into listening to a kind of music that perhaps they were not familiar with, and to grow our audience that way.  We didn't have the, the liberty of just kind of haphazardly playing whatever we wanted to; I mean I--however, the first song that I played was 'God's Got My Back,' because I know that I could not have done any of this without prayer, preparation, and perseverance.  So it took--I know that that's how I was able to get through that process.  Didn't have the resources financially, didn't have a radio angel to step in to, to help with the financing.  When I went to the bank even with the frequency, no one would give us money to help with doing this and so where perhaps I would have been able to have a high-tech, state of the arts station, that didn't happen when we started, but we started; that's it.  We started and we continue, and that was the goal.  And because I was so involved in the community on different boards and, and all of that, and youth activities, and involved with our kids and their interests, it was an opportunity to gain even greater, greater exposure, and to be able to help some of the, the, the local agencies that needed help if they're having a fundraising event or what have you.  I could decide if that's within the areas of interest that we have that--'okay, we will support--we will be a media sponsor for that, and we will get behind your event.'  And in fact, that's what has happened over the years.
Story_ID: 40005
Speaker 1: So there's no community affairs shows or talk shows or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No talk shows.  The community--we, we over-do our, our necessary--or it's, you know, hours of community service that we need to do because of our involvement in various organizations and, and what have you, and on various--on, on a lotta boards--I keep saying various.
Speaker 1: Now what's the range that your station covers in terms of--'cause I know it's advertised as New England Soft Jazz, I mean--
Speaker 2: Smooth Jazz?
Speaker 1: Smooth Jazz, yeah.
Speaker 2: We are from southern Vermont, New Hampshire to Connecticut--northern Connecticut; it's where--well there are stronger areas than others in some areas because of the terrain, but for the most part, that's where terrestrial radio is.  However, in this day and age, you know, we also consider ourselves a regional station and global station because in fact, we have streaming all over the world through WEIB/FM.com.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And do the call letters have a specific meaning for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --for you, or were those just the letters?
Speaker 2: --those were--on a personal level, they did for me, but for the most part, nothing that I can really speak of, although (laughter), although my husband likes to joke and say, 'It stands for 'We In Business'' (laughter), but I say, 'No, that is not what they stand for.'  But I guess after all those years (laughter), that's what he thinks they stand--so for--so be it.
Story_ID: 40006
Speaker 1: Now in this day in age in radio, I don't' know what it was like when you started, but--so you started in '99 [1999], broadcasting?
Speaker 2: (NODDING HER HEAD YES).
Speaker 1: Yeah, well yeah, '99' [1999], that's when things started really switching, and local disc jockeys started losing their jobs to these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Conglomerates--
Speaker 1: --conglomerates, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--de-regulation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So how is your--how do you operate your station in terms of--do you have locally situated disc jockeys, or do you tap into some big stream, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.  De-regulation did absolutely nothing for radio except put ownership in the hands of a few national companies.  It meant--for African Americans or minority broadcasters, it meant they--you know, it's just, it's impossible.  It's impossible to, you know, to get into broadcasting at this point.  The frequencies aren't available and, and the big broadcasters aren't giving them up.  So it's impact--it certainly has impacted our community, the Springfield Metro--Massachusetts Metro Market, because now we are--WEIB 106.3 Smooth FM is the only locally-owned commercial FM radio station in the Springfield, Mass--Metro Market.
Speaker 1: Okay, but who staffs (ph.) it?  I was trying to get at do you have someone there spinning--I mean playing discs, or do you tap into some other source (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It's, it's a, it's a locally-generated program format right here at the studio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It is--we have two syndicated programs and they're on Sunday afternoon.  No, actually it's three.  We have--from six to midnight, there are three syndicated programs; one is Dave Koz Radio Show for two hours, the next two hours is New Urban Jazz by Bob Baldwin, and the next two hours, Legends of Jazz with Ramsey Lewis.  But everything else comes through the studio.
Story_ID: 40007
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And it makes it a lot more difficult for, for me, as a stand-alone operated station because New England--how shall I put this?  It wasn't the progressive community that we thought we were moving into when we came here in '69 [1969], and I really don't believe much else has changed since, since then although the community has been very good for us.  We've raised--our kids were born here, we've raised our family, they've gone away to college--Tuskegee, and they have returned here.  But at the same, at the same time, there's a certain, there's a certain thing that goes on in the broadcast business; there's no one in the broadcasting business in New England who looks like me, you know.  I'm African American, I'm female; there are certain challenges around that.  Not only are they trying to--do they try to buy your radio station, but there are certain things that, that has been done to me to try to make sure that I don't get the business that I need to to continue to service this community, and that's, that's sad.  Now, I can deal with that, that racism, that is--that was the kind that I grew up with that was there when I came here.  I knew what that was, but I've come against a different kind; it's a hidden kind of agenda that people have, and I'm not saying it's everyone because it surely is not, it really is not, but there's enough of it to, to really impact what you're doing.  And yes, they'll, they'll smile in your face.  'Yeah, you guys are doing a really great job,' blah, blah, blah, blah.  'I listen to your station'--dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, 'but no, that's not a part of our media buy (ph.) budget.'
Story_ID: 40008
Speaker 1: So has it been worth it, basically, to have done this, and to keep this station in operation, you know, with the opposition before and during?
Speaker 2: Everything in life involves some challenges--obstacles--opposition; you can't really let that stop you.  I don't believe that, that God brought me this far to just pull the rug from underneath me.  As long--I think--I know that it has been worth it; I know it's been, it's been an inspiration for a lot of people, young girls can see what the possibilities are, that they're not limited.  I didn't know what the possibilities were when I was growing up.  Through this, I think people can see; there is much out there.  It may not come easy, it isn't easy.  It's, it's tiring sometimes, you have to pray about stuff, let stuff go, put things behind you, and move forward, and then there has to be those moments of encouragement where people are there to, to say, you know 'Good job, keep it up.  We need this because if you let this station go, you can forget about anyone looking like me or, or any independent person having this kind of access' so that when the American Heart Association says, 'Can we partner with you to talk about the Go Red for Women event that we're sponsoring?'  Because heart attack and stroke are those killers--more so than cancer.  Or when the Food Bank says, 'In this day in age, we have a real crisis here; there is just not enough food for the demand, and you're able to lend your support' because that too, has been one of the things I've been involved with.
Story_ID: 40009
Speaker 1: And just a lot of other things that, that have helped me to, to know that there is a need here, and it may be, it may be hard but, you know, it was hard for my mother, it was hard for my fore-parents; you just have to do it, and you have to keep going.  You gotta build yourself up, you know, you need to take some time for yourself.  And I admit that's something that we're, we're guilty of not doing--taking that personal time to help you to keep going.  But incidents like this, being called to say, 'Would you be available to do this?'  That was--that happened at a time when I was like pulling my hair out like--I don't know; and even, you know, today it's, it's like a juggling act.  But, it is--for me it's a, a, a--it says, 'Okay, you know, you need to keep doing this, you need to let people know that there are possibilities;' you just have to be willing to, to work for it, and to learn through your obstacles and challenges because 15 years helped me to learn more about this business, to understand, and to become more educated that this is a business that is primarily male-dominated and, and white.  And I'm obviously not a part of the Good ol' Boys' Club, but I still have to keep going in spite of I don't--I'm not on the golf course with the president of this company or that company or, or what have you, but one thing we are is we are very involved in the community; we are very involved in helping out in this community.
Speaker 2: Okay, because you used--you said you're the only broadcast source here in the Springfield area that's local, I mean that's really local.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I even had someone challenge me on that because they said, 'Oh well, what does local have to do with it?'  And I said, 'Really it has a lot to do with it because number one, I'm vested in this community.'  Like I said, my kids were born here, they grew up here, they're living here.  I don't intend to go anywhere.  National broadcasting companies--the dollars--although they may be paying the local staff, the dollars are not here in this community; they've been going--they're going to corporate.  And the corporate concern is not about what's going on here with your kids or, or my kids, it's really about that bottom line.  One of the, you know, broadcasters earlier said, 'I'm not in the radio business, I'm in the (GESTURE POINTING TO HERSELF) business.'  You know what I mean? I, I--you know, it's about advertising; that's the bottom line for me--that corporate bottom line.  And, because of my, my history--where I came from, how I grew up, I guess, and as well as the relationships we have built over the years in this community through the various boards and, and what have you, you know. I, I can say that we in fact are very community-focused, caring, and committed.
Story_ID: 40010
Speaker 1: We always ask this.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: They are the same as most communities--education; always goes back to that.  The drop-out rate, the, the crime rate, the--you know, jails, poverty in the community.  And so we're involved with organizations striving to help in some of those areas--both my husband and I.  And so if we can just help out in this little corner over here, and do it well, then hopefully it'll radiate, and I think it has because some of the kids' lives we've touched have gone out and they've done other things so it's spreading the seeds, and that's what you, that's what you want.  I'm optimistic about our community 'cause there are great people here, the kids are good, we, we, you know--unfortunately, the resources are being cut, the programs are being cut, so the after-school programs, the, the music programs, the physical education programs in our schools, those are being cut.  That's where people, our kids, get creative and feel good about themselves because of the accomplishments, and so when we don't have those, it's--what, what do they have to look for--many don't feel that they have much to look forward to, so you wanna change that.
Story_ID: 40011
Speaker 1: All right, now this is another question we always ask.  When you look back at everything you've done to this point in your career, is there any major thing that you would do differently, or change if you could?
Speaker 2: I don't know because, through every stage in this whole life cycle, it's been a learning experience, and from this experience brought confidence and belief to move forward to the next, and to overcome the next, and so it's hard for me to say that there's, there's something that I would do differently.
Story_ID: 40012
Speaker 1: Well, likewise, if you look back at everything--again, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I would say that professional legacy is probably the fact that, that I, a southern girl from the rural south, was able to go through this, this whole process and who would have thought I would be in a position where I'm discussing with you the fact that I was the first African American broadcaster in New England to have built--constructed a radio station here, male or female, and the fact that it is one of the legacies that--one of the things that I leave for my family, and for younger generations, as part of the, the, the, the continuing history of what was started as a young child and then that, that whole fact that you can grow up and believe that this is possible in these United States.  And obviously, I did not get there by myself because I had the strong support of my family; could not have done it without them.  My mother [Mattie Dawson Moore Hall], until the day she died, was the very essence of what this whole work was about in terms of encouraging and supporting.  As a matter of fact, I might add, her biggest joy at that--at this point--at that point in her life after the station was on the air, was coming here to spend time, in the Spring of the year, to go with us to the National Broadcast Conference, and that's what she did; she would go and she knew everyone and they loved her and, and--but to see it come to fruition for her, and to have her have my back and to be an encouragement for me because I saw what she was able to accomplish and she didn't have any resources.  She didn't have, you know, she didn't have much when she started but she was able to accomplish all of that, taught for 44 years, retired and then continued to mentor young people.  And so I hope that this will be for, for, for kids, for my family to recognize, and I think they do, because my son helped me to put this station on the air--Daryl (ph.), after he came back from Tuskegee [University], and I believe the whole timeline was about God's plan because while I started when these kids were little, or the idea was conceived when they weren't even born, but they both graduated from college by the time it was over, so that my son was there to help me, in the very beginning, to start the broadcasting of this station.  And my daughter Alicia (ph.) is now--is still there, and she's, you know, she does on-air and, and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: We have two children, Alicia and Daryl.
Story_ID: 40013
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go back to another issue where I was asking about how your station is operated?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: We never did find out like what you actually do at the station in terms of day-to-day tasks, so what are your responsibilities?
Speaker 2: We are--there are very few of us there, but you would not know that if you're listening to us on the air; but primarily, I do everything--operations, sales, the janitor when I have to be when my husband doesn't come in to help me with those duties.  But basically, I wear many different hats because the people who, who come in or they come in, they're contracted to do their shows, and that's basically it.  So everything--from the community relations, being out, being the face of the community, attending events, dealing with the, the, the financial part of the station; just about every role I play, you know, to a certain extent, and we've been able to, to manage that quite well but, but it is--it's challenging.  However, when you feel that your brand and your product is real important, you have to make sure that the product you're putting out over the air is one that's gonna be representative of the quality that people have come to expect; or they expect it from you if they don't get it from anyone else.  And so if I'm trying to sell the station, I've gotta make sure that the program is, you know, there are no blank spots, that everything has to be done, I'll even say, above and beyond anyone else because you're held, it seems, to a higher standard because they don't expect you to be able to produce quality or anything that is, is going to appeal to, to the greater community.  And that's what we have to do because the minority community in this, in this area is just that, it's a minority community at this point.
Story_ID: 40014
Speaker 1: And so we have the most diverse listeners of other radio stations in the market, and it's because of the music that we're playing; it appeals to you, it appeals to, to whites, blacks, Asians, you name it, because it's just plain good, quality music that is relatable to our, our constituents--our listeners.  And so, not only do we have to do that, but we also have to look at the, the Internet and take advantage of that, and use the resources to get our message and our brand out there by whatever, whatever way that we can, so--over the years, technology has changed; it's advanced, and that's a good thing because it allows us to, to provide the kind of programming that we want, it allows us to broadcast not only terrestrial, right here in the local area, but also regionally so that we have listeners coming--you know, calling in from Boston [Massachusetts] or wherever, because we are the only station that's playing this kind of music in, in the area or they miss a station that is flip--that the format has flipped because, you know, they can no longer get the station; and also globally.  I mean we get e-mails and informa--and questions from people all over the country, and calls coming in.  So it's, it's, it's a challenge for, for an individual, but the people who I do have helping me for the most part are there, you know, they have my back too, so--and for that, I'm appreciative.
Story_ID: 40015
Speaker 1: Well, who are they?
Speaker 2: We have, we have on-air people that covers all-day parts (ph.), and that's, that's pretty much it.  Some people wear different hats like one other person who does the PM Drive also may produce commercials and, and put the, the--put it into the computer so that it, it plays the way that it's supposed to.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) who are they in terms of their names? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I know, and I--the--and I just--well one is my daughter, Alicia, and there are others but one thing about this business, they come and they go, and that's why I am a little bit vague because the existing radio stations, I have found, have come in and focused specifically on our--one of their, one of their strategies have been to focus specifically on our, our person that we may have and target them to get them out of the station to work for them, although it may be temporarily.  And so I specifically don't push any particular person.
Story_ID: 40016
Speaker 1: Well, my last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person of, of faith, integrity and compassion, concern, caring and, and, and family focused--knowing the priorities, knowing that God is first, knowing that family comes next, and all else comes underneath.  But being the caring and the committed person who, who has great integrity.
