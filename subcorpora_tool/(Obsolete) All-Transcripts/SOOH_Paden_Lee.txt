 Finchum  Paden  Today is March 15, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re conducting an oral  history project, part of our Spotlighting Oklahoma project. Today I   m in  Tulsa, Oklahoma, speaking with Lee Paden. Our topic is Henry  Bellmon, former governor and U.S. senator. Thank you for having me  today.  You   re quite welcome.  Let   s start by having you tell a little bit about yourself. Where you were  born and your career and we   ll     Okay. I was born here, in Tulsa. I grew up in Sand Springs, which is  about seven miles from Tulsa, graduated from high school there, went to  Oklahoma Baptist University, undergraduate, and then went to OU Law  School. From those experiences, then, my life followed a pattern often  connected to Henry Bellmon.  Well, in high school, were you interested in politics?  I probably have always been interested in politics. I can remember when  I was five, six, seven, eight years old, that a friend of our family ran for  county commissioner, and I passed out cards and signs and things like  that for him. Putting them on windshields of cars and doing all sorts of  things. He lost. (Laughs) But, yes, that probably was my first political  experience, so I   ve always been interested and involved in politics.  Did your parents discuss it around the dinner table?  Not really. Not really. My father died when I was two, and my  grandfather lived with us from the time, literally, that I can remember  until he passed away, which I was like twelve or thirteen. My  5  Finchum  Paden  grandfather was interested in world events and what was going on. He   d  read the paper from cover to cover. He never liked to watch television,  or at least he said he didn   t. This was back in the    50s when television  was fairly new. He said it hurt his eyes. But the one thing I remember  was when Ike ran for president. My favorite aunt was a dyed-in-the-wool  Democrat. She was one who voted for every Democratic  candidate, would never think about voting for a Republican until Henry  Bellmon came along, then she did vote for him. But my grandfather, one  time when Ike was running, wound up with a huge Ike button that he  would put on his shirt when my aunt was going to be there. (Laughs) He  liked to gig her and rib her, and that was always fun.  There was a little bit of politics discussed during my growing up years,  but I guess where I really started forming my political ideas and  thoughts was when I was in college. I was a government and history  major, and the guy who was the head of the government department   at  that time it was called government, it wasn   t called political science, at  least at OBU  Oklahoma Baptist University    was a man named Corbett  Rushing, and he too was just a rabid Democrat. He used to make  comments about the fact that you could put all the Republicans in the  back of a pickup truck for their annual meeting and still have room for  two sheep and a goat. I was enough of an individualist that I said,    I   ll  start looking at what the Republicans have to say.     In the    50s and the    60s, if you were going to vote in Oklahoma and help  select the people who were actually going to be elected, you had to be a  Democrat because there weren   t any Republicans who ran. And there  certainly weren   t any Republican primaries. You might have an  opportunity to vote for one Republican out of every ten races that were  on the ballot. When I registered to vote, I registered as a Democrat,  primarily because that was where the challenges were. But I think I  always was a Republican at heart, because the Republican Party in the  1960s was virgin. It was brand new. It was something that was in the  process of development. That was a real interest to me. That   s kind of  how I got involved in the political process.  What made you switch? When did you actually     I think when I actually switched was when I went to work for Henry  Bellmon in 1965. That   s a long story, but essentially, I was in law  school. The Bellmons used law students and med students for part of the  guard group that was at the governor   s mansion. I had been a guide at  the World   s Fair, and I was fortunate enough, by the luck of the draw, to  draw the Bellmon family as the group that I took around when we had  Oklahoma Day at the World   s Fair. So, I got to know them a little bit,  and they both asked me there, said,    What are you going to do?    I said,  6  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden     I   m going to go to law school.    They said,    Well, we use law students  at the governor   s mansion, would you have any interest in doing that if a  position came open?    I said,    Sure,    so they contacted me, and I worked  for the Bellmons for two years and for Dewey Bartlett for about six  months, because he took the governor   s spot after Bellmon was elected.  How did you get interested in being a guide for the fair?  Well, there was a gentleman in Shawnee that was involved in the Sooner  Guide World   s Fair project, and he came to me. I didn   t know him. His  name was Hayler Fisher. He came to me and he said,    I want you to  apply for this position.    I did, and it was an interview process, and I  went through the interview process, and ultimately was selected to go. It  was a great experience, fantastic experience.  1964?  The guides were selected at the end of    63, and we actually went in  March of    64. And there were two groups, one group was there from  March until the end of July and then the other group was there from the  end of July to when the fair closed in October. Then the next year they  did the same thing. Then there were two more groups.  Any moments from that time that just stand out for you?  Well, one thing that we did in that process, which is absolutely an  invaluable experience, is we traveled the entire state. We went from one  end of Oklahoma to the other in all directions. We did it on the  weekends, and we had a couple of professors, one from OU, one from  OSU, who were Oklahoma historians, who traveled with us. As we  traveled from place to place, they lectured on the history of the particular  area that we were in. We went to northwestern Oklahoma and central  north Oklahoma and then eastern Oklahoma over a period of about three  and a half months, every weekend. It was marvelous. We met with  chambers of commerce, with business leaders, with people who were  interested in what the World   s Fair was going to provide them, an  opportunity to highlight and that sort of thing.  It was a fun experience because we got to know each other, number one,  the team that was actually going to be up there. And then the second  thing was we learned a tremendous amount about the state. I   m very  visual, and so in order to really be able to understand something, I  understand it much better if I see it and if I participate in it, if I am  involved in it. That gave us the opportunity to do that. It was a really,  really good idea. Very much like what Leadership Oklahoma is today  except different in that the objective is different.  7  Finchum  Paden  We were told,    People are going to think everybody lives in teepees,     and we got that question a lot. But at the World   s Fair, we saw   first of  all, we were in New York City. What a great place to be for a guy who is  twenty years old and had, literally   well, I take that back. I had been to  Europe the year before on a study trip so I had been to other places, but I  had never been to New York City. But I lived there for six months, and  that was a marvelous experience. People from all over the world went  through the exhibit. The exhibit was a park. In the middle of the park,  there was a topographical map of Oklahoma. It had different things  highlighted on the map, and part of our job was to explain the lakes and  the attractions and the size of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and that sort of  thing.  We had a vendor, and the vendor sold fried chicken. It was a perfect  match for a park because people could come and sit down and eat their  chicken. Adlai Stevenson was the ambassador to the United Nations, and  he came to the fair numerous times. He always came to our park, and he  always sat and ate some chicken. He was so approachable. I guess this  was the first time I really had had interaction with someone on that level.  He was really interested in Oklahoma, and we were really interested in  him as an individual. We had a similar experience when Oral Roberts  came to the exhibit. Oklahomans came often.  Oral Roberts came to the exhibit. He spent an hour and a half or two  hours with all the guides before the fair opened. Any question we  wanted to ask, we could. When we toured ORU  Oral Roberts  University , he wasn   t there. He kept apologizing for the fact that he  wasn   t there, and he was so proud of what they were going to do and  how they were going to develop this educational process. It was no holds  barred, it was wonderful. He was a national television personality, and  people were just blown out of the water by the fact that he was there and  that he was willing to talk and that he was willing to visit. I   m sure there  were people who asked for his help and for his guidance and that sort of  thing. But those were the kinds of experiences that were really, really  interesting. I have very fond, as you can probably tell, memories of that.  You   ve got to remember, I was like twenty-two years old, twenty-one  years old when that was going on so we had a lot of fun as well. The  Staten Island Ferry at five o   clock in the morning was a tremendous  experience. We did that several times.  So you met Bellmon through that process.  Yes, that probably was really the first time that I had any real interaction  with him, with Mrs. Bellmon, with the kids. That was two days, so that  8  wasn   t a huge interaction, but it was enough that, number one, I knew  him by reputation, by what he had done, by what he was doing, but my  real exposure came, then, when I went to work at the governor   s  mansion as a guard.  Today the guards are out in a booth that   s outside. That wasn   t the way it  was in 1965. The guard sat at a little desk right in the front hallway, the  front entranceway to the house. You had a gun. It was in the drawer. I  had never shot a pistol before. I learned how to shoot a pistol while I  was a guard at the governor   s mansion. (Laughs) I always said that if  there was ever a problem that I was going to get behind the governor  because he was a better shot than I was. (Laughs)  But our job, the three guys who were the student guards, and two other  people    one was a retired military guy and the other one was just a  retired guy that worked for the State Capital Police. We all worked for  the State Capital Police. Our job was to interact with the three girls.  They were very active. They were all in high school or junior high  school. They were very active in school, they were very active in 4-H,  they were very active in afterschool activities. The Bellmons didn   t want  them driving. Pat was the only one of the girls who could drive at that  time. Gail learned to drive during that period. I still have scars to prove  that she learned to drive while I was helping her. We took them to  football games. I took Ann to the orthodontist every week. I took Ann to  ballet every week. I took Gail to a variety of different things. They were  very active, as I said, in 4-H and took them to those meetings, took them  to exhibits that they did for 4-H.  We were guards in the sense that that was the way we were employed,  but we really were there to provide some help, because the Bellmons  were gone a lot. They were traveling across the state doing all sorts of  meetings and things. They usually came back at night, but it would be  late at night. If the girls had afterschool activities, we were there to do  that. That was kind of the process.  I   ve got to tell you one funny story. Pat graduated, and her first year at  OSU she lived in one of the dorms, one of the high-rise dorms, the name  of which I can   t recall. She had this sweet little girl who was her  roommate, who was from western Oklahoma. I can   t remember the  town, but the first time she decided to bring her roommate home to the  governor   s mansion, I went up to pick her up. And I took the governor   s  limousine. We had uniforms, but most of the time I dressed like this. I  had a shirt on and slacks on because we didn   t want to look   for the  girls, the girls didn   t like uniforms. So, I put my uniform on. It had this  really creepy little hat. (Laughs) And I   ve got the pistol on my belt, and I  go into the dorm, and I ask for her, and they say,    Okay, I   ll call her,     9  Finchum  Paden  and they buzzed her. I go over to the elevator, and I   m standing like this  (gestures) at the elevator when she comes down, and she is so  embarrassed. (Laughs) She has a bundle of laundry, and she literally,  throws it at me. (Laughter) I go out, and I put it in the trunk, and I open  the doors. And then the limousine had recessed lights under the grill that  flashed, and it had a siren. As we pulled away from the dorm, I turned  the lights on and the siren on, and I was going probably five miles an  hour. (Laughs)  Several things like that happened over the years, but that was a funny,  funny experience, because the girls didn   t act any different than they did  when he was not governor. They lived in a different place, but they  loved to go back to the farm, as he did. They often spent the weekends  there. So, anyway, those were really interesting times because they were  growing, and they were interested in boys. The guys who were the  guards had a little bit of a protective streak about them. (Laughs) That  was fun.  Was it a forty-hour-a-week job?  Yes. Two or three nights a week I worked from eleven until seven. Then  usually, on the weekends I worked from three until eleven, so it was a  five day kind of thing. I think I was off on Mondays and Tuesdays or  something. I don   t remember exactly when, but it was pretty much forty  hours a week, and it got me through law school. (Laughs) And it was  great, especially on the nights that you were there from eleven to seven.  You could read and do a lot of studying during that period and still sleep  two or three hours.  He  Governor Bellmon  always got up at like, five o   clock in the  morning. It was interesting. There was always a stack   that   s probably  an exaggeration   but there was always a stack of phone calls. And after  he got up, he would call down and he would say,    Have I got any phone  calls?    and you   d go through the stack and say,    Mr. So and So called,  Senator So and So called, Representative So and So called,    go through  the various ones. And then he would say,    Okay, why don   t you do so  and so first and so and so second and so and so third, and then I   ve got a  meeting at seven o   clock. And that   s probably all I   m going to be able to  talk to.     You   d call the person up and tell them that the governor was returning  their call and could they hold, and then you   d buzz him, and he would  answer the phone, and he   d talk, and you   d watch until he hung up. And  then when he hung up you   d call the next person. In doing that, that was  probably the first real interaction from a work perspective that I was  involved in. And, of course, there were always lots of meetings at the  10  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  governor   s mansion. You   ve got to remember that when he was elected  governor, I don   t remember precisely how many Republicans were in  the legislature, but the Republicans were the distinct minority. I   m going  to say there were ten in the House and maybe three or four in the Senate.  And we   re talking 100  in the House , and we   re talking forty-eight  in  the Senate  so we   re not talking a huge number of people. There may  have been five in the Senate and maybe ten or fifteen in the House, but  there weren   t very many.  Two pickup trucks. (Laughs)  Right, right. But all of those people were really dedicated, hardworking  people. If you were going to get anything done, you had to have  Democrats as well. For him  Henry Bellmon  to get elected the first  time, he had to have Democrats to do that. The process was not just a  process of compromise, but in a lot of instances   and this was  something I learned early on   in a lot of instances, it had to be a  situation where you were working with a democratically sponsored  agenda, and then you put your handprint and fingerprints on it by  requiring that this be done or that be done, and this be changed and that  be changed. And that is really the way he always worked. He worked  that way when he was Governor in 1987. A lot more Republicans in the  legislature on both sides, the House and the Senate. Still not a majority.  We only got a majority in the last two elections, first in the House and  now, both Houses are Republican.  The art of working with others is something that I think was probably a  legacy that I gained from him. And knowing that you   ve got to go after,  realistically, what you can get, not necessarily, ideologically what you  would like to have. You get half the loaf, and then you go back for the  other half the next time. That   s a marvelous philosophy to have, in my  view, because, number one, you   ve always got a goal, number two,  you   re always trying to achieve it. You   ve heard the saying that     legislation is like making sausage   ? Well, it is like making sausage.  You   re grinding all sorts of different things into the process, and that   s  what the legislative process is. It can   t be just cut and dry, this is the  only way it   s got to be. It just will never, will never succeed if that is the  frame of mind that we undertake in any government, whether it   s local  government, county government, state government, federal government.  Compromise is something that has to be a part of the process.  In his first term as governor, do you recall some of the issues or things  he championed?  He was a big champion of education. In my view, he doesn   t get the  credit for that that he truly deserves. But if you   ll go back and look, he  11  Finchum  Paden  got teachers one of the first major pay raises. He didn   t get all he  wanted, but he got them a pay raise, and they hadn   t had a pay raise in a  long, long time. When he was governor the second time, after much,  much log rolling and consternation and several times almost giving up,  he got 1017 passed   a major, major reform in the educational process in  Oklahoma. Unfortunately, we   ve regressed from that, and we need to  step back and look at how we deal with that issue in the future. He was  always interested in education.  In the Senate, he was the ranking minority member on the Indian  Education Sub-Committee of the Labor Committee, got some major  reforms in Indian education activities. Indian education in the    60s and  the    50s and the    40s was almost   I   ll retract that. It wasn   t almost   it  was a very rigid system. It wasn   t reform school-like, but it was very,  very rigid. There were three schools, major schools  in Oklahoma .  There was a school called Chilocco, which was up north of Stillwater,  up near Ponca City, and there were two or three hundred Indian students  there, not necessarily from Oklahoma, from all over the country.  Riverside was down in the southwestern part of the state. And then there  was another school, the name of which escapes me now, but there were  three major Indian schools in Oklahoma. And then there were a number  of them in other locations, in true Indian country where there were true  reservations and that sort of thing.  They would bring Alaska students to Oklahoma. Well, you can imagine  Alaskan-Indian students in Oklahoma. You can imagine what a cultural  shock that was. Being in the Anadarko area, for example, which is where  one of the schools was located, it   s hot and dusty and dry   a great deal  different than Alaska. And that   s a good example. He worked with  Senator Kennedy, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, on the Indian  education process. The main staff member was a guy from Oklahoma  that Senator Bellmon got involved in the process. He worked for a  couple of years on the committee and brought a great perspective. He  had gone to Indian schools and a lot of improvements were made then.  A lot of improvements have continued to be made. So education for the  masses was something that he was always interested in and was always  something that he stood his ground on. It was not one of those issues that  was so much in front of everything that that was the only thing he ever  talked about, but it was always an underlying thing that he wanted to  improve.  Well, at the end of his first term, he wasn   t allowed to run a second term,  right, at that time?  That   s right. And that was an interesting period. I graduated from law  school in June after he had left office in January. I worked for Senator  12  Bartlett, who was then the governor for about three months following  the change. And then I was getting ready to take my finals and to take  the bar exam, and so I resigned from that position. When I graduated  from law school, I went to work here in Tulsa for an oil company. I was  involved in a management training program where they put you in a  variety of different aspects of the company   s operation. The reason they  put me in that program was, as a lawyer for the company, I was going to  be working on everything from tort claims to bond issues to whatever,  and they wanted me to have background experience.  For the first year that I worked for the oil company, I was in the finance  department, in the pipeline department, in the refining department, and I  sat on a drilling rig when they were drilling a well. I canned oil at the old  Sun Refinery, which is now the Holly Refinery here in Tulsa. I worked  at a service station on the line and did that training program. It gave you  a hands-on experience, as I said before. I had, of course, continued to  keep in touch with the Bellmons. He was on the Williams Brothers  Board, which was a private entity, and then when they took it public, he  was on the Williams Company Board.  They were building a pipeline in Saudi Arabia and during the time that  he and Mrs. Bellmon were over there touring the pipeline construction     I don   t remember whether he asked me or she asked me   but somebody  asked me to come up for the homecoming event at the little school  where they were in, in Billings. By this time it was just Gail and Ann.  Pat was in college, but she was home for the weekend. So I went up and  messed around with them, and I think we went to Stillwater and did  something for dinner or something the night we were there. I continued  to have interaction with them, but the story I   m going to tell you is just  pure fate.  I was working on a Sun pipeline project. The pipeline ran from Duncan,  Oklahoma, to West Memphis, Arkansas. It went through all these little  towns, and at each one of these major towns, like Duncan and at  Wynnewood and at Ada and Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Little Rock,  Arkansas, and Conway, Arkansas, there were terminals. And this was a  finished products line, it carried gasoline and jet fuel. We were doing a  time-in-motion study to see how the people were working and what  additional manpower was needed or what manpower might be taken  away. I was in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and I was staying at a Holiday Inn,  and I had been working out at the terminal. These big tanker trucks  would come in, and they   d fill them up, and then they   d take off and  another tanker truck would be behind them.  I got through, and I went back to the hotel, and I took a shower. They  had a little restaurant at the Holiday Inn, and I was sitting there by  13  myself, eating. I don   t think my food had been served or anything, but I  heard them call for a bellman. I thought they needed somebody to carry  luggage or something. Well, here he comes, traipsing through the  restaurant. He didn   t see me, but when he came back through, I waved at  him. He was by himself, so we sat down, and he told me in that  conversation that he was going to run for the  US  Senate and asked me  if I had any interest in working for him in that campaign. And I said,     Oh, yes. Give me a chance     (Laughs) So that   s how I got connected to  the campaign.  I was a    field rep    for the eastern half of the state. We planned rallies.  Then when he was in the area that was under my jurisdiction, I took him  places. I drove him wherever he needed to go. When you   re in a car with  a guy for about a year, you learn an awful lot about him. My admiration  for him just was amazing. He never was uncomfortable in any setting.  And I   ll give you an example of what I   m talking about. We were  driving from Bartlesville over to Vinita. We   re driving along, and he  sees a combine out in a field. And there   s four or five pickup trucks, and  all these guys are standing out there in the field. He says,    Let   s stop and  see what   s going on there.    I said,    Okay,    because he never was on  time so it didn   t really make any difference. (Laughs)  So we get out, and we walk across there. He said,    These guys are  farmers,    and he said,    If they hunker down, you hunker down.    He  said,    You know what I   m talking about?    I said,    Well, I think I do.  Like, if they go down on one knee, is that what you   re talking about?        Yes, yes.    So we   re standing there, and they were having a problem  with the combine. I don   t remember precisely what the problem was. I  don   t even know that it was the combine. It may have been the tractor.  But anyway, one of these guys reaches down, and he picks up a piece of  grass or straw, and he goes down on one knee, and everybody goes  down at the same time. (Laughs) And I go down in response to what he  had told me. (Laughs) And I thought,    What a marvelous piece of  understanding of the way people operate.    I just saw that demonstrated  over and over and over again. To this day, I do things based on some of  those life experiences that I had.  I don   t know how many miles I drove him in my career when I worked  for him in the Senate. When I went to Washington, I was the only single  male on the staff so I drew the straw that said,    You need to drive the  boss.    I would take him down to the Department of the Interior or I   d  take him to the White House, or I   d take him to a meeting of the  Migratory Bird Commission, or I   d take him to the airport, or whatever.  Sometimes there was lively conversation based on what was going on  and what he was going to do. And I was briefing him up on what I knew  about the situation. Other times, he would get in the car, and he   d go  14  sound asleep the minute I pulled away from the curb. It was just  amazing. He could sleep for five minutes, and he was refreshed. And  that   s how he got through his day. You   ve got to remember, he gets up  at five o   clock in the morning. (Laughs) Anyway, those experiences  were just priceless, absolutely priceless. You couldn   t buy that kind of  activity.  Then when I moved back to Tulsa, one day I was taking him to the  airport from the Senate Office Building out to Dulles, and he said,    Do  you and Carol want to live here all your life?    I said,    Oh, no. No.    He  said,    Well, I want to make you a deal.    He said,    Why don   t you move  back to Oklahoma?    I said,    Would you let me live in Tulsa?    He said,     Yes.    I said,    Okay. That sounds like a good deal.    He said,    We   re  going to have a rough campaign,    and he said,    I   m going to have to be  all over the state,    and he said,    I   ve got to have people running my  office, number one, who I can depend on and, number two, who can see  the lay of the land and get me where I need to go.    I said,    Okay.     We moved back at the end of 1973, and the election was in 1974. I can   t  tell you how many miles I drove with him awake and him asleep in the  car, but we always had really good discussions. One of the things I have  always admired about Henry Bellmon was he never told you what to do.  He always taught you what to do. It was a really interesting way he went  about doing things. Maybe that   s why he liked education so well,  because he liked to    teach.    He never criticized. He was always making  suggestions.    The next time we do this, why don   t we try to do so and  so?    or    The next time we go to this meeting, why don   t we see if we  can get so and so to go, too?    or whatever. Things that I may have  thought of, things that I may not have thought of, but then the next  meeting that you had, you thought, and you said to yourself,    Do we  need anybody else there? Do we need to have a better agenda than we  have? How do we approach this meeting as compared to the last meeting  we had that probably wasn   t as good as it could have been?     He was always teaching. He was always suggesting. He was always  observing. He did that and, literally, the last long conversation I had with  him was on his birthday before he passed away in September. I called  him because, as I told you, when he ran for the Senate the second time, it  was a long involved campaign, and they stayed at our house from the  middle of May until the election was over. And it went into December  because there was a contest of the election. Matt  Paden   s son  was born  on the 23rd of December. They were finished for that jog about the 18th  of December so their bedroom was the nursery. (Laughs) So you can  imagine what we did from the 18th of December until 23rd of December.  We   re pulling off wallpaper, we   re painting, we   re putting curtains up,  we   re putting ABCs on the top   which we loved.  15  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  But anyway, during that period of time, you just got such a perspective. I  was telling you, I talked to him on his birthday, on the 3rd of September.  My son is a doctor in Atlanta. He works in a teaching hospital so he   s an  academician, but he   s also an attending doctor. He   s a pediatrician, and  he works in the intensive care unit. He had come up with an idea to build  a dialysis machine for children. Right now, to dialyze a child, you have  to use an adult machine. None of the tubes are the right size, none of the  pressures are right and you, literally, have to stand by the infant   s bed  while they   re being dialyzed, because you   ve got to adjust things all the  time. And so this was his idea and his concept. They had been working  on it for probably a year, and he applied for an Obama grant under the  Resource Recovery program that Obama put in, and he got a million  dollar grant.  I called the governor and I said,    Governor, you   re not going to believe  this, but my son has changed his political affiliation.    (Laughs) There  was just silence on the other end. I said,    Well, I   m really joking, but,    I  said,    Obama just gave him a million dollar grant for his dialysis  machine.    He knew that that was one of his projects that he was trying to  get underway. And he was so excited about it, and so we talked about  that, and then that turned to politics in Oklahoma, and who was running,  and who was not running, and what was this, and what was that. We had  a long discussion, and I probably talked to him for thirty or forty-five  minutes. He said,    You need to come to the farm,    and, unfortunately, I  didn   t. So, anyway, he was always interested in our children as well and  how they were doing and what they were doing and that sort of thing.  He was close with all of his staff, wasn   t he?  Oh, absolutely, yes. The staff was an extended family. In Washington,  for sure, it was an extended family because the majority of us came from  Oklahoma and were transplants and were up there, and we were in a  foreign land with learning a whole new process. (Laughs)  Since you came back here when he was running for his second term as  senator, did you go back when he won?  No. I went to Washington in    69, and we moved back in    73. I met my  wife   as a matter of fact, he introduced me to my wife. I went back  periodically, but I didn   t go back and work up there, no. Probably within  six weeks after it was all final and everything. We were in the car going  somewhere and he said,    Lee, I   m not going to be a senator all your life,  so I want you to start trying to figure out what you want to do.    He said,     I   ll support you in any way I can. I   ll help you in any way I can.    He  said,    There   s a lot more in this life other than the Senate.    Then, within  16  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  a year, he announced that he wasn   t going to run again. (Laughs)  Was that a surprise to you?  Oh, no, no. He told me that in a variety of different ways. When he told  me,    I   m not going to be a senator all your life,    that was a pretty good  indication that he won this one, but he wasn   t going to ever do that  again.  What was the key to winning that one?  It, literally, was that he touched more hands than the other guy. I   ll tell  you a funny story. You would go to these things where he would speak,  like at lunch, and then you   d have another, like a coffee, in the  afternoon, and then you   d have an evening speaking event. On this  particular day, we were in McAlester for a chamber of commerce or  civic club lunch, and then we drove over to Poteau. Carl Albert Junior  College is there, and we were there, and we went down to the Robert S.  Kerr Research Facility, it   s an animal research facility, because he was  looking at a bull or something that was a new breed that they had  developed. Anyway, we were down there, and then we had an evening  deal at Poteau. And those luncheon things are always the same. They   re  ham and peas or green beans and a little wilted salad that   s been sitting  on the table half the day and something that they would call dessert.  (Laughs) It was never very appetizing looking. You just didn   t eat it. I  mean, you might take a bite of the ham if it looked halfway decent   and  normally it wasn   t. (Laughs) Because there   d be sixty or seventy people  there, you know. In this particular one, as I recall, it was bigger. It was  kind of a joint thing.  So  after the lunch meeting , we   re driving across southern Oklahoma  and he said,    Did you eat anything?    and I said,    No, I didn   t eat very  much.    He said,    I didn   t eat anything. People kept talking to me,    and  he said,    I didn   t get anything to eat.    He said,    First place we see up  here, let   s pull over and get a Coke and some peanuts or something.    I  said,    Okay.    So I see a little two-pump rural grocery store, and there   s  three guys out whittling on the bench. We pull up in there, and we get  out, and he goes over,    Hi, I   m Henry Bellmon,    and shakes the guy   s  hand.    Hi, I   m Henry Bellmon,    he shakes the guy   s hand.    Hi, I   m  Henry Bellmon,    and shakes the guy   s hand. We   re in Little Dixie. We  go inside, and there   s a lady at kind of the check-out point, the cash  register up in front. He stretches his hand out and,    Hi, I   m Henry  Bellmon.    We go back and there   s a meat counter in the back, there   s a  butcher back there and,    Hi, I   m Henry Bellmon.    There was kind of a  tiny bit of recognition, but not very much. We get our pop, and we get  our peanuts, and we get in the car, and we   re driving down the road. I  17  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  thought he had gone to sleep. He was sitting there and he said,    They  had no idea who I was, did they?    (Laughs) I said,    No, I don   t think  they did, Senator.    He said,    Well, that   s five hands I touched.    And he  said,    Maybe when they go in the booth, they   ll remember my name.     He won by 3000 votes. And I  will always  think those five people were  a part of that.  What kind of car were you driving? Was it air conditioned?  Oh, yes. I   m going to say it was a   as I recall, it was a two-door Buick,  little coup thing that we bought in D.C. and then took it back to  Oklahoma.  It was your personal car?  Yes, it was a personal car. Oh, no, there was never a vehicle that was  available.  When you were driving around in D.C. was it your car or his?  Well, it would depend. It would depend. If we were going someplace  that was really hard to park, he had a tag that you could stick up. And if  my car was the closest   because the first year or two   well, the whole  time that he was there they had one car there, and if Shirley was at  home, he usually didn   t take the car to work. After the first year, they  moved into Alexandria, which was right next to the Potomac River. And  they bought a house and then a year or two later, they bought another  house. My phone would ring at five o   clock in the morning and he   d say,     What are you doing?    I would say,    Well, now, I   m getting up.     (Laughs) He said,    Why don   t you swing by and pick me up? Shirley  needs the car today.    And I probably did that three days out of every  five.  And so, my wife and I, as I said, he introduced us. She was working for  a senator from West Virginia. She   d come up there in the summer and  got a job through the employment office and worked for this senator  from West Virginia. We were waiting on the senators    elevator, and she  was standing there. And she worked on the Senate floor all the time for  this West Virginia senator. So he knew who she worked for. He didn   t  know who she was or anything. He knew who she worked for, knew that  she was a Senate staffer. So when this elevator came, he said,    Why  don   t you get on the elevator with us and go down.    She said,    Oh,  thank you very much.    As we were going down, he asked her,    What  part of West Virginia are you from?    She said,    I   m not from West  Virginia. I   m from Ardmore, Oklahoma.    He said,    What are you doing  working for that scoundrel?    (Laughs) She said,    Well, there   s no jobs.     18  Finchum  Paden  He said,    There   s a job now.    He hired her, literally, on the spot.  So we started dating, which was not accepted. We weren   t supposed to  do that. After about two or three dates, I just went in and said,    I know  I   m not supposed to do this, but I think I   ve already fallen in love.     (Laughs) He said,    Oh, no you haven   t. No you haven   t.    But he said,     It   s okay, don   t worry about it.    But then when we got married, which  was the end of the year   she went to work in January and then we got  married in the end of November   she went to work for a trade  association downtown, she would ride in with us, eat breakfast at the  Capitol, and then take a cab down to where her office was. And then in  the evening she   d take a cab back, and then we   d ride home. So we had a  lot of traffic time there, too, because from my house in Virginia, to pick  him up and get to the Capitol, it was probably forty-five minutes.  That was before the metro?  Yes, yes. One of the things you had suggested was how did I develop as  an assistant? What we wound up doing and what he did, I think, literally,  throughout his whole time in the Senate was certain staff people would  work on certain issues. I had an energy background so I worked on  energy issues. I worked on labor and health issues, because I liked that. I  liked the Clean Air Act. I liked the Clean Water Act. One major piece of  legislation that was pending at the time he went up there, there   d been a  big coal mine explosion, and they introduced what was called the Coal  Mine Health and Safety Act. There were extensive hearings on that, and  I really enjoyed working on that. I was the only person who had any  kind of legal background, although I didn   t have very much. But if you  needed a bill drafted, you didn   t draft it. There was a service, and there  still is. You would go upstairs and there was this cadre of people,  probably fifteen or twenty lawyers, some of whom were young, some of  whom were old, and some in between. You would say,    Senator  Bellmon wants to do so and so, and so and so, and so and so.    Normally,  they would turn around and pull out something,    Oh yes, 1934, someone  did       I mean, it was amazing. Every time I went up there, it just blew  my mind. (Laughs) There   s no original thought, but anyway. I did all the  bill drafting, regardless of what the subject matter was.  He was on the Ag committee. We had people who worked on the Ag  committee and the issues related to agriculture. If there was an  amendment or a bill that needed to be drafted, we would all talk, and  then I would go upstairs and get the amendment drafted. At a certain  point, I got to the point where I knew what the process was, and I could  do it pretty much by myself, on amendments. I couldn   t draft a whole  bill. That was a really interesting experience, and it sort of evolved. One  of the things that I learned most from, were from other people who had  19  been there for a long time.  One of the most interesting things is that there was one Republican in  the House, Page Belcher, and a newly elected Republican in the House,  Happy Camp, and then the other four were all Democrats, one of whom  was the majority leader and then the speaker, Carl Albert. And then Tom  Steed, from Shawnee, was the chairman of the House Appropriations  Committee, so lots of power in the House. And their staffs were  fantastic. If I had a question, I could pick up the phone. I could call any  of their staff people and say,    Who do I call to do so and so? How do I  get this drafted? How do I do so and so?    You wound up emulating what  others did. On the Senate side, there were a couple of senators whose  staff were extremely helpful. Senator Dole   s staff, Cliff Hanson, from  Wyoming, his staff   and those were people that you worked with and  you became close to. You wound up doing things by copying what they  did and then putting your own touches on it as well. You developed by  continuing to make suggestions as to how we do it better, et cetera   or  do it differently. And then by talking to others, being willing to ask the  questions and being willing to get the answers and use the answers that  you get.  I was telling you about the senator   s interest in Indian education. One  thing that he never has gotten   and probably didn   t want the recognition  for   in 1969    The president of the United States appointed the chiefs  of the Five Civilized Tribes and had done so from 1907 until 1970. One  day, all the chiefs were up there and Bill Keeler, who was the president  of Phillips Petroleum  and chief of the Cherokee Nation , said,    You  know, Senator, it   s really kind of silly that here we are, living in a day  when we can govern ourselves. We can run our own businesses.    The  Cherokees at the time already had businesses that they were operating.  And he said,    It   s just kind of archaic that the president still appoints the  chief, the principal chief. The tribal members ought to do that.    So we  got with Ed Edmondson, who wound up being his opponent in 1974, but  we got with Ed Edmondson, and we got together with the five chiefs,  and we drafted a bill. And it passed both Houses and was signed by the  president. From that point forward, those tribes have had a process to  select their own chief and their own leadership. They  each  have a  constitution. They  each  have a legislature, all of which came out of  that one simple piece of legislation.  I found it really interesting because I   ve had some interactions with a  couple of the chiefs in the last four or five years and none of them knew  that. None of them had any idea how they had wound up being elected  chief. They knew it was a statute, but they had no idea who did it and  how it came about. And he didn   t want that recognition, but that,  literally, changed the way those tribes have been able to evolve. And  20  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  now, they   re major business entities in Oklahoma. They employ  thousands of people, all five of them. They have made major  contributions to the state in tax revenues, in cultural exhibits that they  have developed. I haven   t seen it, but apparently the Chickasaw  historical exhibit that they just opened last year is just phenomenal, just  absolutely phenomenal.  So, in a very small way, you know, that came about by the fact that they  were given some sovereignty and given some ability to run their own  affairs and to capitalize on the things that they could capitalize on.  Everybody criticizes the fact that,    Well, they have casinos,    well, they  also have a variety of other businesses, too, that employ people, that  provide revenue and income to those people on a weekly and monthly  basis. They have health clinics, they have a variety of other activities,  educational activities that they perform. So a little bit of that is because  somebody had the foresight to suggest that they be elected. The bill  doesn   t say elect, though, it says select. That was a compromise. There   s  a story behind it, but it   s not worth going into.  When he returned to the state, there were a couple of years there before  he ran for governor, right?  Yes.  Do you know what he did during that time period?  Well, he went back to the farm. It   s really interesting. This is something  that I wanted to kind of weave into this. Rural Oklahoma was his  rejuvenation. If he could come back and spend a day or two days or a  week, you just saw a different lilt in his step and a different attitude. We  were going   I don   t remember where we were going, but we were  talking about it, and I said,    Can you describe what it is?    And he said,     It   s values, it   s culture, it   s communication, it   s a whole variety of  things that in rural Oklahoma and in rural America, there are different  sets of norms, mores, et cetera, that are those basic elements of kindness,  of cooperation, of working together, of having different opinions, but  being able to share those opinions with others and agree to disagree, a  whole variety of things.    He always had a new burst of energy after he  had been home.  When he came back to Oklahoma in    80, the end of 1980,    81, he spent a  lot of time doing something that most people don   t have any idea that he  did, and that is that he taught at OSU and OU and at TU. And they were  seminar courses. He loved OSU. His blood was orange. It was red, but it  had to be because he liked OU, too, but it was kind of a mixture. But I  can   t tell you how many times   and I was spending a lot of time in  21  Washington at that time   that I ran into him in D.C., between 1981 and  when he decided to run in 1986,    85-   86.  There was a period of time at the end of George Nigh   s term when the  Department of Human Services was in terrible shape, and he came in  and helped get the Department of Human Services back on a steadier  track than it was on. Also during that time he used his connections, and  continued to do this even after he was governor the second time, to get  grants for schools, to get programs funded for schools, mainly OSU, but  also for OU and for TU, and for smaller colleges in the state. He used  that common, quiet way that he went about doing things. I will tell you,  when my phone rang, and I answered the phone, and he   d say,    Lee?     I   d say,    Yes?       This is Henry,    of course, I knew who it was.    I   ve got  a little something I need to talk to you about.     When it was a little something, I knew that I was in for it. (Laughs) I  was going to have to get involved in whatever it was. It was always  something I loved. It was always something that was really interesting  and that was worthwhile. And you never stopped working for him. You  just didn   t. It just didn   t work that way. Several times during that period,  he would say,    I   m going to Washington so and so, and so and so.    And  Ann  Bellmon   s daughter  was living in Washington, or in the  Washington area at that time. So he   d go up there and spend the week  staying at Ann   s house, and he   d ride the train back and forth. She lived  out in Maryland, and he   d ride the train back and forth into D.C., and he  would go to the various agencies that he needed to see for a particular  thing.  Conversion of switch grass to bio-fuel was a project that he   s worked on  for years. Another project is geothermal heat pumps. And he got   now,  lots of money? I don   t know how much money, but I know in some  cases it was millions and millions of dollars, in other cases it was  hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in some cases it was only  thousands of dollars, but he got grants for people who were working on  projects that he really thought had some merit. One of the projects he  worked on during that period from    81 to when he was governor the  second time was a project   when he was governor, he said,    We spent  thousands and thousands and millions of dollars on sand and salt.    He  said,    I was talking to so and so at OSU    and I said,    Why can   t we  build some kind of bridge heating system?       He helped them get some  money, and they built one. They built it at one of the engineering test  centers, and then they put it on a bridge on I-40   and it worked. It was  solar powered. It had a battery and the solar   when the temperature got  down to a certain level, it would kick this heating system on. It would  heat the water, and the water would flow underneath the bridge, and it  would keep the bridge from freezing over.  22  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Will it ever be commercial? Probably won   t, but it was a great idea,  great entrepreneurial idea. He worked with the Ag people on bio-digester  systems, much of which is still in the process of being  developed and the same with ground-source heat pumps. He was really,  really intrigued by that technology and that kind of approach. People  don   t know that he would plod around to the various places, and he   d go  talk to Senator So and So, who was the chairman of the committee, and  he would get half a million dollars here and a million dollars there. As  Everett Dirksen used to say,    A million dollars here, a million dollars  there. Pretty soon you   ve got a lot of money.    There   s no telling how  much money he got for OSU. He never wanted the recognition and  probably would be embarrassed that his name   s on a building right now.  (Laughs) But anyway, those are the kinds of things that I think are those  hidden jewels that people will really   if they knew, they would say to  themselves,    Oh, my goodness  I can   t believe that that   s where that  originated from   that   s where that idea came from. That   s where  that      not necessarily the idea, but that   s where the spark came to make  that idea a reality. That   s what I really admired about him was he was  always an entrepreneur. He was always inventing. He was always  thinking further down the pike than I ever thought about. But I think I  have some of that in me by emulating how he thought. (Laughs)  By chauffeuring him so much.  Yes, by chauffeuring, right. (Laughter) Chauffeuring him was priceless.  It was absolutely priceless. It was a pain in the neck sometimes because  you   d be at three o   clock in the morning, and he didn   t want to come to  my house. He wanted to go to the farm, and I   d have to take him another  150 miles over to the farm. But that   s all right.  Would you spend the night there or come on back?  It depended. If we had to go the next morning, I   d usually spend the  night. But normally, I didn   t have clothes or anything so it was a  situation where I might meet him at the McDonald   s on the turnpike,  which was kind of halfway in between, then we   d go where we needed  to go the next day.  Do you have any stories to tell about his wardrobe?  Yes, I have a funny story. He always was extremely presentable, and he  never wanted to   clothing-wise, he never wanted to stand out. As you  know, you   ve heard the tux stories, where he never wore a tux when he  was governor the first time. The staff got him a tux when he was in the  Senate, and the reason we did is he stopped going to White House  23  things. And he was, literally, invited to every White House event, formal  event. After about the second time, he wouldn   t go. It was because  everybody was dressed formally, and he wasn   t, and he felt out of place.  So the story I   m going to tell you is kind of along that line.  When we first went to Washington, we shared an office with Ted  Stevens. We didn   t physically share the office. There was a division  between the two. It was a huge office that was held by a United States  senator from California before, and they literally split it in half and gave  half to Stevens and half to us. Then we moved over to what is now  called the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The building that we were in  when we shared the office with Stevens was called the old Senate Office  Building, and that was called the new Senate Office Building. They  named it the Dirksen building and named the old Senate Office Building  the Russell building. And then they built a third building behind it, but  that was under construction all the time I was there. He never had an  office in that building.  Anyway, my office in the Dirksen building was a doorway. It was the  hall of a doorway, and my desk was shoved up against the door so that  you couldn   t open the door. Then there was a closet that was a storage  closet, the paper and office supplies and stuff were in there. It was right  by my desk. So he came through the office, he came back to my desk,  and he said,    I need you to take me home.    You don   t ask why. I said,     Okay. Can you let me finish so and so?       Yes, holler at me when  you   re ready.    So I go in, and I say,    Can we go now?       Yes.    So we go  downstairs, we get in the car, he goes sound asleep. It   s like eight-fifteen  in the morning. At that time, they were living out in northern Virginia, in  Fairfax, and it was about a forty-five minute ride. He sleeps the whole  way, and we get to the house, I pull in the driveway. I said,    Do you  need help?       No,    he said,    Just stay here. I   ll be back in a minute.    He  was probably gone three minutes and comes back and gets in the car,  and we start back in, and he goes back to sleep.  We get into traffic in D.C., itself, and he wakes up and he said,    You  wondering why I went home?    I said,    Well, I am a little bit curious.        Well, I don   t like to wake Shirley up in the morning so I get dressed in  the closet. I put brown shoes on with a blue suit, and you don   t wear  brown shoes with a blue suit. I had to go change my shoes.    I said,     Okay.    Nothing else was ever said about it. (Laughs) But that just  shows you how he was so concerned about the way he looked and the  way he presented himself. He was always that way. He was always that  way.  The first time he ever put a tux on, Carol and I were still dating. Part of  Carol   s job was   you cannot imagine the massive amount of mail that a  24  Finchum  Paden  U.S. senator gets in a day. Furthermore, you cannot imagine having to  answer it all. About three-quarters is answered with what are called form  letters. They cover the subject matter. If you wrote about the Resource  Recovery Act, it would be a form letter that would answer you. It  wouldn   t answer any of the things that you put in your letter, but it  would   just was a general answer that    It   s pending in the Senate, and  I   m looking at it, and I appreciate your remarks, so and so, and so and  so. Sincerely, Henry Bellmon.    Part of Carol   s job was to run these  robo-machines  that typed the letters . What you had to do is you had to  go down in the basement of the Senate Office Building, and you used a  machine that punched out a paper tape that had the letter in it. And then  you did the same thing with all the addresses, you punched out the  addresses. And it would type the letter, and it would shift the letter over  to a machine that signed the letter. He had signed something, and they  had taken that and put it on this thing, and it would trace the signature  onto the letter.  The machines were old, and they broke down all the time, and the tape  would break and that sort of thing. So Carol and I were going  somewhere and she said,    I   ve got 100 letters that have to get out  tomorrow and if that machine breaks down, I   m in real trouble. Let   s run  up there and see if it   s doing okay.    So we go down, the thing was  working fine. I said,    I   ve forgotten something,    so I go upstairs, and  she is rumbling around in her desk, and I   m back in my desk. And he  sticks his head out the door   it scared her to death. (Laughs) He said,     Carol, can you help me a minute?    She said,    Yes.    He said,    I can   t  get this tie on.    He was putting his tux on for the first time, and he  couldn   t get the tie to fasten, and so she fastened it for him. He said,    I  don   t want anyone to know that I   m wearing this tux.    She said,    Well,  Senator, we got it for you so you could go.    He said,    I know, but I  don   t want a big deal made out of it.    She said,    Okay.     So she didn   t tell me, and we are coming out of the office, and he   s  coming out of his side door of his office, and he   s got a tux on. I   m  going,    Oh, my God     (Laughs) She jabs me in the ribs, which was a     as wives can do, they can teach you not to react. We go down, we get in  the car, I said,    He had a tux on     She said,    Don   t you say a word.  Don   t you say a word to anybody about it.    And it was another three or  four weeks before anyone knew that he had worn a tux or that he was  wearing a tux. And he had gone to two different events in between and  worn it. (Laughs) That was just the way he worked, and the way he liked  to do things. Just a marvelous individual.  Interesting that he got dressed in the closet.  Well, no, he was in his office.  25  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  No, but from waking his wife up.  Oh, yes, yes. As far away as they lived, they would leave at like five-thirty  or six in the morning, because you had to go by all the traffic to  get in. From where he lived, it probably was an hour and thirty minutes,  because we lived ten miles from the Capitol, exactly ten miles from my  front door to where I parked. On a good day, it was forty-five minutes.  Normally, it was an hour to an hour and ten minutes. You had to go right  by the Pentagon. You had to go by all those seven or eight thousand  people at work there, some of whom were leaving, some of whom were  coming. That was an experience. That was just a major experience.  Were you surprised when he came back and after a few years, he  decided to run for governor? Do you know how that decision came  about?  He had been talking about it. He   d talked to other people about it, and it  just turned out to be that it was time for him to do it. The state needed  him. George Nigh had gone through a couple of terms where he had no  problems at all, and then we got into some budget problems in the latter  part of Nigh   s final term. And the state just needed some leadership, and  so he ran.  Was it a hard campaign?  I don   t think it was a hard campaign. It was a tedious campaign. Any  statewide campaign is difficult, because you   ve got to go to as many  places as you can. You   ve got to see as many people as you can. But I  think the issues were really issues that were in his favor. The fact that he  had done a good job as governor before, he had made some unpopular  decisions when he was in the Senate, but time heals things, and time had  pretty much healed those wounds, if they were actually wounds. They  were more   I don   t even know what word to use, but they were not  major life changing issues.  Were you helping with that campaign?  We did. My wife worked, and my kids worked, and I worked when I  wasn   t working my regular job. I didn   t drive him. He did stay a time or  two with us, but by that time we had two kids, and we didn   t have the   room . We had a pullout bed and I think after the second time, he  decided that pullout bed wasn   t the way he wanted to relax. (Laughs)  But, anyway, we had a great experience working in that campaign,  because my kids had never been involved in a political campaign before.  And Matt was like ten, and Jenny was like six   seven, maybe. It was  26  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  fun for them, and they loved it. Out of that, I probably have one regret,  and it   s not really a regret, because I made the decision based on what  was best for my family and for me. He wanted me to come work in the  administration, and I decided that my career was at a point where I  needed to continue to do what I was doing. So I just told him,    I   ll do  anything you want me to do, but I need to stay where I am.    Six months  later, he appointed me to the health board, and I worked with him on  those projects all the time he was governor. Worked with him on 1017  and other issues where he would call and say,    Who do you know? How  do you approach this person, that person?    But he was a good people  person. He needed a lot of information. (Laughs)  Do you have any stories to tell about the Bellmon Belles?  The Bellmon Belles    I guess the best way to answer is no, not really.  They were a great help in every campaign, because they did a lot of the  grunt work that has to be done. Stuffing envelopes, making telephone  calls, helping organize everything from afternoon tea parties to major  campaign events and     And they would wear these costumes just to the campaign?  A lot of them wore them to the office, because in every campaign, there  was a campaign office. And there were people who were there, and there  were people doing phoning, and a lot of people would wear them to that.  And then they would go to the grocery store in them. But the big thing  was to wear them to an event of one kind or another.  When he was preparing for events, did you help with speeches or did he  do that himself?  Normally, what would happen is   like, in D.C. I did a lot of speech  writing for him, as did others. You would write something, he would tell  you what he wanted in it, and then you would write it, and then he would  un-write it and give it back to you. (Laughs) And then you   d write it  again, and then he would edit that. He never considered himself a major  orator, but got to the point where it was bullet points rather than  narrative, because he knew what he wanted to say about the various  things. He did a lot of his own. He would kind of stretch it out on a  three-by-five card.  And go off-script? (Laughs)  Yes, he   d make his points.  Were you with him during the last governorship watch party?  27  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Yes. Yes. I   m not a big watch party person, but my kids wanted to be  there, and he wanted us to be there. So we went to the one here in Tulsa.  In    74, when he was re-elected, we went to the one that was here and  then went to the one in Oklahoma City and did the same thing when he  was elected to the Senate the first time. Those were fun. They were  crazy, but they were fun.  A lot of excitement. What about the swearing in days? Were you there  for those?  Yes, went to those kinds of things because, usually, you were working it.  You were there for a purpose. People felt so comfortable talking to him.  And it didn   t make any difference whether you were the head of Phillips  Petroleum or you were on welfare in Gotebo, people still felt  comfortable talking about their problems, their achievements, their  goals, their objectives, just a whole variety of things. One of the things  you learned when you traveled with a person like that is that there are  ways to interrupt the conversation and move along. And you know  you   re going to get stopped down the way.  When Frank Keating was elected, he  Bellmon  was just beginning to  have major problems with Parkinson   s. After the inaugural event, Carol  and I went in the capitol. Shirley and Henry were over where the statues  of the heads of the governors are, and he was just surrounded by tons of  people, and they were all talking to him and everything. Shirley said,     We   ve got to get him out of here.    So I just went over just like I   d done  a million times and took him by the elbow and said,    Governor, we need  to go up here, because we   ve got to do some stuff up on the third floor,     which was not where we were going. We were getting out of the capitol.  He said,    Okay,    and he was telling people. As we were walking out,  people were talking to him and   I mean, it was all normal, but he just  was not doing well, and he needed to get out of there so we got him out.  That   s the first time I really realized how that illness was going to have  an impact on him, because then his gait slowed. His mind never slowed,  and his ability to communicate never slowed, but he couldn   t walk as far  as he used to, and he couldn   t write as well as he once could, and it just  was debilitating. But he still would call and say,    I   ve got an idea. I   ve  got a little thing I want you to do.    And you were always going to do it.  You were always going to be there, because I wouldn   t have been where  I was if it hadn   t have been for the time I spent learning from him. I   m  not saying that I didn   t contribute to my own success. I did, but I did it  based on the fact that I had a great underpinning and a great learning  experience when I worked for him and then from every encounter I had  with him after that. I probably saw him mad two or three times   really  28  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  mad, really angry. And in all three instances, he had every right to be  angry, but he demonstrated that anger in a way I wish I could  demonstrate anger. That was that in one instance he told someone,    You  are absolutely wrong to do that.    That   s the one I remember that   s in my  mind. That was about as harsh a thing as he could say. (Laughs)  Was his voice raised?  Oh, yes. It wasn   t shouting, but it was very demonstrative. You could  tell that he was very, very upset.  Not directed at you?  No. No. (Laughter) Let me tell you, I was a mouse on that deal.  (Laughter) One of my jobs, when I worked in the Senate was when we  went into committee hearings, he would go to sleep. And I would sit in a  chair   he was in a chair like that. (Gestures) I   d sit behind him, and it   s  got a cross bar on the bottom. If I saw him kind of nodding off, I   d kick  the chair to keep him awake. (Laughs) And I didn   t do a very good job.  He was fun to work for. He was really fun to work for and fun to work  with because he always had a sense of humor, and it was always just this  subtle, wonderful way that he went about phrasing things and dealing  with issues and stuff. It was great. It was great.  What were a few things he would do for fun? We talked a lot about  work.  As I told you, he loved the farm. He loved to be on the tractor. He liked  to do things like fish. He loved to hunt. He would quail hunt and  pheasant hunt and chucker hunt. He hunted antelope. Probably, if he had  a hobby at all hunting was a major, major hobby. Mrs. Bellmon liked to  do that, too, and so those were things they could do together. A lot of  their friends were based on those kinds of relationships. Lots of friends  based on church, lots of friends based on like interests, hunting,  fishing   didn   t fish as much as he hunted, though.  Just a very interesting man.  Yes, yes, great family man. Loved his children, loved his wife, would do  anything for all of them. I mean, he just was totally dedicated to that. I  think part of not running again for the Senate was Shirley was never  really happy up there. There were lots of things she liked, but she   d  rather be at home, too. You asked about things that you don   t commonly  know about Senator Bellmon and Governor Bellmon. I told you that  things he   s done for Oklahoma are things that I don   t think a lot of  people know about. The OSU grants, the OU grants, the connections that  29  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  Finchum  Paden  he had with a variety of different people, and the ability to get them  involved in issues that relate to Oklahoma are things that I don   t think  people knew about, nor did he necessarily want them to know about. But  that was a way that he could help, and he did that often.  If you could capture his essence, what would one or two words be? And  that may be hard question to answer.  I   ve thought about that a bunch. I know this sounds silly, but common is  probably as good a word as I could think of, because he was a person  who could relate to anybody. He could relate to someone who was the  president of the United States, a world leader, he could relate to a  governor, he could relate to the head of a company, but he could also  relate to the retired individual who was living on a fixed income and  who was really having a hard time making it. He could relate to  someone who was handicapped, he could relate to somebody who was  the best athlete in the world, and he could relate to someone who  couldn   t hit a ball if they had to   kind of like me. (Laughs) He was on  the same level as all of those people. And that   s something I would give  a gazillion dollars to be able to do. I think I can do some of it, but some  of it isn   t as easy as others. He always seemed to be at ease with  whoever he was talking to and whatever issue he was dealing with when  he was in a conversation with those people.  And he knew when to hunker down, huh? (Laughs)  And he knew when to hunker down. And then the other word is that he  had an element of creativity that I can   t even begin to explain to you.  How his mind worked and how his thought process worked today, but it  also looked forward. Not until the end of the week or the end of the  month, but he saw things and had visions of things   and vision is  probably a better word than being creative. He had vision. He had vision  for his family, he had vision for Oklahoma, he had vision for the  country, he had vision for peace in the world, he had vision for the need  to share food, to share natural resources, to share clean air and clean  water. So those two elements, I think, probably, in my mind, capture  what he was really all about. He was a great guy to work for, but he was  a better guy to work with. And I was so lucky   I have been so lucky in  my lifetime to have had that opportunity, to have the experience of being  around him, number one, but to also have the learning experience that I  will never lose. And then to be able to say that that   s a guy that I really,  really admired and loved.  That   s a good way to end, isn   t it?  It is.  30  Finchum  Paden  Thank you for sharing some memories.
