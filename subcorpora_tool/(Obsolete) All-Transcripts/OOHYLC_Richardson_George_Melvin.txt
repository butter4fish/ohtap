 Finchum  Richardson  Today is September 29, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Oklahoma City to talk with George Melvin Richardson. I   m not sure  what you go by, George or Melvin. Thank you for having us today. Let   s  start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  My name is George Melvin Richardson, Holdenville, Oklahoma.  And when were you born?  I was born March 1, 1913.  And what did your parents do for a living?  My father always thought of himself as being a teacher. My mother was  a seamstress, and I guess at that time we supplemented our income by  picking cotton. (Laughs)  Okay and how many brothers and sisters did you have?  Altogether eight. Three died early in Texas, and then four were born in  Grayson, Oklahoma. I   m the last one born, number eight, in Holdenville,  Oklahoma.  So you were the baby.  Oh yes. (Laughter)  And you grew up on a farm?  No, I lived in town, but I worked a lot on a farm.  5  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Okay. What were some of your chores?  Pardon?  Some of your chores? What did you have to do for chores?  For toys? I didn   t have me those things. (Laughs)  Did you have any chores?  Toys?  Chores.  Oh, yes. I first grew up by riding the sacks, cotton sacks. Got old  enough, I started picking cotton, and I did that until I got a job, later on,  shining shoes at a used clothes store. Then I had a newspaper route, and  I left that and went to shining shoes, running the elevator, and mopping  the floor in the hallway of a drugstore. (Laughs)  In Holdenville?  No, different places. Holdenville   I was too young to do much, I was  about four or five years old when I left Holdenville.  And where did you go from there?  To Okmulgee.  Was your father still farming?  My father didn   t do much farming. He worked with us picking cotton,  during the break   at that time most of the black schools operated on a  split term, especially in the rural areas. During that time he would work  with us picking cotton, but he had to go to school every year to maintain  his certificate. Black schools were eight months, but had a split term.  Now the farmers would tell us when to close the schools. They   d let us  pick cotton. Then they   d tell us when they finished and then we could go  back and finish the eight months.  So where did you go to first grade?  My first grade was at Holdenville.  And then after that?  6  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Okmulgee and after that I went all over Okmulgee County going to  school. My dad only finished eighth grade; he got an eighth grade  certificate, when he went to regular college. He wanted to be a teacher,  so he tried to do that. In Holdenville, my brother Theo was older than I  was and I think perhaps I was so much trouble for my mother when my  brother left, she sent me to school with him, because I used to do a lot of  stupid things to kind of make her angry I guess. (Laughs) If she   d spank  me I   d stop crying. When she   d spank me I   d stop crying, I wouldn   t  cry. I stopped myself crying. I started crying so she couldn   t get very  long because she didn   t want to beat you too much. When she   d stop  whipping this finger I started crying. (Laughs)  Sounds like you were a handful.  I was, so she just gave it to the teachers. (Laughter)  Well how would you get to school?  I would get to school   now when I lived in Okmulgee and my dad got a  job three miles from Okmulgee, we   d walk every day, and after he lost  that job, they assigned him to a school on the other side of Beggs, which  is about twelve miles. We rode the train between Okmulgee and Beggs  until I got old enough for paying full fare. My father said I was a certain  age and the conductor said,    If he   s that age he   ll be a whopper when he  gets grown.    (Laughs) So we stopped riding the train, we started  walking and hitchhiking between that and where my father worked.  He   d stay in all these places about one or two years, and my brother he  was the only schoolmate I had. I knew very few of those people, one  year, you see, at a time and get transferred and so altogether I guess  about nine or ten different schools before I finished high school.  And where did you finish?  I finished at Langston High School, Langston University High School.  (Laughs)  How did you end up there?  Well what happened, I had a paper route and I had to get up early in the  morning at seven o   clock to go to the paper place and get newspapers,  and I walked about a mile before I got to my route. Sometimes I   d get  there late and so forth, so some teachers didn   t like that. So I got some  poor grades, and I didn   t finish on time, and my brother didn   t finish on  time. He said,    I   m not going to Dunbar anymore,    and my mother  didn   t want us to stop going to high school so she talked with him. He  7  said,    No, I   m not going.    If he isn   t going, I wasn   t going either. So she  had a brother in Langston; she went to Langston to talk with him. He  said he would let us stay at his house for our senior class.  We stayed there and a friend of ours joined us, three of us there at that  time. They   d just planned for two. His wife didn   t like that too well so  one day my brother got mad and said,    We   re going home.    That   s ten  miles from where we were, to Langston. We had a man that knew us  pretty well so he drove us to Perkins Corner. He didn   t have enough gas  so we got out and started hitchhiking. (Laughs) We walked until dark  and hit a little town   Cushing, I think it was. We didn   t know what to  do and so my brother was a good talker. So the three of us were walking.  We saw a gymnasium lighted up and they were playing basketball. So I  asked them where the hotel was, they told us. I think altogether we had  about five dollars. (Laughs)  He said,    Now Rick, you talk better than we do. You go over there and  say,    Got a room?    and then we   ll come by and stay with you.    So he did  that, and he went to the place and knocked on the door, and he said,     You want to stay overnight?    and he said,    Yes.    He got the room so  then Paul and I knocked on the door.    I heard that a young man traveling  stopped here at the hotel.       Yes.       We want to talk to him.    So he came  out,    What you boys doing here?    (Laughs)    Oh, we   re traveling and           Got a place to stay?       No.       You can stay in my room.    So we went up  to the room to sleep, and I guess by the time I got in bed she sent the  little boy upstairs and said,    My mother said the other two boys were  going to have to pay the money.    So my brother got kind of angry with  that,    Now that   s my room.    (Laughs) She said,    Wait until my husband  comes,    and they had a daughter at Langston, too, at that time. He came  and my brother   s       You got a daughter there?       Yes.       I know her     It  got very friendly and he said,    You boys stay overnight.       Wake us up  the next morning because we got a long ways to go.    He woke up us  about six o   clock and we started walking again. We walked all day,  because we didn   t get many rides. Got to Okmulgee, I guess we were  real tired and all that because it was almost dark, ended our trip.  My mother, I don   t know how she did, but she went back to Langston  and found another place for us. So all three of us got to Miss Howard   s  place and stayed there and finished high school. At that time my sister,  older sister, had graduated high school about four or five years earlier.  She went to school one year and she taught the next year. While she was  going to school my father arranged for us to have   this man had a  cotton patch and needed a little help, three acres if we   d do some work  for him. We did that to keep my sister in school. So I got there, and  stayed at Langston four years. We both got jobs and didn   t have to pay  anything. Doing pretty well in the dining hall serving, and waiters I  8  guess. My brother had a high temper, so he got in an argument with the  man over the dining hall so they fired him. Rick didn   t have a place to  go, so he went home. (Laughs)  About two or three months from there   I knew Dr. Young. We had a  quartet and you   d do it with him, singing from time to time. I said,    Dr.  Young, my brother was sent home out of school. We were in the same  class. He   s two years older and I don   t want to finish college before he  does. I want to go home and my brother come here.    He said,    Okay,  you really mean that?    I said,    Yes.    I called, he went home and that   s  where he got a job working on a farm picking potatoes. (Laughs) So he  went home and I stayed, and that threw us back a little bit so we didn   t  finish on time, but we finished the next year. That   s where I met my first  wife, she was a senior that first year, but she got engaged. I had little  girlfriends. I didn   t keep a girlfriend a long time because I didn   t have  money. (Laughs) Especially around Christmas I didn   t. (Laughter) She  got engaged and we finished high school.  I don   t know, at that time education didn   t seem very important. My dad  was a teacher, he taught eight months and now that blacks had grocery  stores, they probably didn   t finish high school. He had to go there and  get groceries while he was in school. So those who had finished one  grade and started teaching, they had to get help every year or so. I didn   t  see much difference in going to school or not going to school. When I  got out, finished, my father was principal of Bald Hill and he retired and  my older sister became principal of Bald Hill. My brother got to teach at  Bald Hill. In the meantime he got a job being principal at Purcell, just  out of college, Purcell. That left a vacancy so I took that vacancy, and it  was twenty miles to Okmulgee. I needed transportation so I was friends  with the Huisman place, Temple and Huisman place, looking at cars and  the guy came out there.    You want to buy one?       No,    I said,    I don   t  want to be billed a car, got so many miles to go.    He said,    I   ll tell you  the manager up the line bought a Terraplane and she didn   t want it. It   s  almost new. What about that?    I talked with the manager. I said,    Now,  I don   t have a job now, but I   ll have a job in about six months   six  weeks. I   ll pay my down payment then.    He let me have the car.  (Laughs) I just had the Terraplane to go back and forth to school.  On the way to that school I said,    Now Jane you know I   m the youngest  of the family. I   ve never been around kids before and you   re a principal.  I don   t want those small kids. I don   t know what to do with them.        Well, Melvin you know how many times I hear that?    I said,    Jane, if  you announce me as primary teacher I   m going back home.       You mean  that?       Yes. If you do that, I   m getting in my car, I   m going back  home.    We got there and she did announce that I was principal. I  became principal and stayed there two or three years and she enjoyed  9  working with me. We ran a little course; we went to Okmulgee  singing   got pretty popular.  Finally, my brother was principal at Purcell. He always thought I should  be doing the same thing he was doing so he said,    Melvin, you don   t  belong in the country, you need to go to some of these little towns.    I  checked one or two places. Then finally, he was at Purcell, there was a  vacancy at Pauls Valley, about eight miles apart. It paid nine months and  I was getting eight months and he was getting a salary, but they   re  paying more than he got in Purcell. He wanted me to be in a little town  so he said,    Melvin, I want you to have that job.    We went there and  first the superintendent said,    Well I   m not going to hire a single  person.    He said,    The principal now had a lot of trouble, single man, so  I   m not going to have       We talked and went by one or two times.  Finally, I went to Langston and someone said the job had been filled. So  Rick and I both went to the super intendant   s  office. He wasn   t there,  but the secretary was there. He said,    Who got the job?    He said,    You  got the job     I said,    I did?    He said,    We sent a telegram to your  home.    I called Jane. She said,    Yeah, you got a telegram.    We went up  to the little school, it had three rooms. The custodian was cleaning the  building,    What you boys doing in this building?    (Laughs) Rick said,     He   s your principal.    So I stayed there one year.  Oline had been engaged about eight years at that time. But what  happened before then, we started seeing each other, going to shows and  so forth. We   d never call it being in love with each other, none of that.  Finally, I was going to take her to the dance. She was staying in Beggs   Oklahoma . I was going to meet her and go to the dance and she agreed  to that. I got in my car and drove to Beggs and got there and said,    Well  Oline   s not here. She   s gone to the dance with her fianc  .    I said,     What?    I started not to go to the dance. So I said,    I   m going anyways.     I went there and there she was with this fellow. The little girl from  Oklahoma City didn   t have an escort, so I danced that whole dance with  her. (Laughs) I don   t know who brought her there. I guess we didn   t talk  very much, I was watching what they were doing. So that was the end of  our little talking together.  I decided to try to be principal at Holdenville   my brother with me. I  told him, I said,    Rick,    he said,    Melvin, you go to Holdenville. That   s  a pretty good sized school, you have to be married.    I said,    Yes, I  believe I can marry Oline.    He said,    Yeah? You   re a fool if you don   t.     So I didn   t go to Holdenville, I went to Langston and talked with her and  she said,    Melvin, I gave Gully his rings that night.       You did?    She  said,    Will you marry me?    (Laughs) I said,    Yes, give me a year.     (Laughs) She agreed.  10  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  She asked you?  What?  She asked you?  No. I said,    Give me a year.    (Laughs)  Okay  But it took you eight years to get her?  No, she was engaged eight years.  Oh, engaged eight years. Okay.  They broke up that night   went to that party.  Ah.  I was invited to my brother   s school to talk, do a little exercise   drove  that Terraplane there. He sent someone there in the car to get some  people to bring back to the building. The car didn   t run. There I was. So  Rick said,    I think I know the people downtown,    so we went downtown  and took my brother. They had Pontiacs, so he let me have a Pontiac. I  called Oline at the time and said,    Well, let   s get married.    I said,    I   ll  be by to pick you up.    She was at Langston again so I went there and got  her. Rick was at Purcell, I was at Pauls Valley and I had been to Verron  one time with a person, so I didn   t have money and I was going to take  on a wife. Got gasoline at a place where I always got gas. I ate at a  certain place in Pauls Valley, so I got food.  On the way to Texas, I saw a sign saying...now my wife   the contract  was if you get married, you got fired. Some boys got married and then  would hide it, that type of thing. I didn   t want to do that. I put it in the  paper so I didn   t have to worry about a job then. So I was kind of  looking for a job on the way down and I saw a sign.  I said ,    Let   s go  by there.    Where we went is Gene Autry  Oklahoma  now. Talked to the  superintendent and tried to get a job with my wife. We talked a while.  He said,    Come have dinner with us      That   s the first time that   s ever happened in my life, having dinner with  white people, all that time. We went there and having dinner, he said,     Young man, where   d you get your job?    I said,    I   m principal at Pauls  Valley.       I want you to be principal here.    I said,    Well, I haven   t heard  about a vacancy.    We went on down across the river, and a big storm  11  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  became a blessing because we were looking around, so a doctor was in  his yard doing something. We told him we just got married and were  looking for a place. He said,    You can stay in this place.    So he gave us  a place to stay. (Laughs) We stayed there and later on I went by there  and talked to the superintendent. He said,    Now, we still want you to  come here.    I said,    I haven   t heard too much about it.    I said,    Well,  I   ve only been in Pauls Valley one year.    I thought it was unfair to do  that. I took a friend of mine to get the job with him. He said,    No, I   m  not going to hire anyone for three weeks.     So in the meantime I went to Langston and talked to one of my  professors and told him I had been offered this job. He goes,    Melvin,  they   ll get a new principal at Pauls Valley, but you may never get  another job as a principal in an elementary school or high school.    I  thought about that so I went back. The job   s open for a week, so we got  married as teachers. All utilities paid. Stayed there two years and got  drafted, went to the Army. Stayed in the Army for three years.  So what year did you get married?  Nineteen forty.  In 1940. And what year did you graduate high school?  Nineteen thirty.  Okay, and what did you do in the Army?  Well I was at Fort Sill, got a little quartet thing and I got kind of pleased  with that. Kind of wanted to stay there and so we had this exercise and  got a picture of about 120 fellows all lined up doing these kind of things.  The captain came and said,    Come down here,    so I went down there.  He said,    You qualify for OCS  Officer Candidate School . I   d like you  to go to take this thirty-day training. If you pass that you then could  qualify to go to Fort Sill. It   d be like going back home.    I did that and I  got there and they had a group going to Fort Sill so I ate with the group.  They had the porters coming through and they said,    Are you the cook?     (Laughs) I said,    No.    We kept going and so we went there.  One thing the commanding officer at Fort Sill   now, we forget about  the thing about being praised and all that. Everybody   s the same way.  We had thirty-two men in the group, but we had six in each little hut,  they called it. I stayed there with them. They had five whites and I was  their sixth person. One or two of the boys was Deep South. They   re  sitting on the bed. They didn   t go to bed. I didn   t either for a while. Then  I thought,    Not my problem.    So I went to sleep. Later on   I hadn   t been  12  very well in high school or college so I was wondering about being in  OCS with these Duke University  graduates . I had heard about it, it  being a university and I was a Langston  graduate . Langston was a  normal school at that time. It wasn   t a four-year college. I went to the  general and told him that I   m in this and I   d only been in the Army a few  months since the OCS and I   d like to be put down to the grays. He said,     No. I can   t do that.    He said,    Now I   ll tell you what, you turn around  and go back there and if you make bad grades, you   ll fail. Then they   ll  send you back home, back to your outfit.     I went back and I did finish on time. That   s my Army experience. Now  at OCS I got along very well with those guys. They had cut periods,  twice, during that time. They had all thirty-two names on there and your  name. You had to get an adjective to describe everybody on that list. I  thought maybe   I was the only black in that group at that time. Had  thirty-two and I was the only one. I kind of thought I   d be the last one.  Some came and wanted me to go against somebody and I said,    No. I  can   t do that.    I did graduate on time. Then when I finished, they had no  place to send me because the Army wasn   t integrated.  I was around there doing nothing for a while. Black officers, strangely,  they had about five or six black officers doing nothing. They organized  what they called the Second Regimen. We were to transport the soldiers  from the barracks to the firing range. After we went to that we went  there to see the person in charge, the colonel. He called me out and said  he wanted me to be adjutant. I didn   t know what it meant because I   d  been there such a short time so I said,    I   ll accept that.    So I stayed there  about a year, and I was promoted to first lieutenant.  In that time the black people were trying to get blacks into fighting, into  action. I said,    Now, what I   m doing won   t get any action.    I wanted to  do something so I could say I   ve done something for my country. There  was one black infantry division, 92nd. I went there and talked with the        Will they accept me?    Well, they take unassigned. I couldn   t be  promoted but would have all the responsibility of everybody else. So I  went there and stayed and took action. All the things they did I had to do  the same thing, but I couldn   t be promoted.  When Truman became president he integrated the Army so I was sent  then to a white outfit at that time and I stayed in. My sister was ill a long  time. I decided I wanted to retire and do something else, so I   d stay out  one year and then I decide what to do. I decided to go back to either the  Army, go into business, or teach. My wife had saved all my money  while I was in the Army, in the bank. She was teaching also, she put her  money in the bank. I had a pretty good little pile of money.  13  Now, when I was at Langston, my senior year we changed presidents  and Ms. Sandra didn   t get me a job. Rick didn   t have a job either, so we  had to do little things, pick cotton to stay in, and did it to finish. He was  president   they changed then and elected somebody else and he was  doing pretty good. He was buying this and doing this kind of thing, I  thought he was really doing some business. He had one party walked out  on him and I heard about that. I came here and asked if I could go and he  did and I paid a little money and got 10 percent or 20 percent and so I  worked at that.  Or whatever, I had three job  options : stay in the army, teach, or  business. I decide then to go into teaching. I got job here at Luther. I  stayed there four years, and then one time I had a theater here in  Oklahoma City and they didn   t have one in Luther. One of the board  members, who owned this theater, asked me to come down and talk  about it. They said,    Now if you operate it without the whole population,  it perhaps won   t work.    Well it opened for whites only and went on. So  they called me over one day, they said,    Mr. Richardson we would like  for you to advertise   ,       I   m not here in business, I   m here in  education.    Said,    Now we   re going to open it and want blacks to come  on Tuesdays and Thursdays.    We had that and my team had a good year  and we had a banquet for everyone.  The coach didn   t know about that, he had had it on Tuesday.  Superintendent called me,    Mr. Richardson, I understand you have a  banquet on Tuesday.    I said,    Yes.       Well the board told me to tell you  that if you don   t move it, you won   t be here next year.    I said,    What?        If you don   t move it, you won   t be here next year.    My wife was home,  she was ill at that time. I said,    We won   t be here next year.    She said  why and I told her and we agreed, so we told him. When the contract  came out he called me and said,    The contracts are ready.    I went there  to get the contract.    Well a lot of teachers are rehired, but boy you  weren   t.    I said,    What?    He said,    You weren   t.    So,    What  happened?       Well think about it.    I went to the president of the board  and talked      We decided not to tell you.    I said,    You know, I   m  business. If I go to another school I   ve got to have a recommendation.        You   ll do okay, but we don   t have to tell you.     I was surprised. I moved, we were living in Luther, so we moved that  next day to Oklahoma City   all our funds and everything. My wife   s  from Wynnewood, so we went to Wynnewood and stayed but our  furniture was in Oklahoma City. Some of the white business people in  Luther came all the way from Luther to ask me why I got fired. I didn   t  want to tell them because rumors would get around. They   d say,    Mr.  Richardson did this,    and I didn   t tell them why. Later on we had a  meeting at school, PTA meeting. I told the parents what happened and  14  Finchum  Richardson  they said,    We   ve got to do something about it.    While we were there  the custodian came and said,    Mr. Richardson, I   ll see you in the  hallway.    I went out there,    Mr. Lovell committed suicide.    I said,     What?    I didn   t know what it meant to me. I had a little gun training  from being an officer so I got a little gun. We left immediately and went  to Okmulgee, and I called back and they said,    Nothing has happened,     so I came back. I had this PTA meeting and I told what happened.  The next day the kids found out about it and I called the superintendent  over to tell him if he wanted to talk about it. He came over and talked  and he couldn   t get any sense of it and said,    I can   t do anything,    so he  left. When he left the whole group left, all the kids left. So I went down  and said,    Now you young people at school, you think you   re doing for  me. Now what I   d like for you to do is go back to school and don   t do  this because you   ll get in a lot of trouble. If you go down to town, they  might say you did something you didn   t do so go back to school.    So  they did that.  I went to see a job in Muskogee, they needed a principal. I met the  superintendent and talked with him. He said,    Well, to be principal here  you have to have a master   s degree.    We talked and he said,    Well  young man, I advise you to go back and quit your job and go to some big  university.    I didn   t have a job at that time, but a week or so later they  had a job at Tatums and they offered me a job there and my wife also.  So we went there and signed contracts to all them. I said,    This is not my  job, let   s go back and resign.    We did, we went back and resigned and I  tried to get in Columbia University and they wouldn   t accept me because  the school was not accredited and my grades weren   t that high so they  wouldn   t    accept me. I wanted to go to some big university. Also at that  time OU was opening, OSU opened. But he had said big so all I had in  my mind was Columbia so I wrote and told them about my time in the  Army and all that and what I   d done. They finally   on probation. I went  there and the first marking period they thought they would get rid of me.  (Laughs) Let me show you something. (Shows diploma)  This is what I was looking for. It says Colored Agricultural and Normal  University. Dr. Young, president of Langston University, took us with  him, his quartet, and we went there and knocked on the door at the  Capitol. Alfalfa Bill Murray came to the door and said    Senator, here   s  Dr. Young with a bunch of niggers.    He said,    This is Colored Ass and  Nigger University   CANU.    I didn   t want to go in there, but I was in  school and I had to go in. That was what he called it.  Alfalfa Bill Murray.  Here   s the other college or university I went to.  15  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Master of Arts from Columbia. So you got your masters from Columbia  in what year?  In  1951 .  How did you respond when Alfalfa Bill said that?  Sorry?  How did you respond when     The governor?  Yeah.  Well the president, he was in charge, and so we went in with him.  (Laughs) I wanted to go home, but I couldn   t. I had to get my education.  Phi Delta Kappa in 1951.  In 1951.  Impressive.  Sorry?  Impressive.  (Laughs) Well I was   I guess I was surprising.  April 1951.  When I told my professor I was going to Columbia he said,    Now  Melvin, you go there you   ll make it. Don   t come back, go to New York  University.    I said,    I   m not going to New York. I   m going to  Columbia,    and that   s what I did. Here   s when I was a John Hathe  fellow.  John Hathe?  John Hathe fellow.  I   m not sure what that is.  It   s a French organization kind of like a fraternity type thing, but it   s all  16  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  over the United States. They elected people that performed at a certain  level to come there. I was a fellow there.  And it was integrated.  Oh yes, but my family was the only one there.  Where are you? (Gestures to photograph)  Here I am.  Graduated from Columbia in June 1951.  Here   s the guy I was talking about.  That   s pretty cool too. Fort Sill about forty-eight.  In 1948.  So how long were you in the military?  Three years.  Three.  I don   t know, after I finished college, for some reason I got inspired for  some reason. But in college, I wasn   t too inspired.  (Laughs)  I didn   t see the difference between those who went to college and those  who didn   t go to college. I just   you go to college and my father was  doing as well as those who did go     Why Columbia?  I went to Wayne State University, and my friends talked about Columbia  and so I left there and went to Columbia.  Where did you live while you were there?  Oh, it so happened   I didn   t know a thing about New York City. I had  my car to drive around and I went to the YMCA. I thought they may  have a place I could go and they didn   t have anything so I drove around.  I saw a guy walking the street and I stopped him. I told him I was  looking for a place to stay.    What are you doing?    I said,    I   m going to  17  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Columbia.       I   m going there too  Why don   t you just stay with me?    I  went there and we stayed together in his room, so I stayed there.  (Laughs)  And where was your wife?  She rode up there with me. She stayed there about three or four weeks,  then she sent for her brother to drive her back home because in New  York you don   t need a car. So she worked at teaching while I was there.  So once you graduated what did you do?  I graduated   I had an advisor that I knew pretty well. As a matter of  fact, I   d go with him to visit schools, called the Six-Six. They had a plan  called the Six-Six at the time. He took me to different high schools, with  him, occasionally. When I went to get a recommendation going from  there, he was the only professor doing work at different colleges. I went  there and he said he wasn   t going to be here but three or four weeks. I  said,    I want to get a recommendation. I got a job in Oklahoma at  Chickasha. It   s open and I want a recommendation.    His secretary said,     Well, why don   t you see Dr. French. He   s doesn   t have people to take  his time like this.    I said,    No, I would like to see my person I work  with.    I finally got to talk with him and told him I wanted a  recommendation. He said,    What are you going to do with that?    I said,     I got an opening in Oklahoma, and I wanted to get a recommendation.     He said,    Why are you going to Oklahoma? You belong on the East  Coast.    I said,    No. I belong in Oklahoma.    He said,    No. You don   t,  you belong on the East Coast.    (Laughs) So he said,    Now I haven   t  recommended very many people to a job like this before, but someone  came through a week or two ago looking for a principal in Arlington   VA . It   s an up going school system so I   d like for you to go there.    He  called and said,    I think I have a man you need to see.     I went there and met with them and they had this   the superintendent,  the board members, and some staff members there. But before I got  there,    I   ve got two or three other guys looking for a job.    And in just a  short time they were gone. When I got there, there were like three or  four left. So they called me over there and talked to me. They said,     Where do you work?    I said,    Well          Why   d you leave Luther?    I  said,    Well, I just thought I needed to get a master   s degree and I  couldn   t get very far with just a normal college degree,    and I talked  about that. So finally Dr. Rhymes said,    Now, is that the real reason you  left  Luther ?    I said,    You ask the sixty-four-dollar question. I   m going  to give you a sixty-four-dollar answer. I was fired     Just like that.  (Laughs) They looked stunned.    Any other questions?    They didn   t have  more questions.    You go out.    So I went out. The assistant  18  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  superintendent came out and said,    Well, first they want to offer you the  job.    I said,    Yes, what is the salary?       Well, they   ll give you the salary  that the present principal had there, the top salary for him.    I said,    I  can   t come for that.    So they talked about it and they came back with  another offer. I said,    I can   t come for that either.    I said,    You know, I  live in Oklahoma, and that means big change. I couldn   t come for that.     Finally they wrote me a letter with a fare I could afford so I went to  Arlington.  As principal?  Pardon?  As the principal?  Yes.  And how long did you stay there?  It wasn   t integrated at that time. I was four years as the black school  principal.  What was the name of the school?  Hoffman-Boston. You didn   t know that name?  No.  Wakefield is the white school and Washington Lee High School   those  two big white schools. So the superintendent and I didn   t see eye-to-eye  at first. The superintendent, everybody called me by my first name     superintendent, principal, all staff by first name. I was in the right. I  called everybody by their first name also. We tried to integrate before  then and the state superintendent didn   t like that. So we go county   see,  in your county it   s different than being in a city. They had some  jurisdiction over the county. They had to fire the board members that  integrated and they had the local government to appoint people to be  principals. They thought Ray Reid was modern enough to handle being  over the black situation and white, but he was really not quite that way,  and so they hired him.  He saw me talking to everybody, and so after he got hired he asked me  to come to his office. I went there. He said,    Well, when I was here  before I noticed you calling everybody by their first names.    I said,     Yes.       Well, don   t call me by my first name.    I said,    No, and don   t  call me either.    So we didn   t call each other anything, just talked.  19  Bishop  Richardson  (Laughs) They wanted me to take a small junior high school. They  wanted to make Hoffman-Boston a small junior high school. I said,    No,  I won   t accept that.    The principal at Wakefield, I knew him pretty well,  and so Dr. Wilson, he said,    George, don   t worry about that. You come  be my school assistant principal at Wakefield.    So I did eventually and I  stayed a couple years.  Well one of his staff members told me,    Well George, Ray Reid said as  long as you   re here you   ll never be promoted.    At that particular time, I  wasn   t too worried about being a principal anyway, but I had been to  this John Hathe fellowship group and met one of the superintendents  there at D.C. He told me,    Now if you ever need a job let me know.    I  thought about that and my mother called me. My brother worked in  Texas. Now when they integrate your school, the principal   s always  fired, black principal   s always fired   Oklahoma. Teachers also, at that  time, they would not know they   re fired until they got a letter. That was  the practice. They had no place for a black principal. He lost his job and  my mother called and asked if I could arrange things for Rick. I said,     Now Momma, Arlington   s not a very big place. They only got one  school, a high school. I don   t know about that.     One day I took my wife to a doctor in D.C. and I thought about that. I  said,    You get a cab and go back home. I want to go to Montgomery  County.    Went there looking for a job so they offered me a job. I  thought about the man in D.C. so I went there and talked to him. I told  him what happened. He said,    He   s got a job.    I said,    Got a wife.    He  said,    She   s got a job.    (Laughs) So I didn   t believe it. I thought about it  a while and I called him again. I said,    Do you really mean it?    He said,     Yes.    He said,    Just tell them we met at some convention.    I called him   Rick  and so his wife had a job and she said,    I   m not going to leave my  job.    So they got a plane, came to Arlington, and I talked to them,    You  didn   t really have to come here.    He knew he had a job. We looked for a  place to stay then. We saw a place across the line in Maryland and he  decided he   d like to stay there. He told me once, said    Well, I   ll get you  a job as close to the line of Maryland as I can, you and your wife both.     They got those jobs. I then decided I would contact Maryland. I got a job  in Maryland. I was in four different schools in Maryland. (Laughs)  During your time in Arlington did you work on any projects or  anything?  In Arlington the black high school   it worked like a building in the  county. It worked like a section of the county. I didn   t want my kids in a  situation like that so I thought about what I might do. So I had some  kind of plan and I talked with the group there, civic organization. They  said,    We tried things like that, it didn   t work.    So I didn   t give up, I  20  Finchum  Richardson  kept on working with it. I worked with him, worked on the plan just for  our neighborhood. Then I decided to go to the board with it, to the  planning commission. Now the planning commission had hired a group  to work on uplifting neighborhoods and so forth and they also tried  themselves. The voters turned it down. I made my presentation and  they   re pleased with it. He went before the voters and they approved it  for  9,200,000 dollars. It   s called the Arlington Neighborhood  Conservation Program.  I got that going, and now I guess where I lived at that time is the most  integrated place in the city. White people moved in. Other groups came  in. It   s very close to the Pentagon, on a hill and I could look down and  see Washington D.C. It was called Johnson Hill at first, when I made my  presentation. Nowadays it   s Arlington View, so it   s changed to  Arlington View. After I went to Montgomery County I finally   I was  assistant principal at Whitman High School. You   ve heard of B-CC   Bethesda Chevy Chase High School ?  Yes.  I think the president of OU went to school at that school, B-CC,  Bethesda-Chevy Chase. I was vice-principal there. Then when my  principal left that to take Whitman High School, somehow he changed  somewhat. He had two other principals, and sometimes I felt left out. I  told him that I had a certain number of responsibilities. I had teachers  and he hired someone with the ones I was supposed to work with. I told  him one time, I said,    Jerry, I don   t do this. Before I   m supposed to  grade these teachers, I want to be in on the employment.    I thought it  was straight. He was in a meeting and one of the secretaries got a  telephone call about one of the people wanting to be hired for the  library. She told me. I said,    Now I told Jerry about this.    So what I did  was I went to my office, got all my papers, put them in my car, and went  home. (Laughs)  I stayed home a few a days. We had seven assistant superintendents  there. This superintendent, I went to him, he   s over Whitman. I said,     You haven   t heard about this but I walked off the job.    I told him what  happened. He said,    I   ll tell you what, I   ll call Jerry and we   ll discuss  it.    He called Jerry and Jerry said,    Well, I   d like to have George come  back.    I told Jerry,    You know I told you what happened, I wasn   t  coming back.    So he said,    Well I   ll tell you what, I   ll monitor every  week and see how it   s going.    I said,    Well I   m not going back.     I went back home again, and I thought I   d be able to talk to the main  superintendent, so I called him. I talked to him so they set up a meeting  and had all of the seven area superintendents, the staff and all them  21  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  talking. I said,    If this is during the school term, all the jobs are filled         Yes.    I said,    Well, you know you don   t have to move anybody. You  can fire me.       We   re not taking about firing.    So they said,    Well       I  went back home and stayed a little while longer. They called me about a  job near the end of the state.    Well, that   s too far, I can   t go there.    They  finally got a school with the same standing that Whitman had. They had  built a brand new school that just opened up the year before. I went  there. I said,    I only want to stay there one year.    So I stayed there one  year and I said,    I want to leave there and go to the assistant  superintendent   s office, either an area or main superintendent.     At the end of that year I told him I was ready to go. They assigned me to  the job. I stayed there until I retired. I went home. My brother and his  wife were retired. My wife retired, and I was still working. I planned on  working one more year, and I decided I wasn   t going to work one more  year so I went back and told my secretary. I said,    Well, I   m not coming  back anymore.    (Laughs) I said,    You can send the voucher every two  weeks.    She did and so it was kind of late so I went to my office, where  I was. They had replaced me so this person said,    Mr. Richardson what  are you talking about? You know if you   re out four days, you have to  bring a doctor   s statement.    I said,    I know that.    I told them that I got  that till the end of the school year.  I decided not to remarry (laughs) for three years. Then finally, again, a  friend told me about Arcilerlle and Rick said,    I   ll go along with you      He went along with me, they talked. Finally I started talking, and our  courtship was by telephone, basically. I   d go there every once in a while.  That night we were talking at eight o   clock, I said,    We need to get  engaged.    She said,    Got to get rings for that.     I said,     I   ll be there  tomorrow.     Now this is your second wife?  Yes.  And you were still in Virginia?  No, I   d since retired and I   ve been here about twenty-five years.  You came back to Oklahoma?  Yes.  Okay.  I   d be by myself if I was still in Virginia. I told her   she said,    Well that  22  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  means rings.    I said,    I   ll be there tomorrow, so go to your jeweler,     and she selected a ring. We set the date, got married   eleven years ago.  (Laughter)  How old, roughly, were you when you retired?  I was sixty-nine.  Sixty-nine, and then you came back to Oklahoma     To Oklahoma, yes.  Did you come back to Oklahoma City, Langston     We built this house  in Oklahoma City  before we came to Oklahoma.  Made trips here while they were building. They did some things that I   d  had done differently, but it   s okay. When we came here it was just like  empty, not with everything like it is now.  So Oklahoma was home?  Yes, home.  You were going to come back no matter what.  And she   s   also home. (Laughs) Yeah, she was from Oklahoma. As a  matter a fact, her parents were in the Run way back in Oklahoma, her  grandparents. They still got that farm, 240 acres. Not this wife, the other  wife.  Where?  In Logan County.  In Logan County, okay.  I   ll be darned.  What was her last name?  Huh?  Your first wife, what was her last name?  Madison.  23  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Madison.  There   s a lot of Madisons in the area, but they were in the Run. Now  what happened, they had a 160 acres and a man had eighty acres next to  them. He didn   t like it so he left and they paid fourteen dollars for it.  (Laughs)  And how many children do you have?  I have one.  One.  And six grandkids and three great-grandkids.  Boy or a girl?  Sorry?  Was your child a boy or a girl?  Boy and hers is a girl. She (Arcilerlle) had one, I had one. Her daughter  will be here Friday.  Going back a little ways, what was the Great Depression like for you?  Well, that   s when I was getting ready to graduate at that time. I worked  on the projects they had, WPA  Works Progress Administration . When  I lived on Porter Street and a young man that had gotten in trouble  before lived on Porter Street and he was named Melvin. In college I was  going with this girl and this guy got married. (Laughs) She thought I   d  married and I had to do a lot to explain, but now he got on WPA. You  know they put the names on the wall there and you see your name. So he  was on Porter Street and put his name in   I passed by and saw my  name, so I got hired and got a job working on the railroad. The road was  going no place, but we were just working. (Laughs) I did that for a while  then I got a job shining shoes, all that kind of stuff.  Was the WPA in Holdenville or Okmulgee?  Do what?  The WPA job, where was it?  WPA? Yeah, we got a little money for it. Not much.  24  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Where?  Okmulgee County.  Okmulgee County.  Yes. That   s where my home was until I left the state. My brother was  always with me, just like a shadow. Rick, I thought he   d get married  before he did. He   d know the girl and stay with a girl a whole year or so.  I didn   t do that. He said,    Now Melvin, the way you   re doing no girl has  confidence in you.    I got married and he was still looking a long time,  but he got another girl and they quit. So he didn   t have a wife and so I  got married. Oline had a roommate and so she told her,    I got married,  but don   t tell anybody  You do, I   ll lose my job.       Does he have a  brother?       Yeah.       Is he married?       No.       I want to meet him.    And he  married her. (Laughter)  Well did he retire back to Oklahoma too?  Yes.  Did he?  No, he went to Texas. Went to Texas, then he went to Tulsa, then went  from Tulsa to Atlanta, Georgia. That   s where he passed, in Atlanta,  Georgia.  Now you talked about your service during World War II. Did you ever  have to go to Europe or the Pacific?  What?  During World War II did you ever serve in Europe or the Pacific?  I served in Italy.  Italy.  The film Red Tails. It was out last year, a film called Red Tails. Well,  they were the ones who protected us   infantry division.  Where in Italy did you serve?  Right around the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Leaning Tower of Pisa.  25  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  And your troop was integrated, and your group was integrated?  No. At that time you couldn   t integrate, until Truman was elected  president. The first thing he did was integrate the Army.  Okay.  As a matter of fact, we couldn   t go to the officers    club. We couldn   t do  anything. In Oklahoma they had a barrack that wasn   t being used so I  turned it into an officers    club and we had our little group there. We  couldn   t    go to the white officers    club. Overseas we couldn   t go to the  officers    club either. Everything was separate.  And you were in a quartet?  They had a quartet. One of the groups got pretty famous, went to South  America and then they went to Europe. They finally died and something  like that, but I was with them a short time, originally at Langston.  Do you have a favorite song?  Favorite song?  Yes. Do you have a favorite?  Oh I got so many. In the quartet I had   I guess   I got so many  favorites. We had a quartet, my family had a quartet. There were five  kids. My sister Fredonia could play   she was talented, she could play  the piano and we were the quartet. We went to civic organizations. At  that time they were separate. You sang there and also in the city. One  time I went to a radio broadcasting station singing a song. She was very  talented. If she   d hear you, she could just follow you with the piano. One  time, they had silent movies at the time, and she played during that time  and when they changed scenes, she   d do music for it. So we had a good  family situation.  When you went to the movies where did you go? What town, what  theater did you go to?  Okmulgee.  Okmulgee?  Yes. As a matter of fact, we didn   t go to the main theater at Okmulgee,  because at that time they   d find what was the worst place to put people  26  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  and that   s where we were. The buses, we got the back. Trains, we got  the back. You know at that time when you were coming from Kansas to  Oklahoma if you were in another part of the train, they   d wake you up  and say    Go where blacks are supposed to sit.    If you   re white then they  had to go where the whites were supposed to sit. If you went across the  line they   d wake you up and say you have to go to the back.  You talked about a train trip during my first visit here, but going to  Virginia, when you got to St. Louis you had to switch seats.  Do what?  Do you remember switching seats in St. Louis?  Yes.  Can you talk a little bit about that?  Switching trains at St. Louis? One of the main things in St. Louis   I  don   t recall anything really about St. Louis. Only a friend of mine,  working with a park group, and they had this oil thing. He was with that,  I went across that and very little else about St. Louis.  My question for you is did you every think you would make it to 100  years?  I didn   t think people lived that long. (Laughter)  Well they do now  (Laughs)  I was in Arlington, in the church, and one man who worked with the  railroad department and he   s sixty-five, got a watch. We thought he was  ancient, sixty-five years old. (Laughter) But I pass sixty-fives and they  look like young people.  Did you every have another family member that lived to 100? Are you  the first one? You   re the first one.  I   ve lived longer than any other person. I had very few fights in my life.  Matter of fact, my brother was always with me and he always, if there  was fighting, he   d do that part. I would do the other part, stay out of it.  One fight I had, I was delivering papers and my friend across the street I  had deliver with me. He was a year younger than I was. They started  pushing him around, all the older ones there, they started pushing him so  I decided to protect him so they got on me. They kind of beat me up,  blood was coming down my back and when I got out   called me girl or  27  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  something, for some reason. I went home and my brother went and cut  loose on him, they had to hold him. He was going to go and cut loose.  (Laughs) That ended my paper route carrying.  The only threat I had in teaching, my first job I spanked   a little girl and  boy got into a little conflict. The boy came to school, got hit a little bit.  This man said,    You   re not going to hit my boy.    I sent word that if he  came back to school, he   d be whipped. I stayed away for a little while  and he kept on sending little notes. So finally   they had truant officers.  He had to go to school and he had to bring him, so I didn   t know what to  expect. I parked my car close to the building so I could get out if  necessary. I whipped him. He deserved it. He was a mean ole    boy up  there. That   s the only threat I got in my whole forty years of teaching.  When I look back, my dad was born in 1864, one year after the  Emancipation Proclamation. President Lincoln had authority as  commander and chief, so he integrated the country. That became the  genesis of freedom for blacks in this country. The political situation  grew real slowly, the emancipation, segregation, discrimination, and  then the Jim Crow laws, all those things before we got to where we are  now.  Your father was born in 1864?  Yes. My grandmother and grandfather were both born in Oklahoma.  Your grandparents.  The whole family, except three, was born in Oklahoma. Now three died  in Texas. The three older ones.  How did they come  from  Texas?  I imagine they probably came in a wagon because (laughs)     Okay.  Others came with them. I imagine a group of them got together and just  came.  And why were you fired at Luther?  Well, the board knew I had a theater here in town.  You owned a theater?  28  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  What?  You owned a theater?  I was part owner. My college president and I owned it. He first hired me  when I was a student. (Laughs)  What was the name of it?  Eastside Theater. I think I   ve got a picture of it, but it   s Eastside Theater.  They were talking about opening the theater and I said,    Well you won   t  be profitable unless you have all people attending,    but it opened for  whites only. After it failed financially, they called me over and wanted  me to publicize it. Then they said,    Well we   re going to let blacks come  two times a week, on Tuesday Thursdays.    My football team was the  champion that year, and my coach invited the coach from Langston to be  the speaker and all that.  Someone told the board that I had it on Tuesday, and the superintendent  called me over and said,    I understand you have a      Now before then  he said,    If you didn   t move it, you   d be fired.    I didn   t move it so he  said,    Now the contract   s ready.    I went and he said,    The teachers are  rehired but you weren   t.    I said,    Why?       You think about it.    He told  me before if I didn   t move it I   d be fired,    So you think about it.    So I  thought about it. He said,    They told me not to tell you why.    Then the  board president, I talked to him. He said they said,    Don   t tell you.     Tuesday?  Yes, the event was on Tuesday. That   s the day that blacks were  supposed to go to the show.  I don   t understand.  What happened, after I got fired, a carload of white business people on  the side of the state came all the way to Wynnewood. That   s where I was  staying because I stopped in Oklahoma City but my wife was still living  in Wynnewood. They came down, asked me why I got fired. I wouldn   t  tell them, because I thought if I told them and it got across the state, that  perhaps I wouldn   t have a chance to get a job here in the state anymore.  So I didn   t tell anybody at that time.  You were a strong person.  What?  29  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Said you   ve been a strong person.  (Laughs) Well, what happened at that time, usually they fired a  principal, black principal. He would go back and say,    Now what did I  do?    They   d tell him what to do and he would take his job. They  expected me to do that. Even my brother-in-law, he said,    Now Melvin  that   s a good school to go, go ahead and keep it.    I said,    No. I   m not  going to do that.    He said,    Well my principal   s fired and he went back  and told the school board and got it worked out.    I said,    I   m not going  to that.    I was tired of hearing that.  Was Luther integrated?  No, all black.  Luther was all black.  At that time all schools in Oklahoma were  segregated .  Today what   s a typical day like for you? What time do you get up?  Well, when I feel like it. (Laughter) Yesterday I got up at twelve thirty.  And then what do you do with your time during the day?  Look at that (gestures to television), magazines. Now we have a lady  that comes and cooks for us, so she does that and cleans the house. We  go out on the patio, things like that. Go to a show every once in a while.  Forty years ago or longer we decided we wouldn   t cook on Sunday, so  we still do that.  Still cook on Sunday?  No.  You don   t? What do you do?  Go out.  Well how do you get there?  Car. Automobile.  You drive?  Yeah.  30  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  You still drive?  Oh yeah. I go shopping. We leave and you   ll go out of town. (Laughs)  Do you have a preferred place to eat on Sunday?  No, we go to Red Rock, we go to the steak place on Remington. We  used to go to a place down in a shopping center, but they closed. We go  to a little place across the street. It   s an Italian type place. We go there  quite frequently. They know our seats, see. We go there and they know  where we sit. (Laughter)  How about religion? Is church important?  What?  Is church an important part?  Well, that   s when I got started   I came here and the pastor had resigned  and they got a new pastor. They   re going to take the church, imminent  domain. Just had a few months to stay there, they   re going to take it so I  got involved in that. The new pastor made me chairman of the building  committee. Then I became chairmen of the trustee board, so I worked  with the county. They had offered them  200,000 dollars for the  building. I got it up to  700,000. That wasn   t enough but that   s what we  got. I got a builder to build the building and he started pretty well, but  somehow he got a partner to work with him. They got in debt and he left  and had about fifteen or twenty leans against the church. I was chairman  of the trustee board, but first of all I wasn   t   at first I wasn   t the  chairman of the trustee board, but they got loans from the Liberty Bank,  it was downtown then, for 18 percent. That   s way up there. When they  were in lawsuit they refused the loan.  I went to all the places in town and I finally got a loan here at Republic  Bank, it   s called Republic at that time. I got it at 14 percent. So we got  started and this builder got broke so he left all these bills and I worked  with a lawyer and I had an estimator come and he said he could get it  down to  160,000 dollars, something like that. I offered to them, the  builders, the company I was working with, they wouldn   t accept it.  FTW, something like that, the company building the church for us. So I  got to first go out to make Vaughn  inaudible     oh, he   s built a number  of church buildings in town. Can   t think of the name. I asked him to  come out and estimate it, and he came out and looked. He said it   d cost   415,000 to correct it. We worked on it a while and my lawyer found  out this company was insured half a million dollars. I   d ask for  160,000  31  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  dollars because of all the money spent to that point. They had to accept it  and they first wanted to give me  450,000 dollars. I knew they wouldn   t  do it, so they went up around  575,000. So that was able to get us out of  debt.  I worked with them. Now, I taught Sunday school and I organized the  men   s choir. They hadn   t had that before. That first year they asked me  to be chairman of the men   s day. One of my friends said,    Now Melvin,  men don   t raise money. They combine with the women because they   ll  raise the money.    I said,    I   m not going to do that. So I took it and raised  over  10,000 dollars.    We went from that. So I belonged to the choir,  chair of the trustee board, and taught Sunday school. Then I was selected  as the first layperson at the State Examination of Psychologists by  Governor Nigh. I had a number of other things I did around the city. I  was chairman of the Oklahoma County Teachers Association.  What was the name of your church?  Called the Tabernacle Baptist Church. I have a picture of it.  You really didn   t retire?  What?  You really didn   t retire.  (Laughs) Try to keep busy.  How important has religion or spirituality been in your life?  Since I really got busy, that   s when I started doing things   after I really  left school, college, and got involved in religion. Time to do what I  liked, it seemed so, I don   t know why. I got busy doing things that I  never thought I could do.  What do you think your secret to a long life is?  Well one thing, I smoked one cigarette when I first started teaching; way  out in the country, you got to do something so I bought a cigarette, a  pack. So it was so much trouble trying to keep matches and cigarettes  and all that, I didn   t want anything to do with that so I stopped. I got  one, I smoked that one. I don   t drink. I belong to a fraternity and they  have drinks quite a bit, but I never decided to drink anything. I don   t  gamble. I like to dance. I was ninety-seven years old when I went back  to my reunion in Arlington. The kids had never seen me dance before.  (Laughs) So I got up there and done things they couldn   t do. (Laughs)  32  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  And here, a few years ago, they had a group called the Senior Prom. You  have to be fifty-five years old or older to be a member of that and I was  king of the ball. (Laughter)  What style of dancing?  I like the old-time dancing, waltzing, the two-step. Actually, when I was  in high school they used to have dances and doing the Charleston, way  back before your time. You   d do that and the theater closed and used  this for kind of activities and I could do the Charleston so I participated  in there. I was doing the Charleston and then one dance you   d squat  down there and stick your feet up. One time I jumped up, my pants  didn   t come up. (Laughter) I think they gave me a prize for that.  (Laughter)  Another experience I had, we lived on Fifth Street and the house next to  us was vacant. Did I tell you about playing mumble peg? Well that   s  where if you lose   we had a little stick in the ground and each one hit it  and the loser has to take their teeth and raise it up. Well, there had been  horses in there sometime and so I lost and I was supposed to do that. So  I squatted down and got in a good position and I ran, got in the house.  The house was just a short distance. So I was headed toward it and my  brother says,    Open the door     They opened the door where I could run  in, got in the house. I ran in the house. They got angry at me about that  so later they got pretty good and I thought it was safe to go out.  So we got in the little house next door and it was empty and we went up  in the attic, looking up there. So they jumped down and left me up there.  I found a little pot about this big so I got some dust to put in it. Every  time I started, they   d throw something up and I was afraid to come  down. So finally,    Melvin, you coming down?    I said,    Well, I want to  see all of you. Get where I can see you. They did and I took that (pot of  dust) and (gestures throwing it) and I kept on running. (Laughs) Our  friend Dunbar,    I   ll kill him     I was afraid to come out for about a  month. (Laughs) Those kinds of things I got into occasionally.  Well do you have a philosophy or a motto you live by?  What?  Do you have a philosophy or a motto that you live by?  Well, basically my father was a very honest type person. If a nickel was  there, he would try to find the owner of it. (Laughs) He took us to the  bank, ready to borrow money, took us to the bank. They   d always give  money because he was a good person. My main philosophy, I guess, is  33  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  to try to do the best you can each day. Even when I get up every  morning I just pray that I made it another day and expect it to be a good  day and then expect things to go well. I never get up thinking I am going  to fail. I always feel I   m going to make it so I   ve done it all this time.  And now when history is written, what would you like it to say about  you?  I   d like to be remembered that I tried to help you along the way and used  my life, after I got up old enough, to be helpful and to work with young  people to succeed along the way. I had one young man, when I was at  the black school, he was a good student. I had a white administrator and  we didn   t have all the equipment he had and he invited us to bring our  kids over there. One day he said,    Mr. Richardson, do you have a young  student who could go to Yale University?    I said,    Yes, I have two of  them.    He said,    Well, I tell you what. I   m a graduate of Yale. I   ve got a  scholarship for him.    So he did and he went to Yale. Let me show you  something. Here   s what they gave me when I went to the reunion. This  is the young man and what he does, every year he gives scholarships to  students to go to college. He went to Yale University and went to  Harvard.  Oh this young man here?  Yeah, but he gives scholarships every year. He has a foundation. Now  check this out.  George Nigh, yeah.  I had this when I was president of the county organization (Oklahoma  County Teachers Association).  You were very civic minded, weren   t you?  I belonged to the Committee of 100. I was the only black person on the  Committee of 100. At the time I was on the board they   d have speakers  to meet with them and tell them what they were going to do. When I told  them what I was going to say they said,    You   re going to say it?    I said,     Yes, I   m going to say it. You asked me to speak.    So I spoke and made  a speech  in 1971 .  This is the last thing here. They offered me a job out there. I didn   t take  it. I was working in Montgomery County so I wouldn   t accept it.  You gave up a lot of jobs.  34  Richardson  Bishop  Finchum  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Finchum  Richardson  Yeah.  In your lifetime, you got     He stood up for what he believed in.  Yeah.  Another thing they tried to do back there   now my idea is in a  population there   s a place for older people, retired people, the baby-boomers,  and you have another group called dropouts. No one takes  responsibility for them. They get kicked out of school, they can   t go to  school anymore, and they   re not sixteen so they can   t work. So what do  they do? The gangs are looking for them, aren   t they? Now the Muslims  are looking for the gang members, if they can. No one takes  responsibility for them. When I was in Arlington I realized that the black  kid growing up, his parents didn   t have the same background that the  white kids had. So I got the board to give a preschool-type program for  them but they had to get around to it, because now in my growing up a  table   we were all at a table. Later on it became a duck and fight, Chip  and Dale, that type of thing. What they had   they   d never changed.  I thought somewhere along the line we should have something for those  kids who can   t go to school, dropout, or something like that. You   d find  them under trees during the summer days. They pass by them and pretty  soon they find out they may be joining a terrorist group. Take the little  church, you don   t find young teenagers in church, young adults even.  You don   t.  That   s a scholarship I started some time ago. (Gestures)  A scholarship fund for your wife.  She passed about twelve years ago, more than that.  Pretty neat.  Yes.  Every year we give a kid a scholarship in our church because when I  came up my family didn   t have money for new clothes to send us to  school. My clothes were always from a used clothes group, and the kids  criticized the two of us.    Why don   t your pants come down to your  shoes? Why are your pants falling down? Are you a soldier?       No.        Got the same uniform.    (Laughs) And what happened, I was left home.  35  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  I was in the choir, and I was a pretty good tenor I thought, and they got  invited to a white church or something like that. I wore the clothes I   d  wear every day and I was the only that was left off because I didn   t have  a suit. My brother had bought a suit, so he was on, but I didn   t have one  and I was left off the trip. My mother was very angry with that. She  saved some money and got me a new suit, my first new suit. (Laughs)  I have a little thing I do now. I have a little, rental property business that  I do now.  Keeps you a little busy.  What?  Staying busy.  Yeah, I have about eight homes right here in Oklahoma City.  What time do you go to bed?  When I feel like it. Sometimes I go at eight o   clock. If I have the energy  I may go at twelve o   clock, or whatever time I feel like it. We sit outside  when the sun is bright. We get to talking and stay out there, come inside  and talk. Then we look at television. If there   s something interesting we  stay up and see it, then go on to bed.  What do you think about the current president?  Well I think he   s doing the best he can under the circumstances. I think  he wanted to help too many people in too many different ways, and I  think they got kind of mixed up. You can   t roll Lincoln, Roosevelt, and  Martin Luther King into one person. They   re too separate entities, but I  think he   s a good speaker.  Very good.  He went to Europe and he was really welcomed when he went to  Europe. They said Reagan went there so they thought he (Obama)  couldn   t go there but they had a big crowd. Then this Obamacare,  Roosevelt got this Medicare started and so forth, so I think he thought     What can I do to help a lot of people?    I think perhaps not being in  politics a long time, he really didn   t know enough strong people for staff  members. I think he got advice that sometimes wasn   t the best advice  and I think also looking at the   one thing I said   Emancipation  Proclamation, integration, discrimination, Jim Crow. We are now in a  stage of desegregation, not integration. We   re desegregated, we   re called  36  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  integration because a few kids go to school, but we are desegregated.  Things are almost like they used to be. All the kids go to school, I can go  to town and try a hat on. I went to Washington D.C., a black person  couldn   t try a hat on you know. You could buy it, take it home, bring it  back, but you couldn   t try it on in the store. You couldn   t try a dress on  in the store.  In D.C. or here?  No, D.C.  In D.C.  I thought when I was going to D.C., I thought    Capitol.    I thought   a lot  of things I couldn   t do. I couldn   t go to the theater in Washington.  Well when you were growing up did you spend any time in Boley   Oklahoma ?  What?  Did you spend any time in Boley?  Boley, in Boley?  Yes.  Yes, we had a convention there. I don   t know why but our friend totaled  our car. We had an old Ford car and it was wrecked. We wanted to go to  the convention but we were involved in a wreck. The merchants had big  cars, Buicks and all those other cars, Studebakers. They drove through  Henryetta going to Boley. They said words while we   re there,    Don   t  come back through Henryetta.    So well then we had the wreck then,  they had to go country roads all the way right back to Okmulgee. Had to  find a way to get back there. A friend of ours, Mr. Wellington, he knew  about   knew us pretty well so he stayed with us. That old car   it ran  best going downhill. (Laughter) It didn   t do well going uphill, but he  stayed with us until we got home. They told us not to come back through  Henryetta with this car, so we didn   t. Boley was a good, at that time,  Boley was our New York almost. It was the best black town in the whole  country.  Did you go to dance there?  Yes, I knew the superintendent and she went to school with me one time,  but they had dances. Now at the Teachers    Association meetings, they  37  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  Arcilerlle  Finchum  Richardson  were all black at that time, they didn   t integrate like they are now. They  always had dances at those. Well I grew up like that. I danced in my  home. Girls would come over to be with my sisters and my sister played  and so we could dance. (Laughs)  You   ve seen a lot of changes.  Oh yes, I   ve seen a lot of changes.  What do you think has been the biggest one?  The biggest one, to see the president of the United States a black person.  I never thought that would happen. Not this soon anyway. That   s the  biggest change.  Do you still vote today?  What?  Do you still go and vote today?  I still didn   t hear you.  Do you still go vote?  Oh yes, every time they have a voting I   m there. We walk over there, not  too far away. I always keep up with the political situation. Well my  wife   we   ve had a good life together, eleven years. We agree on  everything, almost. (Laughs)  She   s the boss. Yep  (Laughs)  Doesn   t matter, when you   re talking, she   ll go like this. (Gestures) She  knows me so well. She knows what I was thinking. (Laughter)  What   s her name.  Arcilerlle.  Arcille.  Arcilerlle. A-R-C-I-L-E-R-L-L-E, Arcilerlle     Anything else you want to add before we shut it off?  I   ve said so much. (Laughs)  38  Finchum  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Bishop  Richardson  Finchum  Richardson  Finchum  I wish you   d sing for us   But one thing we like to do, we like to travel. We have been on   go on  trips together. Go to the East Coast to Las Vegas and Connecticut and  Washington, Atlanta, Georgia. We go quite a bit.  Do you have anything left on your bucket list that you want to do?  (Laughs) What?  Anything left on your bucket list that you hope to do?  Well no, I just want to live out my life like I   m living now, that   s the  main thing. I have a picture of a house. When I was at Arlington, one of  my parents were living in a house, and his kids had graduated and he  couldn   t pay for it. He said,    Mr. Richardson I   m about to lose my  house, I   d like for you to take it. If you assume the loan, you can have  it.    So I assumed the loan and I said,    Stay there as long as you live, a  hundred dollars a month rent.     One?  Yes, and he did. At that time the little house was valued at about five or  six thousand dollars, but it sold for twenty thousand. See after I made a  change there, the streets and everything, it keeps on moving in. One time  they didn   t move there, but after that happened they moved in and oil  probably went way up.  A lot of changes. Alright, well we   ll say thank you and we   ll shut it off  okay? Thank you very much.  -------  -------
