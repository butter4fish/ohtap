 L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  Today is April 25, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I am with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library.  Also joining me is Randy Wilson, who may add in a  few questions.  I am in Tipton, Oklahoma, at the home of Raenell  Vernon. I will be interviewing Raenell today as part of the Spotlighting  Oklahoma Oral History Series, so thank you for having me here today.  Thank you.  Why don   t you tell me about where and when you were born?  Well, I was born June 12, 1924, two and half miles west of Tipton.  And were you born in a home?  Yes.  Your parents    home?  That   s right. Dr. Spurgeon was the doctor.  What were your parent   s names?  My dad   s name was Luther Green, but he went by Luke Boyd.  And your mother?  Lillian Boyd. Lillian Hasley was her maiden name.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  Daddy had two little girls. Their mother had died when he married  5  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  Mother. She had me and my brother, Noyce Boyd.  So what was your house like, the house you were born in?  It had two bedrooms, a living room, dining room, and kitchen.  And did your daddy   s two little girls live in the house with you?  Yes, they did.  Were they much older?  They were I think about six and nine when Mother and Daddy married. I  believe that is right.  Do you know how long your parents lived in the Tipton area?  A long, long time. Daddy   s family came from Tennessee to Wise  County, Texas. Mother was born in Comanche County, Texas, and then  they migrated this way.  So your parents met in Oklahoma?  Yes. Well, I think Daddy was living where Uncle Doc Boyd   he later  lived in that house. That was across the road from where my mother   s  people lived. (Laughs) As I said, Daddy   s family came from Tennessee.  There was a kind of dispute or something over an estate and the Boyds  never did like trouble or conflict, so they went, like I said, to Wise  County, Texas.  Because of the dispute.  Kind of, yes.  Do you know any of the details from the dispute?  No, I don   t. Everybody wasn   t happy so they just got out. It was my  daddy   s daddy and his brother. Daddy   s daddy   s name was Jessie Wade  Boyd. His brother was Anderson Lafayette Boyd. Of course, you don   t  want all the details of how the cousins   they were always a close  family, the Boyds.  And were they farmers?  Yes, here in Tipton they were. Daddy said when he came to this area, we  were coming from Frederick one day, and he told me when he came here  6  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  there were not any trees, but the grass was belly high to a horse. I just  remember him telling me that. And then Daddy ran a ferry across the  river down here,  North Fork of the Red River,  over into  what is now   Jackson County.  Really? Was that just for people coming and going, or would they ferry  horses and supplies?  They would carry loads of stuff and people. There was no bridge.  (Laughs)  Do you know what the ferry was called?  No, I don   t.  Or how long it lasted? Do you remember the ferry at all?  No, I don   t remember the details about it.  Do you know where your mom or dad went to school?  No, not really. Daddy didn   t have a very big education. I think if he  would have lived today, he probably would   ve wanted to be a doctor  because he studied that. He had doctor books and things. He was always  interested in that.  What did he farm, your dad?  That place where I was born. Before that I don   t know where he farmed,  but that place his sister and her husband, he bought it from them because  this Uncle Dick Hammonds was afraid of tornadoes, so he moved out to  Farwell, Texas. (Laughter)  Where there were fewer tornadoes?  I guess. (Laughter)  Do you remember experiencing many tornadoes growing up?  I remember we went to the cellar quite a bit. (Laughs) We had a good  life. Everybody was poor but we didn   t know we were poor, or I didn   t  worry about it.  What were some of your chores growing up?  Something that I remember, Daddy brought in the nicest little postered  7  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  rocker. He   d bought it at Benton   s Store. I just thought that was  wonderful. I   ve had it for years, but it   s no longer around. Of course, my  older sisters, and we had cousins and they would come. We always had  lots of company.  Did your family raise a big garden?  Yes, they did. I have to put a good word in for my brother. He was a  wonderful brother. Don   t you amen me  Raenell says to someone in the  room . (Laughter) Yes, he was a good one.  Did your father mostly farm cotton?  Yes, and back then they raised a lot of sudan and stuff like that for cattle  and their horses. The best watermelons in the world. (Laughs) Let   s see,  Mother was a good cook, always busy, always people coming and going.  It was thickly populated in the rural area all south and west of us. One  Christmas we were just recalling memories and Noyce said everybody  from that direction came by. They stopped going to town, and they  stopped going home. I guess they thought it was the 7-Eleven.  (Laughter)  Would they eat?  Yes, they would eat. We did lots of cooking.  What are some of your favorite dishes that she made?  Oh, those pretty cakes and pies. My sisters went to school across the  road from where we lived, and down the corner. The teacher roomed  there with my folks. Mr. Lyons was his name. My older sister, Pebbie  Boyd, married another Boyd. There was another set of Boyds, no kin but  she married Jimmy Boyd. She had three daughters, Joy, Irma, and Larue.  My sister Lota married Richard Dunlap and they had one daughter,  Linda Killebrew is her married name. Then Noyce married Gene  Caviness from Bethany. Their kids, my kids and Noyce   s kids, they  were close. They more or less grew up together.  In Tipton?  Yes.  Where did you go to school?  Tipton. I started school in first grade and then graduated in 1942 from  Tipton High School.  8  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  What are some things you remember about school? Was it very big?  Yes, it was big back then. The Tipton Home was big and that made our  school big.  Do you remember some teachers in Tipton High School that had an  influence on you?  Oh, yes. Lotus Maynard, Geraldine Mays was our home-ec teacher. I  can   t remember all of the men   s names. Mr. Dobson was one. Mrs.  Lesch was the principal, she was a good one. She was tough. Who was  the superintendent? I forgot. Mr. Wheeler was when I was in school.  Was the school in the same location as it is now?  Yes, it was.  Has it changed much?  Yes, it has improved a lot. The grade school was down the street here  and then they moved it out there in about 1954, I think. We have a good  school system now. We have the elementary, the junior high, and then  the high school. This past summer, they put a memorial there for one of  the boys that was killed at Fort Hood in the shooting. He graduated from  Tipton High School, J.D. Hunt. That was kind of a biggy for last year.  How would you get to school?  The school bus. It went way off down that way, packed with kids.  Who drove the school bus?  I don   t remember who the driver was. I just remember one of the  Hubbard boys. He was in high school, and when I would get on the bus,  he said I was his girlfriend. I was so embarrassed. (Laughter)  Was he much older?  Yes, he was in high school, and I was about in the second grade.  (Laughter)  Did you have sports activities at school?  Yes, I did, but I didn   t play sports. Erma was a good basketball player.  (Laughs)  9  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson   Erma adds in the background: Well, I get better every year. (Laughter)  Nobody   s here to dispute it, so I might as well say I   m good.   Did you have 4-H or FFA  Future Farmers of America ?  Yes, we had 4-H. I remember making our little arm bands, and 4-H is  good. And then of course, FFA for my kids was good.  Well, back to your time growing up and things around your house.  Would you raise chickens?  Oh yes, yes. And we would dress chickens in the summer and put them  in the deep freeze.  When did you get a deep freeze, do you remember?  Oh, we still have our first one. I think we bought it in 1958, and it   s still  running.  Wow.  Not here, but where Randall lives.  Was there much dust blowing around Tipton in the 1930s?  Indeed there was  I can remember Daddy coming after me at school and  a big red thing was rolling in. That was during the Dust Bowl days. That  was the only time I ever remember Daddy coming to get me at school.  And then he drove you home and did it blow into your house?  Oh, did it, yes  You had to cover up your food and then dust, sweep and  rake it out. That was red then and the ones we   re having now are more  of a pale gray color. That Friday we had such a storm it was     The dirt is still red but the dust is     It doesn   t roll in red like it used to. I guess you could say from soil  conservation, that has helped, and tree rows that were planted back in  the thirties. I think Mangum, Oklahoma, was the first county to plant  tree rows to help with soil erosion. I remember a lot about school, it was  good. And then high school and our banquets and things like that.  When did you get indoor plumbing in your home?  10  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  Daddy built that house in 1931 during the Depression, and he hired Mr.  Huffer, Tom Huffer was the carpenter. He  Mr. Huffer  hand-picked the  lumber. He would go to the lumberyard and if it had a knot hole or  something, he would put it back. Frank Findley built the cabinets in that  house.  So did they have indoor plumbing in the thirties?  Yes, we had a bathroom there.  Wow. What about electricity?  That came in the thirties. I can   t remember just when. Was it about    37  when we got electricity? It was sometime in the thirties, I remember. It  was wonderful.  Did you have a radio that you would listen to?  Oh, yes. We would gather around to listen to Amos and Andy and Red  Skeleton and the  Grand  Old Opry on Saturday.  The Grand Old Opry?  Yes.  Do you remember Fireside Chats with the president?  No, not really.  Did your parents talk about politics much?  No, they didn   t. We thought Roosevelt did quite a bit for the farmers.  Like what?  Well, like all this soil conservation and things like that.  Did you know many people working on WPA  Works Progress  Administration  projects?  Yes, I did.  What are some WPA projects around Tipton?  Oh, they built lots of restrooms and things like that. What else did they  do? You can still see some signs of WPA things around town, but I can   t  11  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  recall things just right off.  I   ve seen some bridges around.  My husband   s grandfather was a bridge builder. He had these plaques or  whatever you call them, with his name on it, but we   ve never been able  to find one. There was this big barn on the Vernon Farm. He built that  barn. There was one there, but we didn   t get it. I don   t know what  happened to it.  And what was his name?  His grandpa was N.N. Vernon, Nathan Newland Vernon. His dad   s  name was Homer Vernon.  Maybe we   ll find those signs someday. (Laughs)  Yes. (Laughs) It would   ve been nice.  Well, did your parents talk about being in the Depression very much?  Did you know that was what was going on, or was that just how things  were?  Well, I can remember they talked   his brothers, they gathered always at  our house, sat around the stove, and they talked. They tried to figure out  everything, I guess. They were a close family.  And when people would stop by on their way from town to home would  they talk about all kinds of things?  Yes.  Was there lots of gossip?  Well, we were about the last ones west to have a telephone. Daddy has  delivered many death messages, or somebody being in jail. They would  call to get somebody to come and get them out. (Laughter) He was, I  guess you would call him a messenger boy.  So what are some things you would do for entertainment?  We had company, that was the main thing. I always had a lot of  company, my girlfriends. We would be around in the living room.  Mother played the piano and we   d   I couldn   t sing but I had some  friends that could. We   d spend Sunday afternoons doing that.  12  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  Would you play forty-two back then?  I didn   t, but I learned to after I married. That was a big thing, a biggy.  Did you grow up going to church?  I did. I   ve been going on that corner ever since I was three weeks old, I  guess.  And that is to the Tipton Church of Christ?  Right.  Did your family have a car very early on?  Yes, they did, and my daddy, he had one of the   they called them    star  cars    back then, and there was seven of them that went to Canadian,  Texas, and moved the home from Canadian to Tipton. Mother said I was  three weeks old when they came. That was the highway where we lived  back then. I was three weeks old when they came by moving. They  moved the whole home with those seven cars and I said,    Today it  would take all seven of them to get the kid   s toys and clothes in.     (Laughter) That is how times have changed.  So they moved the actual structure?  No.  Okay, just all the contents and everything?  Yes, and the kids.  Wow. And your grandparents were living nearby?  Yes, Mother   s people lived west, south and west of where I was raised.  Daddy   s folks, I never knew them. I never knew I had a grandmother on  that side. They had passed away before my time.  Would you go over to your grandparent   s house very often?  Oh, yes we did. Mother was from a family of twelve kids.  Wow, so you had a lot of cousins running around?  And even when my children were in school down here, they had twenty-three  cousins in school.  13  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Wow.  Because we all grew up here and stayed around back then.  So did all of your family go to church with you? Would you get together  on Sunday afternoons? What kind of events would bring you together?  Well yes, from church. Everybody would go home with somebody or  they would come home with us. Everybody had Sunday dinners back  then. I still love Sunday dinners. I like company.  What are some of your favorite things to cook for Sunday dinner?  Back then it was roast, and now it   s whatever you think of.  Well, what about Christmas? Did you family have some Christmas  traditions?  Oh yes, but back then it meant so much. If the guys got a pair of socks or  a tie, you know, that was great. And I usually got a doll, but all of my  cousins didn   t and I didn   t want to show off my doll, because a lot of  them didn   t get what we did.  Would your family get together on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day?  Christmas Eve, mostly. We would go to Grandma and Grandpa Hasley   s  for Christmas Day, usually.  And have a big feast.  Yes.  What other holidays were celebrated?  Nothing like today, even birthdays back then. I was sixteen before I had  a birthday party. (Laughs) It was a big deal.  Would you go to basketball games or football games or any of that?  I was about grown before I went to any sports activities. I remember the  first ball game I went to. My cousin, Cloys Boyd, came by and picked  me up and took me to the ball game. From then on, we went to every  game they had when my kids were playing.  Was Saturday a big day in Tipton?  14  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  Oh, was it  Indeed it was. The streets were lined and people would come  and shop and stay. I remember Randy   s great-uncle, John Fitzgerald, he  loved to talk. He would sit on the curb, or even sit between the cars and  visit with people.  Just visit about the goings on of the week?  Oh yes, about the farm or whatever.  Did they have drawings?  Oh, they had drawings on Saturday, and Mr. Patton would holler and  holler. Everybody would gather around. You might get twenty-five  dollars, I don   t remember, but it was a treat. Back then, Tipton never has  been a big town but it has always been a good town. It had lots of  businesses. Of course, those days are gone. At one time, we had about  seven grocery stores. There was a filling station on every corner, it  seemed like. Even downtown where the post office is now, there was  one there. There is one a block east, out north there was one on both  corners, down south of the school there was two, one on each side of the  road, and going around the curve there was one there. They had a  croquet set, and people would go down there and play croquet.  And have a picnic?  No, just play.  Was there a theater?  Yes, at one time we had two, but I only went to one. The one that Lilly  Edmondson and her sister ran, that one.  And was that a movie theater?  Yes, it was, and on Saturdays they had the preview. When you got  grown, you got to go to the preview.  Do you remember the first film you saw?  Not really. I just remember going to Frederick to see Gone with the  Wind. And Shirley Temple, she was a real little actress.  Do you remember hearing about the start of World War II?  Do I  On December 7, 1941, it was Noyce   s fourteenth birthday. He had  15  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  a bunch of boys out for dinner, and they were playing football east of the  house where we lived. Robert and I were sitting in the living room  listening to the radio, and it came on that Pearl Harbor had been  bombed. That was 1941. We married in June of    42. He left, joined the  Navy. Left for the Navy in November of    42. Then he came home in  1945.  I have been from one coast to the other. I   ve been to California two  times, I know. And then I lived in Detroit, that was my first place. Then  I lived in Newport, Rhode Island and Philadelphia. I remember going to  Grand Central Station, going through there, but I   d never been away  from home. You talk about    I was I guess you   d say a little ignorant.  (Laughs) No wonder my daddy worried   What year was it you graduated high school?     42.  How did you meet your husband?  Well, we were raised here, and I ran around with his sisters and his  cousin. That is how we met.  Was he a few years older in school?  He was two years older than I was, but he didn   t graduate. He did get his  diploma a few years ago. The boys that were in the service that didn   t  get to graduate, they had a special thing on Veteran   s Day and I have his  diploma there in the hall.  So he was still in high school when he had to go to the service?  Well, he would   ve been another year. He was behind me in school.  Oh, he was behind you, okay.  Yes, but he was older than I was. But anyhow, that is how that all took  place.  Where did you get married?  In the living room in our home. Jane Killebrew, a dear friend of mine,  that was the first church wedding I had ever been to.  When was that?  16  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon     46 I believe. 1946, I think that is right.  Did you have your own home with him or did you live with family after  you got married for the few months he was still around?  Daddy bought a place west of where we lived. There was a house there  and we fixed that up and that was where we lived until he went into the  Navy.  Did you live on your own, or did you live with your parents while he was  gone?  Well, I lived with my parents but then, like I said, the first place I went  was Detroit, Michigan, by train.  What year was that?  Well, I guess that was    43. And we didn   t wear slacks back then. I can  remember getting off the train. It was so cold; it was like an instant  freeze on my legs. I   ll never forget that feeling.  So what was your first job?  I worked in Grant   s 5   10 Cent Store in Newport, Rhode Island. There  was a hurricane coming, and we had put all the under stock up. I  remember running home or wherever the apartment was. They rented  every room and closet they had to the service people back then, you  know. I lived with a family, and then there was a couple  rooms  that  had a curtain  in the doorway , it didn   t have doors. There was another  bedroom on that side and then three on the other side. Oh, I remember  running back to where I stayed and material back then drew up if it got  wet. I had a short dress by the time I got home  (Laughter)  Where all did he serve in World War II?  He was on the USS Oakland to start with, and that was all in the Pacific.  Then when we went to the east coast, they christened the USS Los  Angeles, and he was on that and went down through the Panama Canal,  which one of our President   s gave away. I don   t like that. We may need  it someday. But anyhow, then he came around to San Diego, and that   s  when I went to California for the first time.  So while he was gone could you communicate with letters?  We did, but he would go months without getting any mail. We had a  little something worked out to kind of know where he was. He   d say,    I  17  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  think I   ll see so and so from Tipton.    That would tell us kind of where     we knew where they were so that would kind of tell us where he was.  Were there a lot of boys from Tipton that left?  Oh yes, and a lot that were killed. You know, growing up with all of  them, I have a Tillman County book with all the service people, pictures,  and details about them.  How did the community change when all those young boys left?  They hung together. They hung together and supported each other.  Did they have to find people to help out on the farm from other places?  We had a Prisoner of War camp here in Tipton, German prisoners. They  would go out and gather, pick cotton and things like that.  What was that camp called?  I don   t know. It was about two or three blocks down here.  Do you know about how many prisoners of war there were?  No. But they were just like our boys, you know what I mean. They  weren   t mean or anything. In fact, some stayed here and married girls  from here   the guards, of course.  When did you come back to Tipton?  Whenever he would leave, I would head home. I think we were in  Philadelphia in July of    45 when the war was over. I know we had just     how we got that message   well there were telegrams back then that his  Grandmother Vernon had passed away. I remember looking out the  window of the hotel or something where we were with mobs of people  in the street, I remember that.  And there was a lot of celebration?  Yes. And then let   s see, I know he was home by 1945. He came into San  Diego, California. Then he came to Norman, Oklahoma, to be  discharged. Then we, like I said, fixed up that little old house. The  kitchen, of course there was no running water or anything, but Daddy  put in a sink and a little pitcher pump. So, we had water in the house.  Then later he added a bathroom for us.  18  L. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  So did you all farm when you moved back?  Yes, Daddy was a good provider. He helped all of us kids. He helped  Noyce get started in farming, too. Then Pebbie and Lota were married  and already into it. He gave them the equal amount of money he spent  on us, so he was a good man. (Laughs)  Did you ever get to help in the cotton fields?  I didn   t, no. Lots of them did, but back then most farmers had a hired  hand, you know.  Did you ever see many Native Americans in the area?  No, but we could hear the drums a lot of times at night that were north in  the Indian  camps , where they were.  Do you know what tribe that would   ve been?  No, I don   t. There were several different tribes up there.  Where is up there?  North of here. It was in hearing distance, I can remember those   Boom   Boom  Boom    you know.  Near Otter Creek?  It was north of that, I think. No, I didn   t see much of them.  Were there any hobos or gypsies that would come through with the  railroad?  Oh yes. We lived on the highway. Many of them would stop. Robert   s  folks lived south and east of Tipton, but the railroad went through their  farm and they would come and ask for something. I remember Robert   s  mother, they always gave them something. He just stuck his hand inside  the door and she just put some food in there. We never turned anybody  away. There were some  gypsies  but the hobos mostly. Of course, us  living on the highway, we had quite a few visitors.  And would most people have cars that stopped in, or would they be on  foot?  There was a lot on foot, but one night it was raining, dark, and we had a  fence around our house. We could hear somebody calling and hollering.  19  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  Daddy went out and it was this woman, she had had car trouble west of  where we were. I think she had children with her. Anyhow, we brought  her in, got them dried off and warm, I remember that. You weren   t  afraid of people back then like you are today.  Would you ever lock your doors?  We usually locked the screens, but not like we do today.  What are some values that you learned growing up that you have  carried with you throughout your life?  Well, I had good, honest parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, all that I  think influenced my life. They were faithful Christians, and of course  that pays off wonderfully well, on and on. Then back to our life, when  Robert came back we started farming. We had our first baby, a beautiful  baby, but she was stillborn. They brought her back to the hospital for me  to see, which was very unusual back then. But she was a beautiful,  perfect baby, I remember that.  What year was that?     46. Then Dennis was born, our oldest son, Dennis Boyd Vernon. He  was born in 1948. He was born at Frederick. Then Randall was born in  1951, May of    51, and he was born in Altus. It had come a flood and  Mother and Daddy were over there. Dennis had been in the hospital with  pneumonia. They couldn   t go back home the usual way because of the  flood, so they had to go back around through Snyder and then back  home. I just didn   t know. I was afraid he wouldn   t live until I got home.  Then here came Beckie Jane. She was born in 1956. She was born in  Altus, and of course having a little girl, that was good.  My kids always had lots of company. They had a pony, and the kids  remember that. I remember Dennis had a slumber party, I think when he  was in the eighth grade, a bunch of boys. Well, when we got ready to  take them home, back to town, we couldn   t find this Ricky   oh what  was, I can   t think of his last name   we looked everywhere for him. He  was up in the loft of the barn laying down watching the horses eat hay,  and had gone to sleep. (Laughter) But everybody had kids, and when  you had a lot of cousins, we always had a lot of company.  So a really close-knit community here.  Yes. Even the Wilsons were our good friends. (Laughter) We spent lots  of visits together, we did.  20  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  When did Tipton start changing? When did the seven grocery stores get  down to one grocery store?  Let   s see, all the rural area began to go down. It was thickly populated.  Every section had several houses on it. I mean, well at least two and  sometimes more. Usually there was a little house of people that helped  on the farm. Of course, that made our school big, but the rural area was  so thickly populated back then. We had two drug stores, we had the  movie theater, and we had a Wal-Mart store in my day, and it was called  Benton   s. You could buy just anything there. They had a tractor agency,  a garage, a funeral home. We even had a J.C. Penney   s at one time. You  can still see it on the north side of the street there, J.C. Penney.  Does it still have a J.C. Penney sign on it somewhere?  As far as I know, it   s in the entrance way. I guess it   s still there, I don   t  know. I haven   t walked on that street lately.  Is that down from the Senior Citizen   s Center?  It   s in the next block, that way.  Close to where the old post office used to be?  Yes, on the north side there. Let   s see, dry goods stores, we had   I   ve  heard this told, that people from eastern Oklahoma would come here and  pick cotton through the season, and everybody went to town on  Saturday, as we said before. Jemison and Lee was a popular department  store then, and they would let so many in and shop. They   d go out the  back door and they   d let so many more in. We had a variety store and it  was wonderful. You could just buy so much there.  There was  Mattie   s,  and they had one before that. Arthur Smith ran it back then, from candy  to dishes and material and shoes. I remember you could buy a pair of  high-top, black tennis shoes for forty-nine cents. I felt so sorry for the  kids that had to wear those, I really did. Today, they pay big dollars for  them and wear them with dress clothes. (Laughter)  Were there many restaurants?  Oh yes, and bars. We had the Bloody Bucket. (Laughter) We had   oh, I  don   t know how many more bars we had. We had a killing on the streets  of Tipton.  Really?  More than one.  21  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  When was that?  Dennis was about e two years old, and Mother had brought him to town  and bought him some little brown and white saddle oxfords. That was  when Fay Jones killed Jack MacDonald. Mother and Dennis had just left  the store and been gone about ten minutes when Jack was shot.  Where was he shot?  There on the west street     Just out on the street?  Yes. Well, he rolled under a car and he was shot again. Tipton used to be  pretty rough, they tell me. (Laughs)  One fellow, the grocery store man, was collecting a bill and     Yes, shot. Mr. Maley, wasn   t that his name, that R.T. Jones shot just a  little ways down that way?  What about the local newspaper?  It was great, the Tipton Tribute. The people that I remember that ran it  were Chet and Vera Holding. It was a great little paper. Back then, you  got the news from Manitou and Laing, who had company and who did  this and that. That   s how I got acquainted with different people, is  reading the paper.  So when did the Tipton paper stop production?  Oh, I don   t know. I can   t even guess when it might be.  I think the late sixties.  Fifties?  Sixties or seventies.  Yes, because I remember when the kids were in school we kept  everything back then.  Alan and Edna Minger ran The Tipton Tribune.   Now we have Mary Ellen Grose that puts out the little Tipton  newspaper, weekly. It   s kind of like a little letter from home to people.  Was there just one cotton gin?  22  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  Oh no, there were many. I think at one time there were five.  What would that be like when it was cotton season?  They would bring their wagons and line them up and then gin them out.  Yes, it was a big thing.  And the burrs, what did they do to those cotton burrs?  I think they fed them to the cattle.  And they burned them there.  Yes, they had that big old burn thing. I think it   s still standing, maybe, or  it was not long ago. Of course, we had   I guess it was commissioners  back then. We had road graders that were pulled with horses. I  remember Chase Gough was the mail carrier. (Laughs) Of course,  everybody had a Montgomery Ward and Sears and Roebuck Catalog.  That   s how you got your material for your school dresses, ordered  mostly.  Did your mom make most of your clothing?  Oh yes, all my life. Up even after we were grown, she made everything.  And she sewed for the public. At one time she had about seventy-five  customers. Teachers and everything, she   d make dresses and suits, and  good old polyester was in style back then, which lasted forever and  never faded. You didn   t have to iron it. (Laughs)  Was there a home demonstration club in this area?  Oh, very many. Circle Valley Club was one. There were others, Busy  Bee.  Would you ever have a home demonstration agent that came out to your  house?  Yes, they usually had meetings, club meetings.  Did your mom quilt?  Did she?  I   ll give you a tour of the house. It is full of them. Many,  many, many. I hope the kids treasure them like they should because  there are many, many, many stitches on them. I   ll show them to you.  23  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  R. Wilson  What have we not covered?  I don   t know. My husband was from a family of   they had six children  in his family and they were good people.  When did he pass away?  In 2000, October 2000.  What is your profession now?  Jack of all trades and master of none. (Laughter) I didn   t work out  of  the home . I didn   t know it was necessary. I thought if you were a  mother and a wife, that was the greatest calling in life. And it is. But I  didn   t work. Had I worked, I   d probably be better off today, but I didn   t.  Not a lot of people did back then. They worked on the farm or in their  whatever.  So what are some of the jobs you have now?  Well, I sell Avon.  That keeps you busy, doesn   t it?  Yes, I   ve been at it thirty-six years, so yes.  It keeps you connected with people.  Yes, I like people. You learn a lot. I   ve had a full life, and of course my  kids, I   m proud of them.  I have Dennis, Randall, and Beckie. Dennis  and Randall both went to OSU, and some of their kids have gone there,  too. Beckie went to Oklahoma Christian. I have seven grandchildren and  three great-grandchildren. Of my grandchildren, Rod Vernon, Rick and  his wife Mary Vernon, and Rebecca Vernon Reed all went to OSU.  Robert Wade Vernon joined the US Army, and Cody Howdeshell went  to Texas A M. Then I have Haley and Katie Howdeshell. My great-grandchildren  are Gage and Tyson Vernon and Lillian Raenell Reed.   When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  My friends are a great treasure, and family of course is first. We   re down  to just a few classmates anymore, so I guess I   m the oldest one in my  class left. We still have two   well we   re just dwindling.  You still work with the funeral home?  24  Vernon  L. Wilson  Vernon  L. Wilson  Yes, I   ve been working for the Tipton Funeral Home since 1992. That  has been a good thing, a good experience for me. People say,    I don   t  know how you stand it.    I say,    Well, I know everybody. I love  everybody, and it   s good.    I   m glad I can.  Well, thank you so much for visiting with me.  I hope I haven   t taken too much time.  Oh, no. (Laughter)  -------  -------
