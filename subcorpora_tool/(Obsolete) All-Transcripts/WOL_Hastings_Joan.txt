Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Today is June 24, 2008. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and we are conducting an oral  history project called Women of the Oklahoma Legislature. Today I   m  with Joan Hastings Camp. She served in the House from 1974 to 1984.  We are at the OSU-Tulsa campus. Thank you for joining me today.  Oh, happy to.  Let   s start by having you tell a little bit about your childhood, your  parents, where you were born   that type of thing.  I had a wonderful childhood. I grew up in Drumright, Oklahoma and  had a great neighborhood with lots and lots of children to play with.  Things were so much easier then. We could take five mile hikes and our  parents didn   t worry about it, out in the woods catching tadpoles and  chasing frogs and whatever. It was a really great childhood, just relaxed.  I loved growing up on the farm. I became quite a tomboy and rode  horses, just everything a little tomboy girl would do.  Did you have siblings?  I had two sisters, but they were eight and nine years older. That has all  the disadvantages of an only child, without the advantages of an only  child. (Laughs)  And what did your parents do?  My mother was the county health nurse. My dad was deceased. We  lived in my grandmother   s house with my grandmother.  Very fun. Learned how to cook then.  5  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Oh, did I ever  From the very beginning, by the time I was old enough  to stand on a box, she started me.  And then you got interested in politics when?  I think probably when I was about eight years old. I remember that  Leon C.    Red    Phillips was Governor of Oklahoma. He was a relative.  We called him Uncle Red, but I think he was my father   s second cousin  or cousin or something. I don   t know where it was, but something like  that. But anyway, when he ran for governor, I was just little bitty. My  mother was working very hard and handing out finger nail files that said,     Vote for Leon C.    Red    Phillips,    and so I went along. That was my  first brush, you might say, with politics.  In high school did you take government and social studies?  I took a lot of history. I really liked history. But no, I had no interest in  high school in politics that I can actually remember. I did in the  presidential elections and such, I   d kind of get interested in who was  running, but 21 looked a long way off.  Do you remember casting your first vote?  Oh yes. It was for Dwight D. Eisenhower.  Really?  And I was just 21 in October and that election was in November. I had  become active in the Young Republicans at Tulsa University. That was  a fun thing for me in the beginning and then it got a little more serious.  Then I got elected Miss Republican and that led to all kinds of little  adventures. I actually got to know Perle Mesta and Pearl Sayer, both  hostesses from Oklahoma. Of course, they made the movie about Perle  Mesta, but Pearl Sayer was just as elegant. That was fun. That was  from being Miss Republican. Then I got to go to Washington D.C. and  actually ride an elephant down Pennsylvania Avenue. That was a lark   That was just something nobody can believe  It was great fun.  How did that come about?  Well, when I was Miss Republican I was entered in a state centennial  contest representing the republicans. The Shrine Circus was in Tulsa. I  got an offer to ride in the parade with the Shrine Circus and lead the  parade, as a matter of fact, on an elephant. Well, riding an elephant just  sounded like a wonderful thing to me. I thought that was great. So I  did. And I found out you have to shave an elephant with some type of  6  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  torch. If you don   t, they   re really prickly. They   ve got really bad hair.  That   s why they wear those I hops on their heads to sit on. So I was  okay. Mine had been shaved completely, and it was fun. But there was  another girl who represented the Shrine. She decided that if I was going  to ride in her parade that she was going to ride too. She put on this little  bitty, short, harem type outfit, and she rode the circus elephant for the  Shrine, and it hadn   t been shaved. She was miserable, just miserable.  My elephant that led the parade was from the Tulsa Zoo, and she was  very well trained by Hugh Davis. She just did everything right, and she  was smooth. So I had a lot of fun. Anyway, our congressman Page  Belcher thought it would be great fun to help the Young Republicans. I  went to the Young Republican National Convention in Washington, and  they were going to have a parade, and I don   t know exactly how they  worked it all out, but they did. And I got to ride the elephant down  Pennsylvania Avenue and I have pictures of it.  Had it been shaved?  Yes, it was fine. (Laughs)  That would have been very neat, a lot of people watching, too.  Yes. Of course here in Oklahoma, I wore an Indian costume, and it was  all leather. Well that   s pretty protective, really. And in Washington,  that was in the days of the crinoline underskirts   I must have had on  four cancans and a big, blue skirt over that    (Laughs)  What time of the year would that have been?  That was in May, the first part of May.  The weather was okay then.  Yes, it was pretty. The cherry blossoms had just finished, if I remember  right. Gosh, that   s a long time ago, Tanya.  What was your major in college?  I majored in education, in special education. I taught special education  for a while, and I also taught physical education. I loved children, so  teaching was a good thing, but then I found out there was such a need  for the special education teachers, so I did that. I owned my private  swimming school, Aqua Tots, for 32 years. I taught many children to  swim. I was an early pioneer in special needs children learning to swim.  I received the John F. Kennedy award for my work with handicapped  7  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  children.  And what got you interested in running for a political office?  Well, I consistently said I never would, that it just would never ever  happen, but there came a time in my life when I   d had a tremendous  tragedy and I was just kind of drifting, and my Young Republican  friends decided that I would run for office. Well, the man that I had to  run against in the republican primary had only lost to the incumbent by  15 votes in a recount two years before. So it didn   t look like a very good  opportunity. I was smart enough to realize that it surely didn   t look very  winnable. But they were just gung-ho,    Please Joan, do it. You need to  do something. You   re really going into depression deeply, and this will  pull you out and make you work. You   ve got to work; you   ve got to do  something.    So, I think I was just kind of railroaded into it, to tell you  the truth.  My husband was agreeable, because he never for a minute believed I  could win. I think some other people weren   t too sure I could win  either, but they were going to get me busy and make me do something I  was interested in. Well, it had different results than we expected. We  won. I   m really proud of it. My bridge club, my Sunday school class,  and the Young Republicans, that   s what I had to work with. We raised  money, not a tremendous overage of money, but we raised enough  money. We won every single precinct in the district by large amounts. I  was just overwhelmed by what happened. I couldn   t believe it. I still  can   t believe it.  Then we had the general election. Well that was with a very handsome  democrat man named Ray Mullins. He had been a sportscaster, and he  was always, winter and summer, very tan, prematurely gray hair, big  beaming white teeth smile   oh,    Mr. Glamour,    and strong democrat  support. The area I had was all of south Tulsa. That   s east, west, to the  county lines. A lot of that area at the time was heavy democrat  precincts. Bixby was heavy democrat then, Glenpool, Jenks was heavy  democrat. That   s all changed, but that was all big time democrat. I had  up to 41st Street on the north. Of course there were some republican  strongholds in that area. I thought it was an amazing thing   we won by  the highest plurality in the whole United States.  Gosh  That   s saying a lot too.  It was just amazing.  How did you do it then?  8  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Worked. I mean the volunteers were just outstanding. They were on the  phones, ringing those phones; I would knock on someone   s door, and the  person would come to the door, I would say,    Hello, I   m Joan Hastings.  I   m running for       And they   d say,    You   re Joan Hastings?       Yes.        Well your office is on my phone.    And sure enough, they were talking  to my office at the same time I was knocking on the door. That happened  many, many times. I just had tremendous volunteers. Also I did work  the precincts. I knocked those doors.  Oh, I forgot to tell you, in the Bixby area, I had three horses. I had a  huge English riding horse that was eighteen and half hands tall. The  horsemen will know that   s tall  The only way I could get on him was to  get to a fence or get to a porch or something. I couldn   t get on him from  the ground. I had a little Pinto and I had a Morgan quarter horse. They  had to be exercised. Out in the Bixby area, all of the houses were acres  apart. Some of them were like an acre, two acres, maybe five acres, but I  had a big Cadillac, and in the real hot sun, start-stop, start-stop, start-stop.  It was ruining it. It went out on me several times, so I decided that  my horses need exercise and I   m a good rider, that   s what I   d do. So I  campaigned the whole south district, even when I got over into  Glenpool, I got a horse trailer and took my horses over there. I   d ride  one in the morning and a different one in the afternoon. I   d ride up to  the houses, and as long as I was on the Morgan quarter horse, I would  get off and go knock on the door, unless somebody happened to be in the  yard or something, but I really couldn   t get off of that great big one  unless there was some place to get back on.  During that time when I   d leave the Morgan and just let him stand,  people would say,    Aren   t you afraid your horse will run away?       No,  my horse wouldn   t run away. He   s very well trained.    I prayed my  horse wouldn   t run away  (Laughs) But there usually wasn   t any place  to tie him. The big English riding horse, a beautiful, gray animal, I  didn   t get off of him. I rode him, usually on weekends when people  were out in the yard working and that sort of thing. There are still  people today that see me in restaurants and laugh and say they remember  when I rode up to their house on that great big horse and asked for their  vote. It worked. Obviously it just worked. I rode the Pinto a little bit,  but he was wild.  Did you do that for each campaign then, or just the first one?  Never had another campaign.  Never? You didn   t have any opponents?  No. I served ten years and there was never another opponent. So we  9  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  must have scared them out the first time. (Laughs)  That was before term limits. You could have kept running.  Yes, I could have kept running, but my mother and father were really  getting old, and I didn   t have my sisters   they were deceased. I was the  only one to take care of them, and I didn   t want to leave. I was literally  being handed a Senate seat, and oh I wanted it Tanya. I really wanted it.  But I came home, and by then I   d been active in the National  Association of Legislators and was an officer, going to be president the  next year, and just all kinds of things. The Women Legislators  Association, I was elected there, so I was gone a lot, even in the off  term. Well, I looked at my mother and step-father and said,    This isn   t  going to work.    There was nobody to take care of them and they were  too old, and that   s just the way it was. So I went back and announced  I   d be leaving the House and that I would not run for the Senate after all.  Oh, it hurt. But I knew that   s what I had to do.  Well, then an amazing thing happened. I don   t think it was even a week  after I made that announcement that the Tulsa County clerk died. There  were already two people, maybe three in the race. Republican primaries,  by the way, were very unusual then. We didn   t have enough republicans  to have primaries, basically. So my friends started telling me I was  going to run for that. I told them they were crazy. I   d never tried a  county-wide race, and it was not an acceptable situation. I was wrong.  They won again, and we jumped right in that. By the time I got in, there  were eight or nine in that primary. There had never been that many  people in a republican primary in this state before. Well, it worked out  very well. The same volunteers, bridge club, Sunday school class,  Young Republicans, and here they came. We worked really hard and we  won it real big.  And you were there how long?  16 years. No opposition there either. It was just a charmed life.  Sounds like it   Each time I   d kind of get ready and think,    Oh boy, here we go,    and it  didn   t materialize.  Let   s back up a little bit to your first election and the election night. Do  you remember much about your first election night?  Yes. I remember being totally overwhelmed by the margin that we won  by and looking around at all my friends. The tears were for the friends  10  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  that had worked so hard. I just couldn   t believe that they promoted me  into that. And then of course I didn   t really quite know yet what they  had promoted me into. (Laughs) But the overwhelming gratitude was  the biggest part of it. I wasn   t yet thinking about actually going into  office. That took a little bit to sink in.  Did they all go to the swearing in ceremony?  You wouldn   t believe it. They rented two MK O buses and filled them,  I mean filled them. There were some cars going too, because the buses  were filled. We almost filled the gallery in the House with just my  volunteers. That made a strange impression on the other representatives,  not altogether good. They thought I was just bragging, I guess. I was  the first female person to be elected from the east side of I-35, which  you know is the divider in Oklahoma. No other woman from the eastern  half had ever won. So we were kind of a cause to celebrate in its own  way, but then to fill the gallery with volunteers   that looked a little  presumptuous. We didn   t mean it that way, but that   s how it looked to  them. So I wouldn   t say that was the best foot to start on, but it worked.  And later I   ll tell you a story about how well it worked for me on  something.  Well go ahead if you want, while you   re thinking of it.  Okay. One of the first bills I had, well one of the first, the very first bill  was to computerize the Supreme Court records. Now you can imagine  in    74 computers weren   t in yet, and for me to go over there, a brand  new person, and write to computerize the Supreme Court records, which  Marian Opala had asked me to do, I   m not saying I was bright enough to  think of it, but it did pass. It was very hard fought and it was difficult in  passage, because they didn   t know what computerization was, and you  don   t mess with the Supreme Court. Well, we did.  Then the next thing was to cure the flooding in Bixby. We had eleven  hundred homes that flooded every time, just small rains could flood  them. Haikey Creek and Joe Creek were always out of their banks, so it  wouldn   t take much to cure that. I knew that years and years before that  I had written an inter-local cooperation bill and just taken it to a  legislative friend to cure a park program here in Tulsa. It allowed  counties, cities, states, any entity of government to monetarily cooperate  with any other entity of government under the circumstances of the  written contracts and such, so I knew it could work. I was immediately  told by the House Speaker that that would not be legal. I could not get  state conservation money for a district   s flood control. I didn   t believe  him. I knew that Jim Jones, our democrat congressman, was going to try  and help me get some federal money for it, so I did it anyway.  11  Finchum  Hastings  Well then I got called to the governor   s office. Governor Boren said,     Representative Hastings, you cannot pass this bill. I promised the  people there would be no new boards, committees, agencies, anything  that required money, nothing new. We   ve got to settle this budget.     Well, we had eleven hundred homes flooding, so I didn   t pay attention  to him either. I went on with it. I got a lot of co-authors to help me, but  every time the bill was going to come up for a vote, my co-authors  would get approached by the governor   s office and they   d disappear off  of the co-author list.  Interesting.  So it was very difficult to find enough votes for that particular thing. I  did, finally. There was a bill being offered by a Tulsa republican  representative who was going to make it illegal to raise cocks to fight.  You couldn   t have them period. Well he had the SPCA helping him,  which is pretty considerable. The representatives from southeastern  Oklahoma, particularly, were very upset about that, and they didn   t want  that bill to pass. They were the very ones who had been giving me some  trouble. So I went to them and said,    You want your bill to pass? I   ll  kill the cock fighting bill if you   ll pass my bill.    They said,    Ha  What  makes you think you can?    And I said,    What makes you think I can   t?  You don   t have anything else to go with.    So John Monks of Muskogee  and Evan Dunn, they said,    We don   t think you can do it.    I said,     Well, I   m telling you I can.     Anyway, I did kill the cock fighting bill, and they then passed my flood  control bill, and it went to the Senate. Well when it got to the Senate,  the senator from the far southeast area loaded my bill up with a lot more  money. I wasn   t asking for very much money. I was asking for  80,000  dollars, which to cure eleven hundred homes, that   s not a lot. Well  anyway, he loaded it up with like  300,000 dollars for his district. Uh-oh.  That meant it had to come back and pass the House again. So I  went down to the conservation director and asked him to show me this  creek that this  300,000 dollars was going to cure. It was a dry creek  bed that hadn   t had water in it in years. It was a set up. His  representative over on the House of Representatives side, put some more  money in it when it came back to the House. Well now I   m carrying a  half a million dollars, and  300,000 of it   s for a dry creek bed. They  didn   t think I knew that.  So I went to the House member and told him,    Do you remember all of  those bus loads of volunteers that came over with me for swearing in?     He said,    Well how could we forget them?    I said,    Well I   ll tell you  what I   m going to do. If you and senator so-and-so don   t take that  money out of my bill, I   m going to bring those bus loads and some more  12  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  right into your district. And when the election comes, we   re going to  knock on every door and tell them what you did to eleven hundred  Oklahoma families. And you won   t come back over here. You   re going  to be through.    He said,    Well now Hastings, just don   t get mad about  it.    I said,    I am mad about it. You get that money out of my bill, or I  promise you neither one of you will get back over here. We   ll do what  we have to do.    They took it out of the bill. They knew I would do it.  (Laughs) So my volunteers being in the balcony did, finally, help. It  definitely helped because they believed me by then. And I would have.  So it was an adventure.  It sounds like I would make these people mad. They didn   t really get  mad. They just kind of thought it was surprising and didn   t know I had  it in me. But they just kept testing, constantly testing. So being a  female representative, you had to really be on your toes all of the time.  Sounds like it.  You really did. I   m trying to think of some of the other ones. Oh, I  passed the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs bill, to form that agency.  That   s another one  Governor  Boren got in on and told me,    That   s two.  You cannot, in my regime, have a new agency, board, or commission.     Same thing, we needed it. We really needed it. They were trying to do  narcotics work with OSBI  Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation   agents that were not allowed to wear cowboy boots or have long hair.  They had to wear coats and ties.  Kind of hard to be undercover that way.  You can   t do that. So it was a very, very hard fought bill. I guess it was  my hardest one. No, not quite. There was one other that was worse, but  it was almost the hardest one. And we did ultimately get it through. It  took a lot of work, and I had to stand those same people up in the corner  and say,    No, no, no     They put up with it.  Something like that would happen during the course of one session or a  year or two?  It was very the first   it was in the first four months of Boren   s  governorship. Now he meant well. Let me tell you, he meant well. We  need to do that right now. We are opening so many new agencies and  boards and commissions, and we   re putting money in all of them.  They   re good charitable things, but we can   t afford them. And that   s  what Governor Boren was doing, was pulling that back. Well, he did a  good job of pulling it back, it just so happened that those two things that  I did, I felt my eleven hundred families and then I felt my Narcotics and  13  Dangerous Drugs bill was important enough to challenge. It was a really  hard fight, but both of them did get through. Not many others did. So  for a freshman, that was kind of different.  And part of my success came from the craziest thing you   ll ever hear of.  I got put on the Wildlife Committee. Well, I   ve hunted since I was a  child. I told you I grew up in Drumright. I had a BB-gun probably by  the time I was six. That   s just the way of life. So when I grew older, I  rabbit hunted and squirrel hunted and quail hunted and duck hunted, and  that was the norm for me, and I continued that through adulthood. Well,  my friends here in Tulsa wanted someone on the Wildlife Committee  that they could talk to about the duck laws and all the other game laws.  Harold Stewart was real close friends with the Governor and the Speaker  and the Pro Tempore, and he and the men from Ducks Unlimited  requested that I be put on the Wildlife Committee. I didn   t ask for the  Wildlife Committee. I found out I was on it, and I thought,    Oh dear.  For a female representative, this is probably not wise. So I will just go  sit real quiet and I   ll try not to get into anything, just vote.    That was  my full intention.  I went to the first Wildlife Committee meeting, and they had this  ridiculous bill to make your hunting license come due in your birthday  month. Well, I   m a duck hunter, and I sat there and thought about that.  We can   t do that. You   ve got to put a federal duck stamp pasted right  onto your Oklahoma hunting license. It   s got to be pasted on, the law  says it. You   ve got to put that on on January 1st. For those like me,  whose birthday is later in the year, then if we have to get a new  Oklahoma hunting license, we   ve got to buy another duck stamp, which  I think was  16 dollars, if I remember right. Well the sportsmen would  be furious. It isn   t that much money really, but the principal behind it  was going to make them really mad. So I sat there and thought,    No,  this will go away.    They had the discussion and thought that was a  wonderful idea. So finally I held up my hand. Representative Converse  said,    The lady representative   s got something to say,    very disparaging  like. And I just asked,    What about the duck hunters?    They all looked  kind of like    huh?    Converse didn   t even take the bill off of the agenda  or anything. He just pushed it aside and said,    Next bill.    It wasn   t  disposed of any other way, just pushed to the side and said next bill. So  that was the end of that.  But then in about two weeks, Hollis Roberts, who was a new  representative who came in when I did, came over and said,    Boy Joan,  what about that blanket donkey coon hunt? Aren   t we going to have a  great time?    And I said,    Why yes. You guys will just have a  wonderful time. I think that   ll be super for you.    He said,    What   s this     for you    stuff? You   re one of us.    And I said,    Oh, now wait. I don   t  14  anticipate going with the Wildlife Committee on your hunts and  different things. I don   t plan to do that. I   m just a member of the  committee. He said,    That   s what I   m saying. You are a member of the  committee and if we do, you do.    Uh-oh  I said,    Well Hollis, I wasn   t  invited, so let   s not worry about it.    Oh no, that wasn   t good enough.  Hollis leaves my desk and literally sprints to the front of the room where  the big dog democrats set. He brings Lonnie Abbott back who is hosting  the hunt. It was on Judge Busby   s ranch and Lonnie said,    Well we  didn   t know you didn   t get an invitation. Of course we want you to  come     I was thinking how I was going to get out of this. I didn   t even  know what a blanket donkey coon hunt was. I said,    Well tell him not to  worry.    No, nothing was going to do, I had to go. I said,    Well if I have  to go, then I   m going to bring my secretary and another friend, because  I   m not going on this by myself.    He said,    Oh that   s all right, we   ve  got plenty of room, plenty of room. It   ll be all right.     Well, I go home, and my Bixby campaign manager Dorothy Watkin   s  husband was a coon hunter. So I asked Dorothy,    What is this blanket  donkey coon hunt?    Well it turns out the donkeys are all trained to jump  the fences if you put their blanket on it. They   re trained to their own  special blanket. If you put the blanket over a bush, they   ll jump over the  bush. If you put it over a fence, they   ll jump over the fence. She said,     You have to wear a hard hat with a light on it strapped under your chin,  because you   re going to be going right through the woods, running. You  have to wear insulating coveralls, because it   s going to be bitter cold,  and insulated gloves. You have to have the thick ones, because running  through the brush will tear up your hands. Oh boy  And boots, heavy  boots.    Well, being a hunter I already had that, and I had the insulated  coveralls. She provided the hard hat with a wheat light on it. This is  just like a construction hard hat. I took some extra clothes of that kind  for my helpers.  So we went to the hunt. One of the funniest things, Tanya, I have ever  seen in my life. The ranch women came from all over and prepared a  big dinner for everybody. The Chamber of Commerce came. It was a  big thing for the community. We didn   t go out until midnight. So at  midnight, everybody   s there to watch us go. It was the bitterest, coldest  night that it had been in Oklahoma in, I think, 32 or 22 years, something  like that, a long time. Now we   re out there getting on the donkeys.  Kenny Converse was about 6   4       or 6   5       and he   s kind of bowlegged.  He   s so tall. He gets on this little jenny, and Lonnie Abbott is shorter  and kind of chubby. He also gets on his donkey. It looks like Ichabod  Crane and Friar Tuck got loose in the night. I started laughing. I  couldn   t stop laughing. They   re the ones, they   re Wildlife Committee  heads, they   ve got to lead the parade, you know. So a full moonlit night,  and here goes everybody on these donkeys.  15  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Well, Senator John Dawl had brought me a trained jenny, as they call it.  I couldn   t believe that little donkey. She could single foot right and  single foot left. She could canter and gallop. She was a gated donkey. I  never heard of such a thing. She was as good as my English riding  horse. So my ride was very pleasant. We got to the first fence and I go  kind of off away from them. I ripped my blanket off that   s behind my  saddle and put it on the fence, and sure enough, that little donkey goes  over that fence, just boom. I climbed over the best way I could, rolled  up the blanket, put it back on, got on the donkey, and here we go again.  The dogs would be baying. The men would say,    There   s old Belle,  there   s old Blue.    They had all these names. They knew the sounds  from the dogs. I had never experienced anything like that. It was fun. It  was different, but I won my spurs. The men never for a minute believed  I   d go   number one, definitely I wouldn   t be able to keep up   number  two, I would hate it   number three and none of those things happened.  Had any of them bothered to tell you about the blanket and the fence?  Nothing. Nothing. No, they were giggling to themselves before we  went, thinking,    Oh, boy, this is going to be a big prank on Hastings.  This is really going to be funny.    Then, they had a skeet shoot. Well,  like I told you, I shot all my life. I did real well. And you know what,  they accepted me after that. It made all the difference in the world. I  could feel the attitude change.  What else did you hunt?  Well, later through the years, there was a pheasant hunt every year and it  was way out in the Pandhandle. Oh, this is one of the priceless ones. So  we   re out in the panhandle for this pheasant hunt in Lawton. The  Lawton Chamber of Commerce was sponsoring it. It   s a three day hunt,  and there are banquets at night. Everybody comes in, the Chamber of  Commerce, the ranchers, and such. The second day of the hunt   they  had guides for us who would take us out and put us in the fields. Well,  when you pheasant hunt, there   s a line of people that come down and  sweep the rows where the corn or wheat has been. They   re what they  call blockers. Pheasants run on the ground, so blockers stop them and  they fly, and that   s when you shoot. Well, we   re spread out across this  field, and we have a little nine-year-old boy hunting with us, so he  attached himself to me, which was fine.  We were beginning to sweep the field, and Representative Miskelly  says,    Hey, look at that. What are those sunshine boys doing over  here?    The    sunshine boys    is what they call the Kansas highway  patrolmen because they   ve got big sunflowers on their cars. I said,    I  don   t know. That   s real strange.    We found out real quick. Those old  16  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  sunshine boys called us off the field and put us all under arrest for  hunting in Kansas without a license. We had a guide. We explained to  them. In Kansas, all children that hunt have to have passed a hunting  course for young people. Well of course, that wasn   t the law in  Oklahoma yet, so that little boy was under arrest too.  The fines were huge. I can   t remember now how much it was but I think  it was like a  100 a person. It was big. Well when we   re out in the  hunting fields, we   re not carrying that kind of money. We had a motor  home with us, and I quietly told that little boy, I said,    Hey, while we   re  talking to them, you just kind of scoot away and go get in that motor  home, and don   t you come out for anything. I don   t care if they tell you  to come out, don   t come out. The motor home is on the Oklahoma side,  I know that.    So he starts, and he gets a little ways away when they see  him going.  They say     You son, come back here     I was real proud of  him. He kept going. I guess I was teaching him not to be law abiding,  but I just thought it was all ridiculous. And sure enough, he went over  and got in the motor home and stayed there, on the Oklahoma side.  They made us get enough money together. We had to all pool money to  get enough money to pay that fine. Then Representative Miskelly went  with the highway patrolmen. I don   t know whether they mailed it in or  what. I don   t know what they did. They went somewhere and paid it.  And we were of course just incensed. Our guide was incensed. He said,     But this is my dad   s land, and I know the Kansas border is right here  somewhere, but not this     We paid. Oh, it made the news. Our  governor wrote their governor and their governor wrote our governor. It  was a big who-ha. But anyway, that was another one of the interesting  hunting stories. (Laughs) That   s the only time in my life I   ve ever been  arrested or fined, but I got it that time   I don   t think anyone else has told me that story.  No, I think my life in the legislature, because I hunted and fished, was a  little bit different. I didn   t think anything about it. I had six boy  cousins, and I kind of grew up with them. The youngest was just a few  months older than me, so it was just stair steps from there. Those boys  would put me on horses and try to make me ride pigs and just crazy  stuff. So I was accustomed to that kind of thing   it   s life. And if  they   re going hunting and if I   m really expected to do this, well sure I  went too. And lots of times I took my husband with me. He said that it  was the best opportunity for hunting he had ever had (Laughs) because if  people are going to entertain the legislator, they want to give them the  best possible hunting, and fishing sometimes, too.  Did you gut them and clean them and all that yourself too?  17  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  No. My family had a rule that would incense most males in other  families. Women hunted and women fished, women cooked, but women  never cleaned the game. So I never had to clean game at all, ever. I  think I did clean a few fish, because I fished by myself sometimes, but  that   s it.  And we used to, after the big hunts, we would have an all-game dinner  for the legislators. Tanya, the invitations were literally just sought after.  And the wildlife people, the game rangers and all, they   d bring in fish  and they   d bring in game to add to what we had, and we   d all bring in  ours. We   d get the Trade Winds  hotel , it used to be there by the  Capitol, to let us use their kitchen, and we would cook them. Well, of  course me being the only woman, I got to be the ma  tre domo of the  kitchen and order these guys all around,    You do this and you do this.     (Laughs) We turned out some great food, fabulous food. And we just  had the wildlife rangers and some of the legislators and that was it, to  provide the food.  Do they still do that?  Nope. They used to. It was called the,    Buffalo Stomp.    We   d get a  cowboy band in and play two-stepping music. It was a perfectly  harmless wonderful entertainment. The Supreme Court Justices all  attended   everybody went. And like I said, the food was really good,  the band was good. Sometimes the highway patrol band played, and  they were very good. Then we   d dance around the pool to,    Boot  Scootin    Boogie.    (Laughs)  Was this once a year or every other year?  Once a year, usually just before closing. It   d be late May. But see, we  didn   t get out until July lots of the time. We worked lots longer months.  People would say,    Well, you   re not over there to play.    Now I   ve only  been telling you some of the play stuff. We were passing bills dead  serious and I guarantee you tempers got hot on the House floor, on  things that we were dedicated to. But we had a release valve. The things  I   m talking about were the release valve, where we didn   t get so angry  with each other that we would lose the camaraderie. That we didn   t get  so angry with each other that we couldn   t go ahead and work together.  There   s not much of that left over there now. They really draw the line  and get angry with each other, and it doesn   t go away.  You did those types of things with the men. Did you do anything similar  with the women?  Oh, absolutely. The women went on some of these things. They didn   t  18  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  necessarily hunt and fish. They went and ate and looked pretty, you  know, but they went. They just didn   t hunt and fish. I was trying to  think if any other one did. I think Dorothy Conaghan may have hunted  with us a couple of times, but that wasn   t anything they   d ever done.  Well did you live down there during the week or did you commute?  I lived down there during the week. My secretary and a long term friend  of mine that worked for Senator Gene Howard, we shared a three  bedroom, three bath apartment. It was at Warwick West. It was a gated  community that we were in with a guard gate.  And did you come down Lincoln to the Capitol in the morning?  Yes. And, you know, that was quite a sight.  That was before they had the dome, wasn   t it?  That was before the dome, but even then you   d go up Lincoln and the  sides weren   t very pretty then, but the building, it was just impressive. I  would often think,    I can   t believe I got here. This is all unreal.    And  then I   d get there for work. Oh, it was real. It was very real. (Laughs) I  remember the first day I went to the Capitol to serve. I pulled around  the Capitol   you know, you have to go all the way around to get to the  House parking lot. I pulled in the House parking lot, got out of the car,  and there was a green coat there. We hadn   t been assigned parking  places yet, so the green coat was to take the cars and put them away. I  stepped out of that car and looked up, and there were those big birds on  each   they   re not eagles, I don   t know what they are, gargoyles or  something on the corners of the building. But the big archway, and I  thought,    Oh, what have I done now.    It was like,    I think I   ll go  home.    (Laughs)  David Hall, he was Governor at the time and in kind of disgrace, he was  standing halfway up the steps. He ran down a few steps and he just  swung me around and said,    You   re going to love it.    I   d known David  since he was District Attorney. We   re different parties, but I   ve known  him since he was District Attorney in Tulsa. I knew his wife Jo and his  family and all. It was a shame that such a brilliant person got caught up  in the bad things that he did, because he did a lot of good things as  Governor. We find sometimes that people who go wrong, they have  their good sides, but once they go wrong, they don   t belong in public  office, that   s for sure.  Where was your office the first time?  19  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Well, now that was interesting too. After I got up those stairs, which I  said was so impressive, and I stepped inside the building, I really felt  overwhelmed. I knew to go to the fifth floor. All republicans had to be  on the fifth floor. Democrats never came to the fifth floor. That was  kind of like being ostracized, you know,    You guys are up there.    I  don   t remember how many of we republicans were there when I first got  there, but I think it was less than 15. There were very, very few. So I  went up to find my office, and I walked in and this desk was dirty, I   m  talking dirty. Yuck  So I looked that over. The office had been closed  up of course since July, and nobody had been in there and cleaned   that  was kind of a shock.  And I thought,    Okay, I guess it   s up to me.    I had come over early, so I  made a list of what I needed to clean the desk with and started going  through the desk. There were things in the drawers, just all kinds of  really old things, and it was dusty. And in doing that, I told you about  my relative, we called him Uncle Red, Leon C. Phillips, Governor of  Oklahoma, and that I gave fingernail files out for him when I was about  eight or nine. I pulled out this little booklet that was the democrat  convention booklet. It had Uncle Red   s picture on the front of it. And I  just sat there, and it kind of gave me goose bumps. I sat there and read  the little book a little bit. It told a biography of him. What a strange  thing, Tanya, that in that whole 101 house members, that I got the desk  that had obviously been Uncle Red   s at one time. How? You know?  Strange.  And for that item to have been there that long.  And for that item to have been there for that many years, Tanya, he was  Governor in the 40   s, and this was    74. That was right there in the desk.  Everything else was dusty and stuff. I   ve always wondered about that.  If it was a coincidence, what a terribly strange coincidence. But it kind  of set a tone, too. I thought,    Well, history says he was a good  Governor. I hope I can be as good a representative.    But I   ll never  forget it, and I   ve still got the little booklet. So that was interesting.  Earlier you mentioned there were three bills that you struggled with.  You   ve talked about two of them. What was the third one?  Okay. Gosh, there was the bill of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. I  didn   t count the Supreme Court normally, in it so much. And the Flood  bill. Oh my yes, I know. It wasn   t my bill, I didn   t write it. I was the  vice chairman of Mental Health by then, and drugs and alcohol were a  real scorge of the young people. When I first got there, they kept saying,     Oh, drugs-drinking- that   s not a problem in Oklahoma.    Well that was  head in the sand. Anyway, they were going to lower the drinking age  20  down to 18 years. David Riggs wrote a bill, and my seat mate Helen  Cole wrote a bill. Well naturally I would have preferred to support my  republican seat mate Helen Cole, but her bill really honestly wasn   t as  well written as David Riggs    bill. They had to come before the Mental  Health Committee   that was their assignment. So I tried to get Helen to  join David as co-author of his bill. She absolutely adamantly did not  want to do that. She wasn   t going to join with a democrat. I told her, I  said,    Well his bill is what   s going to come out of the Mental Health  Committee. I   m sure it   s the one that   ll be voted out of the Mental  Health Committee.    She didn   t want to hear that. It kind of hurt our  friendship a little bit.  Anyway, I went over to David Riggs and said,    David, your bill is the  one we really need to pass. And though I may not sign on it as co-author  since I   m vice-chairman of Mental Health, I want to help you pass it.     He said,    Joan, it isn   t going to pass.    I said,    Oh, I think it is.    He  said,    Well go to it, whatever.    So I went around and got him a whole  lot of co-authors. I think I had 32 co-authors. See, that   s almost enough  to be a third. So at that point, you can imagine the beer lobbyists were  just pulling their hair out. They didn   t worry about it at first, but now  here it is, Joan   s in the mix and she   s got 32 co-authors on the bill. They  had to do something.  Well, there was a beer lobbyist named Gaddy and I thought the world of  him, but he came and talked to me at length saying,    Please Joan, don   t.  Get out of this. Don   t do this. You   re going to hurt your career.    I said,     Well Lou, it might be that I will, but we need this bill. Law  enforcement tells me they   ve got to have it.    And of course we were  going with the age old argument that if they   re old enough to serve their  country, on and on and on, and to raise it to 21 is terrible, and you must  not do this. It fell on deaf ears.  So, the bill came to the committee, and I had the votes. Speaker Dan  Draper didn   t want that bill to pass. So I had written another bill. What  did mine do? Mine declared 3.2 beer an alcoholic substance. It was a  shell bill to help pass the other bill. I was having a lot of grief on it too,  because oh, that was worse than the 21 year drinking age, far worse. I  wouldn   t change. It gets to committee, and the Speaker comes to vote  against my bill to make beer, 3.2 beer, an alcoholic beverage. He can  tell, uh-oh, Joan   s got the votes. So he called me outside the committee  room and says,    Hastings, what is it going to take to get you off of this?  Whatever it is, tell me what you want, whatever. Get off of this.    I said,     You don   t have anything that you can give me that I   d take to get off of  this.    He said,    Now there has to be, I know you. You   re a horse trader.  There   s some way here. You   re working for something different. It   s  not this.    I said,    Well you   re right about that. I   ll drop my 3.2 beer bill  21  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  if you   ll let the 21 year drinking bill go through.    It was the lesser of the  two evils for him. He stood there and said,    I knew there was something  going on here. I don   t want to do this.    And I said,    Dan, I know you  don   t want to do this, but that   s it. It   s either/or. There   s a good chance  we   ll pass both of them.     He left, didn   t go back into the committee meeting. I went in, withdrew  my bill, and he let the 21 year drinking age pass. He could have stopped  it, I think. I   m not sure. We would have fought him hard. That was the  doozie of all, I guess, really. And that   s the only way was to run a shell  bill, which I would have passed, if I couldn   t have gotten him off of that  and let the other go through. So that   s how the 21 year drinking age got  into law.  You have to learn to be a negotiator all the way around.  Oh, you   ve got to be a negotiator and a horse trader, like he said.  (Laughs) And you don   t trade out bad things. If that sounds bad, it  shouldn   t. Everybody   s got their own reason for the laws that they  write, and you have to understand that. Then you have to look at what   s  the most important for the people of the state of Oklahoma, and that, to  me, means the majority of the people of the state of Oklahoma. Then  you   ve got to look at the heart of those legislators that are supporting  your opposition and figure out what do they want most or what they  dislike most. Is it worth it? That   s the decision you make. On that one,  there wasn   t a doubt in my mind. I   d be perfectly happy making 3.2  beer an alcoholic substance. I was more than happy getting the 21 year  drinking age. It was a win-win situation.  That goes back to the cock fighting bill. I didn   t want to defeat that cock  fighting bill. Now that   s one where I didn   t want to defeat that, but the  alternative was so much more important, and the only way I could get it  passed was to go against the cock fighting bill, so I did. They wrote an  editorial in the Tulsa World about cruel, senseless, female legislator.     Heartless,    that   s what they called me,    Heartless, female legislator.    I  wrote back and told them that I traded chickens for children and I   d do it  any day in the week. (Laughs) That   s the kind of negotiating, and that   s  what you send these people up there to do, is negotiate. They   re not just  going to go up there and be able to pass what you want them to pass.  Everybody   s got something they want, so you   ve got to make everybody  want yours the most.  It sounds like gender wasn   t really the issue with the skills you brought  to the table.  As it turned out, but when I first got there, Bill Bradley called me that  22  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  socialite politician from Tulsa. He said,    You just ran to show us you  could get here. You   ll stay through this session, maybe, and you   ll tuck  your tail between your legs and go home. That   ll be the end of that.    I  said,    Representative Bradley, I fully expect to be here as long as you  have been here, and I   m young enough to do that.    He kind of startled  back and said,    Well by golly Hastings, you might make it over here.     (Laughs)  Did you earn a nickname? Some people have.  Oh yeah, they called me Mother Superior for a while. That   s like being  Carrie Nation in the legislature  (Laughs)  Let   s talk about the cheese room.  Right. You know, there are all kinds of ways, as I was just telling you,  to work in the legislature. Back then, they had, because of press, what  became known as the infamous cheese room. There was nothing  infamous about it. There was a room, and it was in that Trade Winds  Motel that was just down Lincoln Avenue from the Capitol. It was just a  big suite is really what it was. And all of the lobbyists   not one  lobbyist, all the lobbyists   went together and provided the cheese room.  It   s where we could go after session and they had snacks. They had  cheese, lots of different kinds of cheese. They had cold cuts, and just  whatever they put out there each time. They had wine. They had beer.  They didn   t have hard liquor that I remember. No, just wine and beer  and cheese and food. They played cards in there sometimes   it wasn   t  for money. The door was always open. The door was never allowed to  be closed. It was one of those big double doors. Everybody that stayed  in that hotel was aware.  People went there after session, and they would talk to each other about  the day, their bills and how they needed a vote. This was legislators and  senators, both house and senate talking to each other, just in a relaxed  situation. It didn   t last very long, maybe an hour. Sometimes not even  that. But you just kind of recapped the day. Actually, it was a good  thing. Any animosities that had been brought out during the day in  discussion and debate, they kind of got smoothed over in that. They  didn   t play poker, they played bridge. They had a whole group of them  that were really good bridge players. I was okay with bridge, and I  played occasionally with them, but I was usually on my way doing  something else. I was playing golf or something, I was leaving. But  they did play bridge, and they did not play poker and they didn   t gamble.  Nobody believes this, because of what you   ve been led to believe in the  press. It   s not that way. It was just kind of coming down time.  23  Let   s see, there was another one I was going to tell you. Oh, yes. We  never had free time. I never felt I had free time. I had a friend, Emaline  McCormick, and she and I canned together every year. We would make  pies and put them in the freezer. She had several kids, and I just did it  with her because I wanted to. We had peaches, apples, and pears. So  this was our canning weekend, which would make it in late July or  August. We were at my house. She made the best pie crust, and I   m not  very good at that, but I   m really good on the filling. So she made the pie  crust and I made the filling. Then we both made the jams and did the  steaming and all this, that, and the other. We were hard at it. The phone  rings, and it was Dr. James who was head of Mental Health. He said,     Joan, I   ve really got some things I have to talk over with you. I need to  see you.    Well, it was Saturday. I said,    Well, when?    He said,    Well I  am here in Tulsa now, and I would like to come by.    I said,    Okay.  Now you   re going to have to understand that I   m doing some work that  I   m not going to stop, but I   ll listen to you and talk to you.    Well, he  came over.  Here we were, doing all this canning in my kitchen   I had a big  kitchen   and he sat there and talked to me about mental health problems  and some things we really needed to do. I just kept working, seasoning,  spicing, and so forth. Of course, it was smelling pretty good in there by  then, and he said,    This discussion is kind of about over, but I want to  stay until you get one of those out of the oven.    Then so help me, the  phone rang again. This was the State and Public Safety Director, Paul  Reed. He said he had an issue that we were going to have a committee  meeting on. In the interim session, we went right on with our committee  meetings. He had to talk to me. I told him the same thing I told Dr.  James. I said,    Well, I   m in an all-day work session, but I can talk to  you. So if you want to come over, it   s okay. Dr. James is here now.     He said,    What?    (Laughs) I said,    Oh yeah, Dr. James is here.       Oh,  okay. Fine, that   s great.    So he came over. Dr. James was leaving in  just a little bit. He sat there and told me about the highway patrol, what  they needed in the law in this committee meeting, what they wanted to  happen in committee meeting and all, which if I remember right, the  committee meeting was like Tuesday.  Of course by then we were getting pies out of the oven. And he again  said,    I can   t sit here without having some pie.    We hadn   t intended to  cut one, but that was all right, we did. So that was a strange way of  doing business, but I felt good that they felt comfortable, considering I  was vice-chairman of Mental Health. Chairman Ross Duckett was sick  a lot. He wasn   t there a lot right then, so I was it. I served on the  Corrections Committee and Public Safety, that   s why I felt good that  they felt comfortable enough to just come discuss what was needed. But  that   s a very different way of doing things. (Laughs)  24  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  So on weekends you came home?  Yes.  While you were in session, at the early part of your term, ERA  Equal  Rights Amendment  was a big thing?  Oh, was it ever. That   s another big story. I was opposed to the ERA,  Equal Rights Amendment for anyone who is listening to this and doesn   t  really understand. My reason had nothing to do with female gender  equalization. It had to do with if we had federally passed the Equal  Rights Amendment without amending some other laws, I truly believe  we could have broke, financially broke, Social Security. We would have  had to immediately equalize the age of the sexes, which would have  thrown a lot more people into the system. Then there were some  insurance laws that if we equalized without taking care of those laws,  that that would be a disaster   and I had already done the study. When I  first got there, I had the legal department pull up a list of all the gender  laws so that I knew exactly where the laws were different for men and  women.  I didn   t feel we could pass the Equal Rights Amendment without doing  lots of damage, both state and national. We needed to attack the  individual laws first. Well, that wasn   t real popular because women  thought we should just all be declared equal. Now declaring us equal  and legalizing it is another thing. They couldn   t understand that, didn   t  want to understand that. So I took quite a bit of heat. Representative  Helen Arnold brought President Reagan   s daughter, Maureen Reagan to  the Capitol. She was there to help pass the Equal Rights Amendment.  Well, she asked that I let Maureen Reagan speak at the Republican  Caucus. I was caucus chairman. I knew that the caucus members didn   t  want to hear her. They told me they didn   t, but that   s beside the point. I  called the caucus meeting.  Well, when you call a caucus meeting, that   s a command performance,  for the most part. Whether they want to listen to whatever it is, they  will. So everybody showed up. I introduced Maureen Reagan, said that  she was there in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment, and let the  discussion begin. She started her speech, I guess we would call it, and  she said something that triggered one of our representatives. He held up  his hand to ask a question, make a statement, whatever, and she called  on him. What he said didn   t please her at all. She called him a retarded  bastard. Whap  I hit the gavel down and said,    This caucus is over.     She said,    You can   t do that.    I said,    I most assuredly can do this. I  am the caucus chairman. The caucus is over. Gentlemen, you   re all  25  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  excused.    She was livid. I told her,    Miss Reagan, you can   t come in  here and call elected representatives bastards and get by with it. It isn   t  going to work. That just will not work at all. You didn   t start this  conversation in a level, modulated way. You started it in opposition,  and no one had even said anything yet. So this is not a workable  situation.    Oh my goodness, we made the headlines in the New York  papers. We made the San Francisco Chronicle. We made every major  newspaper in the whole United States that caucus chairman  Representative Joan Hastings had thrown the President   s daughter out of  a Republican Caucus in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It wasn   t all just  favorable. I would do the same thing again. Her demeanor was not  anything that was acceptable.  You didn   t take heat from your caucus members, did you?  Oh no, they were proud of me. They were very proud of me, except of  course for Representative Arnold. There were a few of the republicans  that were in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment, Helen being one of  them. I had the greatest of respect for that. That   s fine, they can have  their way. It   s just that they brought someone there who acted  demeaning toward everybody, and she acted like she was the President   s  daughter. That   s not exactly the way to get through to people.  No way to win friends either, is it?  She didn   t win friends or influence any people. It turned out that she  and Senator Denny Garrison, who was at that time working as David  Boren   s chief administrative assistant, had had words before she ever got  to our caucus. Of course, I had no way of knowing that, but that came  out later, too. It must have been kind of rough language on her part. It   s  not acceptable. You may be equal, but you don   t have to prove it in  certain ways.  Well, as you were getting into the office itself, did you have someone that  you modeled yourself after, a role model in the political world?  Not really. I had a mentor here in Tulsa named Elizabeth Davenport,  who was a businesswoman here whom I respected immensely, just  thought the world of. I thought she was just elegant, well spoken, and  all of the things I   d like to be. She was my mentor, and other than that, I  can   t think of any specific person, no.  You said your House seat partner was Helen Cole. How are your  seatmates chosen?  Republicans and republicans. Now I did get a democrat once. The  26  republicans all had to sit on the far north wall. I mean right up against  the wall. Now if we grew too much, which we did and took up all the  north wall, then we had to be across the back and start from the back and  go forward again, because the democrats got all the forward seats. So if  it happened that we were unequal in our numbers, then and only then  would you have a democrat sitting beside you. I had Representative  Don Denman , who was a republican when he came in the legislature,  and he changed. That   s another funny story.  When I first got there, Representative John Miskelly was chairman of  Appropriations. Now I thought the world of John, but I   m going to  describe John just like he was. John had a great big, huge tummy that  stuck out. His belt was under his shirt quite a bit, and John sometimes  didn   t always shave real clean. He was very garrulous   that about sums  John up. (Laughs) But he was smart. Oh, he was smart. If he read a  budget, he could turn around and start quoting it. I mean, real smart. He  just didn   t look real good, and he looked mean. So I don   t know what  the vote was, it wasn   t anything that I thought was too terribly  important, but here comes John down the aisle toward me. He gets to  my desk and said,    Hastings, get your head out  What kind of vote was  that?    He   s a democrat. He   s a wheel, and he   s coming back here  telling me how to vote? I said,    Representative Miskelly, I   m going to  vote this any way I please. My constituents tell me how to vote, but you  don   t. I   d suggest you get back up on the front row with the big wheels  where you belong.    Whoa  He turned around and zoom, there he goes.  Well, Jerry Smith and Charlie Ford were both representatives then too.  One sat across the aisle and one sat in front of me. They said,    Oh good  grief Joan. Go apologize, do something. You won   t pass a bill the  whole time you   re here. That was not a cool move.    I said,    Well, he   s  not going to come back here and tell me how to vote. I   m the one that  got elected. I   m not going to listen to him.    They said,    Oh boy, you  could have handled it better than that.    I thought,    Oh, well.     Don Denman was my seat mate at that time. He was still a republican at  that time. Well, just a little bit of time went by, and here came Miskelly  down the aisle. You could tell he was headed straight for Denman. I am  thinking,    Oh, now what?    The first rule of the House is nobody can put  you out of your seat except for illegalities, breaking rules of the House,  and then it takes a green coat to escort you out of your seat. That   s our  legal maneuver. Miskelly came back there and said,    Get up  I want to  sit there.    Denman gets up like a baby child and goes to stand in the  back. I   d have told him    no     So he sits down beside me. I sat there  thinking real quick,    What am I going to do now? Okay, take a stab at  it.    So I said,    Mr. Miskelly, we can be friends or we can be enemies,  it   s your choice. What do you want?    I stuck out my hand to shake  27  hands with him, and he just looked kind of startled. Then, he shook  hands with me. He just kind of shook his head, got up, and went back  up front again. I was glad that was over. Denman came back and sat  down.  That was probably on a Wednesday, and you know, we leave session on  Thursday and come home at noon, generally, or sometime during the  afternoon. When I went back to session on Monday, I was sitting in my  office getting some work done, and you could hear a kind of a buzz  coming down the hall of people talking. It was a little louder than  normal. I remember thinking,    I wonder what   s going on,    but I was  real busy, so I didn   t get up to go find out what was going on. The  secretary   s office is in with our office. Her desk just sat ahead of ours  then. Now they have private offices, but we didn   t. And then here  comes these two guys, and it was Miskelly and he had the Speaker with  him, Speaker Willis. They come in, and I was real green, I didn   t know  that that was anything unusual. Miskelly says,    Well I   m glad you   re  here Hastings, I wanted to talk to you a little bit. The Speaker   s got  something he wants to say.    Well, what they did was offer me a place  on the Appropriations Committee.  I already told you that I had been put on the Wildlife Committee without  my asking, and I had Oil and Gas, and I had Corrections, and I had  Education, and here was another one. Normally, you only had four  committees, one biggie and two smalls. So I asked them what I had to  give up.    Well yeah, you   re going to have to give up one of your other  committees, your choice, whatever.       I think I need to think this over. I  really believe I need to think this over.    The Speaker kind of grinned, a  funny little lopsided grin, and he said,    Well, that   s refreshing.    I didn   t  know what he meant. They talk a minute or two more and they leave.  They were no sooner out of the office and a few steps down the hall, and  here are all of these republican representatives in my office.    What did  the Speaker want? What was the Speaker doing up here? What was that  about?    And I said,    Well, he and Miskelly just came up to see if I  wanted to be on the Appropriations Committee.    They said,    You are  joking us        No.    They said,    The Speaker   s never been on the north  aisle up here before, never been on this floor before        Oh, well, he just  was.    And they said,    What   d you tell him?       I said I wanted to think it  over.       Oh my God     They go get Kent Frates, who is our leader, and  Kent says,    Joan, don   t think it over. Go down there right now and tell  him, yes you want on Appropriations. We   ve only got two republicans  on Appropriations. We can   t get them on Appropriations.    I didn   t  know that either. So I gave up Education, because I figured I could help  Education better by being on Appropriations than I could by being on  Education.  28  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  That same day or did you think about it over night?  No. They were so adamant.    Oh, go down there before he changes his  mind     So I went down before he changed his mind. That was it, and it  was real good. I served on Appropriations until, I think I left it  voluntarily, I know that. I   m not sure I left the last year I was there, or  maybe the last part of the last two years that I was there. The schedule  just became so heavy for me that I decided I had been there long enough  that that was all right. I had been on the subcommittee of everything.  One of the years, I believe it was 1983, we were really hitting a financial  crisis in the legislature. We didn   t know how we would have enough  money to get through the next part of the fiscal year, from January to  July of    84, I think. No, of    83. So they picked six senators and six  house members to work us through that. It must have been    82 and    83  instead of that, because I was there a little bit after that. I was one of  them.  We worked all through interim session. We called in all of the  departments, and we weren   t going to do a zero-based budget, but that   s  basically what our questioning was about. We had to strip a lot of  money out of a lot of places. We finished on Christmas Eve at 2:30 in  the afternoon. But we had balanced enough to get through the end of the  next fiscal year. That   s when I thought,    That   s enough of that.    I felt  successful about it, and knew I was very helpful in it, but at that point  everything was kind of crowding in on me with my parents and this  other senate decision and such. So I thought,    Well, we   re through that.  I think I can do without that for a little while.    Then it turned out that I  left anyway.  Well that experience probably helped with the county clerk position.  Oh, definitely. Everything I learned over there helped immensely with  the county clerk job. It was very helpful. Also, it helped me to go back  and change some laws that county government needed changed that  were for the benefit of, well, everybody for that matter. We had some  archaic county laws that were just ridiculous, and nobody had ever really  attacked them. So I got to be instrumental in a few of those, and that was  fun, because you went back and applied your trade to another effort, so  that was neat.  Do you have one shining moment, if you had to pick just one moment  that was     Well, I can tell you a funny one, and then I   ll think about the shining  one, because I   m sure there was. The Speaker also then, early on, told  me he wanted me to go to Seattle, Washington and represent the  29  Finchum  Hastings  legislature at the Legionnaire   s convention. Well, again, I didn   t really  know   what do you do, but I said,    Okay.    I went to Seattle. I   ll never  forget, I got checked into the hotel, and I didn   t have a clue. I asked the  Speaker,    Well, what do I do?    He said,    Well just go down and find  this man,    whatever his name was,    He   ll kind of show you around, and  you just represent Oklahoma and make us proud.       Oh, okay.    So I  found that man. He welcomed me there and said that they were very  happy to have me there. He gave me a paper where the different  meetings would be, and then he went off to do whatever he was going to  do.  I was like,    Whatever in the world am I supposed to do?    There was a  reception that night. I went to the reception   I didn   t know a soul. That  was miserable, it really was. I didn   t know what I was supposed to be  doing. I felt sure that there was something I was supposed to be doing,  but I didn   t know what it was. So I kind of just stood back and watched  everything. I went to bed real early. The next day, I went to the meeting  at nine o   clock in the morning. They sat me up on the stage, and I sat  there and I sat there and I sat there. Their business meeting was going  on, and I sat there. Then they introduced me, and I sat there and I sat  there. That was exactly it. It was to show Oklahoma   s interest and  presence to the Legionnaires and that we cared about veterans and so  forth. That was why I was there.  There was a big parade. Now this got funny. The Oklahoma  Legionnaires were going as Indians, so they got me all dressed up like  an Indian and we get in the parade. Well, there were a bunch of Indians  there from Alaska, and I don   t really, even today, know what this was all  about, but they didn   t want anybody impersonating Indians. They didn   t  feel like Indians were getting fair treatment at all and they were very  angry. We were carrying some signs, maybe they just said,    Oklahoma  Legion Post,    and such. They took off the signs   well, they literally  attacked us. I had never been in anything like that before. The police  then, of course, moved in and got them moved out. I didn   t get hit or  anything, but you can   t imagine what it   s like to be walking down the  street just in a parade, representing Oklahoma Legionnaires, and have a  group just attack you for no reason that you know. So that was a strange  experience.  Let   s see, a glowing experience? I played on the House basketball team.  We raised money for charities in various communities, many fundraisers  for band uniforms, playground equipment, etc.  Male and female, I suppose.  The only female. In all of the surrounding states, I was the only female  30  that played on the basketball team. We had David Stratton, he had been  on national championship teams. I told you Converse was 6-foot-5 or  so. We had some others that were big names in basketball that were  now in the House of Representatives. Their career was behind them in  that, but they really knew basketball. So they asked me to play on the  basketball team, because they found out I was from Drumright that I had  played. No, I didn   t want to do that. They kept on. So this night they  were going to play the Central State College coaches at Edmond. Here  they came again.    You   ve got to play Joan, we   re short people. You   ve  got to play.       Okay.     So I got my secretary, Billie, to run downtown to the sporting goods  store and get me the clothes I needed. It was a little bit late. We both  got home, and I had to get changed, and then we headed for Edmond.  We got there, like I said, a little bit late. The game was already in  progress. I jogged across the court and sat down on the bench. I was  feeling like nut one. I sat there and I   m thinking,    Now they won   t  really play me. I know that. I   m just here because I   m an oddity.    We  were behind, and the coach puts me in. They played full court  basketball. I mean, I   m not very tall, and these guys    strides are like  this,    Boom, boom, boom     I   m trying to keep up and guard, you know,  and I   m down about this high on them. My fingertips were touching at  about their nose level. I was trying to guard and trying to keep up  running up and down the court. Well, I am keeping up pretty good.  We got down to the right goal, I   ll call it. Somebody makes a shot and  it   s coming off of a rebound. I   m just almost under the basket, and holy  gee, it   s coming right at me. Now this guy   s behind me, this behemoth  guy is right behind me, and he   s teetering like this. I   m looking up at  that ball that   s coming down to me. I think,    Oh, I   m going to get it.    I  jumped as high as I could jump, which is not very tall. I got the ball and  bent over holding the ball. Well when I do like that, he   s off balance.  He was really teetering now. I just held my position, thinking,    He   s  going to fall on me. I know he   s going to fall on me     They penalized  him for hovering (Laughs) and they gave me two free shots. I can   t  believe this to this day, Tanya, but the truth is I made them. I made both  of them  That   s incredible for me  You know, another thing that helped  me get through was purely the grace of God, because I couldn   t do that  again, but it worked. It really helped me in getting through difficulties  later with them. So a lot of little funny things played a part.  A really high point   I would say being elected the first female legislator  on the Board of Directors of the National Council of Legislators. Then I  became the Executive Vice President of the Republican Legislators and  would have been president the next year. That   s when I left to go be  county clerk. But that was really outstanding, because they hadn   t had  31  Finchum  Hastings  any women legislators on any of those boards ever before. So that was a  biggie. There were so many surprises, just constant, but there was a  whole lot of work that went into this, too.  In Corrections, I went to every prison in the state. I did not tell them I  was coming at all. I spent my out-of-session time and just showed up  and told them who I was and that I wanted to inspect their prison and  that I didn   t think everything was like we   d like it to be, and it wasn   t. I  insisted that I be shown the budget, everything. And because I was on  the Corrections Committee   they can   t refuse a representative. That   s  something that I   m not sure our representatives even maybe know. But  it is in the law that a representative can go to any state-paid institution  and do an inspection at any time and they have to honor it. And I did. I  went to the mental health institutes that way too, and I found some big  infractions at times.  Did you go by yourself to these places?  No, I took my secretary with me. It was just she and I. She took all of  the notes and everything. We were official, very definitely. Once, Pearl  Whitcoop, a reporter for the Tulsa Tribune, went with me. We went to  five of the prisons with her with me, and she wrote stories about what  we found and so forth. But you know, those people have done bad  things, no question about that, but we owe them safety from each other  and food and shelter. It shouldn   t be great tremendous food, but it   s got  to be adequate and so forth. One thing on one of those, I was inspecting  McAlester, and that was even before I got elected. I was campaigning  and I went to McAlester right after they had just burned the prison. You  remember that prison burned? He wasn   t going to show it to me. Mr.  Wilson was the acting warden at the time. But I just impressed on him  that I was going to win and that I was going to be on the Corrections  Committee. I had already made up my mind on that. I didn   t know  anything at all about jails and prisons, nothing. I told him that if he  didn   t show the prison to me that I was going to get on that committee  and not know anything and be of no help to him whatsoever, so why  not? He decided he would. So he showed me all through everything,  very nice.  Then he took me over for lunch to the women   s prison. Now that was  an adventure. I forget how many women they had up there. It wasn   t a  whole lot. All fat   I mean, really fat. I thought,    What kind of  percentage is that that you   d have this many women and all of them  were really fat?    That didn   t make any sense. Well, it turned out that  they didn   t have any exercise classes. They weren   t allowed outside  because that part of the women   s prison was right there on the grounds  with the regular prison. They did the cooking for all the people that  32  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  worked over at the other prison. People came to visit that day, I forget,  the mayor came to eat from McAlester. There were a lot of people that  didn   t belong in prison work. The food was outstanding. I tell you  what, those women could sure cook. I got a real bad impression. They  were fat, because they were using all real butter and gravies and sauces.  The quality was superior, not what was served at the main prison.  When I actually got elected, I went back again   same thing again. The  food was just outstanding. I looked at their menus, and it was like  sausage gravy for breakfast and things. No wonder they were fat. But  they weren   t allowed outside, so they got no exercise. They had no  skills being taught. Well, they were being taught cosmetology, but in  Oklahoma you can   t get a license if you   ve been convicted of a felony.  So why teach them something that they can   t do? That didn   t make any  sense. They didn   t teach them typing. They had one typewriter for all  of those women. It was not good, and that was something I was real  pleased I was able to change that quick after I got in, without even  changing laws. It was just procedural changes and persistence, and that  worked.  What did you change specifically?  They got classes in elementary math, English grammar, and written  literacy. They got a little bit of accounting, just enough so they   d know  how to do checkbooks and this, that, and the other. And they got  commercial skills, typing and so forth. Computer wasn   t, like I said, it  wasn   t there then, so not that. It really got them started better. And they  got exercise. There was a lady there for murder, and she   d been in this  little cell that had a hallway outside, and they let her walk up and down  the hallway. That was it. It was dark in there. Well she murdered  somebody, true, but I don   t know her reason for it. There   s no good  reason for murder, but still, that was cruel and inhumane treatment on  behalf of the state of Oklahoma. Ugly. There were a lot of things that  just really made a difference.  That   s an example of where you were proactive.  I did a lot of things for women   s rights and for women   s laws and  changing in women   s laws. The Displaced Homemaker bill was my  original bill. As it happened, my son died while I was in the middle of  that, and Cleta Deatherage took over and passed it, but it was my bill  and I had done all of the work on it. So I did a lot of female law work.  It wasn   t anything like the Equal Rights Amendment. (Laughs).  That was interesting in itself. We   ve covered a lot of stuff today. I think  we   ve covered most of what I have to ask about. Is there anything else  33  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  you want to say?  It   s an experience I wouldn   t have missed for the world. From the  outside, I could have never imagined it being what it was. I truly believe  that those people I served with, for the most part, there were a few that I  felt weren   t really dedicated perhaps, but for the most part, they were  very dedicated and believed in what they were doing. They really  wanted to help the state of Oklahoma. I am totally convinced of that. I  didn   t always see eye to eye with them.  The best way to kill a bill, by the way, was for one of them to get up and  say,    Well, that   s one of those old Tulsa bills.    They had an animosity  towards Tulsa. In fact, all of northeastern Oklahoma was always  cheated out of money, roads, highways, you name it. We never came  out, and we still don   t. Why? I don   t know, I always tried to find that  out, but I know that,    Well, that   s one of those old Tulsa bills,    it was  almost always a death nail. Oklahoma City was fine. They had no grief  toward Oklahoma City. I don   t know, but it was. Getting this building   OSU-Tulsa campus , OSU, I worked really hard on that too. Penny  Williams, Charlie Ford, well a whole lot of us did. We did win, but it  took several years. It would help Tulsa, and it was really difficult to do.  I   ve still got my mortar board hat that they gave us for being the  sponsors of the bill that got this place in action. (Laughs)  Well, that   s a lot of amazing stories.  And that   s only a small part, if I really sat and thought about it. Ten  years is a long time.  Well, why republican instead of democrat?  Oh yes. I told you about when I was little and Leon C. Phillips was  Governor. Well, people thought my mother might have a lot more pull  than she did. They would come to the house, and that was kind of hard  times, and they would come to the house and ask for mother to get them  things and get them jobs and get them this and get them that, and I got a  bad impression from it. I just plain got a bad impression. Later, I don   t  want to insult my democrat friends, because I   ve learned that of course it  isn   t this way, but I felt they just always asked for things that they hadn   t  earned. So I don   t mean that in any context, I   ve learned better, but as a  kid, you get some strange impressions, and that   s the impression I got. I  didn   t know anything about it, but I just thought I wasn   t going to be like  that. Then I got to TU  Tulsa University  and they were talking about  well the republicans were this and the republicans were that. In truth, I  found that we   re not all that much different. You just have to do,  regardless of politics, you just have to do the best you can do for your  34  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  Finchum  state and your nation and you   ll be all right.  That   s a good answer.  Well, it   s a real one. I saw times when partisanship really harmed our  state, and I deplore that. That   s not good government.  I have one last question. If you don   t have anything else, then I   ll go  ahead and ask.  Sure.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  I did my best. That   s about all anybody can do. And that I didn   t yield  in the face of adversity. That   s what I   d like history to say about me.  Well, I appreciate you taking the time to do this with me today. I think  you   d be a great role model for those yet to come.  Well, we get old and people don   t pay attention to us anymore, so it   s  been fun. (Laughs) But that is true. People don   t learn from the past,  because they want to reinvent the future, but you can   t reinvent the  future. The past is always there with you, and if you don   t accept and  really examine and look at it and ask people who have been there what  happened when, you don   t make as much progress as you could.  When was the last time you were at the Capitol?  January of this year. I go over and lobby every once in a while. If  there   s something important to me, I   ll go over and pound on them  (Laughs)  Do you get the same feeling when you walk in the doors as you did when  you actually worked there?  I do. I really do. That is the Citadel of Oklahoma. Good and bad things  come out of there, but if people took more interest in their government,  if people went to visit more often and really watched it, it would make a  difference.  Had you been there before you even ran?  Yes, I had.  Some people haven   t.  35  Hastings  Finchum  Hastings  I know. Some people have never been to the Capitol. My mother being  the county health nurse, she was interested in us understanding  government and why it was necessary and what it did. I   d say she kind  of gave us a good foundation in that, us being me and my two sisters.  Well, Oklahoma is better for having had you serve.  Well, thank you. That   s a very nice thing to have said.  ---  ---
