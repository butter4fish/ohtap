Speaker 2: I can only trace that side back to my grandfather and grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, there is some of that history known by other family members.
Speaker 1: Okay.   Where is Camden, South Carolina in relationship to, say Charleston [South Carolina], or?
Speaker 2: Let's say in relationship to Columbus [sic].  I mean, Columbia, South Carolina.  It's thirty-two miles, I would say, north of Columbia.

Speaker 2: I don't--not so many on my mother's side.  More so on my father's side, there are stories passed down.

Speaker 1: Did your mother [Frances James-Alexander] tell you about growing up, in--did she grow up in Camden [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She left Camden when she was a teenager.  Right, she left Camden as a teenager and moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get the impression that she liked Camden, South Carolina, or?
Speaker 2: I never talked to her about that.
Speaker 1: She never talked about growing up in the country or anything?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She talked about it but, I--the part I remember her talking about was how hard it was (laughter).  So, she didn't, you know, elaborate much on that.
Speaker 1: But, you got an impression it was a hard life?
Speaker 2: Right.  Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, she came up when she was teenager.  Did she come up with other relatives, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There was--I had--well, she came up to work, you know, as a maid, you know.  They let her--at that time, they were hiring people to work as a maids.  And, two more of her sisters came up also.  And, I don't remember exactly who came first or how or when.  But, later also, my grandmother came.  My grandfather didn't come at the same time that they came.  But my grandfather came up later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, eventually, the whole family came?
Speaker 2: Eventually, the whole family was in Ridgewood, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, tell us a little bit about Ridgewood.  Now, what--where is that?
Speaker 2: Ridgewood, New Jersey was a town where there was--kind of an affluent town, in terms of the indigenous populations.  And, so, it was one of these town, you know, once after the railroad was built, they had people who worked in New York [New York City, New York] and Wall Street, and all of those places, you know.  And, so, people there used to, they used to commute in demand, of course.  Commuted back and forth, you know, because it was a good place to live if you worked in the city.  Because the railroad then ran to Jersey City [New Jersey], and it ran to Hoboken [New Jersey], I think, also where people could get the fairy across into New York.  And, so, they hired a lot of black women as nursemaids and housekeepers and things of that sort.  And, so, a lot of women came up from the South to those jobs.  And, what happened is a lot of work like this where one person would come or a couple would come and then they would, somebody would say, "Well, do you know somebody else?  I have a friend who's looking for a job."  And, then they would bring in their sister, their cousin, a neighbor or something, they would come up and get a job.  And, so, eventually, there was a whole lot of people in Ridgewood from Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A whole lot of people.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a good description.  Because I mean, that's the kinda, you know, I mean it's really how migration happens (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  There was a whole lot of--and, of course, my relatives, you know, a lot of my relatives there.  And, a lot of 'em lived in Ridgewood and, then Paterson, New Jersey, which was about five miles from Ridgewood.  Maybe, maybe, you know, four to five miles from Ridgewood.  It was an industrial place at that time.  They used to call it the Silk City of America.  And, had a lot of factories and places there where a lot of the men could work, you know.  So, of course, a lot of the men came up to work in Paterson.  So, you had a lot of people from Camden that worked in Paterson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, lived there.  Paterson was more of a city.  Ridgewood was more of a town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, did you mother get a chance to go to school in Camden or in Paterson?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother did go to school in Camden.  And, I don't know up to what grade.  But, she did go to school there.
Speaker 1: But, she came up when she was a teenager, too?
Speaker 2: She came up as a teenager, right.  And, went to work--

Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's full name is David Alexander, D-A-V-I-D, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My dad's date of birth is April 25, 1901.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, where was he born?
Speaker 2: Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your parents married when they came up, or did?
Speaker 2: They married, yes.  I, you know, some years after they came.  My dad was here before my mother [Frances James-Alexander].  My dad was ten years older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was in New Jersey before she was?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, that's interesting information.  I--okay.  All right.  Well, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can trace them back as far my grandfather and grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what are the stories on that side from way back?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather was a minister, and a farmer in Camden.  And, my grandmother, of course, was a homemaker.  And, there was thirteen children on my dad's side.  They had thirteen children.  And, my dad also had thirteen children.  Alright, he had three children before he married my mother.  And, then when he married my mother, they had ten children.  And, my dad came up from Camden in his early twenties.  And, he got a job with a man who owned--an Italian man, in Waldwick, New Jersey, who owned a construction company.  Him and his, him and two of his friends, Tom Woodruff (ph.) and Coleman Brown (ph.), were two of my dad's friends.  They got a job with them and they worked there.  The man had a construction business and they worked on the railroad.  They were building a railroad yard in Waldwick, New Jersey.  And, you know, the trains of course, were coal at that time.  And, so, ever so often, they needed a railroad yard where they had coal and water and stuff like that for the train.  Because, it was the Erie Railroad and it ran from the Hudson River to Chicago [Illinois], that branch of the railroad.  And, so, this one place that they decided to make this railroad yard, was Waldwick.  And, Waldwick in German means a light in the woods [sic, "village in the woods"], okay.  And, so, because my dad and them, they had worked with horses and mules and stuff in the south that they, you know, that's how they got the job.  And, my dad had met one of the construction guy's sons and they were at, I think that--at the train station or something like that, in Ridgewood.  And, they had asked him, you know, when they got to talking, you know, he said, "Well, you know, my dad is maybe hiring some people."  And, so he got the job.  They went out there and talked to 'em and they got the job and they started working for him.  And, then of course, later on when it was finished--while during the work, you know, they learned, you know, working with cars and, you know, tractors and bulldozers and all of that.  And, my dad was always interested in cars.  And, so, when that was finished, he got a job working, working at a car lot.  It was called, T.B. McGuire Packard.  He worked for the Packard company.  And, he did porter work and, you know, some light mechanics and stuff.  And, later he became a certified Packard mechanic.  That was back in the early years.  And, he was a Packard mechanic from then until 1956 when they stop making Packards [1958].  And, during the war years [World War II, 1939 - 1945], when they had stopped making cars and most of the companies were then, you know, put in to making war machinery, they didn't make Packards for several years.  My dad worked with what was called the WPA [Works Progress Administration] in Waldwick.  And, they were, you know, they built some bridges and a dam at this lake that was there, and he did different things.  But, he still worked part-time.  Mr. McGuire didn't wanna just let him go altogether.  So, he still worked part-time there, where he would go in and take care of the cars in the lot and do a little mechanic work for a few hours a day.  And, then he later went to work for Wrights, Wrights Aeronautics [sic, Wright Aeronautical, later Curtiss-Wright Corporation].  It was what they called back then, they call it a defense plant.  And, so, he worked there.  He worked at T.B. Guire--McGuire in the daytime, and then he worked at Wrights at ni--on the night shift.

Speaker 1: And, then of course, you know, where we lived, my dad [David Alexander] always had a big garden.  And, my mom [Frances James-Alexander] canned food and all of that stuff.  And, so, we, we made it pretty good.  And, because, you know, they had had these children, you know, during that time we got quite a few, what do they call it, coupons, you know, then for food and, you know, sugar, and all of that, you know, so.  So, it was pretty good.
Speaker 2: So, you lived in the garden part of New Jersey, really?
Speaker 1: Well, I lived--
Speaker 2: Is that what they called it?  They call it the Garden State?
Speaker 1: Well, no.  That was more south of us.  But, up there they had--see, Waldwick [New Jersey] was a very unique type thing.  I figured it out later in life, you know.  But, on one side of the tracks, all right, they were mostly all Italian people who had come over from Italy to work on the railroad.  And, on the other side of the tracks was mostly Irish people, people of Irish descent who also worked on the railroads, you know.  And, then surrounding Waldwick on the, I guess would be on the west side of the town and the surrounding areas, there were farmers of Scandinavian descent, okay.  I later figured out, because all of my friends--their names, you know, all right?  Hunsider (ph.) and folks like that.  But, they had farms out there because all of these people moving in and they were building houses and stuff, and of course, you needed to eat.  So, they had farms and chicken farm, you know, chicken places, and dairy, so you can go.  You got your eggs.  You got everything from right there.  So, and then, on both sides of the tracks, they had, how many, twenty-three business (laughter), okay, I counted 'em one time.  I went home to visit, the places that were there.  And, on our side of the tracks, we lived on the Italian side, okay.  All of my neighbors and friends growing up were Italian.  There was only one other black family at that time.  And, there were cousins of mine and they--but, they had no children.  And, so, the farms on the outside of town, later on I--we use to, we all worked there, kids, you know.  We worked at the farms, and you know, we--that was our summer jobs.  And, then there was a construction company, you know.  I did some of everything, you know, we always made sure that we had a little job.  I had my first job there when I was about, I think I was about eight or nine.  There was a weaving mill that was there where we lived.  There was a weaving mill there and at eleven o'clock every day, they would come out, some of the guys would come out and give me a note with what they wanted, the sandwiches, there was little delicatessen.  And, I would go and get their sandwiches and stuff.  And, my brother and I would do that.  And, we would go and get their sandwiches and soda and then we would come back, they would give us--you know, each person would give us a nickel.  And, then they would throw the soda bottles over the fence.  Give us the soda bottles, and we could get two cent deposit on that.  So, we made money from that every day, you know, while we were growing up.
Story_ID: 137101
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory.  My earliest childhood memory was, I was probably three or four years old.  And, my mom [Frances James-Alexander] and one of my friends across the street, his name was Tony Bill (ph.), my mom and his mom, and myself and Tony, we had went around to the store to the delicatessen.  And, while we were there, I asked my mom for a Tootsie Roll, the candy used to sit on the counter there.  And, my mom said, "No.  There's candy at home."  So, I let that go.  Tony, asked his mom for a piece of candy, and his mom told him no and he started crying and throwing a little fit and everything, you know.  And, his mom reached up and got the Tootsie Roll and handed it to him.  So, I guess in my little mind, I thought that's how you got a Tootsie Roll.  So, I asked my mom again, and he said, "No."  And, I started imitating what Tony was doing.  And, my mom reached up on the shelf there, up on the wall, and she got something.  I think, I don't know, an iron cords or something from up off of that thing there, and commenced to spanking on my butt, you know.  So, you know, that, and then she took it and put it back up there.  And, that--I remember that very well, you know, people talk about how far you can remember, I remember that.  And, so, that was my first and last fit.
Story_ID: 137102
Speaker 1: Describe your parents' personalities and who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: I find myself a lot of times, physically, taking after my dad [David Alexander].  I find myself, sitting like him, or standing like him.  I think back to that a lot of times.  I wasn't like him in the sense that he and all of his brothers and sisters were never talkers.  And, I'm a talker, you know, so on that part, I take after my mom [Frances James-Alexander].  On my mother's side, my mother had a lot of sisters, all right, two brothers, all right.  And, my mom and her sisters are great talkers.  You know, they talk a lot, you know.  And, so, I think I take that part after my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your parents met, actually met?
Speaker 2: I don't know it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I know where they met.  They met in Ridgewood [New Jersey] at church.  You know, I know that's where they met, you know.
Speaker 1: In Ridgewood or down in--
Speaker 2: In Ridgewood.
Speaker 1: Not in Camden [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  They didn't get married--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Until much later.  Remember, my dad was in Waldwick [New Jersey] before my mom came up to Ridgewood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, he's from Camden, South Carolina, too?
Speaker 2: He's form Camden, also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, he was from Camden also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I got (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: But, they met in Ridgewood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 137103
Speaker 1: What were some of the--now, you've told us about some of 'em already, but what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up in Waldwick [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: In Waldwick, I was wild.  That's what they called me, wild.  I had to be, you know, there were lakes and a place, we used to call it a mountain.  But, we found out later it was just a hill.  We used to call it the sandbank.  But, it was this big sand hill up there that we used to go and play up there.  And, there was farms and things like that.  And, that's what I had to do.  I had to be out, you know, at the lakes and all of those places, you know.  I was, you know, just me and my friends, we were explorers, you know.  We had to, you know, do things--I remember one time, in 1947, they had a great rain, sort of a flood.  And, I guess at that time, how old was I; twelve years old.  And, they were building this wall up by our school [Waldwick Public School, Waldwick, New Jersey] and we had been walking the streets, you know, in the flood.  You know, water was going down the streets and everything, and we got up by the school.  We wanted to see how deep the water was because there was this brook [Ho-Ho-Kus Brook, Bergen County, New Jersey], it was a--you know, but it was a wide brook, you know.  And, some people might call it a river, we didn't, you know.  And, but, anyway, it went from the lake and it went all the way to the next two towns.  And, so, this friend of mine and I, we were up there and there was one of these big tubs that they used to mix cement in, aight.  You know, they used to mix cement in tubs, you know.  And, so, we saw this big cement tub so we said, look at--"Let's take a ride in this," you know.  So, we were gonna put it in, in the brook.
Story_ID: 136179
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's pick up this story.  You, you all found a container that they mix concrete in and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this tub.  Yeah.  It's called a tub, you know, but--that they mix concrete, so.  So, we said, you know, you know said, this should work like a boat.  So, my friend, his name is Geeko (ph.), his real name was Manuel.  He was of Spanish descent.  And, I don't know, I never knew, which, his last name was Ferrer (ph.).  But, we said, you know, let's try it.  So, we went and we got two big sticks, big long sticks.  And, we took it and got it down close to the water and then we took our sticks and pushed it in and we got in there.  And, we started going down the river [Ho-Ho-Kus Brook, Bergen County, New Jersey].  And, so, we could use our sticks to push us around things, rock, big rocks and stuff in there.  Then we got to one place where it wasn't, you know, high enough and we got out and pushed it back out where it was high.  And, then, we got down to Wyckoff Avenue [Waldwick, New Jersey].  That was way down the river.  That's called Wyckoff Avenue.  And, the, there's a bridge that went across the water.  And, the water wasn't up to that bridge.  And, there was like a sandbar, if you will, that was out there, and the thing got stuck on there, all right?  And, the water was rushing really, really, fast around both sides of us, you know.  And, so, somebody came by, you know, in their car and saw us out there, sitting out there, you know.  And, we were out there really basically laughing at ourselves and everything, you know, deciding whether we should get out there and, you know, walk through the water or try to get it off or whatever.  And, so, the people, I think, thought we were stuck.  And, so, the next thing I know, here was this guy named Pugg Tinnerhike (ph.) and a couple of--Pugg was on the volunteer fire department.  Him and this other friend I was telling you about, Tony Bill (ph.), his brother, Angelo (ph.).  And, this guy had went to all these people's houses, you know, 'cause it was only a block or so away, and went and got them.  And, then here they come out there with ropes and everything (laughter), thinking they needed to come and get us, you know.  And, so, finally, what we did, we told 'em we could just push off.  So, we finally, took our sticks and pushed ourselves off from the little sandbar like, and we were able to go over, right up to the bridge.  And, we got out to the bridge, they were all there waiting to catch us, you know.  So, we got--they got our arms and everything.  And, so, when they got us and they pulled us off, then the boat went, I mean, the tub went all (laughter) under the bridge and on down the river, you know.  And, so, they got us up there and they were laughing at us and everything, you know.
Story_ID: 136180
Speaker 1: It was really funny.  But, then one of the guys [Waldwick, New Jersey Volunteer Fire Department] said, "All right."  And, said, "You two," said, "now, how are you gonna get this tub back to whereever you got it from?"  'Cause we had told 'em we got it from the schoolyard [Waldwick Public School, Waldwick, New Jersey].  They said, "Because, these people are gonna be coming to work, you know, looking for their tub," you know.  And, what happens is the river [Ho-Ho-Kus Brook, Bergen County, New Jersey] runs all the way down to another lake.  It runs from one lake to another lake.  And, the other lake was Coles Pond.  And, below Coles Pond is a falls there.  And, below Coles Pond was what they called The Bleachery.  The Ho-Ho-Kus Bleachery.  And, that was where they had this big plant where they bleached materials, you know.  But, there was a falls there too.  And they say, "So, now, if it goes down to The Bleachery, you know, it's gonna mess up stuff, you know.  And, this is, I think my really, my first inkling of environmental stuff, see because, all of that stuff from The Bleachery, you know, went right into the Coles Pond.  I mean, not into Coles Pond, into the water there and went where ever it was going [New York Harbor], you know, the runoff and stuff, you know.
Speaker 2: It was common in those days, for industries to just dump whatever waste (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Dump it right in the water.  But, above that was Coles Pond and we used to swim there.  You know, we swam everywhere, you know.  Matter of fact, we had a, we had a pool in the city, you know, regular city swimming pool, you know.  Very few kids went there.  We went swimming in the, you know, down the watering hole, Coles Pond, the lake, where ever.  But, anyway, they said, "You guys are gonna to--wherever that goes, you're gonna have to get it and bring the tub back to the school, you know.  Bring it back up there by time these guys go back to work, you know.  And, so, the next day, got my brother and two of my other friends and we went, and there's a--where the--from that bridge on down below that there's like, houses that sit back in one area along the water.  And, then there's another steep incline along there.  And, it was like a very narrow what, you know, similar to what people might call a goat path.  But, it was a very narrow slippery walk that went all--a long ways, almost a mile down there.  And, we used to call it, what was it, Devil's Path.  We used to call it Devil's Path.  And, then, you know, you--it was a rite of passage for you to walk Devil's Path when you were growing up, you know.  You know, without sliding down into the lake, into the water, you know.  You know, kids, you know, you had a, you know, whenever somebody's new was in town or something, you know, they had to do that.  They had--all the guys, the guys had to walk Devil's Path.  So, with that flood, with the rain and everything, Devil's Path was real, real slippery, you know.  So, here was all of us going down Devil's Path to try to find out where this tub was, you know.  And, then we would have to walk the streets, you know, back with the tub all the way to the school.  Which was probably three or four miles away, you know.  But, what had happened was, the tub had went down there and it ended up in this guy's yard.  Because, the water on the side where all the land and everything was, it had ended up over in the guy's yard.  And, so, we were on the other side of the water, you know.  And, the man's name was Mr.--I'm trying to think, it was (unclear) Mr. Van Dyke (ph.), I think.  So, we were yelling across to Mr. Van Dyke, he was out there, you know.  And, we was telling him that, we had to get that.  Can we come over?  You know.  We would have to talk all the way back and go back to the bridge and then up and then down this street to go down there.  And, we said, "We gotta take that back to the school."  And, he told us, he yelled over, he said, "Naw."  He said, he would get a neighbor, put it on the pickup truck and they would take it back.  So, they did that and so we had to go back, you know, Devil's Trail.  That's what it was, Devil's Trail.  We walked back Devil's Trail, all the way back to Wyckoff Avenue.  So, it was an outing for a whole bunch of us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a good story.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 136181
Speaker 1: Now, what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Waldwick Public School [Waldwick, New Jersey], it was called at that time.  And, there was--they didn't call them elementary schools.  They called it Waldwick Public School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did you like school?  Were you a good student, or?
Speaker 2: No, I was a bad student; was a terrible student.  I was--what happened was, I found out later why I was such a bad student.  Because we had a house full of children, we had a favorite game.  We had steps that went upstairs, from the kitchen the stairs--steps went up to the upstairs where the bedrooms were.  Our favorite game was school.  Me and my brothers and sisters, me and one of my brothers at that time and, then I had two sisters.  And, our favorite game was school.  What is was, you would sit on the steps and they would ask you questions, okay.  My sisters would ask the questions.  Mostly they would be the teacher.  And, then you had to answer the questions, and as you answer the question, when you get it right, you would move up a step until you got to the top of the steps.  My brother, David, then my sister, Mattie, and my sister Mary, and then me, we were all each one year apart.  And, then before the next kid after me was four years.  Everybody use to say, you know, my mom [Frances James-Alexander] took one look at me, she said, that's it for a while, you know (laughter).  But, that's what my family used to always say, my aunts and uncles.  But, anyway, my sisters would always pick questions from their books, you know.  And, of course, I was always below them, you know, so I didn't know.  So, what I used to do, is I used to sneak their books, you know, and go and read their books.  I would always read their books, read my brother, David's book, you know, and all of that, so I can get a chance to be the teacher.  So, I used to read their books.  So, as soon as school, in September, I would get right into their, I would devour my books and then I would get into theirs, all right.  We were all readers, you know.  My mom was even a great reader, you know.  But, she read mostly romance, magazines and stuff, but that was her pastime, that was her favorite pastime.  But, anyway, what happened, the result of that was, that as I went from one grade to the next, I was totally bored.  You know, because I had read all the books.  I used to even read math books, you know, I just, I just was a reader.  Right now I've got a collection of books in my house of over three thousand books.  And, if I buy another book, I have to sneak it in the house, you know, so my wife don't say anything, I, you know, I don't have no more place to put it.  But, anyway, so, I would be total bored in school.  So, I had two choices, I would play hooky or I would be totally disruptive in school.  I could get A's like in the second grade.  I would get A's, second grade.  Third grade I'd get A's on tests and things like that.  But, they would keep me back 'cause I didn't have enough days in school.  Or, you could stay back on conduct.  If you had enough, if you had E's back then, E was bad.  E didn't stand for excellent, okay (laughter).  E was a bad grade.  You didn't want a red E anywhere.  And, in conduct and stuff, I had red E's, all right.  And, so, they would keep me back.  And, I never could figure why a teacher would want me another year.  But, they keep me back in the second grade and they keep me back in the third grade, 'cause of playing hooky and I used to play hooky from school.  We would leave from my house and go to school, which was only a matter of a few blocks away.  And, my sisters and brothers would go into school and I would go to the lake or somewhere.  And, when the school bell rang for lunch, I would go to school, go in there, go to the lunchroom, eat lunch, go out there and play with the rest of the kids, you know.  'Cause you're always back there and you had an hour between lunch and time to go back to school.  I would go in the school yard, play ball and everything, and the bell rang, and the other kids would go in school and I would got back to the lake or somewhere, all right.  And, I get home and go on punishment.
Speaker 1: Now, what would you do out at the lake?
Speaker 2: Whatever.  Read--sometimes I would got out there and read my--read books, read my school--bring my school book, throw rocks, whatever.  I did not wanna be in that school.
Story_ID: 136182
Speaker 1: Did not wanna be in that school [Waldwick Public School, Waldwick, New Jersey].  When I got--
Speaker 2: --Now, there were like, you said there were very--it was a small number of black students there, mostly--
Speaker 1: There were no--no black students.
Speaker 2: No black students.
Speaker 1: No, no.  I--
Speaker 2: Were you the only student in your class?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The only black student in my class.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.  Only, when did I have--I had a black student in my class one time when I was probably in the--no, I don't ever, I never had a black student, until high school.  But, anyway--
Speaker 2: So, you were the only one.  I mean, did you--did, how did they treat you in school?  I mean, when you were there, I mean.
Speaker 1: I was treated all right.  I was, but, but, but, I'm getting ready to get into that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In the fourth grade, they had a new teacher by the name of Miss Merrick (ph.).  She was my fourth grade teacher.  She was new.  All the rest of the teachers, except one teacher who became a kindergarten teacher by the name of Miss Buckley.  But, all the rest of them had been there most of their lives (laughter) okay, in the school.  Miss Merrick was brand new.  So, one day Miss Merrick was talking about something, this was about the second or third day of school.  And, fortunately, Miss Merrick didn't know my history yet, you know.  So, she was talking about something and so I blurted out all the answers of what she was talking about.  So, she called me up to her desk, and I said, "Oh, Lord, I'm in trouble all ready."  And, she said, "How did you know that?"  I said, "Well, I read, read in, you know, in the books," and you know, read, and so and so forth.  So, she got the book and she asked me some other questions and I answered all the questions.  So, she said, "Okay."  So, she went on, she said, "But, don't blurt out in class, raise your hand," you know, went on like that.  So, at lunchtime, she talked to some of the other teachers and the principal, I guess, and everything and anyway, when we got back in class, one of the secretaries was in the class and she said, "James, we're going down to the principal's office."  I said, "Dog, I'm in trouble."  She brought me down to the principal's office.  She talked to, his name was Mr. Workman (ph.).  She talked to Mr. Workman and she said, "Mr. Workman," she said, "I'd like to have James do, I would like to have him do other books and things of that sort," you know.  And, I wanna give him some special things and then I'll let him, you know, you know, run errands, do whatever we need to do in the class, you know.  She say, "I think I can work with him," you know.  Mr. Workman said, "Whatever, just keep him out of my office.  Whatever you can do," you know.  'Cause a lot of times I'd end up in the principal's office, you know, when you're bad in class or something like that, they send you to the principal's office.  So, that's what Miss Merrick did.  Miss Merrick would bring books for me to read and things of that sort.  And, she would give me extra assignments.  She said, "Now, the only way you get to do this special stuff, is that you have to do all your regular work.  And, you have to be in school," and everything.  'Cause by that time, she had talked to the other teachers and they had told her my history, you know.  So, that's what Miss Merrick did.  And, then Miss Merrick passed that on to Ms. Dunne (ph.) who I had in the fifth grade and on up the line.  So, I never stayed back in school again, all right.  So, I just was able to do special kinds of things, you know.  And, so, that was, that was really, really good for me and it helped me the rest of the time in school.
Story_ID: 136183
Speaker 1: And, so, anyway, when I got in the eighth grade [Waldwick Public School, Waldwick, New Jersey]--well, one of my things all through, from the time I was five years old, I said, "When I grow up, I'm gonna be a sailor."  That was my thing.  So, from when I was five years old.
Speaker 2: Now, what gave you that idea?  Or, do you know what inspired you to think about that?
Speaker 1: Yes.  My mom [Frances James-Alexander] one day bought me these, you remember they used to buy these little sailor suits for kids?  Are you old enough to remember that?  (Laughter).  My mom bought me one of these little sailor suits one time, with the bell pants and everything.  I was probably about five years old, okay.  And, everybody was saying how nice I looked in my sailor suit.  I would tell everybody I gonna be a sailor when I grow up.  And, that stuck in my head.  So, two things I always like, water and horses, okay.  And, I'll tell you a little about the horse history in a minute.  But, anyway, I, I went to the eighth grade.  Of course, I was crazy about sports.  And, I got to the eighth grade and by time I--when I got in the eighth grade I was fifteen.  Yeah, and by time I started my first year of high school [Ramsey High School, Ramsey, New Jersey], I was sixteen, 'cause I had stayed back twice.  And, I had to decide whether or not I wanted to go to school, to high school.  Back then, it wasn't a big deal.  Whether you went to school further or not, you know, once you got sixteen.  It just really wasn't.  I mean, and this isn't like you were in a ghetto school (laughter), you know.  But, higher education was not always given as an option, all right.  Jobs was an option that you--was what you were given, you know.  What kind, what are you gonna do?  What are you gonna be?  You know.  And, normally, if you in a, grow up in a town where everybody, you know, my dad [David Alexander] was one of the few professionals in the town.  And, he was an automobile mechanic so, you know what everybody else was, you know.  Everybody was laborers, you know, in the town that I grew up in.  And, so, anyway, I had this thing about wanting to play football, all right.  Remember now, I weighed probably 105, 106 pounds at that time.  Yeah, when I was sixteen, I probably didn't weight 110, all right.  But, anyway, I wanted to play football.  I could run.  So, I got to high school and I was able to play junior varsity football, all right.  And, so, once that first semester was over, football was over at Thanksgiving, all right.  I got to play that first semester and then I got that out of my system.  And, so, I just didn't ever, I never went back to school
Story_ID: 136184
Speaker 1: From the time that I was twelve, on the weekends, I would work at a pony track.  There was a place in Allendale [New Jersey], which is a town next to where I lived.  And, there was a place there we had found on one of our exploratory trips, called the Allendale Riding School.  And, they had all of these horses there.  And, the place was right on the border between Allendale and Saddle River.  And, so, we used to go there and just sit on the fence and watch these horses run around, whatever they were doing.  So, one day I was up there by myself.  I'd rode my bicycle up there.  And, this man came in this Willys Jeep and he pulled up where I was sitting, and I said, "Oh, Lord, I'm in trouble."  And, he said, "Come here, buy."  And, he was, he talked with an Irish brogue.  So, he was--instead of boy, he was saying "buy," you know, like that.  He thought really (laughter)--so, I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "What's your name?"  I said, "James."  He said, mine too.  He said, "But, they call me Jim."  She said, he said, "So, you'll be little Jim."  Now, this is just at a meeting, you know, right there at this by this corral.  And, he said, "You," he says, "I see you here a lotta times," you know.  I said, "Well, I like horses," you know.  He said, "Well, come on."  He took me down, he took me down, he told get in the car, said, "Leave my bicycle there."  He took me down to the house, down this gravel road, took me down to the house and over by the stable.  And, he says, he say "Pat," he said, "Patty (ph.)."  It was this old Irish guy, he was the stableman there.  He says, "Saddle up a pony and give him a ride."  So, he went in saddled up a pony.  Jim went on in the house.  Patty saddled up a pony and then he walked me all around the place.  And, then he showed me how to, you know, do with the pony and stuff like that, you know.  But, I had been on pony rides before.  But, he told me this was a little bigger than the normal ponies, you know.  And, so, rode around and then she showed me and then I was able to ride around the track by myself and everything, you know.  So, by and by, Jim came out and he says, he says "All right."  She says, "You're not afraid of the horses?"  I said, "Naw."  I said, "Naw," you know.  So, he says, he says, "Do you wanna work on the pony track?"  He says, "We have a pony track."  He say, "You ever been to the pony track?"  I said, "Yes.  Out on Route 4."  I mean, "Out on Route 17."  He said, "Well, that's my pony track."  He says, "You can walk out, work out there and walk, you know, walk kids around."  He says, "Do you have a telephone?"  I said, "Yes."  I game him my number.  And, so, that night, he called my ma [Frances James-Alexander] and asked her, you know, if I could work at the pony track.  And, my ma say--like I say I was eleven or twelve at the time, and my mom says, "Yes," you know.  Then they wouldn't have to worry about me on the weekend where I'd be, whether I'd drowned or something, you know.  (Laughter) so, that's what I did.  I worked on the weekends, I worked at the pony track.  And, then in the summertime, I would stay over at the, at the riding academy.  I later became stable boy there and learned to ride, you know.  I can ride at any time I wanted to ride.  And, then by time I was fourteen, I was teaching riding there.  So, that was another great interest in my life.  So, I did that up until, like I said, the time I was about sixteen when I quit school--
Story_ID: 136185
Speaker 1: And I got a job in Paterson [New Jersey].  And, this job--
Speaker 2: Now, what was the name of your school?  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 1: Oh, Ramsey High School [Ramsey, New Jersey], R-A-M-S-E-Y.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ramsey High School.  At my high school, eight different town, eight different small suburban towns all went to the same high school, all right.  There was only one high school in the region, you know, in that area.  And, eight towns, all of the towns went to this one big high school.  And, that was the first time that I had black students, that I went to school with black kids who weren't my relatives.  Later on, I had an uncle with some children who moved in Waldwick [New Jersey].  But, none of the children were my age, you know.  But, anyway, I went to school there and I had four black classmates in my class.  And, one of 'em, brother eventually married one of my sisters.  And, then there were two, two girls and then one guy who later became a pretty good football player, Dick Bodie (ph.).  But, anyway, that was like I saying, it was Ramsey High School.  So, anyway, like, when I was sixteen, I got this job at a coat factory.
Speaker 2: This is in Paterson?
Speaker 1: In Paterson.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I worked in a coat factory.  I was a helper to the cutter.  The guy who cut the materials, you know, all that.  And, then I would bring the materials, once he cut different materials, I'd lay out stuff at every different sowing machine.  And, I had to watch all the sowing machines that were handling certain parts, you know.  To make sure that they always had work there.  And, then I would, once they sowed their things together, I'd take it and move it to another position.  And, I met some friends there, you know, from Paterson.  And, I used to go to Paterson a lot.  That's another aspect that I'll talk about in a minute.
Story_ID: 136186
Speaker 1: So, now, you're working in Paterson, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which you said was one of the worst places in the world (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, anyway, yeah, like I said, and I got this job in Paterson, you know, working in this coat factory and met some friends there.  But, I have a lot of relatives in Paterson.  And, so,--
Speaker 1: Are these Alexanders, or?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  The Alexanders and Andersons (ph.) and Beltons (ph.), and James--Jameses (ph.), and you know, there's a whole Camden [South Carolina] connections, all right.  But, the majority of 'em was Alexanders.  Most of those folks for somehow, you know, they're relative to the Alexanders.  That was the dominate family out of Camden, South Carolina, and Kershaw County, South Carolina, and the Alexanders, you know.  There's all of these different hookups, you know, but it all keeps going back to Alexander.  So, anyway, in Paterson, even when I was young, you know, thirteen, fourteen years old, I would get out of school and sometimes get on a bus, get on the bus.  But, it was only a nickel.  I'll ride the bus to Paterson and hang out.  I had the affinity to wanted to hang out in Paterson.
Speaker 1: Now, you said it's one--it's a place that had more bars than any little town.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And, was this part of the attraction, or what?
Speaker 2: Just the street life.  I don't know what attracted me to that, to Paterson.
Speaker 1: Well, it seems that--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I just, I just enjoyed being around black folks.  There was really no interaction in Paterson between white folks and black folks (laughter), you know.  Black folks were just all over the city, you know.  And, they had what they used to call chippy joints.  It would be little storefront places where they would sell hot dogs, and candy, and soda, ice cream, and have a juke box.  And, that's all they were.  And, the kids would hang out there and they called them chippy joints.  And, I used to like to go to those places.  And, they, you know, and they'd play the jukeboxes and, you know, we'd dance, and that's where the kids went, you know.  And, I used to love that.  I mean, kids would go their right from school, you know.  I mean, it was nothing for mothers and fathers to come by there.  They know right where their kids at, instead of home from school, you know.  So, but, that was, I loved Paterson for some reason.  And, then, later--
Speaker 1: So, this is about 1950?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1950, period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, but, we're talking about the late '40s [1940s], late '40s [1940s] into the '50s [1950s].  But, also, during that time, they had the street corner guys, you know, singing in the streets, you know.  Them guys would always be in there singing, on the corners and stuff.  And, every bar had a little trio.  A little jazz group playing.  If you would be there in the evenings, you can, you know, you can go in the bars, you know.  They just wasn't gonna serve you, you know.  But, you could go in there and listen to the music and listen to the singers and that's how I got so involved in music, you know.
Story_ID: 136187
Speaker 1: But, anyway, going back to when I was sixteen and working on this job [Paterson, New Jersey coat factory] and had a couple of frank--friends, Freddie Newton (ph.), and Hank Jeeder (ph.) was one, and a couple of other friends.  And, like I said, a lot of cousins and stuff.  And, then when I was like a month away from my seventeenth birthday, I got my mom [Frances James-Alexander] to go down with me to the recruiting office and we signed me up for the [U.S.] Navy.  I was--but, they couldn't take me until I turned seventeen.  So, we signed up and that was the 16th of July in 1952 [July 16, 1952].  I turned seventeen August the 7th [August 7, 1952], and I got my induction papers about a week later.  And, I left out of New York [New York City, New York] on the 27th of August [August 27, 1952].  And, from there I went to Baltimore, Maryland to boot camp.  And, they--I'm sorry, to Bainbridge, Maryland, [U.S. Naval Training Center, Bainbridge] it's B-A-I-N-B-R-I-D-G-E.  And, that's where I went to boot camp.  And, there--
Speaker 2: How did--yeah, how'd you like the Navy?  Was it what you thought it was gonna be?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it.  And, boot camp, one day we were out behind the barracks, a bunch of guys, we were shooting dice.  And, I was shooting the dice and I made a ten.  And, a guy bet me that I wouldn't make the ten.  And, so, I roll the dice, we were shooting for pennies or something and he, "I bet you ten dollars you don't make that ten."  I said, "It's a bet."  So, I rolled a ten, he didn't have ten dollars.  So, he said, "Here, hold my camera until payday.  And, then I'll get the camera back from you.  It was little [Kodak] Brownie Hawkeye camera.  And, I said, "All right."  So, I took the camera, put it in my locker.  And, when payday came, this would be our first payday, all we got was ten dollars.  (Laughter) So, the guy said, "I'm not gonna give you my only ten dollars."  He said, "You just keep the camera."  Okay.  So, about, I think, it was probably a week or two later, yeah, it was probably about a week or two later, they--there was this guy who was a newscaster back then, Walter Winchell.  You ever heard of Walter Winchell?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: He was this great newscaster.  His son [Walter Winchell, Jr.] was in the next barracks, I think, to me.  And--or, he was on the base or somewhere stationed on the base or something of that sort.  Anyway, somebody had said, Walter Winchell was coming to the base.  So, I said, "Well, I'm gonna get some film.  I'm gonna take Walter Winchell's picture."  So, I went over to the PX [Post Exchange] and the guy showed me how to put the film in and everything.  And, so, I had this camera.  Somehow or other the Walter Winchell thing didn't happen.  But, I had this film in the camera.  So, I started, I said, "Well, I'mma just take some of the guys' pictures."  So, I took a few of the guys' pictures.  And, when over to the PX and brought the film in and they, you know, developed and printed my film.  And, when I went to get my--pick the pictures up, the guy said, you know, he said, "You got a pretty good eye."  And, he showed me a few things and everything, you know.  And, so, when I came back over to the barracks, the guys kept begging me for the pictures.  So, I said, "Naw, you get--it's gonna cost you fifty cents for this picture.  So, the guys gave me fifty cents, you know, for the pictures.  So, I said, (unclear) and that allowed me to buy some more film, you know.  And, so that's what I started doing.
Story_ID: 136188
Speaker 1: And, then I found this jumper.  They used to call the shirts, you know, your [U.S.] Navy shirt, they call 'em a jumper.  I found this jumper in one of the barracks that we had to go clean up one day.  And, it had stripes on it, you know.  So, I took it back and brushed it all off and everything, you know.  So, what I would do, I would take the guys' pictures for fifty cents.  I said, "For a dollar, you could put this jumper on with the stripes, you know--
Speaker 2: They had the ensign stripes?
Speaker 1: And, then you could send that home on the arm.
Speaker 2: Oh, so, it looked like they were at--they were on--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looked like they were, you know.
Speaker 2: What do they call it?  An en--not an ensign but, a petty officer?
Speaker 1: Right.  Petty officer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  But, naw, these were three stripes so that would be what they call seaman first class [now seaman].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Seaman first class.  That's the first step before petty officer [third class].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, anyway, you know, so, I would have them stand like this, you know, with the three stripes out, you know.  And, I would take their picture, and they would--you know, to send home to their girlfriends or whatever, you know, see.  So, that's what I would do, you know.  I didn't know we could all go to jail, to the brig for that.  But, you know, that's what I was doing.  So, anyway, I--and then I stated taken pictures around the base [Bainbridge, Maryland] and all of that.  So, in November, once I graduated out of boot camp, my first duty station was Charleston, South Carolina.  'Cause when we took our tests, everybody takes different kinda tests.  I got 100 on my Mechanical Ability Test.  And, of course, my dad [David Alexander] was a mechanic.  So, he, you know, he made all of us learn what he was doing, you know; me and my brothers, you know.  So, anyway, I got a hundred on that.  So, they sent me to Charleston OJT, what they call on-the-job training.   I all--I went automatically there with what they call a fireman billet.  In other words, people, most people would what they call SN, which stands for seaman.  Everybody normally gets that until they finished whatever kind of training they're doing, or finish whatever school they're doing.  And, then you become designated.  I went there as a designated FN, which automatically meant that I went there with--when you graduate you get your first little two stripes, you know.  And, you get--its seaman recruit, was one stripe, you know.  And, then you go to seaman [now seaman apprentice] which is two stripes.  And, then seaman first class [now seaman]--before petty officer--which is three stripes.  And, then everybody got white stripes, you know, until you made your billet.  If it was in the engineering aspect of it, then your stripes were red, all right.  I automatically went there with red stripes, you know, which made me some kind of smart-aleck in the engineering field, you know.  So, I went automatically with my red stripes to be trained on-site.
Story_ID: 136189
Speaker 1: While I was at Charleston [South Carolina], was the first time that I ever ran into flagrant racism, while I was in Baltimore [Maryland], I mean, while I was in [U.S. Naval Training Center] Bainbridge [Maryland].  After you were there for like a month, you got a day off.  That's the first time you get a day off.  We all went into this little town, which is the closest town to the base called Perry, Perry, Maryland.  And, we all went to this place and it was a restaurant there and there was about four, about four black guys, one Navajo Indian, two or three Puerto Ricans, and maybe about a dozen white guys.  And, we all go to this restaurant out there.  You know, our desire was to go, you know, and have a good hamburger rather than the base and PX [post exchange] hamburgers, you know.
Speaker 2: This was like 1952, we're talking?
Speaker 1: 1952, right.  And, when we went into the place, a guy came from behind the counter and said, you know, he pulled one of the white guys aside and said, "If you don't look like this guy, y'all can't stay in here, whoever doesn't look like this person here," you know.  And, like I said, our whole company mostly, the majority of our company came from northeast, you know.  Because that's, you know, that whole group that went together from New York [New York City, New York], you know, that's where we went in.  Left--shipped out from, they call it, with northerners, you know.  And, so this really wacked us a little bit, you know.  And, so, we ended up, you know, cursing the people out and everything, the white guys and the black guys, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and we just left out of the place, you know.  And, all of us went, left out.  And, that really rocked me, you know.  You know, you know, you had heard about this, you know.  But, it's something I hadn't personally, had that kind of confrontation with, you know.  And, so, what it, what it did to me, me and this Navajo guy and one of my Puerto Rican friends, and one of the black guys; the four of us, we just went off on our own.  But, I didn't wanna go in or near another store or business or anything else, you know.  So, we just walked around a little while and then we went back to the base, you know.  We just went back to the base.  But, then it started making me very, very, aware of little things, you know.  Some of the leadership, if you will, guys who were training us, and so on and so forth, who would pick out certain people to do certain things.  And, it made you very conscious, you know, of certain things and then some things that made you really self-conscious, you know.  And, so, that was my baptizing, baptizing in fire, you know.
Story_ID: 136190
Speaker 1: But, then I went to Charleston [South Carolina], you know, you know, that just piled more misery on me, you know.  Because, then I ran into real blatant racism, you know.  Because, they had so many [U.S.] Military people there, when the bus came up to the base, to the gate where we were going into town, we all spitefully sat in the front of the bus, okay.  Hispanic, you know, guys and black guys, we all just, you know, they had them, you know, they had the little labels, you know.  But, we sat right in the front of the bus, along with white guys, you know, sailors, okay.  And, we just did it for spite.  Now, we--there would also be black and white guys who worked on the base, all right.  'Cause, now--Charleston was, you know, one of the biggest shipyards in the country, which incidentally, they have closed down for some crazy reason.  But, anyway, we would just sit, you know, wherever, you know, just to be confrontational, I think, you know.  You know, you're seventeen, you know, eighteen years old.
Speaker 2: Did they ever say anything?
Speaker 1: Sometimes some of the workers, base workers might say something, but they say it from whereever they were sitting, you know.  They would--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Say certain things, you know.
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: You all shouldn't be sitting up there.
Speaker 1: Like, you know, some people don't where they supposed to sit, or something like that, you know.  But, you know, they were real careful about how they said it in there, you know.  Because, you know, and like I said, there were [U.S.] Marines too, you know.  Black and white marines on the bus, you know, 'cause they worked on the bases too, you know.  And, sometimes you run into a little problems in town, in Charleston, but mostly we had our own, there were black areas of the city where we would rather be anyway.  So, we just didn't just go through a whole lot of crap, you know, with that.  But, it was very interesting to say the least.
Story_ID: 136191
Speaker 1: But, one day, I was sitting on the pier talking to a couple of guys, and I worked on with tug boats and cranes, yard cranes.  You know, they had what they call floating dry docks.  I worked on them.  And, we would mostly if--when ships got into, you know, the inland area, tug boats would go out and bring 'em in, you know.  And, then if we had to unload things off of 'em, or they were doing some construction on a ship, outside of the pier, you know, we would then go to the YSD what they call it, the yard ship dock, and, they had cranes on 'em and we would go out there and do that.  And, sitting on the pier this day, quiet morning, and this guy comes down the pier with this great big camera, with this big flash on it.  I had never seen one.  So, I asked him what kind of camera it was.  And, he told me, you know, it's [Graflex Pacemaker] Crown Graphic, you know, graphic timer, and he showed me how it worked, and so on and so forth.  And, I told him, I said, "Well, I'm a photographer too," you know (laughter).  I said, "Let me show you some of my stuff."  So I ran in and got my scrapbook.  And, had all my stuff in a scrapbook, you know, brought it out, showed it to him, and he said, looked pretty good.  He says, he said, he said, "Well, one day, you know, come down to my studio and I'll show you what, you know, what we do."  And, so he told me where it was.  So, the next day was a Saturday.  Instead of going to town [Charleston, South Carolina], I went on over there about nine or ten o'clock in the morning, I went on over to his studio there.  And, he was out, standing outside talking to somebody, and he introduced me, you know, and this guy was one of his apprentices.  And, we went on in and he showed me the darkroom and the different kinds of cameras and all of that.  And so, from then on, you know, at least a couple of times a week, I would go over there, you know, and hang out.   So, after a while, I even, he let me take one of the cameras and go out and do a shot or two for him, you know.  And, a couple of times, you know, I did some stuff for him, you know, like if he wanted to be off for the weekend, I did a couple of shots for him and things of that sort.  So, that's where I really got involved in photography.  And, for the next four years, I shot pictures all over, you know.
Speaker 2: It was just helping him, or did you have a--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  Just shooting whatever, you know.  That was--I wasn't consciously doing documentary at that time.  Not consciously.  A lot of my work later, I found was of a documentary nature, you know, but it wa- it wasn't from any kind of consciousness, you know.
Story_ID: 136192
Speaker 1: Now, you're a, you're a pretty good story teller.  You like to tell stories, I--we can tell that.  But, so, do you think that kind of translates into the--your camera work?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have this thing I was thinking about the other day.  I was thinking, I wondered if I could ever do small books that would just tell stories.  Just a specific story, you know, about different people, places, or events.
Speaker 1: Without any text, you mean?
Speaker 2: Yes.  With text.
Speaker 1: With text, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, with text.  Just, just a specific story, you know.  Like for instance, once in 1974, I was reading something, a little magazine that said, that this year, or the next month, would be the one hundredth birthday of W.C. Handy.  And, I was, I was running an arts organization that I had founded in New Haven, Connecticut.  And, I was also working as a consultant at Yale School of Art and Architecture [later Yale School of Art and Yale School of Architecture, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And, in this program called BEST, The Black Environmental Studies Team, which had another part to it called The Black Workshop.  And, Willie Ruff who is a jazz bassist, and he also played, you know, several other instruments, was teaching in the Black Studies Program at Yale.  And, he was from Florence, Alabama, and, not was, he is from Florence, Alabama.  But, Willie was telling me about W.C. Handy.  He had told me about W.C. Handy, who was also from there.  And, so, I started checking around to find out what was gonna be happening around this one hundredth celebration.  And, I found out that there were several cities in the south that was gonna be celebrating his one hundredth birthday.  So, I decided to go to Florence, all right.  They were having a celebration there.  And, then they was having a celebration in Memphis [Tennessee].  And, then they were having a celebration in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So, I mapped out my little trip, and, so, I flew into Florence, Alabama, flew into Alabama.  And, I got to photograph his family.  His family was there.  They had made his home into a museum.  They had taken the house he was born in, back in the back woods, and brought this little wooden house, little clapboard house, out closer to the main street.  And, then they'd added another section to it and made a museum out of it.  And, so, his family, his brother, his wife and other family members were there, you know.  And, I got to get all of them out in front of the house and did a picture of all of them together.  And, then I photograph that.  And, then they had a celebration at the college.  I think, it was University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  The one that [Alabama governor George] Wallace had stood out in front of it and said, you know, "Segregation now and forever," all that.  But, they had a celebration there, which was interesting.  They had a big billboard out there with his picture on it, you know.  Out there on a, on one of the main streets.  And, so, I--they had Preservation Hall Jazz Band played there.  I met Emme Kemp, who was this jazz musician, started playing jazz when she was three years old.  Florence Johnson (ph.), one of the old time jazz and blues singers was there.  And, Maxine Sullivan, she was the one who sang "Saint Louis Blues" in the first movie that they made ['St. Louis Blues'] on W.C. Handy in 1939.  So, you know, they remade the move later, but she was the one who sang in the first one.  She lived in the Bronx in New York.  And, we later became very good friends.  And, so, after that, I was there for about two days.  I left there and I went to Memphis and they were having an all day celebration there.  And, that was at the time that they were bulldozing Beale Street, to redo Beale Street.  But, Club Handy, the Club Handy sign was still up.  You know, the club had been closed for years, you know.  But, I got pictures of the club with the Handy sign, and they had made this little park, and I did that.  And, then the students from the high schools had a parade, playing W.C. Handy's music, you know, and I documented that.  And, then after that day, the next morning I got up and went to New Orleans, and they were doing things there.  And, I went and shot at Preservation Hall and in the streets of New Orleans and stuff like that.  So, that was all just one, just a whim, you know, for--
Speaker 1: An idea that you picked up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Just one, you know, just one day I just jumped up and did it.
Story_ID: 136193
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: We were--so, you had learned how to shoot and you were helping, you know, the photographer--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: For the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, so, anyway, back to Charleston [South Carolina].  At the time that I was in Charleston, I--like I said, about Paterson [New Jersey], you know, I loved the streets and the music, and being in the streets and everything.  So, that's what I did in Charleston.  I had some other friends with--who like the same things that I was crazy about and that was street life.  And, so, we had some fake ID that said we were twenty-one, you know, that was easy to find in the Navy, you could get that, you know.  So, we had fake ID.  I think--when I was eighteen years for instance, seventeen, eighteen years old, I looked like I was thirteen or fourteen, you know.  But, I had this ID that said I was twenty-one, you know.  And, so, they never questioned it, you know.  So, I--we hung out in the bars, you know.  In Charleston, and we--I mean, it wasn't an inch of ground where there were black folks in that whole area that I didn't go to.  Like now, when I meet people from Charleston, you know, I can give them stories about Charleston, and places, and people in Charleston that they, that they don't (laughter) know about, you know.  It's because we just hung out all over Charleston and the surrounding area.  There was a place out there they used to call, you know,--the blacks couldn't go to the regular beach, but there was a place out there they called Mosquito Beach, you know.  It was out in the woods and we called it, they called it Skeeter (ph.) Beach, you know.  We'd go out there to skee--they'd have crab boils and you go out there and buy what they call scrap iron.  Which was some people called it corn liquor, but they called it scrap iron out there.  And, we would go out there and hang out there all night.  An area called James Island and James Island.  The police and the sheriff wouldn't even go out there.  But, there was, you know, some of us, you know, sailors, we would go out there and hang out, you know.
Speaker 2: James Island was made famous, the famous battle [Battle of Grimball's Causeway, February 10, 1865] of the 54th [sic, 55th]--
Speaker 1: Right.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Massachusetts [55th Massachusetts Colored Infantry]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In the Civil War (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Yes.  So, we would hang out all of those different places.  The Lincoln Theater, you know, you know, that was there.  And, there was this big fancy hotel, I forget the name of it right now.  It sat right down on King Street.
Speaker 2: Is this in Charleston?
Speaker 1: In Charleston.
Speaker 2: Charles--okay.
Speaker 1: In Charleston, yes.  This big hotel, I can't think of the--Francis Marion, that's it, Francis Marion Hotel.  It sit there, you know, and it's still there today.  And, I was invited to come to Charleston to do a jazz exhibit two years ago.  And, on the jazz history, you know, they had a seminar on the jazz history of Charleston, which goes back to the 1800s.  A lot of people don't know that, you know.  Charleston had a jazz history there.  This jazz band that was started in an orphanage there back in the 1800s.  And, they toured all through Europe and every place else.
Speaker 2: Playing jazz, what we call jazz.
Speaker 1: Playing jazz.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Playing jazz in the 1800s, you know.  So, there's always that question between New Orleans [Louisiana] (laughter), you know, and Charleston.
Story_ID: 136194
Speaker 1: But, you know, but they've united that thing so.  There's an organization called the Charleston Jazz Institute [Charleston, South Carolina], all right, that was started by this guy and a lady there.  But, anyway, I was invited to come down there and be a part of the Charleston Jazz Initiative [CJI] Circle.  Because, I had documented some of the musicians who come out of that, out of that orphanage.  Like, Benny Green [sic, Freddie Green], the jazz guitarist that played with Count Basic all of those years.  He was one of the people who came out of that program.
Speaker 2: Now, that's much later, though, than when you were in the [U.S.] Navy, right?  That's much later when you do that?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I did that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Much later.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh.
Speaker 1: But, what I was gonna say, is that this hotel, the Francis Marion, you couldn't even walk on that side of the street.  When you got down by that hotel, you know, you had to walk out in the (laughter) in the street almost, you know, to go pass there, you know.  And, then while we were down there, we had a suite in the Francis Marion, you know.  So, it was really interesting, you know, how history has changed, you know, in terms of black folks, you know.  One of the managers--
Speaker 2: So, the Francis Marion was a--
Speaker 1: In this hotel.  It's a white hotel.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A big fancy white hotel.
Speaker 2: But, you all had a suite in it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  When we went down there, you know, two years ago, you know, my cousin and I.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was two weeks ag--I mean, two years ago.  So, I was telling him the history.  I took my cousin on a car ride, if you would, you know, around Charleston [South Carolina] telling 'em--showing him the different places, you know, and everything there.
Story_ID: 136195
Speaker 1: But, anyway, so, that was the whole thing about Charleston [South Carolina], you know, there wasn't a great, for the sailors, it wasn't a great interaction between whites and blacks, you know, other than on the base.  And, for the people in the community, you know, it was just--outside, now the guys and the ladies who worked on the [U.S.] naval base had a pretty good jobs.  They made pretty good money, you know, the guys how work ship fitters and things of that sort, all right.  Now, in 1952, I was a revolutionary before I even knew I was one (laughter).  Because, what we used to do, me and two friends of mine, we went down the pier where they had the black toilets and the white toilets; sat side by side.  And, the black drinking fountains and white drinking fountains, and we used to go and stop up the white toilets.  We would take and throw rags or whatever down the white toilets, you know.  And, do things to the white drinking fountains and things of that sort, you know.
Speaker 2: That's sabotage, isn't it?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.  That's sabotage.  Government property.  But, anyway, that's what we did.
Speaker 2: Now, this is on the base?
Speaker 1: This is on the base.
Speaker 2: They had, they had segregated these on the base?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes!
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sure.  Sure, on the base.  And, but, now, it was supposed to have been desegregated in 1948.  But, it wasn't, all right.  Okay.  It wasn't.  And, what, what--white guys would walk all the way down the pier.  Now this, remember this now, this pier is almost a mile long.  They would walk all the way down the pier to go to the bathroom.  When they had the one that said black right next to it.  The ones that was the black ones.  Even after, this shows how you can be programmed, even after the signs came down, they still both went to their own.  The black person, black guys and the white ones.
Speaker 2: Now, were the--these white sailors from that region?  Or, did they--
Speaker 1: The white sailors?  No, no, I'm not talking about the sailors, I'm talking about the civilian workers.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: See, I'm--this is civilian, civilian workers.  You know, those were for civilian facilities.  You know, they had the toilets and so on and so forth.  Yeah, you know, the white sailors and--
Speaker 2: I guess I was confused 'cause you were saying that--I was asking you if the toilets that you stopped up were on the base or--
Speaker 1: They were on base--
Speaker 2: They were for--
Speaker 1: But, they were on the pier--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, they were for the workers.
Speaker 2: Okay, civilian workers.
Speaker 1: They were for the civilian workers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not for us.  You know, we, we used our own facilities on, whether we were on ships or whether we were on, you know, the small craft, you know.
Speaker 2: But, there was no such segregation on the ship or anything?
Speaker 1: No.  No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.  No.  No.  There was no segregation on the ships and, you know, and there was no segregation in the military facilities.  That had stop, you know, like a couple years before.  Right.  Although, at the time that I went in the Navy, non-whites, unless they had some specific skills, nine out of ten of them were automatically, in the Navy, they were automatically relegated to kitchen and steward jobs.  Steward were people who served the officers.  You were automatically--they made you a TN [stewardsman].
Speaker 2: Just automatically?
Speaker 1: Automatically.  Yes.  If you were Filipino, if you were Puerto Rican, if you were black, mostly the Filipino and blacks.  Sometimes not the Hispanic, all right.  Now, they, they had an opportunity to change their billet, by signing up for different schools and stuff at the time that I went in.  But, before that, you know, they didn't, you know.  One of the greatest heroes from the Second World War [World War II], Dorie Miller [Doris Miller], all right, he was a TN, okay.  And, he's the one that shot down several Japanese Aircraft.
Speaker 2: Right.  He came out of the kitchen and got (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes.  That was Dorie Miller.  Yes.  But, so, anyway--
Speaker 2: Now, I've heard--now, confirm this, or unconfirm it, but that all the black sailors were trained to use the guns even though they were (simultaneously)?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Everybody was trained.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Sure.  Everybody--we went through the same training as everybody else.  You had to go through your training.  So, you were trained how to use the guns and everything, you know.  In boot camp, you learned everything on the ship, you know.  You went through all of the same training.  It didn't matter what your billet was.  You went, you--everybody had a duty station, okay.  If you're on a ship, okay, or, if you're on the base.  Everybody had a duty station.  And, so, that if the alarm went off, everybody knew automatically where they went, okay.  Everybody had a duty station, all right.
Story_ID: 136196
Speaker 1: And, so, so, anyway, I had a transfer one time, remember I was telling you about this, my dad [David Alexander] worked for this guy who had this construction company?  We lived on his property.  They had a house there; on his property, that, when I dad got married, he rented my dad this house, for ten years--for ten dollars a month, okay.  And, so, we lived in that house.  We were all raised there, me my brothers and sisters; ten of us.  Not the three children that my dad had before he married my mom [Frances James-Alexander].  His youngest son, his name was Qweety Mangardi (ph.).  His youngest son was in the [U.S.] Navy.  And, he became a naval officer.  And, it so happened that when I was sent to Charleston [South Carolina], he was on that base also.  And, he was a pretty high officer on the base, all right.  And, I knew him from the time I was a baby, okay.  And, so, when I went home on leave, his youngest sister, Jenny, when I--the first leave that I had when I went home, Jenny had told me that he was stationed there.  And, she gave me his phone number and address.  So, I looked Qweety (ph.) up and he was really surprised to see me, you know.  And, so, you know, we would see each other from time to time.  So, when I got ready to leave that base, I went and told Qweety (ph.), you know, I gotta, you know, I need to leave, get away from here, you know.  And, so, he, he hooked it up for me to go aboard this ship.  They were, they were putting a ship, a new type of ship into commission in New Orleans [Louisiana] at the Todd-Johnson Shipyards.  They had this new type of ship they were putting together called LSTs [Landing Ship, Tank].  They were LSTs, landing ships, okay.  And, so, Qweety said, you know, "That would be a good experience," you know.  Because, it was an opportunity to learn all about this ship and everything.  We would be stationed down there before the ships were even completed.  And, we would be on the base at Algiers [Louisiana], which was right across the river from New Orleans.  And, so, I was fortunate enough, you know, to get that.  So, I went down there to New Orleans and we lived, stayed on the base there.  And, that was right up my alley because we had fun in New Orleans, you know.  New Orleans streets and the music and stuff like that, you know.  And, so, we were there for about six months while they finished the ship.  And, then from there the home port was going to be in Little Creek, Virginia.  So, we went from there, I don't know if either y'all remember, K--Hurricane Hazel [1954].  Hurricane Hazel was one of the first named Haz--hurricanes.  Hurricane Hazel was very destructive.  We were going through Cape Hatteras, Virginia.  Well, we pulled into, from New Orleans, we went into Miami [Florida] and they had the christening ceremony for the ship.  And, then from there, we went on around to, heading to Nor--Little Creek, Virginia and ran through Hurricane Hazel right off of the coast of Cape Hatteras.  And, it tore the whole top deck off of the ship, just about, you know, really messed it up.  So, instead of going into Little Creek, we went right into Norfolk [Virginia], into dry-dock, you know, so that they can do repairs on the ship.  And, then I was back and forth between Portsmouth and Little Creek and Norfolk, Virginia.  And, I was there for several months.
Story_ID: 136197
Speaker 1: Here [Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Virginia] again it was still the South, you know.  And, so, they had a ship there, a LSD, landing ship dock they called it.  If small boats had problems, this landing ship dock could go out and lower itself down into the water.  And, they could pull them in, set 'em up and raise the back up and work on, you know, the boats.  And, so, they had what they called a swap.  Every once in a while in the [U.S.] Navy, they had swaps.  If they were moving a ship from one port or one city, or even one country to another, from its, from its regular home port, changing home ports, they would put the word out for swaps.  Like for instance, if you have a guy who is married, living in a particular city, you know, and they wanted to stay there and so on and so forth, you would swap with them onto this ship that was moving.  You had to have--all things had to be equal, you know, in terms of your rank and so on and so forth.  Because, they would have so many people of each rank and each billet, each job, you know.  And, so, you could only swept--you can only swap laterally, all right.  So, fortunately, I was able to find someone.  I worked in the engine room.  I worked on evaporators, okay, that made fresh water, okay.  I was trained in the evaporators, we made fresh water from sea waters, you know.  It was a chemical process, you know, that you did.  And, so, I found a guy who wanted to stay in Virginia, you know, on this, you know, and so, we were able to swap.  So, I was able to get on that ship and go out to California.  So, I was able to go from Little Creek, Virginia, and we went all the way around, you know, down through the Panama Canal into, around to Long Beach, California, all right.  And, so, that's where I was able to, to go.  We, matter fact, we went into San Diego [California] for a while and then up to north--then up to Long Beach.  So, I spent my last two years on the West Coast in the navy and we went back and forth to Hawaii and Japan, and the Far East.  I was able to experience that too, in the Navy.  And, like I said, still, I was still, you know, shooting pictures but, you know.  And, when I got ready, when I--
Speaker 2: So, you were just still doing it kind of voluntarily?  You were--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Just voluntarily.
Speaker 2: As a hobby, sort of?
Speaker 1: Just as a hobby.  Just as a hobby.  And, when I--
Speaker 2: What were you shooting with then?  Were you still shooting with your Brownie, or?
Speaker 1: No.  I had, you know, picked up a couple of different camera through the years, you know.  I even had a, what they call it, Voigtlander, you know, which was a German camera, 35mm, which was a pretty good camera, you know, at that time.  And, I was, I had, was going with a girl there in Los Angeles [California], when I was stationed in Long Beach.
Story_ID: 136198
Speaker 1: So, when I was getting ready to--it got close to time for me to get out [of the U.S. Navy], and I was in a tossup between whether I was coming back to the East Coast or staying in California.  I had met Johnny Otis.  Are you familiar with Johnny Otis?  Johnny Otis was a--which I only found out much later, years later, that he was white.  Everybody had always assumed Johnny Otis was black.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, you thought he was black then?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I thought Johnny Otis was black, you know.  But, you know, be--you know, there's a lot of real light-skinned black folks, you know.  Johnny Otis, you know, had almost an olive, you know, tone to him.  And, this deep black hair, okay.  And, he had more soul than most black folks, okay.  Johnny Otis ran a program at this club called Oasis in Los Angeles [California].  And, it was like, sorta like the Apollo Amateur Hour [sic, Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater, New York City] all right.  And, Johnny Otis had this band, which was all just about all black, the band, most of--well, I think, the whole band outside of Johnny Otis, was black.  And, they had the amateur hour, matter fact, little Esther, Esther Philips, that's how she became famous.  She came out of that.  Mel Walker, he sang with this group, I think it was, might have been the Robins, was one of the doo-wop groups.  And, he would, him and Mel Walker and Esther Philips were the first Doo-wop, you know, duos sorta in the--like Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, but there was them.  And, Johnny Otis was really, really famous.  He did, you know, one of his more famous records was 'Hand Clapping' [sic, 'Willie and the Hand Jive'].  They had this song called 'Hand Clapping,' you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, was that--you mean, 'Hand Jive'?
Speaker 1: 'Hand Jive,' I mean.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Hand Jive.'  Yeah, that was Johnny Otis.
Speaker 2: 'Hand Jive'?  That was Johnny.  Okay.
Speaker 1: That was Johnny Otis.
Speaker 2: I heard his name.  But, I didn't know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Johnny Otis.
Speaker 2: I couldn't remember (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: 'Hand Jive.'  Right.
Speaker 2: Doing that crazy Hand Jive.
Speaker 1: Doing the crazy Hand--that was Johnny Otis.  And, that was him singing on that too.  Yeah.  And, matter fact, he has a son [Shuggie Otis] right now who's a musician, who's really, really popular.  I think he's a drummer.  But, anyway, I met Johnny Otis there that time, you know, and I hung out in the clubs there, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was one--
Speaker 1: In L.A.
Speaker 2: Of the early rock 'n' roll hits, 'Hand Jive.'
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know all the--
Speaker 1: 'Hand Jive.'  Yes.
Speaker 2: Kids in the neighborhood were trying to do the Hand Bone then, trying to get down, you know.
Speaker 1: The 'Hand Jive.' Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Doing that crazy 'Hand Jive.'  Yeah.  And, so, that was Johnny Otis.  And, so, you know, he was really, really, really nice guy, you know.  So, and I hung out there, and, so, anyway, I was going with this girl there and I had by that time several, you know, scrapbooks full of pictures and stuff.  And--
Story_ID: 136199
Speaker 1: So, the ship that I was on that was getting, was getting ready to go back, was getting ready to go back to the Far East, going to Korea.  And, anybody who had less than four months to do, they had two choices.  They could re-enlist or they could take an early out, okay.  And, I was doing what was called a minority cruise.  In other words, I went in at seventeen, and so, it meant I could get out the day before my twenty-first birthday.  So, I was due to get out on August the 7th in 1956 [August 7, 1956].  And, so, they let me, they gave me a new date of August, I mean, of July the 6th [July 6, 1956], all right.  And, so, I could get discharged then with full benefits, okay.  So, I was highly recommended for, you know, to re-up.  Up then, you had to be recommended to re-enlist.  Now, they take whoever, whenever, however, you know.  But, anyway, you had to be recommended back then.  So, I was recommended.  But, I decided--I found out one thing, it didn't matter how high you got in the [U.S.] Navy, you always was gonna have five people telling you what to do and how to do it.  And, most of 'em knew less than you about what you were doing.  So, I decided that that was not a career for me, all right.  So, I took my early out.  I had made the mistake of telling this girl that we were gonna get married when I discharged.  So, the closer it got to time for me to get out, the colder my feet got, you know, in terms of this marriage deal.  So, I decided I didn't wanna get married.  So, when I got my early discharge, you know, I told her I was getting ready to get transferred or something, you know, and that was it.  And, all of these scrapbooks of pictures, you know, they were just pictures to me, you know.  You know, I wasn't into historical mementos and all that stuff.  But, I left that stuff with her.  And, that's where all of that stuff was, and is probably, I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: A--today.
Story_ID: 136200
Speaker 1: So, you're out of the [U.S.] Navy, so--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So, yeah, so then, I got discharged from the Navy, and--
Speaker 1: What I read, let me just ask you this.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I read that you didn't take too many pictures after you got out of the Navy.  You kinda stopped taking pictures?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's the period we're getting into now.
Speaker 1: Well, what's, what was--okay, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--when I got out of the Navy, you know, made my way back to Waldwick, New Jersey.  And, when I got back to Waldwick, I, you know, the first thing you supposed to do is go get yourself a job.  One of the things that I did in the Navy was I had--I used to gamble a lot, in the Navy, you know, a lot of us did in the Navy, you know, I gambled a lot.  So, I went and got this job.  My first job, I went and met my first cousin's first cousin, in Paterson [New Jersey].  My first cousin's first cousin, his name was Eugene [ph.].  And, we were talking one day, and Eugene said, "Well, look, come on out to my job, you know, they hire people out there."  And, he worked in a place where they made these, what they called hide-a-beds now, all right.  Back then they were, convertible beds, you know, now.  But, convertible sofas back then, they called 'em.  But, now they call 'em hide-a-beds and whatever.  And, so, they gave me a job there.  And, what you were doing, what you had to do was you--they had me on piece work.  And, my job was to take the cotton and the cloth for the arms of the chairs, arms of the chairs, and then over them, all right.  And, you got so much, you know, you had to do so many a day.  And, all over, you know, what they gave you as a limit, you got paid extra for, you know.  That was just a, you know, come on to make you work faster, you know, really.  So, I was doing the arms.  There was a guy next to me over in the next space, he was putting together the springs, you know, doing the metal work.  So, a lot of times I was working faster than the carpenter.  The carpenter who was putting the frame together, all right, for the arms, which were wood, you know.  And, so, I would watch this other guy what he was doing.  So, one day I was standing over his shoulder watching, watching him do something and he said, he took his elbow and hit me in the stomach.  So, naturally, I wasn't gonna take that, so, I bust him in his face.  So, we got to fighting, you know, knocking down everything, everything--so, the two bosses came running out of the office.  And, they asked, you know, what is this about?  You know.  And, so, I told him, I said, "Well," I said, "I was looking over his shoulder at what he was doing and he poked me in the stomach," you know.  So, the boss asked him, said, "Ralph [ph.], why did you do that?"  You know, he said, "Well, he got his own work over there."  I said, "I didn't have any arms," you know.  "So, I was just watching what he was doing."  So, and you know, and said, "And, plus another day, he called me a name," you know.  And, so, he says, so the boss says to me, he says, "You know how to do what he's doing?"  I said, "Yeah, I know how to do it."  He said, "All right, put me one together."  So, I got there and put all the pieces together, and put one--put a frame together.  He said, "All right."  He said, "Ralphie [ph.], go get your check."  So, he fired the guy, fired the white guy, all right.  So, the next morning I came in, you know, and the piece work for doing that was really good, you know, high, you know, 'cause you could only do some many a day.  So, I came up with a system, where I would line all of my nuts up, all of my bolts, you know.  I'd line up everything, you know.  So, that I'd always had stuff there and I had put a system together where I could really, you know, make some money.  As soon as I got to the point where I was doing four or five a day, over what the limit was, the same guy that gave me the job, upped the limit (laughter).  He upped the limit to like, one, you know, one less than what I normally was putting together to get the extra money.  So, I quit.  I told 'em, "You take this job and shove it."
Story_ID: 136201
Speaker 1: I then went and got another job.  When I quit, oh, when I quit, my buddy quit.  Both of us quit.  And, we went and got a job at GE [General Electric].  We were working at GE and after we were there about, I guess about two month, GE lost this contract they were working on or something like that.  And, they were temp--laid said, well, you know, you're laying off, we're laying you off temporarily.  So, one of our hangouts was the poolroom.  So, I said to Mr. Summers [ph.] one day, the guy who ran the poolroom, I said, "Mr. Summers," [ph.] I say, "You close up 9:30 in the evening, that's when most of the people are just in the streets.  I said, "Let me rent the poolroom from you at night," you know.  Well, they used to know, they used to see us shooting dice in the alleyway and all that, you know.  He said, "Look," he said, "All right," he said, "Now, this is how much is I'm charging."  He said, "But, all I know is you're keeping the poolroom opened later."  I said, "Okay."  So, what I would do at night, Mr. Summers lived upstairs; him and his sister.  And, what I would do at night is I would, on the pool tables, I'd cover the pool tables.  They had covers for 'em.  I'd have a dice game going over here (laughter), at this table, and a card game going on over at this table over here, right.  And, so, we would, you know, do gambling there at night.  And, so, that summer, his son--his nephew, his sister's son came to live there.  He graduated from high school.  His name was Jiggs [ph.].  He came there.  So, me and Jiggs [ph.], you know, we would run the gambling games and stuff.  And, then Mr. Summers had gotten, you know, pretty old and sick, he wasn't doing too good.  So, Jiggs [ph.]--we up--we also ran the poolroom in the daytime along with another guy that used to work in there with him.  You know, used to work for Mr. Summers, who was real old at the time himself.  And, so, what happened then, you know, we would be in there, you know, at night and we would drink and gamble and all that, you know.   Paterson [New Jersey], that was Pat--what Paterson was known for, you know.  And, so, I, at that time, I didn't even bother with taking any pictures.  I just, you know, I'd have a camera laying around.  I might once and a while take a shot if I went out to one of my relatives' house or something, you know, do a couple pictures or something like that.  But, I wasn't really doing much with photography.  So, I lived that life from then, that was, you know, late '56 [1956], early '57 [1957] until 1964.
Speaker 2: So, this is from '57 [1957] to?
Speaker 1: Well, I got out in '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, really, from '56 [1956] up until 1964.  But, just gambling, maybe an odd job once in a while, you know.  I might take a job, you know, for whatever reason, you know, for a period of time.  But, I was just in the streets.  So, one thing back then, if you went to jail for drunk and disorderly or fighting or gambling, whatever, you know, when you went to court, when your court date came up, if you had a job, okay, it was sorta like the plantation system, you know.  If you had a job, you know, they don't wanna mess up the white man's business, you know.  If you had a job, they would let you out on probation or give you a fine or whatever, right.  So, whenever I had to go to court, I would get, I would get a job, like, you know, the week before, two weeks before, whatever.  Go around and get a job, any kind of job somewhere, you know.  And, then this where, this is where you worked when you, you know, you have your lawyer and the lawyer say, this is where you work, so.  You end up getting a fine or something like that.  Or, if, at most, you might get thirty days or, you know, sixty days or something like that, you know, depends on whatever it is you did.  So, anyway, what I did was, I then, went to--I went on with that kind of life until 1970, I mean, 1964.
Story_ID: 136202
Speaker 1: One morning, I woke up feeling real bad.  This was in February, and I went to the dresser to pour a drink, and this voice said to me, said, "Boy, you're killing yourself."  Just a voice.  I remember that voice as clear.  I always remember it today.
Speaker 2: It wasn't from the next room or nothing?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.  It was just this voice.  It might've been God, or my mamma [Frances James-Alexander] or one of my ancestors; I don't know who it was.  I put the drink down and that was it.  That was in February of 1970, of 1964.
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: And, I've never had another drink since.  And, so--
Speaker 2: Now, during this period of time were you, were you married or anything?  Or, did you--
Speaker 1: No.  I wasn't married but, I had a couple of kids, you know.  I produced a couple of wonderful kids during this period, you know.  And, but, I was just, you know, living the street life, all of those years.  So, then I left, I left Atlan--I left Paterson [New Jersey] and I went up to Springfield, Massachusetts.  Stayed up there with one of my former drinking buddies.  You know, I just wanted to get out of the whole atmosphere.  I went up there and just stayed up there for a couple of months, and then I moved back to New Jersey.  And, I lived in Clifton [New Jersey], started going, started back going with a former girlfriend that I hadn't seen in five years, starting going back with her.  And, we got married in '65 [1965].  And, we stayed married for one year.  During that period of time, I was detailing cars.  Started working detailing cars.  We moved from Clifton to Ridgewood, New Jersey.  Moved back over, over in the Ridgewood area, okay.  Which was right next to Waldwick [New Jersey] where I grew up.  I had all my relatives, had relatives in Ridgewood.  And, I as detailing cars for Brogan Cadillac.  It's a Cadillac-Oldsmobile Dealership.  I was washing and detailing cars for them.  And, downstairs from where I lived was an office where the guy ran a newspaper delivery service.  I was coming downstairs one day and he asked me--you know, we used to talk often, you know, nice guy.  One day--his name was Mr. Gordon [ph.].  He had been a furniture maker and then he bought this, bought this business.  So, one day he said to me, he said "Look," he says, "One of my guys are gonna be out tomorrow do you mind, you know, making a run for me?"  You know, dropping off papers for paperboys, okay.  I said, "No problems, I'll, I'll do it."  So, I got up four o'clock the next morning and made a run for him, you know.  Where you put your bundles of papers together and drop them off and you would finish normally by seven o'clock in the morning.  And, then that, you know, you go on, I went on to my regular job.  So, I started doing that for him.  After doing that for him about, I guess, two months, he said to me, he said, "How would you like to," he says, "I've got some other things that I wanna do.  I don't wanna come here at four o'clock in the morning anymore.  He said, "How would like to be my route manager?"  And, then you come down in the morning and get everything going and stuff like that, you know.  And, he says, "And, I'll pay you, you know, a decent salary," you know.  And, you know, "And then you won't have to be over there," you know, "doing what you're doing at Brogan's."  And, I said, "Yeah."  So, I could go to work at four o'clock in the morning and then I would be off like by ten or eleven o'clock.  So, I took the job.
Story_ID: 136203
Speaker 1: Then after about, me being there about three months, he decided that he wanted to move to Bermuda and open a furniture factory there.  And, he wanted me to be the general manager, just run the business for him.  So, I said, "Okay."  You know, he made me an offer.  He offered me a thousand dollars a month and that was in 1966.  You know most, you know most of the Wall Street brokers weren't working, weren't making that, you know.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That was good money for 1966.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That was a thousand dollars a month, that's what he offered me, all right.  And, so, what I did was, I ran his business.  And, then once a month, I'd fly over to Bermuda, you know, the last weekend, I mean, the first weekend of every month.  I'd fly down there, we'd go over the books and everything and, I got to spend a weekend in Bermuda.
Speaker 2: That is good when you put it in perspective.  I just happen to know, my brother is a college graduate, in '64 [1964] was making about five thousand dollars a year as an accountant.  So, you're making like, twelve thousand dollars--
Speaker 1: I was making twelve thousand dollars a year.
Speaker 2: A year.  That's, that's good, yeah.
Speaker 1: I was making twelve thousand dollars a year running that business for him.  What I did was, I started having incentives for paperboys.  What the business was really was the--all--different papers from the metropolitan area, Newark Star Ledger, the Paterson, two papers from Paterson [New Jersey], one paper, I mean, one paper from Paterson the morning papers, it was just morning papers.  The [New York] Daily News, New York Times, and at that time, they had the New York Herald Tribune, all right.  And, all of those papers would come in between four and five o'clock, the papers would come into this place.  And, then I had guys who would come in at four, all right, and they would make up bundles of all the different papers.  And, then these papers would be dropped off at the paperboy's houses.  And, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the paperboys would deliver the papers, on their bicycles or their moms would take 'em around or whatever.  Because, like I said, this was a commuter, Ridgewood [New Jersey] was a commuter town.  And, the guys wanted papers, you know, to read on the train going to work.  The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all of that.  So, that was the business was.  So, I had incentive programs that I had setup for the, for the paperboys.  Whoever came up with new--you know, you get so many new customers, this is what you get; some money, a new bicycle, whatever, all right.  So, I was able to build his business up like that.  So, then he ended up giving me another, a raise, you know, like that, you know.
Story_ID: 136204
Speaker 1: So, what happened was, I had gotten back into my photography, all right.  I was doing photography, I had gotten back into photography around sixty--[1964], you know, when I first quit drinking, all right.  You know, just something to take up time, you know, doing portrait for people, doing a couple of weddings and things of that sort.  I was doing that.  Remember now, this was a pretty volatile time, you know, civil rights [Civil Rights Movement], and different types of things was going on then.  The Anti-War Movement was even going on back as far as then, you know, the Peace Movement, and things of that sort.  And, so, I'd gotten into documentary, you know, doing some documentary work at that time, '66 [1966], you know.  I started documenting some movement things.  Become politically active at that time.  I have met, you know, Baraka, you know, Amiri Baraka and folks like that.  And,--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the ti--yeah, that's the time when Baraka was starting to really--
Speaker 1: Right.  Yes.  Right.
Speaker 2: Build--they were here building a political organization around [Newark, New Jersey mayor] Kenneth Gibson, right?
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, naw, that was a little later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We didn't build that--that was not until around '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Somewhere around there.
Speaker 2: It was close.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That, yeah.  But, there was other kinds of movement, real cultural movements going on, you know, in New York [New York City, New York] and that.  And, so, I really didn't wanna run the newspaper place anymore.
Speaker 2: So, this was like--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Sixty--this is sixty--? (Simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Sixty--I'm talking, really, '68 [1968] when I really, you know, got away from, you know, I didn't wanna run the newspaper business anymore.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Around '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wanted to go to photography school.  So, I talked to him [Henry Gordon] about that and I said, "Look, we'll--I'll find someone else, even if I have to train someone else to run the business for you," okay.  And, there was one guy, he had about eight kids who worked for me in the mornings.  And, a while back he was working, he was a roofer.  His regular job was roofer.  And, he was working on a roof and he fell through, fell through the roof.  And, he had got a settlement from the company of around a hundred thousand dollars or something like that, at that time.  And, so, I was talking to him about what I was planning on doing.  And, I said to him, I said, "Look, you got all these kids," I said, you know, he had eight kids.  I said, "You and your kids can run this business," you know, all right.  I said, "Because, you know your wife have gotten you to doing this and you're buying furniture and all that.  I said, "That money gonna be gone.  You can make a good investment," you know.  I said, "Henry could probably, would probably make a deal with you, you know, to run the business."  So, he talks it over with his wife and his two oldest sons and his oldest daughter.  And, they decided, yeah, they would run it, you know, they would do that.  So, Henry came over, you know, and they made a deal where he would buy the business.  And, so, the deal was that I would stay there for three months, okay, and train them, you know, on all of the work.  And, me and the person, the lady who was my secretary there, and the lady who was the part-time bookkeeper, they would--all of us would stay for three months, at least.
Story_ID: 136205
Speaker 1: --But, what made you wanna get back into photography?  I mean, was there--
Speaker 2: In '64 [1964]?  I just needed to do something because otherwise, I would've been back in them streets.
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968] what made you think--
Speaker 2: '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: It would--It'd be a way to earn a living?  I mean, did you really--
Speaker 2: I wasn't even thinking about it along those lines.  I really wasn't even thinking about it along those lines, all right.  Because, oh, needless-to-say, I, oh, a year after I got married to my ex-girlfriend, we broke up, you know.  So, I was, you know, just being involved in the streets and stuff like that, you know, with the whole political thing.  And, that's what I wanted to do.  So, I was documenting and I figured I would--could do enough freelance, you know, to take care of what I wanted to take care of.
Speaker 1: So, you were shooting the art scene, basically, the--
Speaker 2: Naw, no.  No.
Speaker 1: Black cultural scene, or what?
Speaker 2: Right then, yeah, I was shooting some cultural stuff.  But, I was doing some little freelance stuff, weddings and family portraits and stuff like that, you know.  And, I figured with the hustle ability, hustle ability I had, I could, you know, I could make it, if I wanted to put the energy into doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, anyway, getting back to that, and, so, we agreed to the three months, you know, that I would say there.  After about a month, I was--the guy had gotten to the point, him and his family, where they didn't wanna hear what I was telling them about the business, you know.  They figured, you know, we know this, you know, you know, we all know, you know, and Henry Gordon [ph.] was paying me, you know, anyway.  So, I told Henry about it, you know, and Henry said, "Well, if, you know, if they don't need you, the hell with 'em," you know.  He said, "I'll give you the rest of the money for the other two months and let it go."  I had told this guy about what to do, you know, the papers, every once and a while they had strikes, you know, the paper would have a strike, the truck drivers, whatever, you know.  'Cause there had been a strike like, I guess, five or six months before.  I had hooked up a deal, the New York [New York] papers were on strike.  I had hooked up a deal with the Newark Star Ledger, okay.  That if the strike happened, I had to have some kind of paper to give my customers to read on the, you know, you know, on the train.  I said, "If the strike happens, I'll gonna automatically want this amount of newspapers."  Automatically, from the next morning.  So, I'm telling y'all ahead so you know, you know, what to make your print run and so on and so forth.  So, it did happen, and I did do that.  I had told this guy, you know, who he had worked for me while he was back out doing--when it happened, he was out, you know, with his back thing, you know.  But, anyway, when the next strike came along, he didn't do that.  So, some of the other area delivery services, okay, did that.  Newark Star Ledger was at its capacity, all right.  And, there was another, one other independent newspaper that wasn't part of the truck driver's, you know, their drivers weren't involved in the union.  They couldn't accommodate 'em.  So, need-less-to-say, this guy went out of business, all right.  He blew the business.  And, the guy in the next town took over his towns, you know.  You know, so, by the time, you know, he came to me crying, it was too late, you know.
Story_ID: 136206
Speaker 1: So, anyway, I got involved in--with, like I said, a lot of cultural stuff.  And, going to New York [New York City, New York], getting involved in Harlem and Newark [New Jersey], and all of these types of things.  Got involved later with the, with the Black Panthers and then 1970--1960--'66 [1966], I went up to New Haven [Connecticut] to document a rally.  Met this girl up there.  Her name was Louise.  I met her, and, so, I was going back and forth up there, you know, 'cause I had met some of the people involved with Panthers in New Haven and all of that stuff, you know.  And, had met Bobby Seale and, you know, some other folks up there.  And, so, I would--was going back and seeing Louise when I was going back and forth up there, you know.  So, her and I had developed a relationship.  In 1969, after the Newark riots, I think, yeah, this was after the riots.

Speaker 1: I'm Denise Gines with The HistoryMakers, the interview--interviewer and Scott Stearns is the photographer.  And, this is the second part of your interview, would you restate your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: James "Jim" Alexander, J-A-M-E-S, J-I-M, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R.
Speaker 1: Great.  The last time you were talking, we were talking about 1969 after the Newark [New Jersey] riots.  But, I wanna step back a little bit and talk about what was going on in your life from, say '63 [1963] until that time.  So, tell me what was going on in your life when, and what were you thinking when, say '63 [1963], when [John F.] Kennedy was killed?
Speaker 2: At the time that President Kennedy was killed, that was in 1963, I was still in the streets.  I talked about that quite a bit.  And, in '63 [1963], you know, it was, you know, like most people, you know, we were feeling really sad about it, you know, and things of that sort.  I wasn't too involved out there in the political world.  But, it was, you know, it was pretty g--pretty sad time for the whole country, you know.  And,--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, moving from that time until 1964, which of course, is the time that I stopped drinking.  I got out of the streets in 1964, early '64 [1964]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, in February of '64 [1964].  And, one thing though, even during that period, I was a reader.  I did, I did a lot of reading, you know, whenever I had nothing else to do I would read books.  I was, I was quite a reader.  And, so, it isn't that I didn't know what was going on in the world, 'cause I wasn't so much involved with it, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 136208
Speaker 1: So, now, in '64 [1964], you get involved in photography again.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, by '66 [1966], you're doing documentaries.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I wasn't--yeah, by '66 [1966], I was doing some documentary stuff.  Not a lot of, not a lot of it, I was just feeling my way through doing some reading about photography.  And, but, I was still doing some stuff in my community.  I had moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey at that time.  And, I was doing some stuff for my church, and community things and it was an organization there, a couple of organizations that I did some pictures for.  Anybody who needed some stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, I was just, just shooting very general.  And, then the latter part of '66 [1966] into '67 [1967], then I really began doing more things along a documentary line.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, start there and tell us about, your--you, you got involved in the political movement at that time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: There was a guy that I had known in Paterson [New Jersey] when I was in the streets.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By the name of Richie Sergeant (ph.).  And, Richie Sergeant was involved with a, a Catholic program in Paterson.  They had a program in, up on Graham Avenue in Paterson where they--he was working with a young priest up there and they were working with some young guys.  And, so, I got involved with them.  They were doing a little newspaper, called The New Press.  And, so, I started helping them out, teaching the guys a little bit of photography so they can do their own photography for the newspaper.  And, then I was--another thing I like to do on Saturdays, every Saturday, I would be in New York [New York City, New York].  I would go to New York.  I had a friend that lived on St. Nicholas Avenue that I stayed at from time to time.  But, I would go there, made sure I was there on Saturday mornings for when the guys from the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] was out speaking on the step ladders, out there by the Theresa Hotel [Harlem, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, I would be out there listening to those guys talk.
Speaker 1: What is the UNIA stand for?
Speaker 2: The United Negro Improvement Association.  That was Marcus Garvey's organization.  See, a lot of people thought that the organization went away when Marcus went away.  But, it didn't.  The org--it was still there.  And, so, I used to like to go out there.  And, then I would spend some time wandering around Harlem and, you know, I loved Harlem.  The whole cultural atmosphere of Harlem was, you know, very dear to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, would you take your camera and take pictures?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would take my, take my camera.  I would do some pictures, you know, and things of that sort.  Unfortunately, a lot of the pictures that I took at that pic--at that period, got ruined in a flood.  I had built a base--a darkroom in my basement.  And, and a pipe busted in the wintertime, and I lost all of that stuff from that period.
Story_ID: 136209
Speaker 1: As I stated earlier, around, you know, I was going back and forth to New Haven, Connecticut too, in the, in the late '60s [1960s].  And, so, there was a lot of things cultural and political, more political than cultural, going on in New Haven.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, a lot of political stuff.
Speaker 2: So, tell me about--
Speaker 1: And,--
Speaker 2: Some of 'em.
Speaker 1: Well, it had these organizations over there called the, they were neighborhood associations.  And, then they had founded this organization called The Black Coalition.  And, The Black Coalition was a umbrella organization for all of the community-based organizations in, in New Haven.  And, so, they had, like I said, the several neighborhood associations.  They had an [National] Urban League and the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and a lot of other organizations.  And, and they met and talked about different things that they were, that they were doing.  And, things that need to be done on a community level.  And, so, they were, they were pretty effective, you know, at getting some, some things going.  And, then they started getting blacks elected, you know, as aldermen and things of that sort.  Later on, one, one guy who was involved there, his name was Hank Parker [Henry E. Parker], he became the first [African American] statewide elected official.  He became the state treasurer for Connecticut.  And, Hank was one of the people who was instrumental in the, in the neighborhood, I mean, in the Black Coalition.  Another guy became a statewide elected official, [Connecticut State Representative] Bruce Morris was his name.  And, there was a guy by the name of Jimmy Jones.  A lot of people who were involved on the community level, you know, started moving into the political arena at that time in Connecticut.
Story_ID: 136210
Speaker 1: But, also, I was still, like I said, involved in New Jersey.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, I was involved with Imamu [Amear] Baraka [Amiri Baraka] and them at that time, they had a lot of poli--political things going on in the late '60s [1960s].  They were trying to get a black elected mayor [of Newark, New Jersey].  And, the person that was anointed was Ken Gibson [Kenneth Gibson], you know.  Because, they had a couple of other people that were also interested in running.  But, the other forces that be, said, "Look, y'all gonna go somewhere and sit down.  And, one of you, all right--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Is gonna come out here and run for mayor.  That's it.  One of you."  You know.  Because, at that time the guy, Hugh Addonizio, who was the mayor, he was indicted for all kinds of corruption at that time, you know.  And, and, so, they had a lot of political things going on.  And, then of course, in 1970, Ken Gibson was elected.  During that political season, we brought all kinds of people in, you know.  Stevie Wonder, and [HM] Harry Belafonte, and a whole lot of people would come in to town and have rallies in the streets and things of that sort, to get people, you know, fired up about this election, you know, and it worked.
Story_ID: 136211
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now we're going on to the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: All right, we're going into the '70s [1970s].  Like I said, up until, after--
Speaker 1: After [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] died, got killed.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where were you before we get there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When Dr. King died, like I said, I was very much involved in that political things in Newark [New Jersey].  And, then with the youth group in Paterson and, going back and forth to New Haven [Connecticut], during that period.  And, then I met some guys from, in 1970 in New Haven.  They had a program that came out of the 1969 riots, you know, in New Haven they had some riots too, you know, a few, few fires and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, out of that program, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], you know, which was very much in the middle of the black community.  They were trying to get some programs going that would sort of show that they were trying to do some things in the community also, all right.  They started at Yale.  They had the Black Student Union and they were doing some things.  After the Newark riots, I had went and did some photographs, you know, Model Cities [Federal Model Cities Program] was around at that time.  I had did some photographs in one of the area that was burnt out and they had some people from Model Cities there.  And, when we did a community meeting and I showed a lot of the facades of buildings and stuff where they talked about rebuilding, you know.  And, I showed on slides, you know, like you could leave certain facades and things of that sort there, you know, and still leave a sense of community, you know, afterwards, you know.  And, so, when, when I met these guys in New Haven, I was out doing some photographs one day, and they were talking about this program they had at Yale called The Black Workshop.  And, I said, "Oh, you know, I, I'll come by and, you know, see what y'all were doing, one day.  'Cause one of the guys was out doing some pictures also.  So, when I went by there, there was this guy, an architect by the name of Ed Cherry.  And, he said, he had heard about this thing, 'cause he had been a consultant with Model Cities.  And, he said, he had heard about the workshop that I had did in, in Newark.  And, so, when the guys said, "Well, maybe we can get you here, you know, to teach us, you know, documentary type photograph because that would be good for what we're doing."  And, the program The Black Workshop, came out of a program called BEST, The Black Environmental Studies Team.  And, that was part of the Yale School of Art and Architecture.  So, this guy by the name of Wendell Harp and Richard [K.] Dozier, and a couple of other guys who was involved with the program, got the dean to allow them to hire me on a consultant basis with the program.  Because, you know, they had this things called, you know, where you could work at universities, they call you a lecturer.  You know, you're not really a professor or teacher, they call you a lecturer.  So, they was able to hook that up.  And, so, I decided then that I would move to Connecticut.
Story_ID: 136212
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And, so, Louise and I had talked about it.  So, I decided that I would move from Ridgewood [New Jersey] to Connecticut.  So, I moved in with Louise.  And, then I moved up there on Christmas Eve of 1970.  And, in January, I started working at that program at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]; started teaching documentary photography there.
Speaker 2: Well, at this point, you're, you're gonna teach documentary film but, explain to me where you got that knowledge.  I don't think we talked about that.  How--do you develop this yourself?  Self-taught?
Speaker 1: This--yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 1: Oh, I did, sorry, in 1968, all right, I found out I had all of this GI eligibility that I had never used from the [U.S.] Navy.  So, I said, "Well, I think I'll go to photograph school.  And, so, I went to the New York Institute of Photography [New York City, New York], and I believe I talked about this in the other segment.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That I went to school at New York Institute of Photography.  And, so, that's when I found out that I really did have some skills, all right.  And, but, I went to school, continued going anyway, because I had access to all of this fancy equipment and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, yes, I had talked about that I think--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Early in the other, earlier segment.  So, anyway, as I said, I did a lot of reading on photography through the years, you know, and, so, I was able to bounce stuff off.  In 1969, I as working with a friend of mine who was writer in Ridgewood.  And, she was, she had got Essence [magazine] interested in an article that she was gonna do.  And, so, I went over with her, you know, 'cause she wanted me to do the photographs.  And, so, while she was in talking to the editor, I walked down the hall to talk to [HM] Gordon Parks, who was the creative director there at that time.  And, so, Gordon and I was sitting down and talking and I was telling him about my idea of just documenting black people for ten years.  I just wanted to do a cultural documentation.  So, Gordon said, "Okay.  That's good.  How you gonna feed yourself?"  (Laughter), you know.  I said, "Well, I'll find a way, you know, I can do some freelance stuff and everything like that, you know."  And, so, he was--I was telling him about this exhibit that someone wanted me to do.  And, he was telling me that someone wanted him to do an exhibit too.  But, he had to find a way to get the negatives, you know, because all of this stuff they wanted in the show belonged to Life magazine.  And, so, he explained to me, you know, why it all belonged to them.  And, then I got a book and I read about photography and the law.  And, I then decided I wasn't gonna be this great magazine photographer that I wanted to be, because I wanted to own my own negatives.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so, that's when that happened.  And, so, of course, that, that ten-year documentary has now turned into, you know, almost forty years, you know.
Story_ID: 136213
Speaker 1: So, we're back in--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--You start working 1970 and you're working--
Speaker 1: In '71 [1971], yeah, that's when I started in '71 [1971], in January of '71 [1971] at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, so, I also, like I said, I had been involved, involved with some people there during that period.  And, I'd met some other photographers and some other artist and musicians and everything.  And, so, I, I started a--I got a group of them together, all right.  I've got this--there was a place they called the Q House.  It was a community center.  And, I got a bunch of them together and I talked to them about starting a, an organization because there was a lot of money in Yale.  I mean, in New Haven, because of Yale and all, and the other colleges they had there.  And, they had a lot of art programs going on but none of 'em in the black community.  There was no programs in the black community related to arts and cultural type things.  And, so, I said, "Well, you know, maybe we'll--let's start an organization, you know, and do some of these things."  So, I got a few of 'em to buy into it, you know.  And, I got a couple of friends of mine from Yale who knew how to write proposals.  And, so, a couple of guys got together and, and we wrote a proposal, you know.  I had--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Never written a proposal before, but we wrote a proposal to the New Haven Foundation.  And, the New Haven Foundation liked the idea of what we were doing.  We had to go to a foundation because the things that I was talking about doing was all advocacy type things, you know, political, you know.  And, from an advocacy prospective, you know, because, you were going to have to go at it from that perspective because nothing had happened in all those years, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, so, they, they agreed to give us X amount of dollars a year for two years.  That would pay for space, and would pay me a small salary to, you know, get the organization going and running and things of that sort.  And, we named it FACT, Free--the Freedom Arts Communications Team.  And, so, we had a mentoring program going.  We had a visual arts program.  We had a music component.  We had a writer's component going.  And, we later on wrote a proposal to the Connecticut Commission on the Arts [Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, Office of the Arts] to, because they didn't have art programs in the schools.  We, you know, and the inner-city schools had no art programs going on.  And, so, I wrote a proposal to do a visiting artist program, where we would have artist who would be paid through this program to go in and teach art in the schools.  And, we got some of the community people, some of the more vocal community people from The Black Coalition and places like that also to buy into the program.  So, they had some input into the schools and so and so forth.  So, we were able to do that.  And, at that time, we had artists who were paid now, to do art and teach art in the school systems.  So, we had about, about four schools.  And, we would have different artists going into the different schools with different types of programs.  We had martial arts.  We had photography.  We had painting.  We had writing.  We had a theatre component.  So, that was going pretty good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, we got that program going.
Story_ID: 136214
Speaker 1: And, you're still lecturing at, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: And, I was still doing the program at Yale.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Right.  And, then we also got involved with the, with the Black, the Black Student Union at Yale.  There was a guy there by the name of Khalid Lum, who was the director there.  And, he, he was very culturally--If you remember that picture that they had on the magazines, I think, it was probably Newsweek or Time, when, when the brothers was with the rifles, at Cornell University [armed takeover of Willard Straight Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, 1961]; they were standing out in front of the, the building there with the rifles, at Cornell.  He was one of those guys, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, we were then able to get a good entree into Yale, into--so, we were able to, you know, couple some community things with Yale University.  And, so, the different neighborhood organizations got involved.  And, we--the arts was, you know, normally always a good way to get to the community, you know.  Parents, you know, get to see their kids involved in different things.  And, I started a festival there called the Dixwell Community Festival.
Speaker 1: Dixwell, what?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  D-I-X-W-E-L-L.  That was what--the main street [Dixwell Avenue] through the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, we started a community festival there.  And, the first years, we held in on the plaza in front of the, in front of the Q House.  And, then we later on moved it to this park out by the high school.  And, so, that went on for several years.  And, 1972, I got in--we did the first New England Black Expo.  The Black Coalition was the impetus behind that.  And, so, it--that was held in the armory.  It was pretty big.  And, so, they did it from 1972.  I was involved with it from '72 [1972] until 1976 when I, when I left New Haven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, we, we kept the art programs going, and the community programs, and all of those type things.  And, Louise and I had a son together.  And, we also had, she had a son, you know, when I met her.  She, she was a widow.  She had a young boy when I met her.  And, so, we had him and then we had one of my other boys there.  So, we had the three boys.  And, then in 1976, by that time, I was really quite fed up with New Haven, Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: It's a very unique place.  How should I say, you have a lot of poverty-stricken, conservative black folks there (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, so, you know, and most of the time when you're doing things, you're beating your head against the wall, okay.  That was, that was my problem with New Haven, Connecticut, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it took me a few years to realize that, you know.  But, you keep trying to, to do things.  And, and we were able to do a lot of things, you know.  I, I also had a mentoring program going with some of the, the students at Yale.  And, got them involved in mass communications things.
Story_ID: 136215
Speaker 1: And then as well as some other folks--I left out one little part.  I later got involved with an organization called, another BEST organization, but it was called Black Efforts for Soul in Television.  A guy by the name of Bill Wright out of Washington, D.C. ran that program.  And, we got involved with a lot of media things, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Suing television and radio stations for, for their license and things of that sort.  And, in 1973, we founded The National Black Media Coalition.  And, then as a component of that in New Haven [Connecticut], we had the Connecticut Minority Communications Panel.  Which was connected with New Haven and Hartford [Connecticut] and one of the television stations there.  And, we were able to produce some shows, you know, and things of that sort.
Speaker 2: What kind of shows did you produce?
Speaker 1: We produced the types of shows that the television stations normally wouldn't produce.  We produced shows on things that were happening in the black community, you know, a lot of things, cultural and political.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, so, we, through the, through the National Black Media Coalition, we were able to do some things in several cities around the country through that organization.
Story_ID: 136216
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like you were doing so many good things--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Can you give me some specifics of why you were fed up with, what types of things were making you not wanna be a part of this any longer?
Speaker 2: I just--well, the things with The National Black Media Coalition was national.  So, we were doing that on a national level.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know, there was aspects of it in New Haven [Connecticut].  But, as I said, the--you had too many people in New Haven who didn't like to see folks rock the boat, if you will.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, so, these were a lot of the people whose children and they themselves benefited by it.  But, because there was really, in New Haven, there was really no industry, you know.  Because, Winchester [Repeating Arms Company] that was there in the earlier years was--a lot of people were losing their jobs there, you know.  And, really, you know, that was, we considered Winchester negative anyway.  They were making napalm and stuff like that, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) okay.  That was being used in Vietnam and all of that.  So--
Story_ID: 136217
Speaker 1: Yes.  And, you know, and like Winchester [Repeating Arms Company, New Haven, Connecticut] was, you know, as I said, you know, wasn't really a positive, you know.  But, you know, there was jobs and so people were working on it, and so on so forth, you know.  But, most of the people, a lot of people there say, you know, either worked for Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], or they worked for the city [New Haven, Connecticut], or they worked for, you know, menial jobs, a lot of 'em, you know.  There was really, like I said, no, no great industry, you know, there.  And, and we had, I had just really got sorta fed up with thinking I'm doing something of a positive nature.  And, every time I turned around, you know, I've got somebody asking me, "Do we really need to do this?" Or, "Do you really need to do that?"  Or, you're doing this or you're doing that.  But, anyway, I turned the organization over to a friend of mine who, young lady who said she wanted to, you know, continue running the organization.  I had gotten involved in a lot of other things then.  I met--
Speaker 2: We're talking about the FACT [Freedom Arts Communications Team] organization?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the FACT organization.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So, yeah, another young lady started running FACT, along with a friend of mine who I'd, you know, got into being the chairman of the board, Walter Benjamin.  So, he, you know, he was overseeing it anyway.
Story_ID: 136218
Speaker 1: I, like I said, I went back and forth to New York [City, New York] quite a bit and I met a--there was a young lady that I knew there who worked for CORE Magazine [Congress on Racial Equality].  And, they wanted me to do some photography.  So, I did some photography for CORE Magazine, Roy Innis' organization.  And, I went and, this was in '75 [1975], I went and did some pictures for them.  And, when I brought the work back, you know, they, they liked it.  And, asked me how would I like to work for a while with them, you know, to be the photo editor for the magazine?  So, I said, "Sure," you know.  I--that sounds pretty good."  So, I started doing that, you know, being the photo editor and shooting some things for them.  And, I got to travel around a little bit.  And, but, I found out later on that there was stuff going on in the organization, you know, that I wasn't, I wasn't really, really liking.
Speaker 2: You're talking about at the magazine?
Speaker 1: At CORE.
Speaker 2: At CORE.
Speaker 1: At CORE, period.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, you know.  They were--at that time, they had the Angolan War [Angolan Civil War, 1975 - 2002] going on, and Roy Innis got involved in recruiting people to fight in that war.  But, they said, that they were recruiting medics, you know.  But, I know, I was, I saw some of the people who were coming through there, you know, who seemed more like mercenaries to me than medics, you know.  And, then there was just a lot of negative stuff happening there, you know.  And, so, I had to sorta get away from that.  But, while I was there, I was--I went to Washington, D.C., to photograph a black political conclave of black elected officials.  And, I was sitting in a room in between one of the sessions.  And, [Atlanta, Georgia mayor] Maynard Jackson was there, [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, one of the guys that I knew from New Haven, Connecticut, Jimmy Jones.  He was the elected official from New Haven.  Johnny Ford, all right, the mayor of Tuskegee [Alabama].  And, so, we were just talking and while they were talking, I was taking some pictures.  So, Maynard Jackson said, he said, "You really look like you know what you're doing with that camera," you know, he said, "What are you, what do you do?  Who do you work for?"  I said, "Well, right now, I'm, I do freelance and I'm also working with a magazine."  I didn't even wanna mention CORE, you know, I just (laughter).  And, so, and I told him, I said, "You know, for years, I'd been running a black arts organization," you know.  He said, you know, "We're just starting one in, in Atlanta [Georgia].  We need some people with some skills and stuff down there in Atlanta."  You know, Maynard always recruited where ever he went, you know.  If he sees somebody who know how to do something, you know, he want 'em in Atlanta, you know.  So, anyway, I said, "Okay."  So, I was there for a couple of days at that conference.  Went back home and I was telling my wife about it, you know.  And, so, later on in '76 [1976], I had been talking to my wife about going somewhere, you know, had an offer, you know, to come to California.  And, somebody else wanted me to come work with they're media organization in Washington, D.C.  But, I was so heavy in, at that time, into my documentary stuff, I didn't wanna, you know, a job-job, if you know what I mean (laughter). You know.  And, so, I said to my wife, I said, "Let's," and she said, "Go."

Speaker 1: So, we decided to come and take a look at Atlanta [Georgia].  So, we, we got her mother, you know, to watch the kids for us.  And, this was in November of 1976.  We decided to drive down.  So, we drove down here.  We drove down and we stayed at a hotel out on 85 that night, that first night we got here.  And, we got up the next morning, you know, and rode downtown to sorta look around and look at things and see what was happening.  We were at a Days Inn out there and we were just tired, you know.  And, they said, "There's another Days Inn downtown," you know, that we could stay, you know, the next day.  So, we did.  And, we, we went to the Days Inn down at, right at 75 and Cleveland Avenue.  We went to the Days Inn there the next day, and checked in and then we started riding around looking at some apartments and things of that sort.  And, saw a couple of nice places in the area.  So, when we were coming back to the motel, we noticed there was a apartment complex right across the highway there.  So, we went over there and went in.  And, we talked to the lady who was the manager and she said, "Well," you know, she said, "From time to time, we have openings but, we don't have any right now."  So, we came out of the building and we were walking toward my car, somebody yelled, "Gimbles!" (ph.).  And, I didn't even wanna turn around.  I say, "Oh, Lord."  That was my nickname from my street life.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I said, that's gotta be somebody from Paterson, New Jersey, you know, all right.  And, so, anyway, I turned around and I saw this young lady.  She came running up and hugged me, you know.  And, who--it was a young lady who was a dispatcher in a, in a taxi stand across the street from where I used to run the poolroom.  And, like a lot of nights I, you know, I was a night owl.  I'd go in there and sit down and we'd talk, you know, on a, you know, late--'til, 'til breakfast time.  And, I'd go in the restaurant and eat breakfast and then I'd go, go to bed, six o'clock, you know.  So, anyway, it was her.  So, she said, "What are doing here?  How long you've been living in Atlanta?"  I said, "I don't live in Atlanta."  I say, "I was living in New Haven [Connecticut]," you know, "For years."  And, I said, "How long you've been down here?"  She told me she'd been down there several years.  So, we got to talking.  I introduced my wife [Louise] to her and everything.  And, so, she said, "You know somebody over here?"  And, I told her, "Naw, we're just looking at, you know, looking at some apartments."  And, she said, "Oh, you're looking, you're looking here?"  I said, "Well, the lady said she don't have any."  She said, "Now we do."  So, she took me back into the office, me and my wife, and she said, there was one of the people that we signed up, she said, "I don't think they gonna, they gonna, you know, work out here, you know.  She says, "So, we can, we can give my cousin, you know, that space."  She said, "Oh, this is your cousin?"  She said, "Oh, you should've--they should have told me," you know.  But, anyway, I didn't, you know, I didn't say any more about it.  So, we went there and then she went and she showed me that model apartment that somebody had already, you know, was gonna get.  And, then she showed me this other apartment that they were gonna do some work in, that she would let us have.  So, my wife liked it.  So, she says, "It should be ready, you know, in a month or so."  And, I said, "Well, that's good.  That would be a good, you know, good time for us, you know."  So, what we, we were intending on staying here for five days.  And, so, we were only here for one day.  So, we started just riding around since we, you know, had found a place to stay.  And, so, we just spent some time looking at Atlanta, riding around.
Story_ID: 136220
Speaker 1: Did you talk to, talk to [Atlanta, Georgia mayor] Maynard Jackson again?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Not, right then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What happened was, we, we decided then, we say, well, you know, we got, you know, we stayed an extra day, another day in Atlanta and said, "We're gonna, let's go through Camden," you know, Camden, South Carolina.  Because we both had relatives there.  We went through Camden, visit our relatives, left there and went to--we decided to just hopscotch back to Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to Baltimore [Maryland], stopped by and visit one of my brothers.  Went to Washington, D.C. and visit another brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now when you get--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And, worked our way back to New Haven [Connecticut].  The next day, when we got back to New Haven, the next day, the lady--I'm trying to think of her name right now--Janelcy (ph.).  The next day, she called me.  And, she said, you know, she said, "We just," she said, "Yesterday, we checked out these people who were going to get the model apartment, and they had put some stuff on their application, you know, that doesn't add up.  So, we're not gonna give it to 'em."  She said, "So, y'all can move back down, y'all can move down here tomorrow, if you want it."  She said, "We're gonna give you that one, that apartment."  Because, it was beautiful, you know, my wife had liked it but, it was the model, you know.  So, she said, you know, "Y'all can move in here any time you wanna."  So, my wife said, "Well, let's, let's stay till after next week, week after next, and it's--for Thanksgiving, you know, and then we'll go on down."  So, okay.  So, I called her back and told her we would be down Thanksgiving weekend.  And, so, we started getting our stuff together.  And, we got a U-Haul truck and we got Louise's cousin, her first cousin, who would go down with us, and that way we can take our car, you know.  We had two cars, but two old cars and (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And, one of 'em we had bought like three years before for fifty dollars, and it was one of those little Falcons.  It was a '63 [1963] Ford Falcon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wish I had it today.  But, anyway, we were able to sell that for fifty dollars to somebody else.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you get to Atlanta, this is in December then?
Speaker 2: This is November [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, well, after Thanksgiving--
Speaker 2: We left, we left New Haven the day before Thanksgiving, the Wednesday.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And, then we went to Ridgewood, New Jersey to spend the night.  And, had all of my family from all of my sisters and brothers, we were all at one of my sister's houses for Thanksgiving there.
Story_ID: 136221
Speaker 1: So, tell me what happens when you get to Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And, then we got to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We got to Atlanta.  We moved in.  That Monday, I went over to, I went over to City Hall, and I did get to see Maynard [Jackson].  'Cause I went up in the building, I was just gonna try to find out where this arts building was.  But, when I was standing in there talking to someone, Maynard walked by.  And, I said, "Excuse me Mayor."  And, he came over and I said, "You know, I'm the photographer that you met at the (unclear)."  He said, "Yes, I remember."  He said, "You were taking pictures."  "Yeah."  So, we started talking.  And, then he told me where this art center was, all right.  So, I went on over to, it was the Neighborhood Arts Center over on Georgia Avenue.  I went on over there to the Neighborhood Arts Center.  Going down the stairs, I mean, going--when I got out of the car, coming down the stairs from the building was a guy that I had met once before when I had been visiting Atlanta in 1974, by the name of Ebon Dooley, who just passed two months ago here in Atlanta.  He just passed.  But, we started talking and then he brought me back in the build, brought me in the building and he introduced me to the director and the associate director.  The director guy, who was the director at that time, the executive director, he has since passed, John Riddle.  But, John Eaton who was the associate director is still here and we're still friends today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, anyway, they introduced me around and I looked over the place and it was really nice.  And, that Monday, I mean, that--two days later, I called a friend that I had known here, in Atlanta, before and talked, you know, you know, where can you make some money here?  You know.  This was another photographer.  And, he says, you know, he said, "They got CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] jobs here if you can find somebody who, who needs, you know, somebody to do what you do, you know, then you can sign up for CETA."  And, he said, "Maynard Jackson runs the program, you know.  It's run by the city."  So, he says, "I'm going--on my way to see some friends, come on with me."  So, he took me over on Marietta Street, 40 Marietta Street, up there and we went and visit some place, and he introduced me to people.  And, there was guy there by the name of Ralph Paige.  And, this was the Federation of Southern Cooperatives.  And, he told Ralph, you know, what I did, you know.  And, Ralph said, "Well, we could use somebody."  He said, "Do you work free."  I said, "No, I don't work free."  I said, "I can't work free."  I said, "I got mouths to feed," you know, and we got laughing and talking about that.  And, so, one of the ladies was there and said, "Ralph, we got a CETA slot," you know.  And, "See if you can get him in that CETA slot."  So, the guy told me where to go.  C.T., C.T. Viv--not C.T. Vivian, C.T. Martin was the person who is now city councilman who was running that aspect of the program.  And, so, I went to, and went and met him, C.T. Martin.  And, told him, you know, my story, you know, and everything that Maynard had told me about the Neighborhood Arts Center, you know.  And, he said, "Well, the Neighborhood Arts Center is one of our contractors."  He say, "But, they don't have any, you know, they, you know, they would have to hire you there.  He said, "But, we do have a slot for this other place.  You go down and go back there and tell them to give you a job, you know, category, you know, a job descriptions."  So, I went back downtown and we sat down and we made me the director of audio visual communications for the organization.  Typed it up.  Went back up there.  And, gave it to 'em and that, that next week I started work there.  And, I worked there until--I went around the South, you know, documenting cooperative programs, all right, through that organization.  Farm co-ops, you know, like the Freedom Quilting Bee [Rehoboth, Alabama] and all of those things.  So, it was, it was really interesting.  They had daycare centers and things and then I did whatever was needed, you know.  Whatever I could do to help out.  And, so, I was also volunteering at the Neighborhood Arts Center at that time, all right.  I was volunteering there.  And, then in October of '77 [1977], they, I left the Federation and went to the Neighborhood Arts Center.  Because the Federation really, at that time, had run out of money for me to even do anything, you know.  They was trying to raise money to just keep the doors open, you know.  And, so, the little bit of money that they were giving me to do stuff, I said, "You know, look, I'll just volunteer and do whatever you need," because the Neighborhood Arts Center said that they have a slot for me.  So, I went over there, then I, then I, I just switched.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was working at the Neighborhood Arts Center and volunteering at the Federation.
Story_ID: 136222
Speaker 1: I then became photographer-in-residence at the Neighborhood Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia], and I documented that program from, well, I started, like I said, in 1976 up until, it closed in the '80s [1980s].  About, I think, yeah, it closed at the end of the '80s [1980s].  But, I was, I was there on staff for about, I guess, three or four years.  And, in the meantime, I was still documenting, pol--political stuff and cultural things.  And, going to New Orleans [Louisiana] and documenting that whole cultural scene there and things of that sort.  And, still involved with the National Black Media Coalition at that time.  We were instrumental in the whole thing around Turner Broadcasting WTBS [now WPCH-TV], you know, where they had sued for the license there.  And, we were able to negotiate a good settlement there.  And, got some people on the board of directors, and some people in different jobs, you know, at WTBS.  And, came out--it turned out with Ted Turner really being an advocate for, you know, minority participation, you know, from being the v--the, the villain, you know, to an advocate, you know.  So, that worked really good.
Story_ID: 136223
Speaker 1: I'm looking at a lot of the photographs of jazz greats.  Tell me about that time of, of taking those photographs.
Speaker 2: That time is still going on (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: I've always been into black music.  Always, loved black music, you know, from the time I was young.  And, I don't know how that came about, you know.  Because in the little town that I grew up in [Waldwick, New Jersey], you know, there was no such thing as any kind of black music, you know.  It was only three black families in the whole town.  But, anyway, I think on Sundays, you know, we used to, you know, I used to get to listen to the Quartets, you know.  My mom and dad would have that on in the mornings, Sunday mornings when I was a little kid.  And, then on Sundays, we would go to Ridgewood [New Jersey] to church.  And, then they had a little restaurant there, my mom--my dad went to the Methodist church and two blocks away was a Baptist where my mom went.  And, then right in the middle, on the other side of the street, there was a restaurant.  And, so, if we only went to Sunday school, then we would go and hangout in the restaurant until my mom and them got outta church.  And, then we would could--they had a jukebox in there.  So, we could listen to Duke Ellington and Sonny Til and the Orioles, and all of those Doo, the early Doo-wop people, you know, and music like that back then.  And, so, I always was in love with music.  And, then in Paterson [New Jersey], when I was living there, you know, they had a little trio in every, you know, every bar, you know, there.  And, so, naturally, once I started documenting music, you know, was one of my favorite subjects.  And, I really liked, more so than documenting in clubs, I liked documenting at festivals and things of that sort, you know, where they had a lot of people and things of that sort.  So, I've been doing that for all of these years up 'til now.  And, I'm now a member of the African American Jazz Caucus.  I'm the official photographer for that organization.  And, that is a part of the International Association for Jazz Education.  It's I-A-J-E.  And, the African American Jazz Caucus is an affiliate organization of that.  And, Larry Ridley is one of the co-founders.  He is a great bassist, you know, and a very, very much of an advocate.  He is a professor emeritus at Rutgers University [New Brunswick, New Jersey].  So, he was involved there and with the jazz archives there.  And, we are working now, to establish a institute for jazz education and research at North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina].  And, that will be the first one at a Historically Black College or University [HBCU].  And, so, we're working with North Carolina Central now on that project.  And, so, we have a--there's a convention every year at IAJE has a convention and they used to move it around to different cities.  Now, they normally just go between Long Beach, California and New York [New York City, New York].  And, they normally have between 7,000 and 8,000 registered people.  So, they have two hotels, the Sheraton and the Hilton.  And, so, I'll be up there.  And, I'll be exhibiting there some of the musicians--jazz pictures from, you know, previous years.
Story_ID: 136224
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the people who you have photographed.  Some of the, well, let's start, let's start with, with some of the jazz.
Speaker 2: Some of the jazz people?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I've photographed, Duke Ellington, Eubie Blake, Count Basie--
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories around when you were actually doing the photographs?  I mean, can you tell us, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.  One story is when they established the Duke Ellington Fellowship at Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  And, they had it at a place called Wolsey Hall.  And, it was like for two or three days.  And, they had Duke Ellington, and oh about I'd say forty to fifty other of the old jazz musicians, people involved, you know, through the years.  And, all of them were being, brought into the Duke Ellington Fellowship; Dizzy Gillespie, Eubie, all of these people from that period.  They had lecture demonstrations.  They had concerts, et cetera.  And, on one, I remember on one occasion, they had a conference, they have a concert going on and somebody called in a bomb scare, all right.  And, so, they had to evacuate the whole hall in the middle of a concert and everybody had to get out of the building while they, they search the building, you know, for, you know--and this is on the Yale campus, you know.  And, that was really, really a negative thing.  But, it went on for the other, the rest of the period.  And, I got to photograph a lot of the old jazz musicians that I had only just heard about at that, at, you know, during that three- or four-day period.  And, another incident was here in 1981, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis [Jr.] came to town.
Story_ID: 136225
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we were talking about you photographing the jazz greats.  And, just that (unclear), you were getting ready to go onto Frank Sinatra and Sammy [Davis, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back to Duke Ellington and the first time that you photographed him.  And, just tell me about that a little bit.  We--I think you were at a concert.  We--is this the same time when they had to evacuate the building?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was, that was the Duke Ellington [Fellowship Convocation, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] thing.
Speaker 1: Thing, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was the first time I got to Duke--
Speaker 1: What about Eubie Blake?
Speaker 2: And, Eubie Blake, he--him and Noble Sissle, was at the Duke Ellington Convocation also in 1972.  And, I photographed Eubie Blake at that time with Nobel Sissle.  And, it was a very interesting thing in that photograph, that's sitting right there alongside of you.  You'll see Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, and a lot of other jazz musicians.  What happened that day was, they were having a reception upstairs in Wolsey Hall.  And, somebody walked up to Duke, they, you know, a lot people who were funding the project and the president of the college [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and all of these people were up there.  And, somebody came up to Duke and told Duke that the, the van had just pulled up with Eubie Blake, at that time.  And, Duke Ellington walked over and told all of these big shots that, "Y'all excuse me a minute."  And, he walked downstairs, had Willie Ruff and one of the other guys there, take him downstairs to meet Eubie at the door, all right.  That's how much high a regard and respect he had for Eubie Blake.  He went down himself.  And, so, naturally since I heard what was going on, I went too, you know.  And, so, I went down there and I captured this photograph of Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie, along with all these other, Milt Hinton, and a lot of other great jazz musicians going to meet Eubie Blake at the door coming in for--at Wolsey Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that was a great moment, and I had the foresight not to try to fight my way down there.  But, stay up a couple of stairs so that I had a good shot of them, you know, a little bit below me.
Story_ID: 136226
Speaker 1: Well, since you're talking about how you positioned yourself to take that shot, let's talk a little bit about your process of taking photographs.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me, do you, do you know when you have a great shot?  Or--talk a little bit to that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If I don't feel like I have a great shot, I guess, I'm like the cowboys, you know.  You know, if you ain't gonna hit your target, don't shoot, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I, I always had this thing about shooting people since I was shooting our people for, for, for I guess, historical purposes.  I never want to shoot or show a photograph that the person who is in the picture wouldn't look at that picture and say, wow, I like that. All right?  I never shot negative stuff.  I never shot crime and all of that stuff.  The paparazzi, and the, you know, newspapers and all that, they gonna get that, you know.  I wanna shoot the people who are contributing, as well as, everyday people who are just here, just living their lives.  And, that's what I put my time and energy into.  I shoot events.  I shoot things that we do, all right.  I guess, I just go and shoot, invited or uninvited, you know.  I just go and shoot things like that.  And, I want to capture--I don't try to pick and decide who is great enough to be in my photograph, you know.  That doesn't matter.  I shoot children, you know.  And, I do that, and, and I concentrate on trying to get a good shot, all right. That's pleasing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  That's, that's, that's important to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, that a lot of times is much more important to me than all the technical aspects of the shot, you know.  I got that from Gordon too, one time.  One time I called him, and I was interested in changing--I was shooting Pentax cameras in the early years and I wanted to change to--I was thinking about changing to Ni- to Nikon.  And so I called [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks and I said to Gordon, you know, I asked him his opinion.  And, Gordon said, "Jim [HistoryMaker Jim Alexander]," he says, "what I know technically about cameras and stuff like that, you could put in a thimble," you know.  He says, "That's, that hasn't always been the part that, that excited me," you know, "about whether I have the most up-to-date equipment or this lens or that lens."  He says, "I've always been more interested in getting a piece of equipment that I learn about and know how to use in order to capture what I wanna capture."  And, then, you know, the rest of that is, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, he says, "I'm more interested in photography than I am any equipment."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  And so I always sort of kept that in mind, too.  And, I've been that way, you know, and of--through the years, I mean, you know, some rough periods doing what I do, you know, being a documenter, I've had pawnshop cameras, you know.  I've had (laughter), you know, you name it, I've--you know, my equipment has never been the best.  But, I've tried to be good at using whatever equipment I have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and, and you were saying like, how did I know whether or not I was gonna have a good picture, you know.  I sometimes not even know whether the camera had a leak in the back or something, you know, where light might have been getting in.  But, I tried to get the best angle I could possibly get.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 136227
Speaker 1: Okay, so, back to the jazz greats.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We were--
Speaker 1: You were getting ready--
Speaker 2: Looking at incidents?
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In 19--, by, in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], they had in Atlanta [Georgia] here what was the Missing and Murdered Children.  It was a case where somebody or somebodies were killing children, young men, and, although the history doesn't say it, some of the guys were not children, you know, they was older guys, they--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, they just lumped everything all into one pot.  But, there was a lot of mysterious murders going on at that time.  And, they were bringing in, trying to bring in experts, you know, FBI people, and private investigators and all of this thing.  And, so, it was really, really taxing, the city coffers.  So, Maynard [Jackson] thought of this idea of, how can we raise money, you know, to do some of this stuff.  And, so, they brought in people to do concerts and things of this sort.  The Jacksons [Jackson Five] came at one time and did a concert, you know, to raise money.  You know, to, you know, for that whole process.  And, they got Sammy Davis [Jr.] and Frank Sinatra to come to town.  And, they had a press conference with Sammy and I was able to sit down and talk to him and some of his, some of the people in, you know, his entourage and things.  And, that was a very interesting time.  And, then when they had the concert with Sammy and Frank Sinatra, one of the things they were really strict about was the whole idea of no one bringing cameras.  There was a company here called Cable Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Atlanta.
Speaker 2: It was part of Cable America.  And, they were videotaping it, you know.  So, I said, "Now, no way am I not going to be able to shoot Sammy Davis in concert."  So, I put on this coat.  I had to put on a trench coat and I had my camera behind my back with the coat over it.  And, I got into, you know, went into the place, went into the [Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta] Civic Center.  I got all the way down in the front and I said, "Now, what I'm gonna do is--Sammy was dressed in black and he's black--
Speaker 1: Laughter.
Speaker 2: And they had these big dark curtains behind him, and they had low lights, you know, on him.  I say, "Well, I'mma get one picture.  And, I know they gonna throw me out.  But, I'm gonna have that picture."  So, I get--I said, "I gotta use flash."  So, I was far enough away where the flash wouldn't affect him, you know.  But, I would've able--been able to, you know, get a decent photograph.  So, I got all ready.  Now, Sammy, as most people know, had one glass eye, and it didn't move.  So, I had to wait to catch an angle when both of his eyes--'cause I was off on the side, off to the side, I said, "I had to catch it at a point where both of his eyes was in the same direction."  So, I waited and then one time when he moved the microphone over and he was looking straight ahead, I shoot him.  And, the flash went off, you know.  (Cough) excuse me.  And, I looked and I saw these police and ushers and everything coming down the aisle with their flashlights, you know, (unclear).  So, when the one guy got to me, a police officer, he got to me and this voice form behind me said, I'm getting ready all--getting ready to get thrown out, you know, and this voice behind me said, "He's alright officer, he's with us."  And, the officer said, "All right," he said, "But, watch that flash."  And, I turned around and it was this guy name John.  He was videotaping and there was two guys back there, they were videotaping from that angle over there.  John was one of the videographers for the cable company.  And, they were once doing a public service announcement that they was shooting for, for the Missing and Murdered Children Program.  And, I shot this picture of them, you know, putting together the ad that was gonna go on, on the cable.  And, it was a really, really, nice picture of him and a police woman, you know, doing some caricature type things and, and I gave him a copy of the picture, you know.  And, so, he remembered that, so he told the police that I was with the cable company.  And, so, I was able to sit there and shoot more pictures.  And, I got some more pictures of Frank and Sammy, you know.  So, that was, being in the right picture, choosing the right place to (laughter) to do my evil, if you will, you know.  (Laughter) breaking all the rules, you know, using flash, shooting where I wasn't supposed to be and everything.  But, that was how I was.
Story_ID: 136228
Speaker 1: Even through the years, people got to know me because I would be at events and things of that sort.  I could shoot the [Black] Panthers.  I was able to shoot the Muslims [Nation of Islam], you know, and lot of times, that was a no-no.  But, you know, they knew me.  And, you know, that I wasn't, you know, doing negative stuff with the photographs.  I remember one time, I had someone call me from The New York Times, who knew that I had shot certain pictures.  And, this was a rally of the Black Panthers.  And, the guy from the Times, you know, somebody had said, you know, had got anoth--in touch with another photographer and said--asked if he had picture of that event.  And, he said, "Naw."  He said, "But, I know this guy who does."  And, he gave 'em my phone number.  So, I told the guy, he said, "Well, we'd like to, you know, purchase use of a photograph from you."  I said, "No problem.  Send me the article."  And, the guy said, "Well, we can't (laughter), we can't send you the article," you know.  And, I said, "Well, I gotta read the article first, so I'm not gonna let you use my photograph," you know.  And, the guy said, "Well, are you, you know, are you serious?"  I said, "Yes, I'm serious."  He said, "This is The New York Times."  I said, "I don't care who you are."  I says, you know, "The last time I really let somebody use a picture of mine, you know, what they said in the caption and the article, was not what really was happening and, so, I don't trust y'all no more," all right.  So, needless-to-say, you know, I didn't get many calls for use of my photographs.  But, that's how I was because people trusted me and let me come and shoot, you know, them doing whatever they were doing, you know.  And, I wasn't going to have my name on no picture they were--where they were doing what they were doing back in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Seventies [1970s], okay.
Speaker 1: Back at--during that period.
Story_ID: 136229
Speaker 1: So, there're also a number of, of people who you have photographed.  Who are you most impressed by that you took a portrait of or a picture of?
Speaker 2: One of the people I think that I really, really, loved is--was John Henrik Clarke.  And, that's him right behind you there, right over your shoulder there.  John Henrik Clarke is an historian.  And, his, his role, like Doc Ben [HistoryMaker Yosef Ben-Jochannan], you know, was to tell our story from back eons ago.  And, so, he put in the hard work, all right, of study and all of that, you know.  He, he eventually read himself blind, you know, trying to tell our story.  So, he was a very, very important person to me.  And, [HM] Oscar Brown, Jr. was another very, very, important person.  He was, of course, a jazz lover, you know.  And, but, Oscar would take and put words to a lot of jazz musician songs, you know.  And, he was a very, very important person to our music.  He wrote plays, and things around black music.  And, Imamu [Amear] Baraka [Amiri Baraka], another very, very important person who has remade himself over two or three times, you know, in his own image (laughter), you know, you know, through the years, you know.  And, but, all the time, writing and keeping up with the history, you know.  Leaving things, one of the most seminal books ever written on music, very important today, called 'Blues People,' you know, by Baraka.  So, he was a very important person.  Dizzy Gillespie; he was teacher, you know.  A lot people talking about him being a musician.  Dizzy was a teacher.  He loved Clark, Clark College [now Clark-Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], you know.  And, I was photographer-in-residence at Clark for five years.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: I was a photographer-in-residence at Clark from 1985 to 1990.
Story_ID: 136230
Speaker 1: And, Dizzy Gillespie, who I first met in 1972.  And, every time I was able to see him, like--he came in '72 [1972] and then again--he--I met him in '72 [1972] and then in '75 [1975], when he came back to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], I gave him a photograph of himself.  And, then after I moved here, through the years when Dizzy came here, I would shoot him, shoot pictures of him.  And, the next time he'd see me, he say, "All right chump, give it up," you know.  That meant that he wanted the picture from the last time I shot him.  And, I would always have a picture of him.  And, and matter of fact, one of--one time when he came here at Clark in the, in the late '80s [1980s], he was playing with the Clark, Clark College, well at that time, it had become the Clark Atlanta Jazz Orchestra.  And, he--they were gonna present him on stage with a photograph of himself that I had taken.  And, so, Charles Stevens who was vice president for development at Clark, at that time, who was jazz lover himself, not was, is, Charles said, "All right, Jim, you know, you can present him with this."  I said, "Naw, I'm not presenting him with the picture."  I said, "You have to present him with the picture."  I said, "I wanted to take a picture of you presenting it to him."  (Laughter) So, I said, "Naw, I'm not being on the stage.  I'm gonna be down below the stage."  So, I got a photograph of them presenting one of my photographs to Dizzy.  And, Dizzy also, a lot of people don't know, was, you know, was very, very much interested in photography.  Where ever he went, he took a camera.  Like Milt Hinton, you know, they were both jazz musicians but, they were photographers also.  And, there was, during, in 1987 when they had the International Association of Jazz Educators Convention here in Atlanta, Dizzy was on stage and he was playing with James Moody, and Jimmy Owens, and Jon Faddis, and I forget who the drummer was, that was playing with them, and Larry Ridley.  Larry was on Base.  And, they were out there playing.  Dizzy walked over to the piano and sat his horn down.  And, went in his bag and got out one of these SX70 Polaroid Cameras.  And, came back over there and start taking pictures of the other musicians.  James Moody was up playing at the microphone at the time.  And, Dizzy was taking pictures of James Moody.  Once he got is photography, he went back over by the piano, got the picture out, you know, the picture would eject out of the SX70.  He laid the picture on the piano, then went and got another picture of another one of the musicians.  Came back and laid that one down, and then he put the camera on the side, picked up his horn and went back out there and started playing.  And, so, I got photographs of Dizzy doing all of this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, Dizzy, was, you know, that's how he got his name, Dizzy.  You know, all of the different antics that he would do, you know.  But, he was a wonderful person.  He loved youth, and I was fortunate to get photographs of him working and teaching the musicians.  One of my favorite photographs of him with a young trumpet player at Clark, and I call that photograph, 'Each One Teach One.' And, I had that photograph in a, in an exhibit.  And, this gentlemen saw the picture in the exhibit and he came to my studio one day.  And, he said, "I'd like to see that photograph of you, I mean, that you took of Dizzy Gillespie and this young man with the music sheet in front of them."  So, I had a copy of it.  I brought the picture out and got--and showed him the copy.  And, he said, "How much is, how much is it for an eleven-by-fourteen, framed sixteen-by-twenty of that photograph?"  And, I gave him a decent price.  And, he said to me, he says, "All right."  He says, "I want five of those."  He says, "That's my nephew."  He says, "And, I'm giving the whole family copies of this picture for a Christmas present.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So, he bought five copies of that photograph.  Yeah.  And, so, there's, you know, a lot of, a lot of stories, you know, around documenting these different people.
Story_ID: 136231
Speaker 1: In 1980, this lady at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia], who was doing a program over there with--on black literature.  And, so, she had a conference, a black writers conference in 1980 at Emory.  And, if you remember, I had said that Ted Turner had turned from a villain to an advocate, you know, of minority concerns.  I got Ted Turner to, to donate a crew, a video crew.  I had a contract to get myself and three or four other photographers to document this whole black writers conference.  And, so, he donated a television crew, you know, to just--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  To document it.  And, that photograph behind your head over there with Andy Young [HM Andrew Young], and Jean Young, and all of those folks there with Sterling [Allen] Brown, who was one of our greatest writers, our greatest poets ever.  And, so, they were able to for prosperity, they were able to document that whole conference.  And, I got to meet a lot of the different writers there and photograph them.  And, I have photographs of [HM] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan from 1966 to the present.  So, I photographed him through all of these years.
Speaker 2: You were talking about writers--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: There's a very famous picture of writers in their younger days.  One of my favorite pictures, you wanna talk about that one?
Speaker 1: Oh, that, oh, the lady, the Black Women Writers?  Oh, yeah, that wasn't there to, they weren't too young.  That's only been about less than twenty years ago.  It was in 1988.  That was when Johnnetta [B.] Cole, her inauguration at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Spelman.
Speaker 1: And, they had a lot of writers and a lot of other artists.  A lot of people came and did tributes and things of that sort.  And, what happened was, after these writers did a tribute to them, myself, and Sue Ross, who was another photographer, we were able to get them outside for a group photograph.  And, so, they were all standing there waiting to get their picture taken, and I got, I got Johnetta to get in the photograph.  Because at that time, remember, she had written this book too.  And, got her to get in, in the photograph with them.  And, they were all just standing there, looking very blase and I got my camera all set.  And, I said to 'em, I said, "Y'all look like you're waiting to get hung."  And, they all bust out laughing, and that's when I shot that particular photograph.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the people in the photograph?
Speaker 1: Oh, we got [HM] Sonia Sanchez.  We got [HM] Nikki Giovanni.  We got Toni Cade Bambara.  We got Louise Meriwether, Gwendolyn Brooks, [HM] Pearl Cleage, Pinkie Gordon Lane, Mari Evans, and of course, Johnnetta, and there was one other writer, it might have been, it might have been Octavia But--Octavia [E.] Butler, I think, yeah.  But, they were all in there.
Story_ID: 136232
Speaker 1: You have documented a number of families here in Atlanta [Georgia].  So, we, we have to talk about the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] family.  So, tell me about your photographs of the King family.  And, there's some other families here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about them.
Speaker 2: Well, one thing, I've documented the diff--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Speak.
Speaker 1: Go ahead about the King family (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Yes.  I've had occasion to shoot different members of the family at different times, and different places, mostly Coretta [Scott King].  I never got to shoot Martin Luther King.  But, I shot Coretta quite a bit.  Matter of fact, when she passed, myself and a friend of mine, Bud Smith, who is another photographer who shot Coretta also, quite a lot.  Matter of fact, even more so than I did.  We had an exhibit of photographs taken of her though the years at the airport [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport].  And, so, the people who were coming in from different parts of the world, to her funeral [2006], all got a chance to see this historical exhibit of her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Atlanta mayor] Maynard [Jackson], like I said, I started shooting pictures him in 1975 up until a week before he passed [2006].  So, I have a, a quite a collection of photographs on him.  And, you know, they're, they're establishing the Maynard Jackson legacy here in Atlanta.  That's a program that they're putting together.
Speaker 1: Have you ever shot Rosa Parks?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes, I've--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Shot pictures of Rosa Parks on probably four or five different occasions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I've shot her here and Detroit [Michigan] and somewhere else.
Speaker 1: And, most of the time, you shoot at events.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: How do you know what events you wanna go and shoot?  How do you decide?
Speaker 2: If I think, if I think what is happening is relevant to our history, you know, it's--then it becomes important to me.  Because eventually this work is all going into an archive and you know, we need this for our babies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  So, and a lot of times, I may shoot things that I think there's not gonna be a photographer there.  And, you know, I say, "Well, you know, somebody needs to shoot pictures of this."
Speaker 1: Right.  So, when you're out shooting pictures, when do you know to stop or how do you get that feeling of how many pictures do you take when you're, you're out shooting?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably too many.  I, I get to a point where I say, well, you know, this, I've got enough of this, you know.  This is documented, you know.  And, I mean, I just get that feeling or I run out of film, you know, it does, you know, whatever, you know.  Lot of times you're shooting and you may say, say, well, I'mma take a roll of film and go shoot this and then you--something else really unexpected happens, you know, and you say, "Wow, you know, I'm not gonna have enough film to shoot this whole thing."  So, you wait and try to get a couple of really, you know, meaningful shots and that's, you know, how it goes, you know.
Story_ID: 136233
Speaker 1: Has there ever been a time that you have taken pictures and when you look at 'em you say, I'm just not really satisfied with, you know, how I did this particular shoot?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, the difference between doing documentary photography and doing photography like you're doing tabletop photograph or if you're doing model portfolios or if you're doing other things.  In documentary photography, you don't have any control over the situation, okay.  So, you're shooting what's happening, all right.  So, the only time where you maybe dissatisfied is if you're in a position where you're shooting from and what's happening might look better from another position, but you can't leave.  You can't move from where you are to shoot from that perspective.  So, you just get the best possible shot you can get from where you are, you know.  There's no sense, you know, feeling uptight about it.  Situations that may frustrate you are situations where you aren't allowed to use flash, okay.  Those are situations that may frustrate you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Because, you're in a situation a lot of times where you really, really need to, you know, have some more light, you know.  And, so, that's, that's where the frustration may come in.  But, you, you documented the happening and you move on.
Story_ID: 136234
Speaker 1: So, let's go back now, when you're at Clark College [later, Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Tell me about those years.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: We're in 1985 to 1990.
Speaker 2: Right.  Back in 1984, I was doing--photographing an event at Clark.  The (unclear), Branford and Wynton Marsalis and their father, [HistoryMaker] Ellis Marsalis [Jr.], was doing a workshop and a concert at Clark.  And, I was, I went to photograph that.  And, I was sitting down next to Dr. Elias Blake, who was the president of the college at that time.  And, he and I was sitting there together, and he said, "Jim," he says, "I'm gonna go up and talk to them a few minutes."  He said, "Get a few shots of, well, you know, when I'm talking to 'em," you know.  And, this was just at the sound check.  And, I said, "Okay."  So, I got a few pictures of that.  And, then of course, I shot the concert later that evening.  And, two days later, I brought a couple pictures up to Dr. Blake.  And, I said, "Dr. Blake," I said, "I noticed y'all have photographers at some things and photog--and not at other things."  He said, you know, he said, "Sometimes," you know, he said, "It's not up to me."  (Laughter) He said, "Everything would be shot."  He said, "But, different departments have their own budgets and they do what they could afford to do," at--you know, at these small, you know, private colleges.  And, so, I said, "Well, that y'all really need a photographer here, you know, I say, "So, you might wanna get a couple of departments together and put their budgets together and, you know, have a photographer."  He said, "Well, go talk to Dr. Johnson and Charles Stephens."  So, I went, as soon as I left out of his office, I went over to Charles.  I say, "Charles," I say, "I was just talking to Dr. Blake and he said, "If a couple departments got together, you know, and see what kind of budgets they have, you know, that you could hire a photographer."  I said, I said, "Now, I won't be no, the campus photographer."  I said, "Because I wanna own my negatives," I say, "But, I'll be a photographer in residence."  He said, "Well, let--," he said, "That might work."  So, he called Frank [W.] Johnson, who was the director of mass communications.  And, then he can--he called the guy who was over alumni relations.  So, all of us got together.  We sat down, right there.  Everybody came over to Charles' office and we sat down and we talked.  And, he told everybody to look and see what they had in their budget for photography, you know.  And, he did that, and they came up with a figure that I wasn't really comfortable with, but they threw a few perks in, you know.  They were giving me a studio, you know, that I could use for whatever purpose I wanted, you know, to, you know, if I wanted to do commercial stuff or whatever there.  And, and then he also called the guy at the newspaper, at the campus paper to see what kind of budget they had.  And, then he called, who was it?  Oh, and oh, I know what, and then Frank said, "Well, look," he said, "Herb Eichelberger [Dr. Herbert Eichelberger] is teaching photography, teaching photojournalism."  He said, "Maybe you can teach that for him for a couple of sessions, 'cause he don't like teaching it," you know, for a couple of semesters and he said, "Well, through a couple bucks in from that."  So, that's what I did.  I end up teaching photojournalism there for two, two semesters, three semesters, and then I did whatever photography they needed on the campus.  And, then I was able to do my own stuff and it worked fine.  I was there for five years, and I documented the--that was the period where they were merging Clark College and Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: University.
Speaker 2: And, I documented that whole process of the meetings and everything around the merger.  So, I documented that, that whole thing.  And, I also, set up a program where I was doing some mentoring with some of the young guys there.  And, then I had also took about four or five of the people who were interested in photography and I worked with them separately.  And, had them doing all the photography for the yearbooks and things of that sort, and worked with them like that.  And, so, I stayed there.
Story_ID: 136235
Speaker 1: During that time, I had opened up a bookstore, myself and a friend.  We had started a bookstore and so--
Speaker 2: Where was the bookstore?
Speaker 1: The first one we opened was on Cascade [Road], all right.
Speaker 2: That's in southwest Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 1: In southwest Atlanta, right.  And, then we later opened another one in Greenbriar.  And, then moved the one on Cascade to a bigger space.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the bookstore?
Speaker 1: First World.  First World Bookstore. We eventually had five.  But, anyway, bookstores--and, I started a thing at the bookstores--later on my partner and I, we separated the stores, I took--we had closed one, and I took two and she took two.  I had one on Cascade and one at Underground [Atlanta].  And, she had one in Greenbriar and the one in Lithonia [Georgia].  But, anyway, I started a thing called Book Talk.  And, what I would do is we would bring writers in, you know, who, whatever writers was gonna be in town, we got them to come in and talk about their book.  And, have a book signing for them.  And, then if we, if there was no writers in town, I used to take a book and give it to somebody; [HistoryMaker] Asa Hilliard [III] or any, you know, college professors and other community activist.  I would pick a book, give it to them, have them read it, and then come back and give a talk on the book.  And, then we would record that, you know, the session.  It was called Book Talk.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the other people that came in to do talks?
Speaker 1: Oh, we had Dr. [John Henrik] Clarke.  We had, of course, Asa Hilliard.  We had Doc Ben [HistoryMaker Yosef Ben-Jochannan], Eugene Redmond.  We had [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is, what year is this now?
Speaker 1: This is from 1988 to 1994.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, you're still taking pictures--
Speaker 1: I was still doing pictures.
Speaker 2: Of all the events?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Still doing pictures.  Right.  Not stopping.
Story_ID: 136236
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what happens next?
Speaker 2: What happens next?  All right, I think, I closed the bookstores, like I said, in 1994.  What had happened--1995, I sorry.  What happened was the--all of a sudden, the establishment, establishment bookstore (laughter) was white, you know, the major bookstores realized that black folks were reading books.  And, so, what they started doing was, at that time, Media Play, Chapter 11* [Bookstores], B. Dalton, Walden Books, all of these people came to Atlanta [Georgia], during that period of the '90s [1990s], in the '90s [1990s].  And, they started having discount wars with each other, all right.  And, naturally that affected all of the independent bookstores, all right.  They put all of the independent bookstores, you know, out of business, at that time.  I mean, we had a lot of really good bookstores in Atlanta; small ones, not just black bookstores but others.  And, they, you know, knocked them out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that time.  And, then of course, you know, they were fighting against each other too, and a lot of them fell, you know.  So, they went to, so, but anyway that's, that's what happened there.  And--
Speaker 1: So, after you left Clark [Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and your bookstores closed, you still had an art studio?
Speaker 2: A photography studio?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, photography studio.
Speaker 2: Yes, I've always had, you know a photography--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Studio in different places, different small studios, different places, you know.  And, I went to work for a while for a--I set up a gallery for this organization called VSA, Very Special Arts.  And, they had a place here called Arts for All.  They were out on Monroe Drive and then they later moved into the Healey Building downtown.  And, so, they wanted to have a gallery there.  And, so, I worked with them to put a gallery there, and I ran the gallery, curated exhibits for them.  And, then I also worked with their department, the Community, Community Arts Department, where they, they gave tickets out.  They went to organizations who were doing events, the Fox Theatre and places like that.  And, they got them to donate X amount of tickets to, for children and for handicapped people, and folks like that.  And, so, I worked with them with that department also.  All the time, still documenting.
Story_ID: 136237
Speaker 1: So, as you're still documenting and taking pictures of people at these events, has there been anybody who surprised you or you thought was one way and turned out to be another way?  Either good or bad?
Speaker 2: Roy Innis.  Roy Innis, you know, really surprised me, you know, because I had known about CORE [Congress on Racial Equality] in the early days, okay.  And, thought highly of it, until I went to work there with them.  And, they had--they were on 135th Street [Harlem, New York] and right up the street from the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture] and they were in the Apex Building.  And, you know, the building where the Apex Beauty School was.  They were there, and, they had on one end of the building they had, they had the CORE Magazine" and CORE national headquarters.  And, then also, in the same building, they had New York CORE, all right.  They had a few chapters still left around in different parts of the country; Baltimore [Maryland] and Los Angeles [California], a couple other cities they had some chapters.  And, there was always some conflict going on in the building, you know.  They had it--so, at one time, Roy Innis had put an edict, an edict out where if he was out of town, the people from national, and the magazine and New York CORE could not interact with each other, if he wasn't there, all right.  His wife ran the magazine, all right.  She was the publisher of CORE Magazine, all right.  His girlfriend, I don't know if she later became his wife or one of his wives, or whatever the case may be, who was [Niger] Innis' mother, you know.  Are you familiar with his son, [Niger] Innis, who's on television a lot of times now?  His mother was running National CORE.  Right in the same space, you know.  It was a very negative atmosphere, okay.  And, so, there was always things going on.  And, then he had this rule that people who worked for CORE any part of CORE, could not have a personal relationship.  You couldn't go out, you know, the men and the women, they couldn't go out with each other.  One time, one of the young ladies there and one of the guys had a, had, went out together, and he had a mock trial there, you know.  Or, had put them on trial, you know.
Story_ID: 136238
Speaker 1: What I wanna know is if you have ever approached someone to take their photograph and you thought they might have been one way and would allow you.  And, when you approached them to take the photograph they did--either didn't want their picture taken?  And, how did, how do you handle that when someone doesn't want you to take their photograph?
Speaker 2: To be honest, in documentary, if you're documenting something that happen--but, before, by time somebody say, don't do it, you have the picture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.  I have never, I've never really had that.  I think, you know, I found out later, there is always a way of approaching situations.  It, I think, people read, people read your professionalism, your attitude about how you're going about what you're doing, okay.  And, they don't, you know, they don't stop you.  I think, that people who seem amateurish or seem (laughter) you know, something, you know, like that, tend to catch, you know, a little more flak.  I--all throughout my career, I have not, you know, really, really, had situations like that.  Although, I have had situations where I have, may have contacted people to request permission, all right, and have been denied permission, okay.  But, anything that I just went to shoot, I normally found--
Speaker 1: Didn't have a problem.
Speaker 2: A way to do what I had to do and not been denied.
Story_ID: 136239
Speaker 1: You have, have shot so many people, and taken pictures of so many people.  Is there somebody that you really would like to take a photograph of that you have not?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think, I would like to do Obama Barack [sic], [HM] Barack Obama, I mean.  Yes, Barack (laughter).  I would like to do his pictures.  [Congresswoman] Sheila Jackson Lee is a person I highly respect.  She reminds me a lot of Barbara Jordan, you know, with her no-nonsense attitude, you know.  So, that's, there, there people, you know, that I admire and of course, (unclear) picture of a long time of Hosea, you know, Hosea Williams.  And, he was a very, very important person to me, you know, because, Hosea, you know, he would tackle any, any kind of problem, you know.  With a march or a rally or a speech or whatever he had to do to bring, you know, some light to things that were happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, he was, he was important, you know.  A lot of people looked negatively at Hosea but, you know, just like you have people today who are always knocking [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson and [HM Reverend] Al Sharpton and people like that.  But, we need those folks, you know.  They keep the stuff out there, and that's important.

Speaker 1: Has your style changed since you start photography--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: 'Til now?  I mean (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The fire.  The fire is sort of banked, you know.  How they used to called banking the fire, you know.  The fire, you know, that I, that I had back then about running and sho--what we call running and shooting, you know, it's sort of subdued now.  But, I still, you know, shoot those things that I feel is negative, negative to shoot, I mean, necessary to shoot.  Right now, I'm trying to get myself sort of in a different mode, if you will.  Because I need to start really, really, archiving, putting this stuff together, you know.  Because, it's--while I still can remember a lot of things, you know.  Because a lot of stuff, I just shoot and process it and put it away, you know.  And, so, I'm at the point now where I have to really get this stuff archived.  And, so, I have some really good people, my cousin Earl (ph.) here and some other people working with me to get this stuff in some kind of order.
Speaker 1: Okay.  From 1995 on, tell me some of the things that you have done.
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, you know, I got active with the African American Jazz Caucus.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I've done that.  I've--I work with an organization here [Atlanta, Georgia] called the African Americans for the Arts.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been, I think, they started it in the '90s [1990s], but it never went anywhere.  So, we revived the organization in the late '90s [1990s].  And, I became the president and we've, and I, spent a couple of terms as president to get the organization kick-started again.  It's an organization that deals with, we do exhibit and we have workshops and things like that around the arts, all areas of the arts.  Matter of fact, we have a show going on right now at the [Fulton County] Southwest Arts Center [Atlanta, Georgia], which is where we meet now.
Story_ID: 136241
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about African Americans for the Arts, and how you revived that organization and became president.  During that time you were involved also because you do so many events.  Tell me about the National Black Arts Festivals.
Speaker 2: Right.  The National Black Arts Festival started in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1988.  And, during all of those years from 1988 to the present, they used to have it every two years, now it's every year, for the last two years.  I documented that.  I have exhibited and documented, exhibited, you know, at the festival.  But, I've documented, documented for all these years.  So, they're, they're having a twentieth year anniversary in 2008.  And, so, I'll be doing, they're putting together a big program and I'll--they're be using my work for some of, my work, I guess, and other photographers, for a book and an exhibit.  But, for the first exh--the first festival in 1988, I did and exhibit on black music called Blues Legacy.  And, for my opening reception, [HM] Ossie Davis was there, and [HM] Gordon Parks.  And, it was a really, really good, and I hadn't seen him in a couple of years at that time.  And, so, he, he was here for my--they were honoring him during that time, too.  And, so, he came to my exhibit opening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Auburn Avenue Festivals?
Speaker 2: Auburn Avenue Street Festivals?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I go, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I, you know, I've shot 'em, you know, through the years.  Yeah, I've shot pictures of 'em during the years, through the years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any dealings with the, the Research Library, Auburn Avenue--
Speaker 2: Auburn Avenue Research Library.
Speaker 1: Research Library?
Speaker 2: Three years ago, they had a program there where they was celebrating me for that year, 2003.  That was--they did two exhibit of my work there that year.  And, then they had a symposium that, that I put together on Black Arts in Atlanta.  We had a symposium there.  And, then they did a interview sorta like what we're doing here now.  This filmmaker from California did an interview on me for their archives there.  And, so, I, and I shoot a lot of their programs that they have there.  I just go down and document, 'cause they bring a lot of writers and folks in like that.  So, they're doing a lot of positive things.  They have established the Jim Alexander Collection at the Auburn Avenue Research Library.  And, so, from time to time I put stuff into that collection.
Speaker 1: Wow!  That awesome.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five photographs that I--from the Neighborhood Art Center, they purchased fifty-five of 'em there, in their collection there.  And, this program called GALILEO from the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], has got permission from myself and Auburn Avenue Library to put that online.  So, it's called Community Art in Atlanta.  And, so, people from all over the world can access those photographs from that particular program at the, that's there at the Auburn Avenue Research Library.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you about other photographers, are--photographers, are there any photographers that you really admire?
Speaker 2: James Van Der Zee.  I don't know whether we had this earlier, whether I spoke about this earlier.  But, he is, he was the master artist photographer, James Van Der Zee.  Even to the point of he actually superimposed other photographs together and he painted on some of this photographs.  And, then one of the greatest document free photography's, of course, was P.H. Poke, out of Tuskegee [Alabama], who had an exhi--had a gallery here, I mean, a studio in Atlanta [Georgia] here for, once for a short period of time.  And, then he went to Chicago [Illinois], I believe, and then he went back to Tuskegee.  And, then he was at Tuskegee until his death.  The last time that he came to Atlanta, I went to Tuskegee and got him and brought him here for an exhibit that Marian Langley who had a gallery up on Marlon Avenue.  She had, wanted to have an exhibit of his pictures.  And, by that time, they had amputated on of his legs.  And, so, I went down and got him and brought him up here for the opening of his exhibit.  And, so, that was an interesting period.  And, before that, they had did an exhibit of his work at the old Nexus Gallery that was on Forrest [Avenue, now Ralph McGill Boulevard], and we took pictures together up there during that time.  And, of course, James Van Der Zee, like I say, he was one of the masters.  When I was going to school in, at the New York Institute of Photography [New York City, New York], like, I would get off of work at the newspaper delivery service like ten o'clock in the morning and I would drive up to Harlem [New York].  And, go from Ridgewood [New Jersey] over to Harlem, and I'd sit down and sometime talk to him for a short period.  And, did that, you know, several times while I was in New York and then I'd go on to school.  And, I was fortunate enough one time to get pictures of P. H. Polk and James Van Der Zee together here in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: Right.  And, then another thing, this photographers--I have a friend whose here now by the name of Eric Waters, who was one of the longtime documenters of the New Orleans [Louisiana] culture.  And, him and about four or five other photographers who had documented the New Orleans culture for years, lost all of their stuff in the flood [Hurricane Katrina, 2005].  And, so, Eric, like I say, they living here now.  He has just a small amount of his stuff, you know, from the earlier years but he's back documenting New Orleans again.  Back, you know, back and forth from Atlanta down there documenting some of the things that's happening.  And, then, [HM] Roy Lewis, who has been documenting for years.  He's in Washington, D.C.  He's been documenting since the early '60s [1960s].  Roland Freeman, he has a documentary photography program in Washington, D.C.  Roland is originally from Baltimore, Maryland.  And, he started documenting the arabbers.  Those were the men who used to go around with the ponies and the wagons, and selling fruit and ice, and vegetables, and fish, and stuff like that in Baltimore.  And, Roland Freeman documented all of that.  He also documented the Mississippi Quilters, and the blues festivals down there; Delta Blues Festival [Mississippi Delta] he documented.  We both documented that for years.
Story_ID: 136243
Speaker 1: So, there's, there's a lot of photographers out there now.  Unfortunately, we can't get a lot of the younger people to, you know, to begin doing more documentary, you know.  But, there is a lot of the older photographers now who are doing that.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Still.
Speaker 2: Is that a concern for you that?--
Speaker 1: It's very much a concern.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Matter fact, I had a talk with several, a couple interviews recently, I've talked about that.  That the photographers now have, are not learning the craft of photography, all right.  See, they, instead of taking pictures, now they're making pictures.  They go out and just take a shot and then right to the computer, you know, and do whatever's necessary in Photoshop, you know.  But, you have to, you know, in film, film cameras made, make you learn the craft of photography.  Because, you can't shoot a picture and then look at it, you know, and then do something else, and look at that one, and do something else, and look at that one and when you finish, you got, you know, take fifteen shots, you know, to, to come up with a decent picture.  With film, you know, you know, you either have it or you don't have it, you know.  So, you gotta learn the craft of photography for film.  So, that's, that's one of the negative aspects of, you know, photography today.  People are not learning the craft.
Speaker 2: How are we gonna remedy that situation?  How--what do you think might help to get the younger generation?--
Speaker 1: Well, by some of us continuing telling them, you know, it's necessary for you to get out there and, and do the hard work of learning the craft of photography.  Because, even with your digital, it will make you a better photographer.
Story_ID: 136244
Speaker 1: Do you have any other concerns about the African American community?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a concern.  And, that is that parents aren't taking responsibility for their children, all right.  I grew up in a time when our parents were held responsible for us; what we did, and what we didn't do, all right.  Not, not, even the parents who might have been a little lax, all right.  The society held them responsible for what they kids did, all right.  Today, youngters do most anything they wanna do, and they do it with their home, their parent's house as a base (laughter), okay, in which to do that.  You were responsible, when I grew up, you were responsible for everybody in your house, okay, whatever they did, all right.  You know, your kids couldn't go out and rob and steal or do whatever, all right, and the parents were not brought to task for it, okay.  Today, parents look at it, well, you know, you know, I didn't, I didn't raise him to do that.  Naw, our parents didn't raise us to do it neither.  But, they held us responsible for what we did, all right.  And, they, you know, and to whatever powers they had, they saw to it that we didn't do it again.  You know, not as long as we were under their roof.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) do you--
Speaker 2: And, that's a problem today.
Story_ID: 136245
Speaker 1: Do you have a message for the future generation?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have, I have, you know, that you're supposed to build on these things that, that the generations in front of you have done.  You've still got some struggles out there, you know, but you can make it better, you know.  But, you've got to, you know, you got to do the hard work, you know.  And, I, I hate to be quoting George Bush, you know, (laughter), but you got to do the hard work, you know.  You've got to get out there and get educated and, by all means, learn some skills.  Education, book learning in and of itself isn't all of it, you know.  You have to know how, if somebody don't wanna hire you, you can hire yourself to do something.  You have to learn how to do something, you know.  So many times, I used to tell the students when I was at Clark [College, now Clark-Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], they had students majoring in, in mass media, in broadcast media at that time.  They had the newspaper there.  They had television programs.  They had the radio station.  Go in there and volunteer.  Don't just do what you have to do for class.  Come out of college with a resume, you know.  Take the time in college, the time that you're sitting out on the, out on the yard and so and so forth, you know.  Be doing something that's going to, you know, prepare you for when you get outta of this college.  Because, otherwise, when you get out of college, you're gonna still have to learn how to do something in order to feed yourself.  And, so, it's important that people today, you know, with all of the things, the access that they have, all of the information that they have, they can really, really, you know, come out of college even with employable skills.  Important.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I, how would I like to be remembered?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person who really cared about people.  That's, that's it in a nutshell.  I really care about people.
Story_ID: 136247
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Besides, my children contributing, I want them to contribute, you know, that, that is really always your best legacy, is that your kid, your children contribute.  But, I'd like for this work that I've done for these, all these years to, to be something that can, can help somebody.  Even if it's just to help people remember, you know, that, you know, that I was here and that they were there and this is what we did.
Story_ID: 136248
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't spoke about that you'd like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  I think, there was one thing.  I didn't talk about this, this space that we're in here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Studioplex [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was an idea that Mtamanika Youngblood, who still lives in this community and some other community folks--this building was sitting here and it was an eyesore.  And, it was a mess really.  It's a former cotton warehouse that's been sitting here for a hundred years probably, and they had this idea.  So, they formed a community development organization here in the community.  And, then since this was in the community, they came up with ideas.  They, they pulled some other folks together and I was one of the original people that they pulled in a group to talk about establishing this community art center here.  And, then we, you know, came up with a name for it.  And, then they, you know, did the design and the plans for it.  It's not all of what it was originally meant to be but, it's a very good space.  I lived here, upstairs one time.  It's a live-work space.  A lot of people have studios and offices in their living spaces here.  And, so, they, and then there's people here who have living spaces and secondary spaces that they use for their studios or offices or galleries.  And, I've been here since the beginning of, I think, 1999.  And, it's a very, very good space.  It was one of the forerunners for all of these other spaces you see around this city that is now becoming what this is, you know.  And, so, it's, it's a good idea.
Speaker 1: What's the name of this complex?
Speaker 2: The Studioplex; all one word.
Speaker 1: And, what area of town is this?
Speaker 2: This is the 4th Ward.
Speaker 1: Fourth Ward.
Speaker 2: They call it the King Historic District.
Story_ID: 136249
Speaker 1: Well, it's actually a very lovely studio.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about?
Speaker 2: Naw.  Well, one thing, you know, I'm very thankful for my family and my wife, and my kids and, you know.  That's important.
Speaker 1: What's your, tell us your wife's name.
Speaker 2: Louise.  My wife's name if Louise.
Speaker 1: And, your children?
Speaker 2: My children.  There's Jimmy, and Johnny, Roxanne, Jeffrey (ph.), Yolanda, Kwame, Ayo (ph.), Ayesha (ph.), and my stepson, Tyrone.
Speaker 1: And, how many grandchildren do you have?
Speaker 2: About fifteen, I think.
Speaker 1: About fifteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They're, they're--I'm thinking about fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Recently, the youngest is a set of twins; boy and a girl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Just going on two.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I wanna thank you very much for your interview and for your time.  It's very important piece of history and, and we really appreciate you.
Speaker 2: I really appreciate you.  Thank you.
