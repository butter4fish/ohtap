Speaker 1: Alright. My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state you full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Hebert Graves Winful.  Herbert, it's, you know how it's spelled, H-E-R-B-E-R-T, Graves, G-R-A-V-E-S, Winful, W-I-N as in Nancy, F as in Frank, U-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born December 3, 1952 in London, United Kingdom.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that everyone with the name Winful is related to me, so it's a fairly unique name.  My sister tells me that it was probably a Ghanaian name like Win-something, Winfrey, and they got, perhaps Anglicized to become Winful, but I really don't know the real history of the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Right now, I'm professor of electrical engineer in computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Harbor [Michigan].
Speaker 1: So that's enough, actually, but I'm just asking, did you have any other title?
Speaker 2: Well, I have, I guess official title is Arthur F. Thurnau professor of electrical engineering and computer science.  Arthur F. Thurnau.
Speaker 1: That's B-E--
Speaker 2: Arthur F. Thurnau. T-H-U-R-N-A-U, Thurnau.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, my favorite food is anything that my wife cooks.  She's really very creative in the kitchen, very inventive.  But if we do go out to eat, I tend to order seafood; I like seafood a lot.
Speaker 1: All right, now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.  It's always been blue. And it just so happens that I'm here at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], where the colors are amazing blue, so go blue.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is fall in Michigan.  Fall is such a beautiful time of the year.  You've seen the lovely reds and yellows and oranges of the leaves, so it's nice in the fall.  And also there's fall football, Michigan football.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination is Paris [France]; so beautiful, grand boulevards, impressive architecture, great food, museums, yeah, my favorite-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Destination.
Speaker 1: The last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite saying, which I have many, but, the one that I--that comes to mind now is, "For God did not give us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."  It comes from the bible.
Story_ID: 23090
Speaker 1: Now.  I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we will start with your mother's side and keep them separate until we bring them together.  So, can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Margaret Ferguson Graves, that--her maiden name, the Ferguson is F-E-R-G-U-S-O-N--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --And then when she got married, it became Margaret Ferguson Winful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how do you spell her first name.
Speaker 2: Margaret--
Speaker 1: Oh, Margaret.
Speaker 2: M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, Margaret.
Speaker 1: Now, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born on November 4, 1922.  I believe she was born in Cape Coast, Ghana, though it may also have been Elmina; I'd have to check with my sister, who knows more about these things.  I think Cape Coast is a pretty good approximation, because Elmina is only about ten miles away from Cape Coast.
Speaker 1: Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family; how far back can you trace them and what were doing in history?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, I can trace back to my great-grandfather, who lived in Cape Coast, Ghana; it was the Gold Coast then.  He was a musician and a business person.  His son, my grandfather, Charles Emanuel Graves, whom I never knew, but because he was long gone before I was born.  He was born, I believe in 1884 and died in 1929.  He was a great musician, a composer, a pianist, organist, violinist; he was an educator; he set up a printing press, a bottling plant; he did many, many things in Cape Coast.
Speaker 1: Those are a lot of things.  I want to go back; now, your great-grandfather, now what was his name and what musicians-- what instrument did he play?
Speaker 2: Now, I don't know a whole lot about him; I'm not sure what he--I think he did play the piano, but other than that, I don't know what else he played.  I haven't researched his life so much, and it's a shame because before my grandmother died, I really should have interviewed her about all these people, but I didn't.
Speaker 1: That's interesting though, there's some music on this side of the family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 23091
Speaker 1: So your grandfather [Charles Emmanuel Graves], he was a musician, a composer, had printing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's had a printer press, he was an educator, he set up a school.  He was one of the first to offer schooling to girls, he was a champion of, you'd say women's rights.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: The name of the school; I really don't remember, it was a girls' school.
Speaker 1: Was it in Cape Coast [Ghana]?
Speaker 2: In Cape Coast, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Cape Coast.  He also offered instruction by mail to people outside of Cape Coast, you know, there was distance education in those days.  So he offered instruction in music and a number of other subjects.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was a pioneer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he really was.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so, he lived I until 1929?
Speaker 2: 192--yeah, he died very young.  But he did a lot in his short life. And then my grandmother, Rosanna had--maiden name was Bilson, Rosanna Bilson.
Speaker 1: Was that B-I--
Speaker 2: B-I-L-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was--was mostly a homemaker, but she was a very smart lady, she read all the time; always reading books.  She was very up on world affairs.  She also played the piano, and she was the matriarch of the family as I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So mother's [Margaret Ferguson Graves] family if fairly well off, you would say.  Would you say that?
Speaker 2: Well, initially, they may have been somewhat well off.  My grandmother tells me that her--her husband's parents were somewhat well off.  My grandfather, even though he was such a great person, was also not a very good businessman, so he did not make a lot of money, and there were times when his students were not paying her fees.  When I went back home to Ghana, a few years ago, I was rummaging through some old shelves, and I found a ledger with a list of names of all the students and beside it whether they had paid their fee or not.  And it was amazing how many had not paid, so when he died, he didn't have like a whole lot of money, but he was not poor. I'd say middle class, though, in those days.  But then after he died, the family fell upon hard times, because I don't think he left a whole lot for his wife and kids, but they still, you know, managed.
Story_ID: 23092
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in those days was there public education, or was, you know, pretty much usual for someone to open a school as an enterprise, even though it was a service as an enterprise, too?
Speaker 2: Wait, say, like my grandparents' [Charles Emmanuel Graves and Rosanna Bilson] days?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: There were some public schools that were established by missionaries.  So most of these schools would have names like St. Mary or St. somebody, so there are quite a few of those public schools set up by missionaries.  There were semi-private, because, I think, a lot--some funds came from the--whatever church was behind it.
Speaker 1: There were free, or close to being free?
Speaker 2: They were not terribly expensive, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we would call these parochial schools here, you know, I mean, it's not really run by the state--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --Would not be a public school in the United States.  I know I've talked to people from the Caribbean who also, when I mentioned public schools, they'd tell me about the missionary schools.  Were there any schools run by the British government?
Speaker 2: Some were and then some were run by these missionary organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay. 'Cause I wondered if the government provided any schools?
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest government was behind some of the schools.  Yeah, but most of the schools were--had some kind of connection with some missionary organization.  So you might say they were government-supported missionary school.
Story_ID: 23093
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother [Margaret Ferguson Graves] tell you about growing up?  I mean, what kind of experiences did she have growing up?  When she grew up it was the Gold Coast [Ghana]?
Speaker 2: It was the Gold Coast then.  Yeah, my mother grew up with five other siblings.  And, you know, her father [Charles Emmanuel Graves] had died when she was quite young, probably around nine years old or so.  So, she grew up with my grandmother and siblings.  My grandmother [Rosanna Bilson] made sure that they all went to school.  My mother, after elementary, did go on to high school, a high school called Achimota, it was called Achimota School [Accra, Ghana].  It was the first high school in Ghana.  Then she went on for teacher training and became a teacher.  All her siblings also were well educated.  My uncles ended up, some became musicians as well, some became educators, one became a writer, so yeah they were well educated.  My grandmother took good care of them in Cape Coast.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I think people would want to know like why was the colony, the British colony, in that part of Africa called Gold Coast?
Speaker 2: Well, Ghana does have a lot of gold, and the Gold Coast, when the colonist came, they did find a lot gold both along the coast and further inland, so it became known as the Gold Coast.  Ghana still produces quite a bit of gold and export; one of the major producers of gold.
Speaker 1: All right.  I just wanted to establish that.  Now, your mother was able to become a school teacher.  Did she teach in missionary school or public school?
Speaker 2: She taught in a public school.  She taught in a school called St. Michaels in Cape Coast [Ghana]; she eventually became the head mistress, principal, of the school; it was a girl's school.  And, yes, she taught there for many years.
Story_ID: 23094
Speaker 1: Now, I want to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Herbert Francis Winful.  The Francis also happens to be my younger brother's name.  So my brother and I shared my father's first two names.
Speaker 1: And what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father, I think, was born either in 1916 or 1910, [19]11, I'm not really sure, but he was born in Salt Pond, Ghana.
Speaker 1: Salt Pond--
Speaker 2: Salt Pond, you know, S-A-L-T, P-O-N-D, Salt Pond.  It's about eighteen miles from Cape Coast [Ghana].
Speaker 1: Is Salt Pond named Salt Pond because there's actually a salt pond?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a major salt industry around Salt Pond.  Yeah, so that their origin of the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How far back can you trace your father's side of the family, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't know as much about my father's side of the family as I do about my mother's [Margaret Ferguson Graves] side, and that's partly because, you know, Ghana is a matrilineal society.  So you might belong to your mother's family as well as your father's family, and in my case, it was also because my parents were divorced when I was six years old, or maybe five years old, and so I grew up really with my mother and my grandmother [Rosanna Bilson] and a whole bunch of aunts so I was much, much closer to my mother's side of the family than to my father's.
Story_ID: 23095
Speaker 1: So, when you mean matrilineal society, what--can you explain what that means?
Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: --and how it's different from what we have here.
Speaker 2: --Okay.  So in Ghana, and in my--in my  ethnic group, you know the Fantes, the Fante tribe, and it's probably the same with many other tribes in Ghana, we trace lineage through the mother.  So, when you say somebody's family, the word for family is ebusia.  So you're part of your mother's ebusia.  So, her relatives--her clan, the larger clan on your mother's side is what you belong to.  You don't belong to your father's clan; you belong to your mother's clan.  And even inheritance oftentimes it's through the mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Now, that's just the opposite of what's done in western Europe and therefore in America, because it was conquered by western Europeans.  So, is there a reason for that that you know of?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know the reason, but as a practical matter, since men, in those days might have perhaps more than one wife or may have had children with other women, the children--the mother's kids are the ones that--well, you feel a closer connection to the kin, the brothers and sisters from the same mother than you would to your half brothers and sisters.  So it just turned out that if you have a family and you got three kids from one with their mother and three kids from a different mother, it's a lot easier to trace where they're all from, I guess, by looking at the mother's side.  I do have some half brothers and half sisters, but I feel a lot closer to my full brothers and full sisters.  But I really don't for sure what the origin of the matrilineal tradition.
Story_ID: 23096
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your family on both sides, are both sides Fante?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about the Fante and a little bit about the history of Fante?
Speaker 2: The history of the Fantes.  Well the Fantes supposedly migrated, well, the Fantes are part of a larger group called the Akan, A-K-A-N.  The Akan includes the Fantes, includes Ashantis, and a number of other tribes.  Supposedly, they migrated from the north in the part around Mali, and ancient empire.  Those ancient empire of Ghana which was to the northwest of the present-day Ghana and settled around the coast.  The Fantes were among the first to have contact with the Europeans around the 15th century.  So the Fantes ended up adopting many of the European ways, including names.  So you find in my family names like Graves, Ferguson.  So the Fantes established a decent relationship with the colonist.  Some of them were trained by the British, so they were even sent to England and they came back and became civil servants, and some even helped in their further colonization of the Gold Coast [Ghana].  The Fantes, they were often--you know, there were various wars among tribes in the old Gold Coast.  The Ashantis became a pretty dominant tribe; they conquered several of the smaller tribes and eventually the British marched up north and defeated the Ashantis and added them all to the colony Gold Coast.  So the colonization started along the coast when the Fantes and British moved further up north.  Don't know what else I can tell you about Fantes.
Story_ID: 23097
Speaker 1: Is their culture similar to--now, from what I read and heard from people from that region, we're talking about somewhere is a conquest by the British at some point--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --That, you know, changed the lives of people to a point where names are changed and some even cultural patters have changed by the British invaders that were conquerors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, initially, they came as traders.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They came to trade.  Initially it was the Portuguese, the Portuguese came along and various other Europeans came-the Danes came, then the British.
Speaker 1: And then we have, like, Ghana as being one of the centers of the slave trade too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Castles and-
Speaker 2: There's all these slave castles that dot the coast.
Speaker 1: Now this is a kind of-- I mean-- so I guess we're talking about from the eighteenth century, you know, on up through the early part of the twentieth century this kind of thing was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it got started around the fifteenth century, I think it was 14-something, right?
Speaker 1: From the Portuguese--
Speaker 2: From the Portuguese, land that their-- so--
Speaker 1: So Cape Coast [Ghana] was one of the-- they had a big castle in Cape Coast.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a big castle in Cape Coast. Originally set up for trade and for administration and then became a place to hold slaves before being sent off to the new world.
Speaker 1: Right, so, now Ashanti, from what I understand, were able to stay somewhat independent but they were dependent on the guns the British gave them to capture other people to send them to coast. Which is, is that fairly accurate, or do you know, do you have any sense?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean there were several wars of conquests by the Ashantis and some of the tribes that they conquered would have to pay tribute to the Ashanti king and by-- there were-- I imagine that some people that were sent into slavery. Oftentimes people from further north, captured and sold off into slavery. So-
Speaker 1: Okay, but, but from what you're saying and from what I've read, I guess we're saying that the Fantes were on the coast, at the bay really, were the closest, had the closest contact to the British--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because of their location.
Speaker 2: Because of their location, initially, yeah.
Speaker 1: So the names and everything-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: One of the great works of African history is written by Jacee Degraft Johnson--
Speaker 2: That's right. I know the family.
Speaker 1: --who's an African warrior back in '54 [1954] when you were two. He's, I thought it was a British man when I saw the book until I saw his picture on the hardcover, sitting there with his kente on. Yeah, Yeah.
Speaker 2: So-
Speaker 1: So, yeah, you'll find that a lot among Fantes, especially among the educated Fantes of that era. Yeah, a lot of British names.
Story_ID: 23098
Speaker 1: What kind of discussions do Fantes have about their origins and history, you know, because as I said, here we often discuss--I know we can only go back so far because we bump against a wall of slavery, but you've got like a wall of colonialism, but you can almost like look over the fence in some ways and see, you know, and part of what you do is independent irregardless of what your name is and that sort of thing, right; so one of the discussions amongst the Fante about?
Speaker 2: Well, I know I did have some discussions with my grandmother [Rosanne Bilson], for example, about, you see, my grandfather [Charles Emmanuel Graves] and where the name came from and whether he had a, you know, a Fante name and indeed, he did.  His Fante last name was Abayie.  Abayie, A-B-A-Y-I-E.  And so, as a composer, he would often use his English name, you know, Charles Emanuel Graves, but then on some other compositions, he would list himself as Charles Abayie.  So sometimes people were not sure whether that was the same person or not.  And most of us also would have so-called Christian names because of the missionaries turned many along the coast into Christians, and they would be baptized, and they would have Christian first name.  So you have a Christian first name and maybe a Fante last name or a Christian first name and an English last name, as well.  And there were also people with Portuguese last names.  Like you find people with names like Susa--De Sousa, you might find names like that among the Fantes; I forget others, but, yeah, you do find a range of European last names.  But everyone also has the Fante name.  A Fante name--one of the names you're given at birth is your--the name of the day of the week, so for example, I was born on Wednesday, so, I'm called Quaco, you give to boys born on Wednesday.  So you have your name Quaco, and then he might have a last name which might be from some ancestor, you know, some ancestor Fante name is added to that Quaco, so Quaco something.  But then at the same time I'm also Herbert Winful.  So it's like you navigating two cultures at the same time.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now this is what I was trying to get at.
Speaker 2: We try to maintain as much of our culture as possible.  Growing up I spoke Fante, but then once you start school, you start learning English as well, so you're bilingual.  There are the Fante dancers, the travel dancers and songs which we learn, the traditions, the traditions that I associate with things like puberty, which I still carried on.  And at the same time, we also celebrate things like Christmas and Easter, so you actually grow up, actually bi-cultural.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so when I asked you for your name, you weren't sure you were giving it to somebody that needs to know it or, so I guess, you know, because you didn't give me Quaco.
Speaker 2: I didn't give you Quaco--well, because that's--professionally, Herbert Winful.  Some of my friends, especially those from Ghana, might call me Quaco.  My family calls me Quaco, but most people here in the U.S. know me as Herbert Winful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know I'm not a Fante, but at the same time, I don't know what I am, I mean historically, but you're amongst--this is not just a professional interview, so this is done--you're an African American, so Quaco is appropriate to put in the name--
Speaker 2: Okay, yes, so you can call me Quaco, if you want. [laughing]
Story_ID: 23099
Speaker 1: So you're like navigating two worlds in the sense.  So when you have a baby, do you have like a naming ceremony?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, there's a naming ceremony for the baby, and you have the elders in the clan gather and the baby, and then you put a drop of water on the tongue of the baby, and say, okay, baby if you--when you say water, it means water and then they put a drop of gin on the baby's tongue, okay, when you say gin, it is gin.  So--and the idea is that you have to mean what you say, you know.  You have to be a person of integrity.  So when you say this is that, that's what it is; you don't say one thing and mean something else.  So that's part of the ceremony, the naming ceremony.
Speaker 1: So it's typical then that amongst the Fante that you would have like, say you'd have naming ceremony then you might have a Christian?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, you have a naming ceremony and then a Christening, you know, you go into a church and there's the Baptist is more fun, and you get baptized and you come out with a Christian name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is, you know, this is--I guess, what I was saying, before we started this African people have something in common, and this is what it is, you know, in the world we live in.  [Paul Laurence] Dunbar wrote about, you know, we were in mask, you know, means duality--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --What you see is not always what's going on with you.  [W.E.B.] Du Bois talked about the two strivings in one dark body, you know, to try to please the popular cultural world, the Euro world, and how to please your own world at the same time, the Fantes were doing mostly the same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And there's always this bit of tension, because if you act too much like, you know, the white folk, like they were peers, then people would talk about you.  Just like over here, you know, "Oh, you're trying to be white" kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, they relate that to learning nowadays.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to learning, but at the same time, people kind of--especially those who hadn't had much schooling, they respected greatly those who had this European kind of air.  Those who spoke, you know, English, you know, very well and had English-sounding names, they were called them "bronyi".  Bronyi means, you know, white man or European.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that?
Speaker 2: Bronyi, B-R-O-N-Y-I, bronyi.  So, if a boy doing well in school and that is speaking English really well, comes home, the family members who might not be educated might say, "oh me bronyi, my white man, me bronyi. [laughing]
Speaker 1: So, it's some hell to catch by being the--
Speaker 2: Well, not so much the hell to catch, but be--they would be-- those people-- they would give you-- it would be a sign of respect, [oburoni?].  Okay, on the one hand, you'd be respected, but then on the other hand, if you acted too much, you acted like, now I will not partake in certain ceremonies because I've been educated, then people would talk about you.  "Oh, yeah, you think you are--you think you are something else.  You've forgotten where you came from.  You can't even speak Fante anymore?" "I can't."  So there's a tension.
Story_ID: 23100
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Herbert Francis Winful], we were talking about your father's side of the family, and you say you didn't know as much about them, but now, did your father have a chance to go to school, too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  My father went to--in fact, he went to the same Achimota School [Accra, Ghana] that my mother [Margaret Ferguson Graves] went to, the high school.
Speaker 1: Well, let me say this, from what I've heard, now, you may not say it, because you take it for granted, but Achimota is a special school.
Speaker 2: It is, really quite special.  Yeah, it was a special school.  They educated some of Ghana's great leaders.  So my father went there, and then he went on to university in London [United Kingdom].  He has a--he got a degree in civil engineering, civil engineer.  So, yeah, he was well educated.
Speaker 1: Now, this is another part of the duality here that there's a book by [Ayi Kwei] Armah called the 'Eloquence of the Scribes' read the scribes going to school in Achimota.  He talks about how special it was, you know, people were hand-picked to be students there, but he also said it's a place where you could display no--none of your African characteristics at all, no African language spoken, no--you know, no history taught, you know, I mean, you were pretty much set on paths to go to England [United Kingdom], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that may have been true in the early days, yeah, but suddenly, you know, when I was growing up, you know, when Gold Coast had become Ghana, there was a big push to go back to your roots and to highlight a native languages and costumes, and so in--I'd say most high schools you actually learned these things of your tribe, and would have some weekends, we'd have--we'd organize, I forget what do you called them, maybe tribal nights, or whatever, and then different tribes would do their dances, and there'd be competitions, which teams would have the best dancers, and play that, so it was--we're always in touch with where we came from.
Speaker 1: That's good to know, because this is, I think, Armah went to school before you did, before independence--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --And independence was 19--
Speaker 2: 1957.
Speaker 1: --Yes, 1957.  So, you would have been like five years old, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '57 [1957], yeah, I was four and a half when--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Ghana became independent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your dad was trained at Achimota then he went to Britain--
Speaker 2: London University [London, United Kingdom], uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --He studied--
Speaker 2: Studied civil engineering.  Yeah, so he came back and worked in the civil service.  He worked for the Ministry of Works and Housing, and then eventually became the chief engineering on Ghana's hydroelectric power project, which is called the Volta River Project.  He built this dam--the Akosombo Dam.  Akosombo, A-K-O-S-O-M-B-O, Akosombo Dam, to provide power to the country.  This was in the early '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 23101
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Margaret Ferguson Graves] was a school teacher, your father [Herbert Francis Winful] was a civil engineer.  Now, is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't think they--you know, I don't remember the story.  I'm sorry, I don't remember how--I may have known it at one point, but I can't tell you right now.  I did not research it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your parents know each other before your father went to London [United Kingdom], or were they married when he went to London to become a civil engineer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were married before he went to London [United Kingdom].  Actually, he was already practicing as an engineer, and then he went to London for further studies.  But, yeah, they were married before they went to London, and so, I was born while they were in London.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is it even--it just dawned on me, is it appropriate to even ask the question, how they met, because were marriages arranged by the Fantes in those days, or would they meet and fall in love like in western movies and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I think both things happened.  I know--my mother tells me that for a long time she was being courted by somebody else.  There was this man who turned out to be a British guy who was courting my mother, but my mother, you know, for some reason wasn't interested, and then my dad came along, but I don't really remember how he came along, and swept her off her feet, but she ended up, you know, falling in love with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, it wasn't an arranged?
Speaker 2: It wasn't arranged, no, it wasn't arranged.  I mean, there are some arranged marriages, you know, it still goes on, the arranged marriages, but in this case, I think, you know, he came after her.

Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their temperaments, their mentalities, their intelligence, the way they walk, the way they talk, the way they look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I am a blend, really.  I mean, there are certain aspects of my personality which I can relate to my mother's [Margaret Ferguson Graves], you know.  Most people look at me and say, "ah, you are, Margaret's son", I mean, there's a family resemblance.  And I think some of my ways are hers, too, because, I mean, I grew up with her.  From my father's [Herbert Francis Winful] side, I think--I also have some facial features which look like my father's.  But I think the greater influence was my mother's, since I really grew up with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your mother like?
Speaker 2: My mother was beautiful, she was very bright, smart, she loved to tell stories, to tell jokes, she loved to laugh a lot, but she was also a disciplinarian, you know.  She didn't put up with any nonsense.  And I remember--as a little boy, sometimes, I was a bit scared, you know, of being naughty.  In those days they didn't spare the whip, so, you know, mother would, you know, grab the whip, but she was a very warm engaging, you know, loving person.  She loved to cook, she loved to bake all kinds of pastries, cakes, pies, she also loved to knit, she loved to read, she was an enlightened woman, but, you know, kind and generous and warm, she was a special, special lady.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: My father was somewhat distant, and since I didn't really grow up with him, we didn't really, you know, bond.  So after the divorce, I would see my father, maybe at most, once a year, and even in those encounters, there wasn't much closeness.  He did seem somewhat distant, but he was a very smart man, you know, worldly, he had ideas about, you know, everything, about the world.  So, I remembered when we would go to visit, you know, with my sister and younger brother, he'd seat us at the dining table and, you know, almost lecture us, but I didn't feel a strong connection with him.  But visiting him was somewhat--it was kind of exciting because he lived in Accra [Ghana], the capital city, and we--you know, my mother had taken us Cape Coast [Ghana] after the divorce.  Cape Coast is a much smaller town, population about 60,000 in those days, and Accra is this bustling metropolis, so going to Accra was, you know, really special, you know, it was like going to New York [New York].  So part of the pleasure in going to see my dad was that fact that he lived in Accra.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that--was that arrangement like--well they were divorced, of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah, divorced.
Story_ID: 23103
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers and sisters for us, starting--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --With the oldest and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Put yourself in the chronology for us?
Speaker 2: My older sister, Marjorie, M-A-R-J-O-R-I-E, Marjorie, was born about a year and a half before me, and then I came along, and then my younger brother, Francis, he was born six years after me--five, five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  It happens that they're both, right now, living in Ann Arbor [Michigan], also, where the family sort of--kind of congregated here in the Midwest.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So, all in Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: All in Ann Arbor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23104
Speaker 1: Now, now, you were born in '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: '52 [1952].  December, '52 [1952], yeah.
Speaker 1: Five years before [Ghana's] independence began.  Were you old enough to remember--you were five?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was actually four and half, you know, because the celebration was the sixth of March.  And I actually do remember going to this big fireworks display; I remember, you know, fireworks lighting up the sky.  It was Independence Day celebration.  So I actually do remember that.  And then I remember those--some kind of a fair, and I remember riding on a ferris wheel with my mother and father.  That's about all I remember about Independence Day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you aware of Kwame Nkrumah?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah, I mean growing up, Kwame Nkrumah was, you know--he was the president, you know, of Ghana, and I remember when there would be like parades on Independence Day or Republic Day celebrations.  And there were times when Kwame Nkrumah would actually come to Cape Coast [Ghana].  There would be a parade and students would go march passed the--and salute the president.  So, yeah, I do remember Kwame Nkrumah; I remember him making speeches, I mean he was a great orator.  You'd be spellbound listening to Kwame Nkrumah speak, either, you know, in person, at the parade or on the radio.
Speaker 1: Here's a man who was the first president of an independent West African country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some say that Sudan got their independence in '56 [1956], but that's in East Africa, but I think, I know that of the countries that were under British, you know, colonial dominations, Ghana was the first?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what everybody says, that Ghana was the first African country to become independent, you know.  Even though, of course, you know, Liberia had, from the time it was set up, it was such a free country.
Speaker 1: Sierre Leone, too in quotes, you know, I mean, it's free in some ways--
Speaker 2: In some ways, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Some ways a little brother of the United States like Sierre Leone, a little brother.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --But--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Ghana, in terms of really throwing off the shackles of colonization, Ghana, I think was, you know, the leader.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it is in this atmosphere that you grew up.  Dr. Nkrumah was deposed in--when was it?
Speaker 2: Kwame Nkrumah was deposed, I believe, in 1964?
Speaker 1: I think that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was '64 [1964].  I was in high school then.  And, I must say, that there was actually joy.  I mean, because Kwame Nkrumah, when I was growing up, Kwame Nkrumah had been flirting with Communism and Socialism, and he had essentially established a cult of personality in which, you know, kids would be told, "yeah, Kwame Nkrumah never dies", "Kwame Nkrumah is the, oh, the god".
Speaker 1: Similar to Chairman Mao?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that.  And so, in those--I mean, Kwame Nkrumah did many great things for Ghana.  Let's not deny that, I mean he--you know, he was a force behind us.  I told you the Volta River project that, you know, produces power for most of the country.  He did great things in education, made sure that, you know, every child could have education, elementary school education, it was universal and free.  He did, you know, many great things; he led the charge for African unity.  By the same time though, you know, things he jailed his opponents without trial; threw them into preventive detention.  I remember growing up, though, you could not say any bad things about Kwame Nkrumah, because you never knew who might turn you in.  And so, yeah, near the end of his rule, he was becoming rather despotic, so I know my mother [Margaret Ferguson Graves] and my grandmother [Rosanna Bilson] and all the relatives were delighted when the coup happened.
Story_ID: 23105
Speaker 1: Do, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory.  Okay, I seem to remember being at, we called it a day nursery, and taking a nap, after lunch.  I have this distinct image, you know, I would take a nap in the day nursery.  And, yes, I also remember that Independence Day celebration.  That was when I was like four and a half, or a little less.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything about London [United Kingdom]?
Speaker 2: No, I have no memory of London.  I mean, I was three months old, actually, when my parents brought me back to Ghana, so I have no memory of London.  But, yeah, those two memories I mentioned being in the day nursery, I was maybe three and a half, maybe four, and then the Independence fireworks.
Story_ID: 23106
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe where you grew up for us, and tell us what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, Cape Coast, as the name implies, it's right on the coast, and so one of the major sights and smells and sounds, it all had to do with the ocean, because standing on the balcony of my house, one could actually see the ocean, one could see the coconut trees that line the beach, and at night, you fell asleep to the sound of the waves.  So the sound of the waves, the sight of the ocean and then sometimes we'd go down to the beach and fisherman pulling in their nets full of catch; so you could see and smell the fish.  So, much of my memories of growing up in Cape Coast [Ghana], the sea played a dominant role.  And then there was the slave castle, I mentioned, the Cape Coast Castle.  The Cape Coast Castle, in those days also housed the library, and so I'd often walk from my house to the castle to check out books and just play around the castle.  Then right at the foot near the--there's this long flight of steps that go up to my house, and at the bottom there's what we call a round-a-bout, and so there would be, you know, some traffic.  We don't really call it a whole lot of traffic, maybe a couple of cars every, you know, five minutes or so.  But it was just so much fun just to sit there and watch the cars come and turn around the round-a-bout.  And then, of course, there's was church, St. Francis Cathedral, which was about, no less than a mile from the house, and we'd walk to church on Sundays.  My elementary school, Catholic Jubilee School was just four hundred yards away from the house, so we'd walk to school.  These were the things that I--well, they're part of my growing up, you know, the sea, the castle, the church, the school.
Story_ID: 23107
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah.  No, I grew up in a Catholic home, and so, well, we went to church at least twice a week, the Sunday, everybody, you know.  You know, I lived in this home with extended family.  So there was my grandmother [Rosanna Bilson], my--a couple of aunts and a ton of cousins; it must have been, maybe, twenty people living in this big house, and you should see Sunday mornings, everybody rushing around, getting, you know, taking their bath, getting ready to go to church, putting on their great--best clothes, and we'd walk to church and then come home and feast on, what we called fufu, you know, fufu is this dough made of pounded, boiled cassava and plantain.  So fufu and Abenkwan which is peanut butter soup, you know, with chicken in it; so Sundays we tended to eat fufu.  Oh, I'm sorry, I meant Nkatenkwan--Nkatenwan, which is peanut butter soup; \ Abenkwan is palm nut soup. So Sundays were special, and then one day in the week, you know, so, another week day, you know, we also went to church, so twice.  My grandmother was, you know, very strong Catholic, and so she was always, you know, singing hymns and quoting from the bible and telling bible stories at home.  My mother [Margaret Ferguson Graves] was also very, very devout Catholic.  In fact there was a time when--when she was growing up, she said she had wanted to become a nun and then maybe, I don't know what happened, maybe my father [Herbert Francis Winful] came along or something, but she had wanted to become a nun.  And so she was also very, very devout.  She became like the president of the Society of The Sacred Heart of Jesus, you know, at our local church.  So yes, the church played a very important role, I mean and I enjoyed going to church, because I loved the Latin rites of the Catholic Church.  We'd be singing these Latin hymns and saying these Latin prayers that I did not understand a word of, but it all seemed so mysterious, and then the smell of the incense, you know, wafting through the cathedral.  It was really wonderful times, you know, going to church.  And then during the Lenten season, we would fast and go to church for the stations of the cross, and there'd be this incredible sadness, because the Lord was about to be, you know, crucified.  And even, you know, there was a time when I even considered becoming a priest.  So great was that influence of the church when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a duality in terms of religion, by in terms of being a Fante and also being a Catholic?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as Fantes, we have a--we have certain rights like, no, pouring libation, you know, essentially, no, speaking to the gods; and a god could be in a tree, he could be in a big rock, you know, and you pour libation, asking for our blessings; we do all that, by the same time, we'd also go to church.  We didn't see any, you know, contradiction in the two.
Speaker 1: I wondered, I mean, but I think a lot of people do that; I'm not just saying that the Fantes do it, but a lot of people have like, I mean they'll pray, then they'll have a lucky horse shoe, or something like that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And I don't know which one they believe in the most.  Sometime when they--if you ask them they probably would say their religion, but, you know, people have lots of--and Fante, I would think Fante is more developed than say just a superstition.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's more than superstition.  In fact, we hope we could call it a religion.  You know, gods that you can appeal to, that you can invoke; invoke the spirits of the dead, you know, it's very, very important.  Spirits of the dead; they are essentially with us, you could call on them for protection, for help, but none of that, you know, was, contradicted to our faith also in the Catholic religion.
Story_ID: 23108
Speaker 1: So you went to Catholic School, I take it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to Catholic school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school was Catholic Jubilee School, Catholic Jubilee School in Cape Coast [Ghana].
Speaker 1: Did they have a kindergarten?
Speaker 2: No.  It started from primary grade one--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And then up.
Speaker 1: Now, this school is run on British system of education, I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We have primary school, grades one through six, and then there's middle school, could be seven, eight, actually it went all the way to tenth, so six years of primary school, then if you stayed four years for middle school, you then--you are done, then you could go on for teacher training or whatever else you wanted to do.  Or in my time, after two years beyond primary school, so after a total of eight, I think, in primary--middle school then you go on to second grade school, high school.
Speaker 1: Now, does everybody go to high school?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, it was just very steep pyramid as far as the educational system is concerned, because after--
Speaker 1: How do you get those smaller number of people?
Speaker 2: --Yes, after middle school, there's those what called the common entrance examination, common entrance examination, which everybody took all over the country, and then if you did well, you'd go on to a high school, so, how many people were weeded out at that level.
Speaker 1: So if you didn't pass the common entrance examination, say in the tenth grade, you'd just--you'd find a job?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you'd find a job or--
Speaker 1: Or a trade or something that you'd get involved in?
Speaker 2: --Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So high school was about college preparedness?
Speaker 2: Yes, high school--well, but there too, now in high school, you--after a number of years, there's also this examination taken, you know, nationwide, actually, it was two out of West Africa, that examination was to determine who would go on to college.  In those days not too many people went to the university.  Yes, I went to Catholic Jubilee School, and then after that, went to secondary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was the name of your--did you go to Catholic Jubilee from middle school, too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm not sure if the--if the levels correspond directly with what we have in the [United] States, but let me see, if I remember correctly, I was at Catholic Jubilee School for maybe six or seven years.  Yeah, I skipped a couple of grades.  Then I remember one day my headmaster asked my mother to come for a conference.  He said, "Well, I think we should skip Herbert up a couple of grades."  My mother--initially, my mother said, "No, I think, you know, a couple of grades, that's too much."  She didn't want me to be either at the same level as my older sister or be above her, because that wouldn't do at home, you know, it wouldn't be good for it, because she was my older sister, can't be in the same grade.  But I think I ended up skipping one--one grade.  And then went on to St. Augustine's which was the high school--high to middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I think I was between eleven and twelve when I entered St. Augustine's.
Story_ID: 23109
Speaker 1: So, now, what were you interested in at school?  Were you-would we be able to go back in time and see you as a potential scientist and say, yes, Herbert is going to be a scientist?
Speaker 2: I do think so.  I do believe you could go back.  For some reason, I was very curious, you know, wanted to know how things worked; I would take things apart, and I also liked to build things.  I remember one of the best toys I got was called 'Meccano', where you actually, you know, construct things with other metal parts and screws and put all that together, and it might be an electric motor to run things.  I was in love with that toy.  I also was curious about plants, other living things.  I remember once I actually even put some watermelon seeds in hot water and boiled them to see if they would die.  So I boiled them and then I planted them, and to my amazement, they actually grew.  And not only did they grow, but they produced all the biggest watermelons that I had ever seen.  So, I was really shocked, but I did not pursue that further, but yeah, I was, I guess, a scientist in the making.
Speaker 1: Where did you get the idea for boiling the watermelon seeds, was it something that just occurred to you?
Speaker 2: I think, you know, in school we had, you know, studied germination, something like that, and for some reason, I just wondered, you know, "if I boiled these seeds, would they die or would they still germinate?"  So, it's possible that I didn't boil them long enough to kill them, maybe what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. (laughing)  But these seeds actually did rather well.  So I was curious.  And then I remember once I built a little radio out of kit.  My mother and uncle had bought me this kit, and I had assembled it and there were sounds coming out of it, and I know my aunts were so amazed that the little boy could put together a radio, so right away, they started calling me engineer, say, "oh, engineer, engineer."  So I kind of always was interested in things, how they worked, liked to build things, take things apart, like to read about how things worked.
Story_ID: 23110
Speaker 1: Now, was there a culture in Ghana of salvaging parts of things, because I know a lot of countries in Africa and Latin America and then the Caribbean, it's been like in Cuba, drives all old cars, can't get new cars; they salvage everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, yeah, in Ghana too.  There's some really very, very skillful mechanics who can, you know, build you anything, you know, they can get old parts from anywhere and then create a fine working car for you.
Speaker 1: I wonder if it's kind--over here we have like a lot of engineers, but there's also a cultured waste where a lot of things are just cast aside.
Speaker 2: No, they salvage everything and recycle these things.
Speaker 1: I would just imagine that that would be just on an everyday level a wonderful workshop for learning how things work.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, even though I was not really--I wasn't part of that like network, but just at home, you know, I would take things apart, you know, toys that I'm given, I would take them apart to see how they worked.  And I was really just driven by the curiosity I had as a boy.
Story_ID: 23111
Speaker 1: I was, I was actually a very good student.  From the earliest times I can remember from the first grade onwards, I seemed to be always like at the top of the class.  I did well in math, in English, in pretty much every--every subject.  I thought--I thought it was just, you know, normal, you know, people who, you know, who studied and you did well.  So I didn't know whether it was hereditary or what.  Now, my mother [Margaret Ferguson Graves] also encouraged, you know, learning, and as a school teacher, she would come home in the evenings and after dinner, we'd all sit around the table, after she cleared off the plates and she would get to work, like, you know, grading her students' papers, and we would sit there doing our homework.  So we all sat there and worked.  And that was just a habit, you know, getting things done, reading and studying, doing your homework.
Speaker 2: Now, was it a, was it a--you were fully aware that your father was an engineer?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah--
Speaker 2: Did this give you--encourage you to--because very few people can point to that, you know.
Speaker 1: Yes, and in fact, my father, I think, once or twice, took me to the worksite of the Volta River Project during the construction.  So I saw the dam while it was being built, I saw the huge man-made lake formed after they had dammed the Volta River.  He actually took me--we walked down one of these huge pan stalks that, you know, bring the water down to turn the other turbines, the generator.  It was the most amazing thing.  I said, "Wow, so this is what engineers do," you know, and I think that also really fed into my--my early interest in engineering and in science, oh yeah, and also an important influence.  And then I had an uncle, too.  We called him Uncle Principal, a brother of my mother.  He was a principal of teacher's training school.  And I remember he gave me once a book called '101 Experiments You Can Do At Home.'  I think I was about maybe 10 years old or so, and that book became my favorite book, you know, I proceeded to do all these experiments in the kitchen, making things that might, you know, explode.  Those were the fun parts, the things that blew up.  But yeah, it was really so much fun.
Speaker 2: So, you had like two, you know, sort of role models, two men you knew were into science, and some of the women. You had your father being an engineer of this huge project.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23112
Speaker 1: Is there an Akan name for the Volta River.
Speaker 2: All I know is the Volta River, I mean that is named--actually, it is on the eastern part of the country, and that part is inhabited, like there are the airwaves, you know.  So it's like the Volta region is inhabited likely by the Ewe tribe.
Speaker 1: I mean, the country now is called--it used to be Upper Volta?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's Upper Volta.
Speaker 1: What's it called now?
Speaker 2: It's Burkina Faso--Burkina Faso.  Yeah, so the Volta River runs down from Burkina Faso down to the coast in Ghana.  I don't know there's some other name for it.
Speaker 1: I'd thought I'd ask.  It always seems funny when I hear that kind of name you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah. (laughing)  What is it doing here? Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some rivers and features do have, you know, the indigenous African names.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Volta or Volta River is clearly different.
Story_ID: 23113
Speaker 1: So you had no trouble with your exams?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it seemed that, you know, things came fairly--I mean I worked, but I didn't have any trouble, you know, in school at all.
Speaker 1: Now were there mentors in school that you could point to that were really good at helping to develop your talent?
Speaker 2: Well, in elementary school, the headmaster, Mr. Robert Mensor, you know, the one who asked my mother for permission to have me skipped a couple of grades, I think he did recognize there was some talent, and he did--he took an interest in me and he then ask me to work as a--to tutor other students who were having trouble.  I also remember in the early '60s (1960s), you know, remember the first woman to go to space, Valentina Tereshkova, the Russian woman?  After her flight she was sent to several countries by the Soviet Union, I guess, to show off the great accomplishment, and she came to Ghana. Not only did she come to Ghana, she came to Cape Coast and to my elementary school, Catholic Jubilee School.  And so the headmaster asked me to present Valentina Tereshkova with a bouquet of flowers.  And boy, can you imagine that little boy in Ghana meeting the first woman to go to space.
Speaker 1: This was at Catholic Jubilee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Catholic Jubilee School.  Yeah, that was (laughing) one of my greatest memories of those days.
Story_ID: 23114
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: The high school, we called it St. Augustine's College, even though it was a high school, but I guess when it was first founded, that was the furthest one could go in terms of schooling, so--at least on the Gold Coast [Ghana]. So it's called St. Augustine's College.  It's also a parochial school; it was a boarding school, as most of the parochial schools in Ghana.
Speaker 1: So, did you live on the school--
Speaker 2: Yes, I lived on the campus in a dorm.
Speaker 1: --So was it in Cape Coast [Ghana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in Cape Coast, in fact, right across the street from the ocean; I mean it's spectacular, you know.  So then there's this road, the road from Cape Coast to Elmina and then right across the road was the ocean.
Speaker 1: Was it close to your family home?
Speaker 2: It was a couple of miles, yeah, two maybe three miles or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was within walking distance?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, and even though we lived on campus, three times a semester, you could go visit your family, you could go home. And so you signed what you called an exiet, permission to leave.  So sometimes I would walk to the home.
Speaker 1: From what you described, you could just walk right down the coast?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you could walk along the beach.  Yeah, so, yes, St. Augustine's was an all boys' school.  We had teachers--we had some Peace Corps teachers, we had teachers who were part of the Brothers of the Holy Cross, an American order of religious folk, and we had some Ghanaian teachers.
Story_ID: 23115
Speaker 1: Now, were you, were you at St. Augustine's [High School, Cape Coast, Ghana] when the--when the [president Kwame] Nkrumah regime--
Speaker 2: When the coup happened, yes.
Speaker 1: --Yes, when the coup happened?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was at St. Augustine's, yeah, when the coup happened.
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything--any stories about that time that you remember, or did things disrupt in any way or did they stay about the same?
Speaker 2: Well, I remembered when it happened, like nobody had any interest in going to class, you know, for a day or two, you know.  We heard stories about some shootings going on in places.  But, you know, Cape Coast [Ghana] being some distance away from Accra [Ghana], the capital city, we didn't really experience any--any violence, but we would see, you know, trucks pull up, soldiers passing through, you know, going to other towns further down the coast.  But in terms of disruptions in our lives, you know, there was really no disruption.  We saw the coup leaders giving their speeches, heard them on the radio talking about, you know, what led to the overthrow and that, you know, everyone should keep calm, everything was under control, formed the National Liberation Council, and they were asking several people who served in the previous government to report for their own safety.  So many of them were rounded up and put in prison.  But as far as the effect on our daily lives, it was, you know, negligible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of course, now we're free to say what we wanted.  I know because I told you that people of my mother's [Margaret Ferguson Graves] generation were afraid to say anything bad about Kwame Nkrumah, so this sort of hush-hush thing, but after the coup, we could pretty much say whatever you wanted.
Speaker 1: And did that lasted long right after the coup?
Speaker 2: Well, after the coup, it did last, but then there was another coup.  I think it was a series of coups.  But Ghana went through a period of instability, you know, punctuated by periods where they had brief periods of democratic rule, you know they--one of the coup folks, they handed over to popular elected government, led by [Kofi] Busia, who was then also overthrown after just a year and a half or two years, so it was a period of great turmoil.
Story_ID: 23116
Speaker 1: So you were at St. Augustine's High School [Cape Coast, Ghana]?
Speaker 2: That's right, from middle to high, covered middle to high.
Speaker 1: So, now, did you have calculus in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, in my--you know, in that school we had, you know, first five years of study, and then it takes you to what was called the "O" levels or ordinary level examination, which is under the British system, and then two more years and then you take the advance level examination.  I had calculus, I started calculus in my, I think was the fifth year, so just before the "O" levels, fourth or fifth year, yeah, in St. Augustine's.  I started studying calculus, learning about differentiation and integration.
Speaker 1: How old were you when this took place?
Speaker 2: How old was I?  I'd say maybe fifteen, yeah, about fifteen, fourteen, fifteen years old.
Speaker 1: A couple of years younger than most people studying calculus here--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --In normal school situations.
Speaker 2: Well, in the educational system then, there were a couple of different tracks.  I was following the track that would lead to specialization in science in preparation for careers like engineering.  And so in addition to taking the regular math, we also took what's called "ad-math", the additional mathematics, and that additional mathematics was--that got you into calculus, at least the first part of calculus, and then after your ordinary level of exams where you entered what we called the sixth form, then you get into more calculus; by that time, you're sixteen or seventeen.
Story_ID: 23117
Speaker 1: Do you know enough about the American education system to compare or contrast it with the British system, because you were in the British system?  There's so much discussion out about STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics] education and Americans are falling behind.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think that the education that I had in Ghana, at St. Augustine's [High School, Cape Coast, Ghana] was just superb, because when I came to the [United] States, I realized I could have skipped at least the entire first year and maybe even parts of the second year, because--
Speaker 1: You're talking about first and second years at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Well, my first year was actually at Lehigh University [Bethlehem, Pennsylvania], but, you know, it wouldn't have matter whether I was at MIT or any other university in the U.S., because after the sixth form in the British system, you pretty much covered the first--I think the first year and a half of an American university education.  So, yeah, the education, now the system in those days in Ghana was really, you know, top notch, at least for those who ended up going to the better secondary schools, and going to the "O" levels and "A" levels, because you ended up with a very strong mathematics foundation, you ended up with a very good background in the sciences, at least, if that was the area you wanted to go into.  In fact, in my first year, in this country, they were using the same books that I had used in high school, in chemistry, in calculus.  Yeah, I really should have advanced placed through the whole first year, but I thought no, I wanted to, you know, get used to the system here, have a gentle introduction to American life.
Speaker 1: So you were kind of glad school days were kind of easy on you.
Story_ID: 23118
Speaker 1: Was there anything truly significant about graduation from St. Augustine's [High School, Cape Coast, Ghana]?  Was there a big celebration around graduation?
Speaker 2: Well, there were really two graduations.  First after five years, we finished the fifth form, you take the "O" level exams, which is taken all over West Africa, and, you know, I presented in eight subjects, ranging from physics to French.  And I remember that year, I got the top score in all of Ghana, at least, and there was another of my--there was classmate of mine who was my competitor, yeah, so we shared the top honors.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Maurice Brunner, Morris Brunner.  He's now a civil engineer.
Speaker 1: Now, is he a Fante too?
Speaker 2: Maurice was of mixed parentage.  I think his father was Swiss and I believe his mum is an Ashanti, yeah, Ashanti.  So Morris Brunner and I competed for the top prizes at St. Augustine's throughout our stay there.  He's also ended up as a professor, but in Switzerland.  And so at the fifth form, you know, we really--we set a record in terms of the scores on the exams.  And the examination counselor hadn't seen results that high ever, so I consent people to come to Augustine to find out whether they had been cheating, so then after that then those--so there was mini graduation of fifth form and then you entered sixth form for the "A" levels, advance levels.  So then after two years in sixth form then there's a final graduation then one could go on to the university.
Story_ID: 23119
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you graduated in '72 (1972), right?
Speaker 2: No, actually, '71 (1971).  I finished St. Augustine's [High School] in 1971.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how it was determined you were going to go to American to study at Lehigh?
Speaker 2: Well, I had always wanted to go abroad.  Now, initially, I had been thinking I'd go to Britain, because most of my relatives, those who went abroad, ended up going Britain because of the colonial connection.  But when I was getting ready to graduate there at--I did some research, I found that there weren't--it wasn't easy to get scholarships to go to England [United Kingdom].  I went to the little library in my hometown, and I researched various universities, and I found that there were a number of American universities who would give scholarships to foreign students.  So I set about applying.  I took the SAT's.  For the SAT's I had to go to Accra [Ghana] in order to take the SAT.  Accra is about one hundred miles away from Cape Coast [Ghana].  The SAT's, applied to a number of universities in the U.S.  And then I had found in these books that I borrowed from the library, and they all accepted me; got offers from Columbia University [New York, New York], University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Lehigh University [Bethlehem, Pennsylvania].  Now, I did not apply to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at the time because I had thought that at MIT, all that people did was study all the time.  That was the reputation that they had, and I didn't want to be like that.  I wanted to have a broader experience in the United States.  I didn't want to end up cloistered and just do nothing but study.  But it turned out that was, you know, that was a false impression.  But, so, I ended up, you know, accepting the offer from Lehigh University, because they also arranged for me to--they essentially covered my airfare also, because there's no way that my mother could have paid for it.
Story_ID: 23120
Speaker 1: While I was in--at St. Augustine's [High School, Cape Coast, Ghana] I had also--I had kept up my interest in engineering and things, and one of the people who really helped nurture that interest was another student.  His name was John Harley.  John Harley, he was very much into electronics and he--his parents, I think, were quite well to do, and so they would import these heath kits. There was this company called Heath Kits that made the kits, electronic kits, from which you could build radios, TVs, all kinds of electronics.  And so John Harley had turned his dorm into pretty much an electronic studio, and so I would go and hang out with him and, you know, he would show me some things.  He also built his own electric guitars, starting from, you know, essentially carving the body--the solid body of the guitar, the neck, and he'd make his own electronic pickups and then string the guitars, and you know, it's amazing, Holly, so I hung around him.  And even, I learned to play the guitar a little bit and became part of a rock group, actually, when I was at Augustine's.
Speaker 2: Now, this is the age of Jimmy Hindrix?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, Jimmy Hindrix, the Beatles, Beatles.  You know, we started out, you know, trying to copy Beatles and then we later got into like soul music, James Brown, Wilson Pickett.
Speaker 2: Did you have a musical hero in particular in those days?
Speaker 1: Well, in those days, Wilson Pickett, I think, was really my hero, then of course James Brown and I also liked the Rolling Stones.
Speaker 2: So you knew how to make an electric guitar at that point?
Speaker 1: Well, certainly, I had watched John Harley make them, and I helped him out with making some of the guitars.  Yeah, so it was--those were fun times.  And we used to have these rock, you know, band contests.  We called them park chain, bands from different high schools would compete against each other, and we got a prize.
Speaker 2: I imagine too is I don't think a lot of African Americans or anybody else watching--imagined like rock bands in Ghana.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I mean, every high school worth its salt aspired to have a rock band.  There was a time when my school, St. Augustine's, had a band called the Flames, the famous Flames, you know, after James Brown, and they became like the top high school band in Ghana.  We were playing all over, you know, going into Accra to perform.  We'd have school dances, and if you knew the Flames were playing, you knew you were going to have a good time.
Story_ID: 23121
Speaker 1: Were you very much influenced by television and the radio and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, television was still kind of new in Ghana.  At St. Augustine's [High School, Cape Coast, Ghana], I think, there was maybe one TV and that TV was in the assembly hall, and on some weekend nights, we would gather to assembly in there and watch this TV sitting on the big stand on the stage and we'd watch, oh, I remembered we watched Muhammad Ali fighting.  Those were some really amazing evenings, to go and watch Cassius Clay fight Sonny Liston.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's 1964 era.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right there.  So, we had TV, but it wasn't like you watch TV every day; there's this one TV on campus, and you got to watch it maybe twice or week or so.  We listened to a lot of radio, things like 'No Voice For America.'  We listened to a lot of music, 'Voice of America.'  So we were familiar with, you know, the soul movement in the U.S.  Otis Redding was another big favorite of mine.  I remembered when he died, and that plane crashed, we were all so crushed, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, when you graduated, this is '71 (1971)?
Speaker 2: '71 (1971) I graduated, yeah, from high school.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any trepidation about coming to the United States, or were you just excited?
Speaker 2: I was very excited, because I really wanted to get away, I wanted to go away.  I wanted to expand my horizons.  I had read so much about America.  We were, you know, fascinated.  We were actually quite fascinated by, you know, black America, the Civil Rights Movement, the music, just the energy, you know, the styles, the afros.  People were, in Ghana, trying to look like, you know, black Americans.
Speaker 1: Did you get--were their issues of Ebony magazine, Jet, that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, we had access to Ebony, Jet, yeah, so we were keeping up with what was happening in the black community.
Speaker 1: So did any of those Burly Black movies get to Ghana?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall any of them.  I don't think I saw one until I came to the States in 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so 1971, Lehigh in the fall, Lehigh University, Bethlehem Pennsylvania--
Speaker 2: Bethlehem Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: --Now what was your first impression of Bethlehem?
Speaker 2: Well, okay, you know, in Ghana, I had this image of the U.S. has nothing but, you know, sky scrapers everywhere, you know, like New York, you know.  And so my plane lands in New York [New York] at JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport], and I was to take the Greyhound bus to Bethlehem, and here I'm on the bus, I go along.  Okay, initially you see some tall buildings in New York, and then that scene, you know, like farmland is that scene, empty spaces.  So that was the first misconception that got shot down that, you know, all the U.S. is nothing but skyscrapers.  And then I was also impressed by the size of the cars, you know, the really big long cars.  And then I got into Bethlehem and actually my heart sank a little bit because it was--Bethlehem was not a big city, I think the population was about sixty thousand or so, which was, about the same size as my home town, Cape Coast [Ghana].  So it didn't have the excitement that I had, you know, imagined.  It certainly wasn't like New York.  So my first impression was a bit of a downer, you know.  I had a host family that I stayed with for a few days, and my first evening there they served dinner, and the dinner was huge steak on a plate.  I wondered, is this whole thing--is all this for me.  Because at home, in Ghana, if you're going to eat meat, you know, you get a small bits of meat, you know, in a soup, but have this huge slab of beef. (laughing)  So that was a shock.  I said "Wow this I have to eat."  And then at the end there was ice cream, again, a big bowl of ice cream.  "Is that all for me?"  "Yeah, yeah, it's for you."  Back in Ghana ice cream, you get a small bit.  So the impression I got was "Wow, people here eat a lot of meat and a lot of ice cream."  And Bethlehem, and so, you know, it's a steel town, and it--it just wasn't--I wasn't terribly excited to be there.  My host family did take me on a trip to upstate New York.  We went up to Niagara Falls and that was pretty exciting just to see the majesty of these falls, and then we went to the Corning Museum [of Glass, Corning] in upstate New York.  They took me camping, something I hadn't done before.  A nice introduction to--to America my first couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was this a Catholic family?
Speaker 2: Was this?
Speaker 1: A Catholic family?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I'm sure they're Protestant.  I think, you know, they did take me to a church a couple of times there--while I was there, but they are not Catholic.
Story_ID: 23122
Speaker 1: So you said the instructions--I mean the level of instructions that we have is fairly easy.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yeah, Lehigh [University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania], I took the basic, you know, physics and chemistry and calculus and what else, oh, I got my first exposure to computers.  Yeah, in those days, we used, you know, these punch cards.  So you sit there and you type up your program and you get a stack of cards and then you take it to the computer center, and they run your program.  And invariably they'll be some mistake, they'll be a bug or something like that.  And you say, oh my god, you've wasted all this time, you know, typing, then you come back and retype, re-punch your cards.  It was fun, I felt like I was getting exposed to really new things.  Those were the only really new things because the physics, the math, the chemistry was essentially review.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, these computer programs that were Fortran and Cobol--
Speaker 2: Fortran, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --Was it Fortran that you learned?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I learned Fortran.  In those days we still used slide rules.  As a freshman I asked one of my professors, "What kind of slide rule should I buy?"  And he recommended the fancy one; it's called the log-log decitrig, log-log decitrig.  So I bought my fancy log-log decitrig slide rule, and I thought "gee, yeah, now I'm really an engineer."  And then, of course, several months later, I think, TI [Texas Instruments] came out with a hand-held calculator, and right away the slide rule met its demise.  I think I still have that slide rule, it's a museum piece, now.
Speaker 1: People used them up through the '70s (1970's), you kept seeing them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, but that was the--what I was using in my first semester at Lehigh.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any other African students there?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, there were a couple African students.  One was a, I think, a graduate student, no, undergrad, yeah, his name was John Yameogo, he was the son of the president of, was it Mali, president Yameogo.  But anyway, he came from a presidential stock, and I remember a couple of other Africans, Godfrey Yenwo, from Cameroon, I think, he's right now head of some energy and oil thing in the Cameroon, Barbeyfee(sp).  So there were three Africans that I met there, and there were--and I had--there were a number of African Americans, not many, but we all kind of hung together.  My dorm mate was African American and we, you know, it was a tight-knit community.
Speaker 1: Was there a black student union by that time at Lehigh?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure there was a black student union at Lehigh.  I know there was one at MIT when I transferred there, but I don't remember for sure if it was a black student union.  But the black students did get together and do things.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to see Wilson Pickett?
Speaker 2: I saw James Brown.  You know, my first semester.  Yeah, my first semester there, I had a--when I was in Ghana, I had a pen pal, who was African American and lived in Brooklyn, and you know, when I came to the [United] States, she invited me to come visit her family. And so I went.   And we went to see James Brown, went to see the Delfonics and just seeing James Brown perform just blew my mind, you know, doing his "Please, Please, Please", getting down on the floor, would bring the cloak around him, tossing down the microphone, pick it back up, doing his dance.  (Laughing)  Yeah, that was really, really great, great experience seeing James Brown.
Story_ID: 23123
Speaker 1: So you were at Lehigh [University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania] for--
Speaker 2: For one year.
Speaker 1: --Were there any special teachers or mentors at Lehigh that you, even though the work was easy, was there anyone there that inspried you?
Speaker 2: I had my math professor, let me see, I think his last name was [Walter] Stangl, Stangl.  I can't remember his first name.  But when I first started I had signed up for the regular, you know, calculus stream, but then it was a bit too easy, so I switched to the more, sort of an advance or honors calculus class, and Stangl was the guy in charge.  And he noticed me, and he would sometimes give me like, you know, special problems to work on.  In fact, when I told him I was transferring to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he was kind of sad, because he felt I could stay at Lehigh, and you know, there were opportunities to do, you know, research to get advanced courses and then he even said, "You could double major in electrical engineering and engineer physics", you know, you have this opportunity.  So, you know, he did try to get me to stay.  He was a very good professor.  I enjoyed his lectures very much.
Story_ID: 23124
Speaker 1: You, you, you come to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], is it '72 [1972] or '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: '72 [1972].  Yeah, yeah.  While I was at Lehigh [University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania], I think, one weekend I went to visit some friends, some Ghanaian friends, who happened to be at MIT, and while I was there, I realized, "oh, so, they don't need to study all the time." And some of them encouraged me to, you know, to transfer, so I did, I applied, and there, they gave me a scholarship.  So, I came to MIT in the fall of '72 [1972], and started right away, took my first electrical-no, real electrical engineering course, which was circuits.  MIT was an exciting place, you know, you could feel the energy the, you know, when you were there.
Speaker 1: Now, were you challenged by the level of activity at MIT?
Speaker 2: Well, I had to work harder now, yeah, because, well, certainly, I was taking more advanced courses, you know, it's harder, but it wasn't--it certainly wasn't impossible.  I continued to do well, and I got exposed to some really amazing professors.  I remember my first semester--at MIT every undergrad is assigned a mentor, an advisor, you would call.  So, you get some choice in who your advisor is going to be.  So, I was handed a list of people, and at the time, I knew I was interested in lasers, because the laser was still quite young, and I had read about lasers, and thought, wow these amazing, amazing devices.  You know, I had even dreams of someday creating an X-ray laser.  So, when I looked through the list of faculty, I had looked for those who were working in the laser field, so I settled upon Professor Herman Haus, H-A-U-S, Herman Haus.  He was really, really a truly great, great scientist and engineer.  I think he was Austrian, but I took him to be my advisor, so he was the one would approve my list of courses I was going to take each semester, and I got to know him quite well. He became my real mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you worked on lasers at MIT?  What was the dream about the X-ray lasers, what did you hope to accomplish with X-ray lasers?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that lasers existed in--at certain wave lengths, you know, you could have visible lasers like, helium-neon laser that puts out red light, there are carbon dioxide lasers, you know, CO2 lasers that put out light in the infrared, and you know, there's this whole electromagnetic spectrum, you go from infrared down to blue, violet, and then ultra violet as good shorter and shorter wave length.  I was thinking, "Wow, wouldn't it be nice if one could make a laser in the X-ray regime", you know, extremely short wave length, and it could have a coherent sort of X-ray you could see through things, it could see through people, through buildings, but you have a very coherent beam.  Though, I just thought it would be an interesting challenge, you know, to actually make an X-ray laser.  I didn't think too much about the applications, but just being able to say, "Hey, we have an X-ray laser."  I've no idea how difficult it actually is to make X-ray lasers.  And, so, Herman Haus became my mentor.  I asked him, "Can I work in your lab?"  And he said, "Well, after you take my course."  So, I took his course and then he allowed me to work in his lab.  So that was my first exposure to lasers.  I got to work on the carbon dioxide laser.
Story_ID: 23125
Speaker 1: Now, did you know a Shirley Jackson [first African American woman to receive a doctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts, in nuclear physics]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, Shirley Jackson.
Speaker 1: Dr. Shirley Jackson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Shirley Jackson was a student at the same time.  I don't remember if she was an undergrad then or whether she was a grad student.  But, yeah, Shirley Jackson was, you know, quite a force on campus.  I also knew, let's see, it's this high energy physicist, whose name just escape me, but there was quite a community of African American scientists, physicists, engineers at MIT.  There was a black student union, there was a black student lounge.  We'd gather there, so, I actually worked as a tutor, I was part of the tutoring staff in the BSU, and so we tutored other students, and my second summer at MIT, I also worked in what was called Project Interface, which was designed for entering freshman of color to kind of get them ready for the rigors of MIT academic life, and so we're teaching things like calculus and physics during the summer to entering students.  So there was, you know, a vibrant black community at MIT, and we pretty much all knew each other.
Story_ID: 23126
Speaker 1: You went straight through till you got your bachelor's degree at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then straight through to your master's and through your PhD, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I did get my bachelor's at MIT, I majored in electrical engineering.  I did a bachelor's thesis with Professor Kong, Jin Au, Jin Au Kong in electromagnetics, then went on to graduate school at the University of Southern California [USC, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what made you move on to California?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was a junior at MIT, I had spent a summer at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] as part of a National Science Foundation program called Research Experiences for Undergrads.  So, as a junior, I had seen an announcement on a notice board at MIT about this program, so I just applied, and I ended up at Yale during the summer, doing research, and that's when--where I got exposed to my specialty which really called nonlinear optics, nonlinear optics, which is the study of--well the interaction of really, really, intense laser light with matter, and the interesting phenomena that can occur under those conditions.  So, I worked with Professor Richard Chang.  I did experiments in nonlinear optics, and while doing those experiments, I read the literature on the subject, and I found that many of the big names in nonlinear optics were at the University of Southern California, people like Robert Hellwarth, he invented something called the Q-switch, which is used in lasers to create very high-peak power laser.  He also discovered a phenomenon called the Stimulated Raman Effect.  So, Hellwarth was at USC and so was John Marburger.  Marburger eventually became the second President Bush's science advisor.  In fact, he passed away just about a year ago.  There were people like Elsa Garmire, Bill Luesse (ph.). So all of these names that kept coming up while I was doing my research at Yale that were at USC, so, that's when I first started thinking, maybe that would be a good place to go for graduate study and also it was warmer than, you know, at MIT.  After four years on the east coast, I wanted a change in temperature.
Speaker 1: Now, during this period of time, did you go back to Ghana, at all?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't go to Ghana at all.  I had become almost an exile, because when I was an undergrad, I just didn't have the money.  You know, it's very expensive to fly to Ghana, so that was my primary excuse for not going back.  I also had this fear, perhaps not a rational fear, that I might go home and not be able to come back, because you remember, there was a fair amount of turmoil and all these coups going on in Ghana, and there was always the possibility that I'd go there and get stuck, so I stayed.
Speaker 1: So, you wanted to at least stay until you finished your education?
Speaker 2: Until I finished my education, yeah.
Story_ID: 23127
Speaker 1: USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] in 19--
Speaker 2: 1975.  Yeah, I graduated from--
Speaker 1: '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: --From MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1975, and then went to USC.  They also gave me a fellowship, paid my way there.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: My dissertation.  The title was 'Optical Bistability in Nonlinear Periodic Structures,' I think that was the title, something like that. And the idea for the dissertation, something that came to me one day in the shower, literally, I had an idea for this device which could act like an optical transistor, all optical switch, so it was a bistable optical device created in a periodic structure.  I can explain it more, if you wish, but that idea that I had for studying nonlinear phenomenon in periodic structures, it actually started a field, you know, a field within laser optics--within nonlinear optics, the field of study of nonlinear, optical phenomenal in periodic structures, so, that was my dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was theoretical, theoretical dissertation, because I didn't do any--
Speaker 1: Let me ask, the notes we have that you solved a problem, an optical problem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that came later.
Speaker 1: Okay, that came later, okay.
Speaker 2: But.  So, when I first started out at USC, I was--I explored several different areas, I worked with several different professors before I finally settled with one, and actually started out doing some experiments, but I realized I didn't care that much for experiments, so I decided to do theory.  And then I had this idea, and I mentioned the idea to Professor Marburger, and he told me, you know, this is the best new idea I heard in the field in years.  So that really encouraged me and stimulated me to--to work on it, and carry out the calculations that led to the final result which we published and then eventually it became my dissertation.
Story_ID: 23128
Speaker 1: You know, a periodic structure, you know, this is something that repeats itself.  And so you can imagine stacking up layers of say glass and glass plates, and let's say one glass plate has a certain refracted index; refracted index tells you how light bends or how light gets slowed down in the medium; let's say you have one medium, one glass plate with a set of refracted index "A", another one with a refracted index "B", so you stack them alternately, AB, AB, AB, so you have, you know, a periodic stack.  It turns out that such a periodic structure has interest in properties in the sense that it acts as a filter so that certain--only certain wave lengths will pass through, only certain colors will go through, and the rest will get reflected.  So, it has, what we would call "a stop band," it stops, let's say, a red light from going through, but other colors can go through.  Now, when you see butterflies in lovely iridescent colors, those--those colorations arise from tiny periodic structures that are organized in the wings and they reflect different colors.  So, the idea I had was, what if light--you send in light that's intense enough to change the refracted index of those periodic structure.  Well, then, if the light is strong enough, it can tune the stop band, it can tune the colors that can pass through and those that can reject it.  So, if I had low intensity, if I had lower intensity light, that red light would get through, as I increase the intensity, it gets to a point where that red light can no longer get through; it all gets reflected.  So, it would have an intensity dependent refracted index, and that can lead to various interesting applications like all optical switching and use as a digital optical computant element, so that was the start of the field of study, and that's something I did while I was a graduate student.  Now, the other one that you mentioned, having to do with the speed of light, that relates to a phenomenon called tunneling, tunneling through a barrier, and that's work that I did more recently, yeah, in Michigan.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, we can maybe wait until we get to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With your dissertation, you finished in 19--
Speaker 1: 1981, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --'81 [1981], okay.
Story_ID: 23129
Speaker 1: Your degree is in electrical engineering, and you--did you go do a post-doctoral, I mean--?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't do a post doc right after my PhD.  In fact, the ink wasn't dry on my thesis when I got a job at a company called GTE, it was GTE Labs, it was a telecom company.  It was also involved in other things like lighting, you know they make the Sylvania light bulbs.  But GTE Labs was heavily into optical communications, the fiber optics.  I got the job there because I had given a talk, based on this dissertation research, at a conference in Boston [Massachusetts], and in the audience happened to be the manager of a research group at GTE Labs, and they were looking for a theorist to help get some research off the ground, you know, in the fundamental research lab.  So he contacted my advisor, I said, "Oh, you know, they would like to make me an offer."  So I ended up going to GTE Labs, which was in Waltham, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, and that's where I got my start in industry.  So, I didn't do a post doc.  Right after my PhD, I went to GTE Labs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, at GTE, your research focused on laser, physics and nonlinear optics, just as it did in grad school?
Speaker 2: That's right, and I expanded a bit into fibers, optical fibers, so, fiber optic research, I worked on semiconductor lasers, I also was able to supervise a couple of students; there were a couple of graduate students at local universities, who would come and spend summer, and I would work with them, supervise them, and we actually ended up publishing a couple of papers, with those students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were at GTE until 1987, is that right or '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I left GTE at the end of '86 [1986].  You know, I had enjoyed my work at GTE Labs very much, it was almost like an academic environment where you are encouraged to publish, you could do fairly fundamental research; it didn't have to be tied to a product, all you needed to do to justify it was, "well this could be useful for communications in about twenty years".  And so, you could go off and do your work.
Speaker 1: Was GTE patterned after Bell Labs?
Speaker 2: It was very much like Bell Labs, yes, very much like Bell Labs, so you--at least in the group that I was, which was called the Fundamental Research Lab.  There were other parts of the lab that did more applied work, more near-term research, but in my group, it was all long-range research.  It wasn't a very big group, but I think it was really very active and productive group, in nonlinear optics.
Story_ID: 23130
Speaker 1: All right, so, in '87 [1987], you went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] here and you've been here ever since?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did that hookup take place?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in the back of my mind, I'd always thought it would be nice to be a professor.  But when I was finishing grad school, I thought I didn't know enough to become a professor, to supervise graduate students, to get my own grants, to teach, to do all those things that a professor is called upon to do.  So I decided to go into industry first.  Now, after six years at GTE, things had started to change somewhat.  I think the company was cutting back on fundamental research; they were letting people go, they had started, you know, shrinking staff, so I kind of saw the writing on the wall.  And it also coincided with my kind of desire to begin exploring, yeah, universities.  But even before that happened, I contacted by a professor from Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], asking me if I would, you know, like to come and teach there.  So, I--they flew me over, I decided no, I'd rather just continue at GTE Lab, and then a little later when I saw that people were really being let go from the labs, I seriously started looking.  And so I applied to a few universities and University of Michigan was one of those places that was, at the time, really making a strong push in optics, so they were hiring, trying to hire a bunch of people in the field.  So I applied, they took me.  And not only did they hire me, they gave me tenure right away, so I didn't have to come in, you know, fight for tenure.
Speaker 1: But it just sounds like you were a very popular choice.  I mean, when you--you seemed to be like a leading graduate student, you know, in optics in those days, I guess, to be offered tenure right away from a school like the University of Michigan, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I had worked the industry for six years, you know, I had published quite a bit, you know, some pretty good papers.  And so I had a bit of a reputation, and at the time I was applying, you know, I got several offers and it became some kind of competitive situation.  I also seriously considered accepting an offer the University of Rochester [Rochester, New York].  Actually, it was a very tough choice, because the University of Rochester had this optical--the instrument of optics, yes.  So they had already a very well established optician in optics.  Whereas [University of] Michigan, at least, at that time, didn't have quite as strong an optics group, but I knew that they were investing heavily in modern optics.
Speaker 1: Now, were you brought in, basically, to lead the effort?
Speaker 2: Well, I was brought in as one of the, you know, faculty that they were hiring, because suddenly at universities--every professor is their own kingdom.  So, I came in, I knew that there were going to be other faculty hired in optics, and so at least we could, you know, there would be possibilities for collaboration and so, yeah, eventually, I decided I would come to [University of] Michigan, and they offered me tenure because I, you know, I felt that I had worked six years in the industry, and I had the--all the credentials.
Speaker 1: Would you have come if they had not offered you tenure?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Yeah, because I knew that there were other places that would.
Story_ID: 23131
Speaker 1: Now who, in those days, would be considered the leader in non-linear optics in the world?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, when you say, who, a person or an institution, or--
Speaker 1: It could be either or both, you know.  What institution, or what organization, or what individual?
Speaker 2: --There are many--there are several people that one would consider, you know, really leaders.  It's always problematic when you start tossing out names because you might leave out somebody.
Speaker 1: (unclear). You can get some of the leaders in the field in those days that say that you were like looking at as pace-setters.
Speaker 2: Well, I had mentioned Robert Hellwarth, for example, you know, inventor of the Q-switch and simulated raman scattering, and he also came up with something called optical phase conjugation, and Amnon Yariv at Cal tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], he was also very highly regarded.
Speaker 1: What is optical phase conjugation?
Speaker 2: Optical phase conjugation, you know, phase with P-H-A-S-E.
Speaker 1: Oh, phase.
Speaker 2: Phase, not your face, but P-H-A-S-E.  It's a phenomenon where you can take a light beam that has gone through some distortion medium, like ground glass, it's all totally distorted and then the process of phase conjugation allows you to remove all those distortions, you know, so that you get wonderful, clean unblemished image.  So you send it through, it gets all distorted and yet if you phase conjugate it through a non-linear optical phenomenon, it can come back with all the distortions and aberrations removed.  So it's a wonderful effect.
Story_ID: 23132
Speaker 1: Okay, I was tossing out some names, of course, at [University of] Rochester [Rochester, New York], there was [R. W.] Boyd, he was quite well known, especially for his great nonlinear optics textbook that he wrote.  Now, in an earlier generation, there was, of course, Nicolaas Bloembergen, who won the Nobel Prize for his work done in optics, he was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] then.  These are, you know, a few of the names of the really top leaders then.
Story_ID: 23133
Speaker 1: Now, when we are at the break, Matthew Hickey, our videographer, asked about optical, when you made a statement about optical phase conjugation, and you said, yeah, that's right, they're using it now to, I guess, give us a non-distorted, you know, views of the universe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when you're imaging through the atmosphere, you know, the atmosphere is say that a distortion medium, and it leads to aberrations, images, and one can use phase conjugation to correct for the distortions and aberrations of images that come through the atmosphere.
Speaker 1: So telescopes, like the big cat telescope, and others are using that now to get to see to, you know, get a less distorted view of space from earth, is that what you mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they may be using a process that's similar to that.  They may not necessarily be using nonlinear optics, but you can do phase conjugation with other schemes like flexible, controllable mirrors, where you can alter the phase in different parts of the mirror, you can serve with mechanism, you can tune the phase, so they're other schemes related to optical phase conjugation, yeah.
Story_ID: 23134
Speaker 1: So, the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] from 1987, came in with full tenure, and now, what have been some of the highlights of your experiences here at the University of Michigan in terms of your research, the students, and your teaching?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I started teaching right away, from my first day, literally on campus.  I started in January, '87 (1987).  I remember I moved from the Boston area, I think, just after Christmas, because I spent the time just before New Year in a hotel preparing the lectures, you know, because I was going to be teaching for the first time.  I was teaching a course in electromagnetics.  And so I started teaching, and it was almost like love at first sight.  I said, "Wow, this is what I was put here to do."  I really enjoyed teaching.  I mean, other than for working as a teaching assistant in graduate school, I had never actually taught, and so this is my first teaching experience.  And I was--I had role models like I mentioned Herman Haas at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], he was a phenomenal teacher. I had--I took physics courses from Walter Lewin, who's now an internet sensation on YouTube.  You know, his lectures are the most amazing lectures, you know, full of great demonstrations, insight.  Walter Hendrik Gustav Lewin, L-E-W-I-N.  You should check him out on YouTube.  I took two physics courses from him.  So, I had these people as, essentially, role models.  I tried to pattern my teaching style after them, and I think it seemed to resonate with the students, because I very quickly became known as the--a pretty good teacher.  I started winning all these awards for, you know, professor of the year, and teaching excellence awards from the college.  I really knew that I loved it.  At the same time I also started a new area of research.  I had my first graduate student, you know, after my very first semester, a student.  I put him to work on a problem.  I had this idea to study what happens when you put a whole bunch of semiconductor lasers together; when you couple them  all together so you get them to synchronize, what would be the dynamics, how would these synchronized lasers behave in time?  So, we set out to do the research, you know, all theoretical, and write down equations, and hopefully, you can solve them, either analytically or on the computer, and we found interesting things happening when we saw these equations; we saw that these coupled lasers could spontaneously begin to pulsate, put out pulses periodically, you know, oscillate, and then these oscillations could be very, very high frequency.  And that in some regimes, you could have chaotic oscillations, you know, that these lasers are perfectly deterministic, they would start putting out chaos.  You probably heard of the technical word, you know, chaos, for essentially random noise-like behavior of systems that are supposed to be completely deterministic, you know, but the randomness just emerges from certain, you know, nonlinear interactions that go on.  And so we discovered this phenomenon of chaos in these coupled arrays of lasers; we found these instabilities, and so that led to actually some breakthrough work that we published, it was 1988, yeah, so '88 [1988], eight, nine, that led to other people looking for this effect.  And so, then I ended up collaborating with some experimentalists in Oregon who had some equipment that they'd been using to study laser arrays, and they found that the instabilities that I had predicted certainly existed in these coupled lasers.  So that was, you know, my first bit of research that I started when I came to Michigan with semiconductor laser arrays.
Story_ID: 23135
Speaker 1: Have you been able to attract very many research grants?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  In fact, while I was at GTE Labs, I actually wrote a research proposal to the National Science Foundation [NSF].  They had, what you call an industry-university collaborative research program, so I collaborated with professor George Stedman, who was at the University of Arizona [Tucson, Arizona], and we got a grant.  And then when I came here [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I got another NSF grant right away to pursue this research on laser arrays, and then subsequently, I'm getting other grants from different agencies.  I was part of a team led by professor Gerard Mourou that wrote a big proposal to the NSF to establish a center for ultrafast optical science here at the University of Michigan, and it was one of the science and technology centers that was funded by the NSF, and this one was funded for, like 10 years, and that center gave rise to a large number of inventions, its formed a number of start-up companies.  But, out of that lab came a technique called "frontal second laser Lasik", you know, where they use frontal second lasers to cut a corneal flap.
Speaker 1: What they call Lasik eye surgery?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, the use of frontal second lasers in Lasik was actually born here in a company called Intralace that evolved from the set up of ultrafast optical science.  None of that was my work, but, you know, worked on by other colleagues within the center.  I worked on other things like these fiber lasers, and I also worked on the phenomenon that you had mentioned earlier which had to do with the speed of light and the tunneling through potential barriers.
Speaker 1: So you worked at both--both theoretical and practical.  You had practical results from your work?
Speaker 2: Yes, some of my work suddenly has tie-in to experiments and to practical applications.
Story_ID: 23136
Speaker 1: We were discussing theoretical and applied aspects of your research, and so like the Lasik eye surgery came out of some research that you--
Speaker 2: Well, not me, personally, but you know, other people in the lab were working on that.  I was working some of the more applied work that had involved how you can get more power out of a laser, for example, I mentioned these semiconductor lasers and how, if you couple a whole bunch of them together, you can enhance the intensity you can get out of it by a factor that goes as the square on the number you can couple together.  And so, lately, I was--been working on fiber lasers, lasers made out of optical fibers which you can couple together to get a lot more intensity.  My research has been to try to understand the physical mechanism that allows them to coherently combine and produce a higher intensity.  So, I've been doing a lot of theoretical work on that, but I've been collaborating with an experimentalist, Professor Almantas Galvanauskas, who actually makes these lasers and can demonstrate some of the results that we predict.  And those lasers can be useful for a variety of applications, including like machining, can perhaps be used in laser surgery.  And then I have other research that is not directly tied to applications, but has the potential for applications, but their real motivation was to actually understand the phenomenon, to understand a paradox, to try to explain things, and so that ties into this.  Yeah, I had mentioned before that there's this--there was this long-standing paradox for seventy-five years, people had been wondering how long it takes a particle to tunnel through a barrier.  You know tunneling is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which, let's say, you know, if you throw a ball at a wall, what happens, the ball it bounces back.  You'd be shocked if the ball went through the wall; so that's classical mechanics.  In quantum mechanics, an electron actually does have some probability of going through that wall.  I recall that, no, tunneling.  It's something that can happen with, you know, electrons, with tiny subatomic particles, but a similar effect also happens with light waves.  Light waves can encounter a barrier and it's possible for light waves to tunnel through that barrier.  And there's a phenomenon called the--they call the Hartman effect in which they found that if you make the barrier longer and longer, the time it takes to get from one end to the other doesn't increase, it just--it takes the same amount of time, so you try to make the barrier ten times as long as this, it will still take the same amount of time to get through.  So that was quite a paradox known as the Hartman effect.  Well, in work that I did back in 2002, 2003, I was able to explain this paradox, and so now it's considered pretty much an understood or solved problem, why the tunneling time doesn't increase as you increase the length of the barrier; why the time just saturates.  So, that's, I think, one of--one of my more important breakthroughs in terms of the understanding the physics of things.  Now, as far as applications of that, there are devices that depend on this tunneling phenomenon.  There are tunneling microscopes, there are tunneling diodes, and so if one understand the ultimate speed of these devices, it's good to know, you know, what the--you'd understand this Hartman effect and maybe find ways to speed up ultimately these devices.  But my original intent wasn't fueled by any applications, it was just--trying to understand something, answer my question of nature, and hoping that, you know, nature would, would answer.
Story_ID: 23137
Speaker 1: What do you envision based on today's research that we'll be able to do with lasers in the future?
Speaker 2: What we can do with lasers in the future, based on today's research?  Well, you know, there's this interesting area that developing it's called metal materials, materials that have properties that are not normally found in nature, for example, they have a property like negative refractive index.  Refractive index assumed to be positive, you know, and we all know that light will bend a certain way when it goes from air into water, we know the way it's going to bend, but if you have a material with negative refractive index, the light actually bends the wrong way, and there are other interesting things that can happen.  You can create something, an optical cloaking device, a device such that it renders everything invisible, everything that's behind it invisible, so I can make you invisible if I create an optical cloaking device.  And this is a very hot area of research.  You can understand that, of course, the military is very interested.  So, that's an area that's, you know, really quite fascinating, and I think in the not-too-distant future, you'll see the optical cloaking devices actually become reality.
Speaker 1: Right.  Anything else?
Speaker 2: Of course, there are applications are being found everyday in different areas.  Now when a laser is invented, people thought of it as a problem looking for a solution or the other way around, anyway, but there were not a whole lot of applications at that time, and now you can see them everywhere, from the check-out counter, you know, to laser pointers in the class rooms, to laser machine and medicine, laser cooling, using lasers to cool atoms to really to a standstill.  So the applications are just, you know, blossoming all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The one thing that people looked at was we thought kids--we thought that everybody would have ray guns by now, people blasting one another.  Is that something the military is interested in?
Speaker 2: Well, there are laser weapons, you know, now, there are high-energy lasers that can be used to, you know, shoot down unfriendly flying objects, so, those, I believe, do exist, and the military is constantly working on getting higher and higher and higher energy lasers.  So, some day you'll see them on the battlefield.
Story_ID: 23138
Speaker 1: Now, what about your work with young people in terms of STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Math] education?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been involved at all levels in STEM education.  This center that I had mentioned, the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science, I was the--in charge of the educational component there too, and so we did a lot of outreach, outreach to elementary schools, middle schools, high schools; we'd bring in students with a great deal of focus of underrepresented minority students, bring them to campus.
Speaker 1: Was there a name for the program?
Speaker 2: It was just the outreach program of the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science.  It doesn't have a specific name, but we worked with schools in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and in Detroit.  Some of my graduate students would actually go to Detroit and work with high school students, show them how a laser is built, so they could actually build their own.  We brought in students at all levels, you know, elementary and high school.  We also focused quite a bit on women students.  We formed a partnership with the Center for the Education of Women and the program here called Women in Science and Engineering, and so we had middle school girls who would come and get exposed to interesting experiments in optics and electronics.  So here we've had a history of working with students at all levels.  Some of the students that I worked with, when they were in high school have now finished, one of them went off to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is finished and gone off to grad school.  On the undergrad level I also started a program--I got a grant from the NSF [National Science Foundation] to start a research experiences for undergrads program that brought in undergrads, mostly minority students to come and spend about ten weeks in the summer doing research with faculty, and some of them have now gone on and become faculty themselves.  So that's a program that I ran for about ten years, here at [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And then of course just teaching in the class room, always trying to, you know, mentor students.  And I've had some really amazing African American students who've now gone on, for example, I taught [Todd] Coleman, was one of the students I taught as an undergrad.  He then finished, went on to MIT, and now he's a professor at UC San Diego [University of California at San Diego, San Diego, California], doing some really fantastic work there.  Donald Walton was my first African American graduate student, he's now a big manager for, I think, World Engineering Applications at Corning Research Labs, he's in charge of the group that brought you gorilla glass, you know, which you find everywhere on displays and things.
Speaker 1: Is that a tough glass?
Speaker 2: Really, really, really tough glass, yeah, pretty much unbreakable.  But he's had an amazing time at Corning.
Story_ID: 23139
Speaker 1: I was asked to ask you to formulate a question for young scientists that is challenging, yet, you know, something they can actually answer.  So do you have a question like that or a question you can ask?
Speaker 2: Young scientist, about what level?
Speaker 1: Well, high school, I mean, you know, middle school, high school.
Speaker 2: Question that they can actually answer.
Speaker 1: But will take a little work.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Oh, boy, how about, "Why is the sky blue?"
Speaker 1: That's a good question.
Speaker 2: It will take a lot of work, maybe.  Of course, these days, you can Google any question.  But of course that's also good because they learn to research, you know, to find answers, to read, to solve problems. What other questions.
Speaker 1: There is a reason.  There's scientific reason why it's blue.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, there is a scientific reason, yeah, so it'd be great if they could find out, because you see blue skies, you know, it's always a joy when you look up and see blue sky, white clouds, you know, it's nature, it's beautiful, and physics can help us understand much of that beauty too.
Story_ID: 23140
Speaker 1: Do you have a project that you're working on now that's really intense in terms of research that you can tell us about?
Speaker 2: Well, I have mentioned this work on, you know, coupling fiber lasers together, that's what I've been working on now for the past year or so, because there still isn't a very good way.  You know, the problem is that as you add more and more lasers into this array, the combining efficiency begins to drop, you know.  And so you're limited to maybe about ten or so, but we'd like to be able to put together twenty, thirty, fifty lasers coherently and be able to maintain that very high efficiency.   So that's a problem that keeps me awake to some extent now.  And it's not an easy one to solve.  So, I think it will keep me busy for a while to come.
Story_ID: 23141
Speaker 1: In terms of the community, that, that we're in, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well maybe, I will start with my concerns.  You know, I was at an event on campus a couple of weeks ago.  We have a program called 'Saturday Morning Physics,' where on a Saturday morning a professor will give a lecture in this auditorium on central campus.  And in the audience you'll find people from ages six to ninty-six, I mean, and the halls are packed every Sunday morning, you know, because the lectures are so engaging, so stimulating, full of demonstrations, like the one I was at just two weeks ago, was on the physics of music.  It's a wonderful community activity.  And you see kids, you see grandmothers, people of all ages, you see high school, middle school, elementary school, they're all into it.  Well, when I was there the last time, I looked around, I did not see a single black kid.  And I don't know, maybe I didn't look carefully enough, but I did not see a single black kid, and that really, I was distressed to see that.  And why is it that black kids are not being exposed to this really exciting field, exciting area of science, and science presented in such an engaging and stimulating way.  So, I, you know, decided to do something about it.  I have initiated conversations with the physics department to see about what we can do to perhaps bring in, you know, maybe get a bus, bring in African American kids on a Saturday morning to enjoy this wonderful series of lecture in physics.  So, yeah, my concern is that not enough African American kids embracing science again in engineering, so I'm really concerned.  Now, I can talk about my hopes too.
Story_ID: 23142
Speaker 1: So, I was asking you about some of your hopes and concerns for the African American?
Speaker 2: Well.  Something that did give me hope to--well, I talked about my concern and hope.  Last week there was a celebration, the applied physics program here at the University [of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary, and alumni of that program came from all over the country, you know, to partake in this.  And what gave me hope was seeing the number of African Americans and other under-represented minority, graduates of the applied program who came back and who are now doing amazing work, who are now faculty at various universities; they came from Duke University [Durham, North Carolina], Rensselaer [Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York], you know, several other universities, African American graduates of the applied physics program.  My formal student, Donald Walton, also came from Corning, and I could see the impact that applied physics program has had.  You know, they've done so much to train African American graduate students.  I think they--they produced a significant fraction of the Ph.D.s that are earned in this country each year by African Americans.  Their graduating class there typically, may be, I'd say thirty percent under-represented minorities, whereas the typical physics graduating class may be five percent or so.  So, there's hope that we're creating, you know, a small but growing number that can now go out and make a difference.  So, I have the hope that the numbers will increase and the impact will grow.
Story_ID: 23143
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done at this point in life, is there any major thing that you would go back to change, if you could, you know, change it or do it again?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think I've been pretty blessed, because I'm sure, I've made some mistakes here and there, but if you're not making mistakes, it means that you're now--you're not really trying.  If you're not failing every now and then, it means you're not really, you know, striving or challenging yourself.  So, I've had some failures, but there's really nothing that I would change, you know, I've learned lessons and then moved on.  I've had, you know, major challenges. I think-- oh, when I was in grad school, I was actually fired once by an advisor, that's because, I guess, I wasn't that much into what I was doing. I was doing some experimental work, and I was not excited by it, so I think I was kind of perhaps goofing off, so I was fired.  Well, that firing actually sort of lit a fire under me, you know, it was--felt like this was a challenge.  And so what I did then was I begun to work on my own on the theory that would explain some experimental results had gotten in that lab.  And so, finally, I got my hands on those results, and my theory explained the data, perfectly, and I took it to the advisor who fired me. And you know what, they hired me right back, you know.  Yeah, in retrospect, I don't see anything that I would really change.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everything taught me something.
Story_ID: 23144
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything that you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your contribution, your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my legacy would be the light of the students whose lives I've impacted in some small way.  I've taught a few thousand students in my twenty years here at [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I think I have had an impact on quite a few of them.  I particularly am proud of, you know, the African American students that have studied with me, and I can see them succeeding in doing great things with their lives, so I think my legacy would be really through the impact I may have had on students, and hopefully, they will also then, you know, pass it on and have an impact on a future generation of students.

Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Now, you have, unlike a lot of people here, you've got a family that's very far from here.  You have some family members in Ghana, you have family members here, so, tell us about them, and if you have children, you know?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, I have a daughter, her name is Candice.  Candice is now a physician, a sports physician in Dallas [Texas].  She studied here as a chemical engineer; she studied chemical engineering here and then went on to   grad--to medical school, and now is a full-fledged physician in Dallas, so she's my only child.  I'm married now, my wife, her name is Louisa, Louisa Ann, she's also--she's a scientist, she's a physicist also.  I have--I mentioned my brother and sister, they now live in Ann Arbor [Michigan], too.  My sister is an architect.  My brother was an engineer, electrical engineer.  He had his own company in Ghana, but now he's here, and he's decided to go into teaching.  So he spent a year and a half working on a Master's in education here at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], as a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, and now he's teaching math in Detroit [Michigan], in--in, I think the school was Cesar Chavez Academy; yeah, so, my brother's now a high school teacher.  The rest of my family, well, with my parents [Margaret Ferguson Graves and Herbert Francis Winful], have passed on several years ago.  I have lots of cousins in Ghana, lots of cousins.  And the last--the remaining--a relative of my mother's generation is my mother's older brother, Uncle Richard, he lives in England [United Kingdom], you know.  So, that's--that is pretty much my family.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any reflections on, your relationship with African Americans, because sometimes that's an issue, Africans from the continent, being misunderstood by and misunderstanding African Americans?
Speaker 2: Well, issues.  Well, when came to the [United] States, of course, I naturally gravitated towards African Americans; I felt we had something in common.  Now, what I initially--they teased me quite a bit.  I suffered a fair amount of teasing, but I realized that's part of, you know, maybe bonding, you know.  They would tease me about, you know, Africa, you know, "Gee, do you all wear clothes, do you still live in trees," you know, strange things like that, but you know, after that initial period of teasing, maybe it was like hazing, you know, join a fraternity, but not that I joined one, but eventually, you know, we begun to interact on a, you know, more, I'd say a rewarding level.  They were curious about me, and I was curious about African American culture, and so, I--I think my relationship with, you know, African Americans is great, and I enjoy the interactions we have; I enjoy mentoring African American students, and well, up until four years ago, I wasn't a U.S. citizen, but now I--four years ago I became a U.S. citizen, so now I can really call myself African American, you know, African and American.  So, yeah, I--I do find myself a part of the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I still, of course, also retain my links, my connection to the mother land, and so I have another circle of African friends in community too.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about, we need to discuss, before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, you did not ask me about what I do outside of work, for example.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you do, are you still a fan of music?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Well, one of my great passions is, actually playing the piano, you know, I love the piano.  I was pretty much self-taught when I was a kid in Ghana.  But in--in recent years in the past, let's say six or seven years, I've actually taken it quite seriously.  So I play piano quite regularly, sometimes being asked to actually perform at events at the College of Engineering.  Last month there was an event called the 'Next Prof,' where there brought in under-represented minority Ph.D. candidates from all over the country to show them what it's like--what the process of becoming a professor and how to go about applying, etc., and so I was asked to perform at the reception and dinner.  My dean knew that I played the piano.  So, playing the piano is one of my greatest joys outside of--outside of academic.
Speaker 1: What genre of music do you play?
Speaker 2: Well, when I started out, I thought I wanted to be a jazz pianist, and I tried for bit.  I found that jazz is hard, you know, because you constantly--you have to invent on the spot, you have to create on the spot and then play it, you have to improvise.  I found that to be a bit hard, so then I turned to classical.  And, so now I play, you know, mostly Bach and Chopin, Scarlatti and Brahms, people like that.  I really truly enjoy spending time playing the piano.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered, first of all as a caring teacher; really, really cares about the student, not just how they learn in the class room, but care about them as people.  I would like to be remembered as a caring teacher, as a creative and inventive scientist, as a loving husband and father, and as a pretty decent musician, also.  But first and foremost, I think, a caring teacher.
