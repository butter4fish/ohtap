Speaker 1: Yes.  And I guess to be a little bit more specific about your occupation, you were, at one time you were the first black deputy superintendent of the Georgia schools, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I joined the Georgia Department of Education at the invitation of State School Superintendent Jack Nix [Jack P. Nix] in 1977 as the first assistant state school superintendent.  I was later promoted to associate state school superintendent for curriculum and instruction, and later to deputy state school superintendent for professional development and leadership.

Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask and they--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Can it be a dessert or must it--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it can be.
Speaker 2: Egg custard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Brown, black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The Bahamas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "That's the price of the ticket."  I borrowed that from James Baldwin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 306760
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Peyton Williams] side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Georgia, G-E-O-R-G-I-A, Reddick, R-E-D-D-I-C-K, Williams.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 2, 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Bleckley County, Cochran, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  I mean how, first of all, how far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I can trace my mother's side of the family back to the 1700s.  They came to Middle Georgia in--somewhere during that time.  That's where the first record of them, of their existence I've been able to track.  My mother's great-great-great-grandmother was a Creek, C-R-E-E-K, Indian [Native American].  They migrated from Twiggs County [Georgia], T-W-I-G-G-S, County down to Bleckley County, which is all contiguous to each other in some fashion, from the Tarver Plantation.  My, one of my great-grandmother's last name was Clara Tarver, T-A-R-V-E-R.  She was a Creek Indian.  She was a free woman of color, and so was her daughter.  She had only one daughter.
Speaker 1: Now was she a full-blooded Creek, or part black and Creek or--?
Speaker 2: Apparently, she was part black and Creek.  There is mixed blood in that family, my mother's family.
Speaker 1: The Creeks are famous for being a group that--escaped slaves would run and join the Creeks, the Creeks and the Seminoles--to Florida and Southern Georgia.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember stories about her from my grandmother.  She was this woman who smoked a pipe and who had extremely long hair, and was very sensitive to time and space, and was even rather clairvoyant in a sense.  But they traced their family back to that part of the country, here in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other information about any of the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Lela Hill Reddick] was a Hill, my mother's mother.  She and her brother were the offsprings of a member of the Hill family; this is a white family in Twiggs County.  They were also closely allied with the Dudley Hughes [Dudley Mays Hughes] family.  Dudley Hughes was a congressman from Georgia.
Speaker 1: That's H-U-G--.
Speaker 2: H-U-G-H-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember his, one of his relatives, Mrs. Hennie Lou Hughes, who lived in their old family home, as visiting my grandmother until the time that she passed away.  As a matter of fact, she and my grandmother looked very much like sisters.  We still have land in our family that goes back to the late 1800s.
Story_ID: 306761
Speaker 1: And my mother's [Georgia Reddick Williams] people were the first people of color to own property in Cochran, Georgia.  And they founded the Martha Ann Baptist Church [Cochran, Georgia], which was founded shortly after the Civil War in 1868, I believe it was.
Speaker 2: It was 1868.
Speaker 1: Eighteen sixty-eight [1868].  The charter of that church stayed with a member of my family until my mother transmitted it to the church.  My [maternal] grandfather [William Reddick] was the last person to keep that charter.  All of the, all of their family members were affiliated with that church in Cochran when it started.  They came out of--the other side of that family was with the Danville Baptist Church [Danville, Georgia], the first Baptist church for blacks.  But they were very heavily involved in church work, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay, the Danville Baptist Church.  And the first one was?
Speaker 1: The Martha Ann Baptist Church--
Speaker 2: Martha Ann--
Speaker 1: --which was the one that was founded in Cochran.
Speaker 2: Now is there a story behind that name, the Martha Ann Baptist Church?  It doesn't sound like a biblical name, you know.
Speaker 1: It's not a biblical name.  I believe that the name came from a member of the Dikes [ph.] family, who gave them land to build the first church.  But that has not been verified or confirmed, because they didn't keep very good records during that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, was the historic relationship between your white ancestors and the black ancestors like an amicable one, or one where the black ancestors received property and things from--?
Speaker 1: Yes.  My [maternal] grandmother [Lela Hill Reddick] and her brother did receive property that they never got.  They--.
Speaker 2: So, they were--.
Speaker 1: It was withheld from them; they never could claim it.  My cousins in New York [New York] who have never lived in Georgia, whose grandfather was my mother's uncle, confirmed his side of that story--that there were properties that they never received that were left to them.  But in terms of an am- a good relationship, I wouldn't know how to describe that.  I do know that my grandmother received lots of preferential treatment, and--because I'm sure people understood her family connections.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But in terms of something like property, they didn't--.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So the acquisition, their acquisition of the first land in that area, how did that--?
Speaker 1: That was purchased.
Speaker 2: That was purchased, okay.
Speaker 1: Purchased land, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And most of it was from the Walker family, who was closely allied with my grandmother and [maternal] great-grandmother's [Clara Tarver] family--connected to my grandmother and my great-grandmother--great-great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Are there any stories about the Civil War or that period from that side?
Speaker 1: Not that I recall them talking about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  There might be a good story in there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Well, there is some history there, and there is a story to be told.  But there's a lot of research that's needed to help verify and confirm some of that.  And most of the actors who could have provided some information along those lines are no longer with us.  There was a book written about the history of Cochran and Bleckly County [Georgia].  And a historian, Dr. Bernadette Loftin [Dr. Bernadette Kuehn Loftin], did include my mother's family in this particular book ['The Cochran Community: Development, Continuity and Challenge,' Bernadette Kuehn Loftin].  And I think, prior to her death, she was about to delve into some of the additional research that was needed.  But that never took place.
Story_ID: 306762
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Georgia Reddick Williams] talk about growing up, and what it was like for her to grow up in Cochran [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've often heard them talk about growing up.  And they were big landowners.  They had plenty of food, they had clothes.  They were--and I have a photograph of them that was made in--around 1913.  And they were people of means, but means by their--from their own efforts--work and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they--being the first blacks to acquire land in that county, did that make, did that make them the richest black people in that county?
Speaker 2: I'm not so sure they had money, that kind of money you're talking about.
Speaker 1: But I mean, not necessarily rich--
Speaker 2: They had resources, and they were perceived--.
Speaker 1: --but being maybe in a time period where a lot of blacks were sharecropping and didn't own anything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were perceived as being self-sufficient--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that way.  I did hear them talk often about land that had been taken from members of the family because they were unable to take care of the taxes, and other kinds of situations, especially my [maternal] grandfather's [William Reddick] brothers, and what have you.  But they were people who were very self-reliant and self-sufficient.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And from what you--I'm inferring from what you're saying is that it was not easy for them, despite the fact that they did have some property.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now your mother, I suppose she had a chance to go to school?  Did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: They all finished high school, as far as they would go in school.  But they never took advantage of the opportunities for advanced study, in terms of college, she nor her sisters and brothers.  And I think they probably could have easily done that if they'd wanted to.  They were very intelligent people, but working and money was a little more important to them, at that time, I suspect, than schooling and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did she pursue after she finished high school?
Speaker 2: She was a domestic.  She did, she was a cook.  My [maternal] grandmother [Lela Hill Reddick] operated her own little laundry, in a sense.  She had several ladies who came and worked for her on Mondays, washing clothes for different families in the community and what have you.  And usually by Friday, she was taking in probably more money than most men, by charging a $1.75, $2 a week to do laundry.  As a matter of fact, her laundry, her little laundry house is still standing where she had the built-in wash pots and the built-in tubs, and all of that sort of thing.  They were, I guess if they were around today, they would be real entrepreneurs in a real sense.
Story_ID: 306763
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Peyton, P-E-Y-T-O-N, Williams.  And he too, had no middle name.  He was a third.  I'm really a fourth.  He was named for two of his uncles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--.
Speaker 1: What is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 7, 1907.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about his ancestry?  How far back can you trace his side?
Speaker 2: Not very far, back into the 1800s.  We can trace them to the 1860 census, we have done that.  They were farm laborers.  He was a person who was very interested in education and educating himself as best he could.  He became a minister, a very successful pastor of churches in the Middle Georgia area.  For about thirty-five years he pastored churches in the Middle Georgia area.
Speaker 1: Baptist churches?
Speaker 2: Baptist, yes, he's a Baptist.  He was also employed at one time at the large air field base, the Warner Robins Air Force Base [Robins Air Force Base, Houston County, Georgia], during the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], which provided income.  He later opened a grocery store, and operated that until the mid-1950s, I think.  And he also was an insurance agent with the Guaranty Life Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: Now, he was busy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sounds like he was very busy.
Speaker 2: Very busy, very active.  He was the first minister I heard preach about a new day, and to advance the Civil Rights Movement.  He was very much in the forefront for equality and equal rights.  He married lots and lots of people, and baptized many folks that I still--occasionally they will see my name and say, "Your daddy baptized me," or "Your daddy married me."  I remember growing up when policemen would bring to him who had done something that was contrary to the law, for him to take care of.  And I also remember him putting people in his car late at night and getting them out of town, because he didn't feel that they would get a fair--fairness or justice in whatever it was they were dealing with.
Speaker 1: So, he fulfilled that ministerial leadership role in the southern, a small southern area that a lot of ministers had to fill then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was very, very, very, concerned about his fellowman, and he did everything he could to help them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when the police would bring someone to him, what was the, what had they--did they expect him to somehow adjudicate the situation?
Speaker 2: They--well, some--I think a lot of times they understood that the people were either very drunk or very--whatever, and hadn't done whatever they would have done.  And in some way, he had a calming effect on helping bring closure to whatever it was, and he did that.  And there were some situations I recall when things would get tense, and people would bring people to him and ask if he would help get them to Macon [Georgia], or help get them to Atlanta [Georgia] or somewhere away from down there.  So, he played that kind of role, too, in a real sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did he come from a line of ministers?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He's Peyton--
Speaker 2: No, he was the first.
Speaker 1: --Williams, III?
Speaker 2: No, but he was the first to go into the ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So do you know much about his, what his people were doing otherwise, before he came along?
Speaker 2: Mostly farm work.
Speaker 1: Farmers.
Speaker 2: Most of them were sharecroppers, and they did farm work.  His sisters all moved to the North at early ages.  And they did domestic work in Ohio--Mansfield, Ohio and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't have a chance to go to school.  His father died when he was quite young, and he took it upon himself to help look after his mother and his sisters, which I thought was admirable.  But he was a person who read the paper every day, who studied the Bible religiously, and who read everything he could get his hands on.  He was very, a very well-read man.
Story_ID: 306764
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Georgia Reddick Williams and Peyton Williams] met?  Is there a story they tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, they were neighbors, they lived next door to each other.  And for my mother, he was probably the only suitable person in town.  You have to remember, she came from a family where they valued people with values, with morals, with property.  Property.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he had some property when they met?
Speaker 2: Well, he had good--he had all of the good qualities of a person, from what I've been able to determine from that relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did they get married?  Did they marry early?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think my mother was around seventeen, about 1927, somewhere along there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Do I have?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I have two sisters and one brother [Clarence Williams].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where do you fall in the order?
Speaker 2: I'm the second.  I have an older sister [Lela Williams], and then I have a middle sister [Gwendolyn Williams McMullins], and a young--my brother is the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 306765
Speaker 1: Tell us about your parents' [Georgia Reddick Williams and Peyton Williams] personalities.  You've told us something about them.  But who do you think you take after, and what traits do you think you have?
Speaker 2: Both of them.  Probably more after my father, in a real sense.  But both, I would think.  I've been greatly influenced by him, and influenced tremendously by my mother.  They were firm and strong believers in the power of education.  They were stern disciplinarians, very demanding in terms of social conduct, and what have you.  And both spent a lot of time helping other people.  That was their life story.
Story_ID: 306766
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I've got lots of them.
Speaker 1: Well, do you have a first one, an earliest one, the first thing you can remember?
Speaker 2: I guess the earliest memory I have is a large, extended, loving family that got together often at my grandmother's house.  That's probably my earliest memory.
Story_ID: 306767
Speaker 1: Can you describe where you grew up, and describe for us some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Cochran, Georgia.  The house I was born in, I'm now remodeling, on 8th Street.
Speaker 1: How big is the house?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's three, six, eight, nine rooms, something like that.  I grew up on a street--that's the only house I've ever lived in until I moved away.  I have fond memories of playing all along that street.  That's long before it was paved, when the roads were--had nothing but sand out there.  We had wonderful childhood experiences.  We were shielded from much of the racism that was prevalent around the place, and in a real sense.  Because everything we lived on--it was called Happy Hill.  The people up there tended to stay to themselves.
Speaker 1: It was called what?
Speaker 2: Happy Hill.
Speaker 1: Happy Hill?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we tended to--I don't know how it got that name, but that's where my family home is today.  The sights and sounds were good sights and sounds.  It was very hot during the summer and extremely cold during the winter.  I walked to school [Cochran Colored High School, Cochran, Georgia].  School was about three blocks from my house.  And our family church [Martha Ann Baptist Church, Cochran, Georgia] was about two blocks from my house.  So, I, you know, had wonderful memories of both places.
Speaker 1: Well, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I guess there weren't many sights.  If--.
Speaker 1: Well, what did it look like?  You said the streets were sand, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, you know, lots of big stately trees, well-kept yards with flowers.  People took great pride in their homes and in their surroundings.  There were lots of elderly people in that area, from whom you learned a lot of lessons.  They were just like your parents, your extended family, in a real sense.  The smells were of sweetness, I would say.  Because it was not ghettoish; it was not rundown; it was not unkempt, but well-manicured, kept yards.  Many of them were swept with brooms, didn't have grass and that sort of thing.  I recall we did have a grass lawn, and a push lawnmower for cutting--but most of the homes did not have that.  They just had, just an open--open yards.
Speaker 1: Did--were there many cars out there when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not many.  My family may have been one of maybe five families, including one of my uncles and the teacher who lived across the street from us.  There may have been ten cars in that area at that time.
Story_ID: 305664
Speaker 1: We were talking about the cars.  You said there were very few cars on the street [in Cochran, Georgia].  So people--were there a lot of animals, I mean horses and mules and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, no, we were in town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, we didn't have that.  But people did have chicken yards with chickens.  And there were some people who still had swine pens, hogs, in their backyard.  Mentioning the sights and sounds; often in the summer, we would sit on the front porch.  That was the common drawing area.  Our family was the first to have a television on our street [8th Street].  So we attracted a lot of company on nights when Bishop Sheen was on, Fulton J. Sheen was on television, and especially when 'The Ed Sullivan Show' was on, and especially if Pearl Bailey, Louis Armstrong or somebody like that.  Word got around.  We would tell them they're gonna be on television, come see them.  We slept many nights with doors open, windows open, nothing locked.  It's not that way down there now.  You could--.
Speaker 1: Not even down there now?
Speaker 2: No, not even in small towns now can you do that.  Fresh air was the norm.  We didn't have air-conditioning and that sort of thing.  So, those are some of the memories I have of that era.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said your family was one of the first one to get gas.
Speaker 2: We were the first people to have gas.  The gas line pulled to our house with--from a butane gas tank that was set in the ground.  It's still there.  It's no longer used.  We were the first to have a sewer--to be placed on the city sewer line, and of course, with running water and that sort of thing.  But a lot of things that would be--my kids would find foreign to think that you didn't have, you know, at that time.
Speaker 1: So you said that most people in your neighborhood [Happy Hill, Cochran, Georgia], they would have an outhouse.  They would--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --have maybe--.
Speaker 2: And we did too until we had--
Speaker 1: Until you got the--.
Speaker 2: --all of those functions pulled up there.
Speaker 1: That would have been, when you got 'em would have been, what, in the early '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Around in the '50s [1950s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 305665
Speaker 1: You said you still have the family television set from those days at home.
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I still have it.
Speaker 1: Well, can you describe it, the size of it, and the--.
Speaker 2: It's a big, square box; mahogany case with round knobs.  No remote.  You go to the television and you turn to one channel, and that was Channel 13 [WMAZ-TV] which came out of Macon [Georgia].  And depending upon the weather, it was whether or not you got a good signal, with one big antenna on top of the house.
Speaker 1: So you had one channel?
Speaker 2: Yes, we could see only one channel.  I had lot of access to radio.  Radio was very prevalent, and we had a lot of access to stations, especially late at night.  WLAC [WLAC Radio] in Nashville, Tennessee was one of our favorites.
Speaker 1: 'Randy's Record Shop.'
Speaker 2: 'Randy's Record Shop' was one of our favorite, and especially at night when we were driving back home.  Because on Sundays we spent all day in church [Martha Ann Baptist Church, Cochran, Georgia].  And driving back at night, it was always, that was the station you would listen to on the radio.
Speaker 1: It's remarkable that people as far north as Detroit [Michigan] listened to that same station.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was the station that sparked, among other things, my interest in gospel music.
Story_ID: 305666
Speaker 1: Church was a big part of growing up I suppose, with your father [Peyton Williams] being a minister.  And your mother's [Georgia Reddick Williams] family having founded the church [Martha Ann Baptist Church, Cochran, Georgia].  Was he the minister of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that church?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, explain to us how that all worked.
Speaker 2: In terms of?
Speaker 1: Well, which church did you attend?  The one your mother's family founded?
Speaker 2: Our family church, yes.  My [maternal] grandmother [Lela Hill Reddick] would have tolerated nothing less than that.
Speaker 1: Well, what about your father being--.
Speaker 2: We all joined that church.
Speaker 1: Well, what about your father being the pastor of another church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He never pastored that church, but we all joined our home church, our family church, the Martha Ann Baptist Church.  My father came out of the Mount Zion Baptist Church [Cochran, Georgia].  And my mother eventually moved her membership from our home church to the Mount Zion Baptist Church.  But we were there with our grandparents at our home church.  As a matter of fact, I studied piano.  And a part of my reason for, or their reasons, for my taking piano lessons was to eventually play for that church.  And I did for several years.
Speaker 1: And you still are a musician and a choir director, I believe?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: You used to be, right? Weren't you at one time?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Didn't you--
Speaker 2: I did that at one time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, but I don't feel at all qualified for that on today's market.
Speaker 1: But that's quite a, you know--well, you know, people think about--you know, they pigeonhole people--he's an educator, or he's this and that.  But they don't see--I think a lot of people would be surprised to find out that you're a musician as well, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, I really don't consider myself a musician.  I consider myself--I did study piano, and I did well enough to play for the senior choir at Mount Zion Baptist Church, and the junior choir at the Martha Ann Baptist Church, and the senior choir at St. Paul Baptist Church [Cochran, Georgia].  But that was a long time ago, and it's been years since I've touched a piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But that's still something that, you know--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it was a big part of life when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, very much.
Speaker 1: Did you take other leadership roles in church when you were a youth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Served in lots of youth programs, youth activities.
Story_ID: 305667
Speaker 1: Now did the church in those days serve as a, like a organizing venue for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know in a lot of communities it did.
Speaker 2: Very, very, much involved in that kind of work.  My father [Peyton Williams] was very, very much into the Civil Rights Movement.  And promoted it in his sermons and in his appeals to people.  So, the church was very much involved all over the place.  I don't think the rural church has gotten much of the credit that it deserves for having fostered a lot of work and support for the Civil Rights Movement.  I think that's been overshadowed by the bigger cities, and the megachurches, and the mega-preachers, and what have you.  But you'd be surprised at how much went on in small towns, with--from ministers and from other people behind the scenes, and in many instances who did this at great risk.  Because there was very little in small towns that was done that was not made known to the larger white community.  And I'm aware of lots of ministers who left, had to leave towns because of threats and other kinds of things--about things they had said in the pulpit, or things they had called their members to think about and caused their members to think about through their sermons and what have you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that's a part of the unsung, of the untold story of the movement.
Speaker 1: And I think just in the last few years, there are stories of people like Fred Shuttlesworth [HistoryMaker Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth] and E.D. Nixon, and people like--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that that were activists that don't get the big name recognition, like say Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  You know, and other people in the smaller towns often would agitate and--you know, without that, national, you know news coverage.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your father know Dr. King?
Speaker 2: I don't believe he did.  Reverend Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy], I think he may have met on one or two occasions.  But I don't believe he knew Dr. King.
Speaker 1: I wonder if he was a member of the National Baptist Convention?
Speaker 2: Very much, yes.  I attended one once as a child.  And my father went religiously every year, so.  Now, that was during the time when Dr. Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] was president.  He stayed as president for a very long time.  He was very much a part of the National Baptist Convention, and convention work in the state [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Dr. Jackson, we know was in conflict with Dr. King at some point for not wanting to agitate for civil rights.  And you know, he advocated that you just save the soul, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --leave the secular world to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I understand.
Speaker 1: --other people.  Did your father have any opinion about that?
Speaker 2: No.  My father believed in equality.  He fought for that.  He led a movement in Cochran, Georgia to build a new high school.  I have a copy of the original petition that he signed along with my first grade teacher, urging them to consolidate all of the black schools that were out in the countryside into one big comprehensive school in town.  No, he, he believed in--that there was a new day coming.

Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a kid?  What kind of a personality did you have?
Speaker 2: Active, involved, curious, energetic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Obedient.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always wanted to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the name of your--
Speaker 2: And I never had--.
Speaker 1: --grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to a school, Cochran Colored High School [Cochran, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was in?
Speaker 2: In Cochran, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now in those days, the black schools were often called high schools, because they went to high school, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You would start started off in elementary school--
Speaker 2: Elementary through high school.
Speaker 1: --at the high school, then you'd keep going?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Because I think people now would be confused when you say it's a high school--you went to a high school for grade school (laughter). You know, but it's--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, we went there from grades one through twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so that was like three blocks from, two blocks from--.
Speaker 2: About three blocks from my house.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And--.
Speaker 2: It was an old Rosenwald building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was very painful to see them tear that building down several years ago.  They built a new facility there, and they call it the Peyton Williams, Jr. Learning Center [Dr. Peyton Williams Jr. Learning Center, Cochran, Georgia].  They named it my honor.  I was very honored that they did that, but I felt strongly that the community should have led an effort to preserve the old high school.  Because there were so many, so many memories there, and it had been an anchor for that community for so long.
Story_ID: 305669
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Probably English and history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you have a favorite teacher?  Or are there some outstanding teachers that stand out at school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I wrote about, I've written about them.  My first grade teacher, Mrs. Daisy Jones, was probably my favorite of all teachers.  And I wrote a special article about her some time ago that was published in several places.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And anyone else that stands out?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In college [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], Dr. Mary McCreary.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get you to college yet.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: We're just talking about grade school and, you know--.
Speaker 2: No, she would, she would probably be--that would be my ideal.
Speaker 1: Now how many students were, you know, were enrolled at Cochran Colored High School [Cochran, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: We probably--all of the classes there would probably not have exceeded fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 1: All the classes together?
Speaker 2: I'm saying individual classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did--it was not a large school, maybe three hundred students or four hundred students.  First grade classes were always very large classes.  But beyond that it--you were in a class of maybe--I think there were twelve graduating--I graduated in a class of maybe fifteen, twelve or fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So an average--I mean would a teacher--did you have like one teacher for your class when you graduated?  Or did you have; were you in a bigger room, or--.
Speaker 2: No, I went to several teachers for different content.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Different areas.  But most of the elementary school was self-contained, in terms of--a teacher taught first grade all day, or second grade all day, or third grade.  They hadn't gotten with the new schedule and nuances.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did have--the average classroom size was small, you would say?
Speaker 2: Small, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you got a lot of attention?
Speaker 2: A lot of attention, yes.
Speaker 1: And the teachers knew your parents [Georgia Reddick Williams and Peyton Williams] and--?
Speaker 2: Everybody.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So, it was kind of a accountability that we don't really seem to have today, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a lot of personalized stuff in the early school.  My, the teacher I just mentioned, Miss Jones, she and my parents grew up together.  So we were just like her own children, in a real sense.  And she followed us, not only from the time we were with her in first grade, but she followed us all the way through twelfth grade in terms of keeping up with us--maybe not teaching us, but knowing where we were, what we were doing--checking on us, all that sort of stuff.  And all the teachers did that in that small school.
Speaker 1: It just seems like a wonderful, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well, it's the kind of school that I see people trying now to go back to, with private schools, small private schools, and with charter schools.  Even with the magnet school concept, of trying to bring back a personalized approach to teaching and learning.
Story_ID: 305670
Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school [Cochran Colored High School, Cochran, Georgia], did you, were you involved in clubs and activities in high school?
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: Well, what were some of the specific things?
Speaker 2: In high school, I was in the chorus.  I was, I did a lot of the little printing for our little newspaper, such as it was.  We had plays, we had special programs we would put on.  And there weren't but a few of us, and teachers just picked you out and said, "You've got this part.  You've got that, and you've got that."  And you did it.  So, involvement was very much a part of it.
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in sports at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never had much of an interest.  And I guess that was because we didn't have--the only sport we had really was basketball.  That was the only sport that was offered.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't play other teams, other schools, and any other--.
Speaker 2: I attended the games.  I was the scorekeeper and, you know, that sort of thing.  But the actual playing, I never did any of that.  My brother [Clarence Williams] did, but not me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were you active socially in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you all have a prom, and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: We had all of that, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 305671
Speaker 1: Did they teach--now this being a black school and all--did they teach black history in school [Cochran Colored High School, Cochran, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We probably had more black history taught in an indirect sort of way than kids would get today in a direct sort of way.  Because it was not unusual for the teachers to remind you of famous blacks, of important blacks, blacks who have made significant contributions to civilization, to the American scene and what have you.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the figures they were highlighting when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Well, the same ones they highlight today.   Mary McLeod Bethune, George Washington Carver, Booker T. Washington, DuBois [W.E.B. Du Bois].  You name it, all of the--Langston Hughes, you know, his poetry was there.  The Louis Armstrongs of the world were there.  Everybody was introduced; you were introduced to everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you, all through school you wanted to be a teacher?  Did you have that--you still had that as your goal?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior in high school, did you know what college you were going to attend?  Had that been planned out for you?  Or had you made arrangements?
Speaker 2: I really didn't know which college.  I knew I would be going somewhere, but I didn't know where.  And I went, I finally decided on Fort Valley State College [Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], which was forty miles away from my home.  It was close to home.  They had an exceptionally good choir, the Fort Valley State College Choir.  They sang on the radio every Sunday morning on WMAZ Radio, you could hear them.  And I did go there, and I had wonderful, wonderful experiences there.
Story_ID: 305672
Speaker 1: Now when you were coming along, a lot of things were changing around this period of time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You graduated in 1960 [from Cochran Colored High School, Cochran, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, the Civil Rights Movement in the South was on television a lot--
Speaker 2: Moving.
Speaker 1: --and on the national news.  Did you, your father [Peyton Williams] you said was an activist.  Did--what impression did the movement make on you?  Were you aware that there was--?
Speaker 2: I was very much aware of it.  This was during the time of his illness, the onset of his illness.  So, he became less involved in his ministry and other kinds of things.  But I was very much aware of it and still very supportive of it, in all kinds of ways.  As a matter of fact, when I ran for president of the student council in college [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], I noted the changes that were taking place around, and that we were still confined to the gates of the college, which got me a summons to the president's [Cornelius V. Troup] office.  I called for more democracy in the university and in the college, in terms of decision-making and what have you, which landed me in the president's office with a dietician, who said that students had come in the cafeteria and put their trays back in the windows.  So that was a part of, you know, it was political in a sense.  But it was a part of the real me, in terms of how I felt and what I thought at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were trying to make things better.  You thought they were--.
Speaker 2: I thought.
Speaker 1: Did you think that school was a little bit too stodgy?  Or was it enough--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I guess in a sense--we were a state-operated school.  And later I came to realize that you don't go against the wishes of the state.  And, and, and of course, you have to remember, Georgia was still very much a segregated and divided place.  And I even saw that when I later went to the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] to work on a degree.  I was determined to get one of my degrees from the University of Georgia.  So, I could understand why the presidents of state colleges for African Americans were ultra-conservative.
Speaker 1: Because they were under direct--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --supervision of, you know, from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the state government?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, they would be the least--less likely to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, encourage activism.
Speaker 2: As opposed to a private--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any private schools in Georgia?  Well, I know there would have to be some private black schools in Georgia.
Speaker 2: You mean colleges and universities?
Speaker 1: Yeah, colleges and universities, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, the whole AU complex [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] over there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Paine College in Augusta [Georgia].  Those are private.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the state ones are cheaper, I know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 305673
Speaker 1: Okay, so Fort Valley State [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], is that the only state black--
Speaker 2: No.  You had Albany [Albany State College; Albany State University, Albany, Georgia], and you also had Savannah State [Savannah State College; Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Albany State and Savannah State, right, okay, all right.  So, when you were in college, were you elected the president of student council?
Speaker 2: No, I lost that election by two or three votes, because of the plurality clause.
Speaker 1: A plurality clause?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now you smile when you say that.  What happened?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Well, the person with the highest number of votes would win.  And I didn't have the highest number.  I was short by two votes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, did you--did your visit to the president's [Cornelius V. Troup] office put a damper on your activism?
Speaker 2: I'm sure it did, yes, yes.  Because I wanted to graduate.
Speaker 1: Did they threaten you with--.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't threaten me.  As a matter of fact, I worked in the president's office and in the comptroller's [L.R. Bywaters] office.  And they were both mentors for me, and to me.  And both of them made me feel very awkward, because they felt that in a sense that I was attacking them.  And I really wasn't, but I think that was a psychological ploy to rein in the, you know, the energy that was there.
Speaker 1: So when you were in college, did you have much interaction with--now Fort Valley State is--is it in a town or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fort Valley, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Fort Valley, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Is it, did you encounter any racism in the town, as such?
Speaker 2: No, we were pretty much confined to the college.  Everything we needed was there on the campus.  And it was rare for me to go into town, so I didn't have that, you know, any kind of encounters there, or anything of that nature.
Speaker 1: So, now, were you majoring in education?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who were some of your mentors in college?
Speaker 2: Dr. Mary McCreary was my first.  She was a professor's professor, from my perspective.  And--.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell McCreary?
Speaker 2: M-c-C-R-E-A-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Miss Elaine Douglas was a great mentor and teacher.  She was the head of the English department there.  Those were my favorite people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, my dorm mother, Mrs. Nella Crooks.
Speaker 1: And now did you, were you involved in the choral groups in college, the choir?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did sing in the choir until I was, you know, suspended for tardiness and absences.
Speaker 1: Now, what happened, now--?
Speaker 2: I was involved in a lot of stuff, and trying to make all of that.  And of course, there is a discipline that you have to have with music ventures like that.  In venues like that, you have to be present.  You can't--you know--so I understood that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what--?
Speaker 2: It wasn't personal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what were some of your activities in college?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I was very much involved with the fraternity, the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity; I was involved with student council work; I was involved with the dormitory council; just whatever, you know, struck my fancy and I had an interest in at the time.  I've always had to be involved in something, I couldn't just sit idle.  I have felt that if it was a good cause, I would welcome the challenge of being involved.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever get involved in any of the volunteering for any of the student protests, and some of the sit-ins in those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't have any at Fort Valley.  We didn't--.
Speaker 1: I mean or even in the towns?  Because I know in those days SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was involved.  And I don't know how much they were doing in Georgia, but I know SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] was involved in Georgia.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't do it.  When I got to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], I did participate--for graduate school--I did participate in one or two marches.  But that was about the extent of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you graduated in 1964, right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was it a bachelor's [degree] in education?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 305246
Speaker 1: We were saying off-camera that you worked in the business office at Fort Valley State [Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] all four years.  And that summer when you graduated you continued to work there, and you immediately got a job, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I worked for the entire four years under Mr. L.R. Bywaters, who was the comptroller, between his office and the president's [Cornelius V. Troup] office.  And I had many wonderful experiences.  Mr. Bywaters was one of my key mentors, and I learned a lot from him.  Had some wonderful experiences there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you graduated, you got a job teaching in a middle school?  Is that--?
Speaker 2: Well, when I graduated, Dr. Troup called me up to his office one morning.  And he said he'd met a principal, and he needed an assistant principal, and he thought that I would be able to fulfill that role.  And he wanted me to call him and talk with him about the position, and I did.  It was Dr. J.T. Lacy over in Sylvania, Georgia.  I went over for an interview, and they interviewed me for the teaching position.  And they called me two or three days later and said, "You know, we'd like to offer you the position of teaching two courses in the afternoon, and working in the office as an assistant principal in the morning."  And I interviewed while I was there with him and with the superintendent, which was quite an experience.  And I took the job.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: This was at Central High School in Sylvania, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's in East Georgia.  That's sixty-five miles west of--east of Augusta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how did you like that?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it very much.  I went there as a teacher and assistant principal, and I stayed there for thirteen years.  As a matter of fact, I've only held two, worked in two places--there in Sylvania and at the state department of education [Georgia Department of Education].
Story_ID: 305247
Speaker 1: How big was Central [Central High School, Sylvania, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: At that time, I think we had close to twelve hundred students.  And here again, you've got a comprehensive high school that went from grades one through twelve.  It was roughly twelve hundred students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what were the challenges in that school?  And--.
Speaker 2: Well, the challenge was getting beyond being twenty-one years old supervising these little ladies who had been teaching elementary school for 25, 30, and 40 years.  And so, my immediate challenge was to get into graduate school.  And I went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] to work on my master's [degree].  And I took as many courses as I could take in elementary education, so that I could have some instant credibility with these little old ladies who saw me as a young whippersnapper coming in there trying to tell them what to do and how to do it, not realizing that a part of my role was to try to bring about high levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of the elementary school.  And--.
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of things--I'm just curious as to what kind of things did you see that had to be--that should have been changed, you know.  These ladies had been teaching a long, long, time, and--.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get into the--that was it.  We didn't get too much into what, the content of what they teaching--how they were teaching, and the methodology, the pedagogy kind of thing.  We were looking at systems, recordkeeping, the filing of records, the usefulness of forms--whether this lesson plan was designed in such a way that it gave you the kinds of information and data that you really needed, or was it just a bunch of busy work for you to fill out?  Those kinds of things.  So we looked at that kind of stuff.  We were looking at the frequency of student visits to the office.  Where were they coming from?  What were they coming there for?  And what could have been occasioning so many visits from Teacher X versus no visits from Teacher Y?  Was it the student?  Was it the culture of the classroom, you know?  Those kinds of, those are some of the kinds of things that we were looking at, at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were also starting to--the movement of using test data.  We were testing the kids, but after they were tested, that was the end of it.  The data, the scores, were recorded.  And the test papers were just--we put a rubber band around all of them, and they were filed away.  But nobody was looking at the protocol of the tests--where kids were weakest, where they were strongest.  The teachers were continuing to go on in their same directions, and that sort of thing.  And that was a real challenge for us, in introducing some of the new things like that.
Speaker 1: What were some of the--well, what would you consider I guess the worst--the worst habits of teachers that had been teaching a long, long, time?  Did they have a--.
Speaker 2: I really, in retrospect, I didn't find any of them to have bad habits.  They had many, many qualities that I'd like to see back in classrooms today.  They were not accustomed to--once principals had verified or certified that they could teach, by giving them good reviews or whatever, it was difficult to infringe on that and introduce--you could do this differently, or you may want to consider doing this another way.  One of the challenges was how do you get people to not use corporal punishment, that all kids don't need that.  And so that, those were the kinds of challenges (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 305248
Speaker 1: --Were you teaching, would you say, in the age of transition from corporal punishment to other methods?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It--the transition was starting to take place, but had not fully taken place.  It didn't really take place until we integrated the schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what would, what signaled the transformation?  Now this is just--you may not know--I mean I don't know, but I know that at a certain time in school, you know--and I'm old enough to remember being in school-- you would get paddled if you misbehaved.
Speaker 2: I think when we started reading over the research and looking at some of the research from the behavioral scientists and some of the psychological kinds of studies that were done, we started to shift our thinking about how to handle situations and problems with young people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you--some people now say that, you know, they yearn for the days when you could line all the students up and give them a swat, you know, or spank their hands with a ruler or something--saying that those were the good old days of discipline, you know, and that's the problem now, we don't have enough of it.  Well, what, do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: I would not like to see us return to that.  I think there are better ways and more advanced ways of doing and dealing with that.  And I think we start by looking at the individual who's having the problem that we must deal with, and finding ways to address whatever the concerns are.
Story_ID: 305249
Speaker 1: I guess when you look back at those days, what were the biggest concerns of students in school in Sylvania [Georgia]?  It was a small, I guess rural kind of setting, you know.  What were their biggest concerns, in terms of going to school, you know, and--?
Speaker 2: Most of them that were there, they lived--a lot of kids who lived in poverty.  The only real meal that some kids got was the meal they got in school.  Some of their concerns centered around being accepted by other kids--the peer pressure, that sort of thing.  And I guess our biggest challenge was how do we inspire kids who come from backgrounds with limited resources to believe enough in themselves and in a vision and in a dream for themselves, that they can leave here and go and advance their education and make a difference--to get some aspirations in them, to become--and to--.  When I think about the resources that kids have at their disposal today, in terms of scholarships and loans and all kinds of stuff that's out there--and when I think about the limited access that many kids twenty or thirty years ago had to that kind of stuff--if they had had it, the difference it would have made.
Story_ID: 305250
Speaker 1: When did you enroll in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] to work on a master's degree?
Speaker 2: The summer of '65 [1965]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was my first summer at Tuskegee, a very rich experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, explain, you know, give us some of the details of that experience.
Speaker 2: My brother [Clarence Williams] did his undergraduate work at Tuskegee.  And of course, everybody was fascinated with Tuskegee, and the Booker T. Washington-Carver [George Washington Carver] notion.  And I've always had great admiration for the school.  I wanted to study there, and I did.  And I had wonderful experiences in the school, the College of Education.  That's where I worked on my master's.  I had some wonderful, wonderful teachers who knew how to prepare you to go back and effectively work with teachers and students.  I had some very good, rich, experiences at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers?
Speaker 2: You would ask me that.  I remember Dr. Sum Kun Gee [ph.], who was exceptionally good.  A Dr. Dixon [ph.] who was from Bennett College [Greensboro, North Carolina], he was there on leave.  I'm trying to think of the lady in reading that we all admired so much.  I can't call her name right now.  But just had wonderful teachers there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were there two summers?
Speaker 2: I was there three--
Speaker 1: Three.
Speaker 2: --three--four summers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Three, four, okay.  So, you got your master's degree in--?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], okay, all right.  Now did you, did you go immediately on to graduate school to work on your Ph.D. after that?  Or did you--
Speaker 2: No, it was about several years later that I started working on a specialist degree at the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the doctorate at Georgia State University [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 305251
Speaker 1: So, meanwhile you were--
Speaker 2: Working.
Speaker 1: --working as a teacher [at Central High School, Sylvania, Georgia], an assistant principal, and a--
Speaker 2: Principal.
Speaker 1: --principal.  When did you become principal?
Speaker 2: When I received my master's [at Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], they promoted me to principal of the elementary school of this large high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Sylvania [Georgia].  And I stayed in that role until I assumed the principalship of the middle school.  And that came about when we desegregated the schools in '71 [1971], I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're principal of the middle school?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Central Middle School [Sylvania, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's until '71 [1971], and then you were principal of your high school?
Speaker 2: No, just the middle school.
Speaker 1: Just the middle school, okay.  All right, okay.  Now, any stories from those days of middle school?
Speaker 2: Well, it just depends on where you want the story to come from.  There was lots of activity, and lots of new experiences in creating the--working with the elementary school, especially desegregating the schools when they got the court order that we would desegregate.  And--
Speaker 1: Now when was the court order issued?
Speaker 2: In 1970, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was that we would, we would--the board of education decided they would have a middle school, a high school, and several elementary schools.  And I was placed as principal of the middle school.  And my greatest challenge was to bring about teachers who had taught in white elementary schools, the white and the black elementary schools, and to merge them into a faculty and into a family and into a community to serve eleven hundred students, grades six through nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the biggest challenge there?  Was it with the black teachers or the white teachers?  Or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't, I don't think it was with either.  It was with both; it was with both--getting people to believe in what we could accomplish--that the task was not one to be dreaded--and to get beyond the fear of what would happen in the process.  We had a lot of people who were really afraid that it was not, that this experiment was not going to work.  But it did work, and it worked successfully.  We never had any major problems.  We would dismiss students every day for recess with a limited number of teachers out supervising them.  Because we believed in the students, and we let them know that.  We had teachers buy into this concept.  We spent a lot of time on professional development with the teacher-staff development.  And we had lots of good experiences.  We had lots of problems, of course, with parents.  I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that we had problems with parents--more problems with parents than we did with the kids.  The kids were fine, but--.
Speaker 1: Now, did the white parents--did--was there a substantial portion of them that actually formed a--did they, like, form private schools after the desegregation?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They did form a private school, yes, a rather large private school.  But I think a part of the success we had was that we drew a lot of those students back to the public school, because of what we were trying to do there.  And they didn't see the violence they thought they would see.  They didn't see the lack of teaching they thought they would see.  And of course some of them stayed away for purely racial reasons.  And some were with us who held on to those racial views, but they just didn't have the money to go anywhere else.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought that might be the case.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That in a rural place--
Speaker 2: We had that.
Speaker 1: --there would be, it would be a challenge to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We, it was--
Speaker 1: --sustain a private school.
Speaker 2: It was quite a challenge, yes, quite a challenge.
Story_ID: 305252
Speaker 1: There any particular stories that you can tell us?  Any war stories about this period of time?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The--it was not an easy period.  And I don't think people realize that, when we talk about that today, about the shortage of black teachers, in small towns in particular.  A lot of children saw good teachers not returning to the classroom for various and sundry reasons.  Either they were pushed out, or they were encouraged to leave, or they were treated in ways that caused them to leave.  And I think that had some minor rippling effect on students and their view of whether--"I will go into teaching" or whether "I will not go into teaching," that sort of thing.  We lost a lot of African American teachers who really, genuinely cared about kids.  A lot of them retired because they could retire.  And we didn't, we couldn't replace them, they were irreplaceable.  A lot of them would have stayed for another five or six years.  But they didn't want to go through the hassle.  One of the problems we had--I had white parents who probably had no more than a seventh or eighth grade education, and questioned everything we did in the classroom.  And a lot of it was done for reasons other than education.  That was very demeaning to many of our teachers.  I had several experiences where I refused to move children--white parents who just insisted that they would not have a black teacher teach their child.  And I had several who insisted.  And I said, you know, "I have nowhere else to put them."  And they stayed, and the kids did well.  As a matter of fact, with many of the children, we didn't have any problems.  It was with parents that we had a number of problems.  When it came to discipline, we had always--when the school [Central Middle School, Sylvania, Georgia] was all black--had very firm policies of discipline--very firm expectations in terms of behavior.  And in a lot of places, that kind of stuff went out the window when we desegregated.  We tried to maintain some of that.  And we had several situations that we took a stand on.  And the board of education backed us, and the superintendent backed us on it.  And it made all of the difference in terms of how kids behaved, and what parents came to expect.
Speaker 1: Well, describe one of those situations for us.
Speaker 2: Well, I had a situation where I sent home the children of some very prominent parents.  And people thought that the world was going to come to an end as a result of it.
Speaker 1: Now, why were they sent home?
Speaker 2: They were sent home for serious infractions of school policy.  I don't want to go into that.
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have to name them or anything.
Speaker 2: No, but-.
Speaker 1: But what did they do?  What did they do?
Speaker 2: Well, we had one kid, we had two kids who brought liquor to school.  Well, we wouldn't, we didn't permit that from any child.
Speaker 1: So, it's not the kind of school where you can bring a bottle of wine (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you know, they brought it, you know, to show each other what they picked up on the plane and what have you.  The fact is, they had it there.  The fact that their parents were who they were, made no difference.  You know, we had to do something with them.  The biggest discipline problems I had initially were from white kids.  And a lot of them were, I think were there to sort of challenge us to see whether we would do what we said we would do.  And we did it in every instance.  We refused to accept--and the community and people knew that it was wrong.  So, how do you go against that?
Story_ID: 305253
Speaker 1: Now, you were in a situation where--unless I'm wrong, you probably represented the first black authority figure that any of these white kids--
Speaker 2: That many of those white kids had ever seen.
Speaker 1: --had ever encountered.
Speaker 2: The first that they had ever seen, yes.
Speaker 1: So, you had to really--
Speaker 2: And that was, that was--and it was the first time that many--I recall a white parent who came to my office once, and she could not sit.  I'm at the desk, here's a chair, "Would you have a seat?"  She could not bring herself to sit at the desk and talk to me; she had to stand.  So, I stood.  That kind of stuff.  Just some situations that you'd rather not really talk about.  Because--
Speaker 1: And these situations are occurring five years, I guess within five years of some real, you know, serious conflict over, you know civil rights struggles you know battles in some way, you know, in the State of Georgia.  And during the time I guess you were principal [at Central Middle School, Sylvania, Georgia], was Lester Maddox the governor during that period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he had just stepped down, I think about that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were still strong feelings, you know.  But we had a community that believed in the system, and they wanted to make it work.  And it did work.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And the situations I'm describing were really isolated from my perspective.  And as I used to say to my staff all the time, "We can't take this personally.  We have to look at the individuals and step into their bio data."  This is the first time, as you said, they had ever had this to deal with, or that to deal with, you know.  The first time I ever taught a black kid, I had one teacher tell me, a white teacher, she said there's no way I could teach mathematics to these kids.
Speaker 1: Oh, she just, that was her--
Speaker 2: She did not believe that they could understand the concepts of mathematics.  As a matter of fact, I have a letter somewhere where she actually wrote this to me.  In addition to, as a follow-up to our conversation about what she--she didn't think this integration thing was going to work.  Well, then what do you do with a woman like that?  You know, she's got tenure in the system.  And she's from one of the prominent families in the community there, you know.  You can't just dismiss her, because these are her views, you know.  You know, I'm not changing the students; we're going to still some students too, you know.  I had one good superintendent. And of course, I had a lady who was superintendent who had no real understanding of the administrative process of running a school, and just believed anything that any parent ran downtown to tell her, you know, and especially if the parent was white.
Story_ID: 306768
Speaker 1: Can you just tell us some stories I guess about how some of the teachers evolved in their thinking, from, you know, when they started, to--towards the--after they finally were exposed to black students, and started trying to teach them [at Central Middle School, Sylvania, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I think they, many of them evolved into becoming very effective teachers, with everybody.  What we tried to do when we had openings, was to bring in as many young teachers as we could.  Because they were less prone to have stereotypical notions about certain things, and they were more inclined to get in there and teach, and take students wherever they were.  And of course there were some teachers that I carefully would not send some students to, both black and white, because I wanted students to have good experiences.  And we tried to schedule them in such a way that they would have good experiences, and not be subjected to low expectations, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were some of the curriculum challenges?  I would imagine that there would be probably a difference in the way that some of the black teachers and white teachers had approached, say, American history, you know, and how they would teach the subject in the classroom, you know.
Speaker 2: We had a lot of challenges, in terms of the curriculum.  And I guess that history was one of them.  But it didn't surface as we would have thought that it would.  We used--I think the books that we were using at that time, as I recall, were rather--even for that period--had the diverse kind of content in it.  And we did stress to teachers--although we didn't use that term at that time, diversity, we did stress the importance of a broad curriculum that was broad enough to embrace all of what was happening, or had happened, in the development and emerging of America.  Our biggest challenge probably was in the area of mathematics and reading.  We had lots of challenges in reading, and even more in the area of getting kids to take advanced courses, and to be exposed to mathematics that was beyond simple subtraction, addition, and multiplication.  And that was the challenge.  We spent a lot of energy on staff development programs with teachers, in science and in math and reading at that time.  And the challenges were pretty much across the board.  But while some students may have read--had pretty good reading skills--others may not have had the best reading skills.  But those who may have had the best reading skills may not have had the best comprehension or the best critical thinking skills, and those kinds of things.  So, we had lots of challenges to work with in those three disciplines.
Speaker 1: Was there a, was there any kind of a language challenge in terms of the black students expressing themselves to these white teachers?  Or--.
Speaker 2: No.  That, that, we stressed always standard American English.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a hallmark.  I must admit I did have a challenge of insisting on putting a number of black students in more of the advanced mathematics courses.  The kids found them difficult, and the parents wanted them out, because it was going to lower their grades.  I wasn't concerned about the grades.  I was concerned about how they would do later on standardized tests, and how it would prepare them for what was to come in high school, and if they were going somewhere else.  So, we had lots of work to do, in working through those, and in most instances we worked through those okay.
Story_ID: 306769
Speaker 1: Did the test scores go up, you know, when you were principal?  I mean, did you--did the test scores rise, or did they--?
Speaker 2: I think our test scores held their own.  They weren't the best around, but at that time we were just starting to do a lot of the national testing, using a lot of the national tests.  For so long, in many of the small towns people had not used standardized tests.  They'd done the testing, but we had not done the comparative kinds of stuff that we do today with the tests, by looking at this group of students versus this group of students, students under these conditions versus students under these conditions, and those kinds of things.  So, but, by and large, I think our students did rather well, in the absence of my having any hard data on whether they rose or fell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were principal of Central High School [Sylvania, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Middle [Central Middle School, Sylvania, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Middle school, yeah.  It became a middle school after--I mean the whole thing was Central.  Okay, I got it, all right, the evolution of it.  It was Sylvania Central High School at one point, and then after desegregation you were the principal of the middle school.
Speaker 2: Central Middle School.
Speaker 1: Central Middle School, okay.  So you were principal there until when?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-seven [1977], when I came to the Georgia Department of Education.
Story_ID: 306770
Speaker 1: You received an award from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], right, for your efforts in the desegregation of these schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, when I was in Sylvania [Georgia].  That was from the Screven County [Georgia] chapter of the NAACP, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Screven, that's S-C-R-I-V-E-N?
Speaker 2: That's S-C-R-E-V-E-N--
Speaker 1: --C-R-E-V-E-N.
Speaker 2: --yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, Screven, all right.  So, in--well, now Georgia goes through some transitions, I guess, I mean in the '70s [1970s].  They go from, say, a Lester Maddox to Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.].  It was right to Jimmy Carter, wasn't it, from Lester Maddox?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Do you--was it, is it your estimation that the state did a flip-flop in terms of its priorities at that time, you know, to go from a Lester Maddox to a Jimmy Carter?
Speaker 2: I think they did, yes.  (Laughter) We became much more progressive, yes.
Speaker 1: I mean it seems--what's your analysis of that?  I mean--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I hadn't thought about that.  But I think President Carter was an excellent governor, from my perspective.  I think he ushered in lots of changes, and changes that have been built on to get us where we are today.
Speaker 1: At the time, I think it took the country by surprise when he ran for president in '76 [1976].  I don't think the country was very--you know, was aware of him as such; I know some people were.  But you know, since his presidency and his subsequent work, he's kind of come down in history today, as kind of a, as a progressive.  You know, everybody sees him as that now.  And he certainly was then, but he's kind of stood the test of time, you know, now.  I mean, you can really say that he really has been someone of substance, you know.  What--I mean, in those days--I mean how did things change, you know, when Jimmy Carter became the governor of Georgia?
Speaker 2: Well, he altered human services and the approach to dealing with human resources, and that sort of thing.  He brought about some changes in the education establishment.  And I'm not aware of, I mean I can't recall all of the kinds of things, but he was a breath of fresh air, I think, for state government.  And of course, he represented change.  And whenever you represent change, you're going to have, you know, levels and ranges of resistance, you know.  But I think he laid a foundation for future governors to build and strengthen the state.
Story_ID: 306771
Speaker 1: You were appointed in '77 [1977].  That's when, that's right, that's after, you know, Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] left [as governor of Georgia], I guess.  He had become the president.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Governor Busbee [George Busbee, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Busbee appointed you?
Speaker 2: Well, the state school superintendent, Dr. Jack Nix [Jack E. Nix], they had noted the work that we were doing in Sylvania [Georgia].  And Governor Busbee, who was the governor, appointed me to his taskforce on education.  And I served as chairman of the Instructional Services Committee of that taskforce.  And they had noted some of the work we had done with professional development in the school [Central Middle School] in Sylvania, and what have you.  And they invited me to come to the state department [Georgia Department of Education] as Georgia's first African American in the role of an assistant state school superintendent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you reluctant to leave--?
Speaker 2: Very reluctant, yes.  But I was challenged by the opportunity to work at state level.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, it's always, it's not easy being the first.  But what are some of the stories about being the first, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, there were probably many; getting over the challenge of people thinking that you're there only because of your race because it's an affirmative action kind of thing to do.  And here again, going into an environment where you're dealing with very highly-credentialed and competent staff people, who themselves had never had the experience of working with a person of color.
Speaker 1: Now at this point, you had your Ph.D., right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, not yet?
Speaker 2: No.  I came in with a specialist degree [from the University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The degree before the Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We also had the challenge of people wondering, well, what will you do, and what will you be able to do?  And of course, during those formative months, it was a challenge to sort of--I was charged to study the department, to look at how we operated, to listen to--to learn the system.  And we also worked with schools that were still under court order--desegregation.  We worked with the first Title IX, the Women's Equity Act [Women's Educational Equity Act of 1974] that had just come into place.  That was under this office at that time.  We filed reports to the courts on school systems that were still under court order.  And it was a challenging experience, that first year or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you served in that position until what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].  I was put in a position as, still as an associate superintendent, but in charge of the state-operated schools.  These were schools for the deaf and the blind, three schools.  And also, the two technical vocational schools that were operated then by the state as residential schools.  And of course later they added to that mix of things the public libraries.  So, I had major, major, challenges with coming into an operation as diverse as that operation was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, you're dealing with--yeah.
Speaker 2: With handicapped children--
Speaker 1: Physical challenges, mental challenges--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and public libraries?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that, that was a very rich experience.  We did a lot of the new construction, in terms of the state schools for the handicapped.  It happened during my administration in this area, as assistant superintendent.  Some expansion of the vocational technical schools, in terms of their programs, took place.  And here again, I look at all of that as being a series of wonderful challenges that we were able to meet, without calling attention to race.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's a, that's quite an achievement in this situation, I would think.
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to think it was, yeah.
Story_ID: 306772
Speaker 1: What are you proudest of, during this period [at the Georgia Department of Education, Office of State Schools and Public Libraries]?
Speaker 2: I'm proudest of during that period is--I finally found a dissertation topic.  And my dissertation was on deaf education. And it was because I was in charge of two schools for the deaf.  And the charge that I'd been given when those schools were placed under me was get in there and clean them up, or help us close them down.  And I found out that most of the folks at the state knew very little about what was going on with those three schools.  I was, as a result of that, I was placed on the advisory board of Gallaudet College [Gallaudet University, Washington, D.C.] in their Office of Demographic Studies.  That's the only college for the deaf in the world.
Speaker 1: And it's in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: In D.C.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so I decided to--and we were looking at--at that time the Disabilities Act was--94-142 [Public Law No. 94-142; Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975] was very prevalent, as to whether or not it was more appropriate to educate these children in a restricted environment with other children like them, or to put them in a least restricted environment, in public schools.  So I did my Ph.D. dissertation on the governance of schools for the deaf in the United States.  How were they governed?  Were they under the state department of education?  Were they under a local board of trustees that was unrelated to the state department?  Or were they privately handled?  And that was to give me some sense of policy directions in terms of my own work with the state.  So I'm proud of having done that study, which was later replicated by Gallaudet for a major presentation in China, I believe.  We had several major construction projects going on with the Georgia Academy for the Blind in Macon [Georgia], of building a new administration classroom building, and also a new auditorium at the Atlanta Area School for the Deaf [Clarkston, Georgia].  Also, we were starting a program called Georgia PINES [Georgia Parent Infant Network for Educational Services].  It was a parent-infant training program for parents with children who were born who were hearing impaired.  The concept of that, for that program, started with an idea from a teacher in the Atlanta Area School for the Deaf, who the superintendent there brought to my office to visit so we could talk about how we could find some money to--they saw a need for this.  And we started that program, and that program has gotten national recognition for being the premier program for helping address the problems of young hearing impaired students.  So there were a lot of, a lot of good things that came out of that.
Story_ID: 306773
Speaker 1: What was your next assignment [after serving as associate state superintendent of schools, Office of State Schools and Public Libraries]?
Speaker 2: My next assignment was, I was appointed to associate superintendent for curriculum and instruction, being in charge of all the curriculum and instructional services for the state department of education [Georgia Department of Education], which was probably the largest department within the state department.
Speaker 1: What year is that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry.  That was in, about '84 [sic. 1987].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-four [1984], yes.  That was quite a challenge, of working through and with the board of education on educational policy issues and instructional policy issues.  I had major responsibility for presenting recommendations to the state board of education, dealing with curriculum issues.  That's, during that time we did the first quality core curriculum for Georgia schools.  That was presented to the state board of education, and approved.  We did--one of the most controversial issues we dealt with during my tenure in that role was the sex education issue, which was an issue that was being picked up all across the country.
Speaker 1: Well, how was that handled?
Speaker 2: With lots of drama.  Should we or should we not teach sex education in the schools?  And if so, what should the content be?  And we had to balance that against the role of the parents versus the role of the state and the role of the school, in spite of the data that we had showing up all across the country about teenage pregnancies, and the lack of information that students had about that.  So that was a quite a challenge.  That was, we stayed in the news for six or seven months dealing with that, until the board finally took a position on that.
Speaker 1: What was their position?
Speaker 2: The position was that it would be taught, and the content was carefully scrutinized.  And it placed a lot of responsibility on the local school systems for making those determinations at that time.
Speaker 1: Now Georgia is a state--and correct me if I'm wrong.  But from what I gather, you know, from watching the national news from time to time and listening to the radio--you know, Georgia is a state where a lot of educational--I  mean big educational issues like sex education, teaching of creationism in the classrooms--those kind of issues are really fought over in the state.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, where they're not fought over someplace like in Michigan or Ohio, or-- Well, they're rather--.
Speaker 2: Those are not issues there in those states.  But here--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're rather cutting-edge issues for us.  And part of that reason, the reasoning for that, is because Georgia is a very--for lack of a better term--religiously conscious state, especially when you get out into the--fifty miles away from Atlanta [Georgia], you have a lot of religious groups that are very active and very vocal about what should or should not be taught in schools.  Evolution and sex education would fall under those categories.
Speaker 2: And these are still being fought over--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --even as we speak.
Speaker 1: Exactly, yes.
Speaker 2: We see these issues now.  There's an article, I mean there's a story today about, you know, whether creation science should be taught in the schools.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Well, you have strong beliefs on both sides.  And I guess the biggest challenge for us today in the 21st century is what is--for students, what is worth knowing, and what is worth teaching?  And there may be some things that we may not need to teach anymore, because kids can get it instantly off of the internet.  Beyond the walls of the schools, there are a lot of places that teach, and the internet right now is the most powerful.
Story_ID: 306774
Speaker 1: What do you think the Internet is the most effective at teaching?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  I think it's difficult to say.  But it's going to become even more prominent, I think, in the teaching and learning process in the years ahead.  Because the access to data is so instant and so much more accessible than to wait until you publish it and print it somewhere else.  So I think that's going to be one of our challenges.  And the bigger challenge associated with that is teaching kids how to think.  Because once they get all this information flooding them on the screen, can they look at it and make appropriate decisions by having the capacity to do the kind of thinking that we need for appropriateness in decision-making?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Has there, has there been a--I know you had the religious issue.  But has there been any issues of terms of the quality, I mean the curriculum, in terms of black studies in the curriculum in the State of Georgia?
Speaker 2: Has there been a push for that?
Speaker 1: Any--or any resistance to it, or a push for it?
Speaker 2: There hasn't been a resistance to it.  There has been a movement to make it inclusive, to be inclusive with cultures of not only the Africa American segment of it, but also the Hispanic and the Asian segment, because those are vastly fast-growing populations in the South and in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Right, right.

Speaker 1: And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired educator, and I'm presently serving as executive secretary of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity.

Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is August 23, 2005.

Speaker 1: I think where we left off was around 1987 when you were appointed assistant superintendent in the Office of Instructional Services for the State of Georgia.  Can you tell us a little bit about what you did in that capacity?
Speaker 2: Well, I was the first African American to serve as the chief instructional officer, if you will, for the state, supervising the Office of Instructional Services.  And this was one of the largest departments in the Department of Education [Georgia Department of Education] that dealt with curriculum and instruction and all of the related policy issues associated with that, and giving occasional directions to school systems on the curriculum, on curriculum and instruction.  It also encompassed the vocational and educational testing and assessment, and special education.  It was quite a challenging assignment.
Speaker 1: In terms of--now you have a background in vocational education.  I mean you spent a lot of time in graduate school dealing with that, right?  Vocational education and--.
Speaker 2: Not really.  My undergraduate degree [from Fort Valley State College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] was in business education with a minor in English.  And my graduate work was in educational leadership.  And when I did the doctorate [at Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia], I had a minor area in business management.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm completely wrong (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 305263
Speaker 1: What were the major challenges in this job [chief instructional officer, Office of Instructional Services, Georgia Department of Education] in terms of--?  I know in African American circles educators are--not just educators, but people of all walks of life are challenged by testing.  And it's--is there any such thing as a fair test for--are tests, like, culturally loaded, or--?  I think people have--testing experts have talked about tests being culturally loaded one way or the other.  And can you--.
Speaker 2: Well, the tests are normally loaded or geared toward what should have been, or ought to have been taught.  Now whether children will actually, young people were actually taught that or not, happens to be in a different arena.  The other part of that coin is how well prepared they have been in language and with language development.  All testing is language centered.  And the kids need a good, strong language background to do well on tests.  There may be some cultural biases associated with testing.  But if our goal is to get all children at a certain level, then we have to remove ourselves from putting a stigma as to what's causing them not to do that, and to teach them what they need to know in order for them to do well in the area that we're assessing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you say the key is what's being taught; you're not--?
Speaker 2: I think that's the key.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And how well is it being taught?   And how well is it being assessed before we get to looking at or giving kids standardized tests.
Story_ID: 305264
Speaker 1: So, in your role [as chief instructional officer, Office of Instructional Services, Georgia Department of Education] you would--would you look at tests to--I mean in relationship to what has been taught, and how?
Speaker 2: Well, at the state, we dealt with minimums.  We dealt with what would be a minimum kind of expectation in this content area, or in that content area?  We didn't--local school districts took it to the max.  We dealt with the minimum.  We saw lots of discrepancies in the assessment of young people back in the '80s [1980s].  But some of those deficiencies were so powerful that people did not want to actually deal with them, as they related to ethnic--. When you disaggregated the data and looked at ethnic background, and backgrounds associated with other demographic factors, nobody wanted to touch that.  In today's environment, we can't avoid looking at all of those kinds of things.  If we addressed some of that early on, it's possible that we may not be where we are in some areas today, with continuing this major mismatch between where we think kids ought to be nationally and in the international arena, and where they really are in their settings today.
Speaker 1: Can you give us an example of what you're talking about in terms of that?
Speaker 2: Well, we knew that, for instance, we knew that black kids were not doing well on tests long before it got to be a popular thing to talk about.  We knew that black males were not doing as well as black females, or white males or females on tests long before it got to be a popular thing.  But the powers that be would not permit us at that time to identify these specific groups.  We, in Georgia, we could identify back in the '80s [1980s] at least seventeen or eighteen school systems that were predominantly African American with lots of problems and limitations.  But nobody wanted to put special funding, or special kinds of initiatives in those particular schools.  We had people right here in Georgia who were directing programs nationally, that were trying to address some of the problems of racial disparity in education.  But we couldn't get people at the state level to embrace that sort of thing.  On the one hand, you say, well, it may have had some advantages.  Because we were trying to use the same cookbook for everybody, but it didn't work.  And we're seeing the realities of that today.
Story_ID: 305265
Speaker 1: What kinds of assistance, or what kind of special programs would the black community need?  I mean, or specifically, black males need that, you know, aren't provided in the cookbook that's used for everybody else?
Speaker 2: Well, first and foremost, they need good teachers.  And they need nurturing, encouraging, supportive, and I have faith in you kind of teachers.  And that's been missing.  The second thing that I think is needed is an environment in the larger community that nurtures, supports, and sustains its nurturing and supporting of young people, whether they're black males, or females or whatever.  And a lot of that starts, of course, at home, and is reinforced in lots of other places where kids would interact between the home and the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm not expecting you to be an expert on all of this.  But it seems to me that we've got--what you're describing is a cultural problem that starts in the classroom, where the teacher, for some reason, is not nurturing and teaching, you know, certain students the way they approach others, you know, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, one of the problems you had, and especially in the South was--and I don't think it's getting any better.  The majority of the teachers in the classrooms were white females.  Many of them had had no contact beyond the contact that they had when the kids showed up at their door to take their course--with these kids.  A lot of these kids were misdiagnosed for special education, which occasioned dropouts for some of them, which occasioned them acting out--behaviors that put them into behavior disorder kinds of classes and special learning disabilities classes.  There was a large body of work done in the late '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] dealing with the disproportionate number of African American males and African Americans in particular in special education.  Well, you look at special education and you say, every child has an IEP, an Individualized Education Plan.  And you're working with them, trying to alleviate--and all of this.  But there was also the stigma of being in a special class.  I don't care how you cut it, when you say special education, it means that you're mentally deficient in the minds of the larger community.  Well, somehow we failed to incorporate, in our teacher preparation programs, the nuances of what people needed in dealing with special populations when they actually hit the classroom.  And if you didn't provide a customized staff development program in the school, in many instances the problems were intensified.  Surprisingly enough, a lot of kids broke through, and in spite of--prevailed and did well.  But they were kids who normally were very obedient; kids who, you know, followed a script well.  But for a lot of kids, that was just not the norm.  They needed discipline, they needed nurturing, they needed support.  They needed lots of other things.  Some kids come to school with that; others don't.  And I think teachers have a responsibility of helping that come about, and principals have the responsibility in leading toward that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it seems we have a problem that's almost like a--there's a--I guess whatever the sociological conditions that produce--or family conditions that produce--it doesn't, it's not easily, you know, taught in the school environment we're in today.  And you're saying we need to modify how we approach teaching?
Speaker 2: Well, I think teaching and learning today is very, there's a very different way of doing it from the way we used to do it.  Kids learn beyond the walls of the schools.  There're lots of places that teach, and kids learn very well in those different environments without any coaching, without anything.  And I think we're having to re-assess how we teach in this 21st century, and also re-assess what we're teaching, and the relevancy of it.
Story_ID: 305266
Speaker 1: I know in the late '80s [1980s] black educators around the country began to advocate African-centered instruction, especially in the social studies areas and that sort of thing.  There was a Portland [Oregon] model created, adopted by the Portland school system [Portland Public Schools] that was, it sort of toured the country.  You know, various school systems looked at it.  Some people took parts of it, some people took the whole thing, some people didn't take anything out of it.  What did you think about the African-centered education movement?
Speaker 2: I think there were a lot of advantages for doing that.  Prior to integration and desegregation, we spent a lot of time with young people, helping them understand their culture, helping them understand the history of the race, helping them understand and appreciate the contributors to civilization who were of color.  And with the transition that we went through, the social movement that we went through in changing schools, we lost a lot of that.  There was a lot of advantages that came out of models like that.  The problem was that most of those models were not sustained; they were short-lived.  And the other part of the problem was they were not necessarily incorporated throughout the curriculum.  It was this class down the hall that dealt exclusively with this, but nobody else on that hallway touched it.  And I think that may have been one of the downfalls.  We never, in Georgia, could get a stronger emphasis in an area like that, beyond the celebration of February as Black History Month.  That's when the majority of it took place.  And our emphasis even then, for whatever reasons, in most places were primarily centered around African American kids.  I did have the privilege of going into lots of schools where all of the children were involved in the celebration of Black History Month, but that was rare.
Story_ID: 305267
Speaker 1: So what are the demographics in the Georgia public schools when you were--what were they in those days?
Speaker 2: Probably 20-something percent of, 26 percent of my students were African American, and the rest Anglo-Saxon and others.  It's shifting now.  It's probably, the African-American population is probably higher, and the Hispanic population has significantly grown in the state.  So, now you're dealing with multiple layers of diversity, as opposed to just two.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.  Things have changed quite a bit over the last few years.  In a city like Atlanta [Georgia], how--what percentage of the public schools were black then and now?
Speaker 2: I don't know what, I couldn't give you the exact percentages.  But I think you had a higher, you probably had a more balanced ratio than you may have now.  And I don't know what that ratio is now, but I think it's probably--pretty high African American.  But it probably approached a more balanced approach back twenty years ago.
Story_ID: 305268
Speaker 1: Where does the resistance come from when it comes to African American studies in the curriculum?  Does it--is it something that just comes from white teachers, or is it from black teachers as well?  Or, what is the (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it's difficult to put your fingers on it.  I think it's--first of all, whether people can teach and incorporate that into a curriculum becomes important.  You don't want folks teaching that who have no feel for it.  I'm not suggesting that there is a resistance to it.  I think the problem has been that there's no leadership for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess what I'm getting at is that it doesn't--it's been advocated for since the 1930s.  In New York, Dr. Willis Huggins [Willis Nathaniel Huggins] advocated for it, and got it included in the New York school curriculum, and it dropped out at some point.  And other people periodically--you know, in the late '60s [1960s] we had like a surge, and then certain courses were added and then they just dropped out again.  Does it have, I know it doesn't have like mainstream support.  But--
Speaker 2: Well, the primary source for most classrooms have been textbooks, for source information.  And textbooks have been very conservative and cautious in their presentations of African American history, beyond those companies that would specialize in producing that kind of work for a classroom.  So, a lot of it's been occasioned by that.  And when it is incorporated in text, it's normally been in the middle of the book or near the back of the book.  It's rare to have--and I haven't looked at any recently.  But at that time, it was rare to look at the incorporation of that at the early chapters and to see it woven throughout the book.  And I think that's the kind of approach you'd have to use, especially when teachers are heavily relying on textbooks as the center for instruction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there special problems in a state like Georgia, I mean in a southern state, as opposed to--I know in the North, the education community is largely indifferent to African American educational values.
Speaker 2: I don't think there's any real difference between it.  I think you do have strong arguments about separatism that creeps in.  And of course, you come back to the notion of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] conversation about the beloved community, where you would like to see everything drawn together as one community, with each receiving equal kinds of treatment in terms of instruction or whatever it is you're doing.  But I think the problems are the same all over.
Story_ID: 305269
Speaker 1: I know that there's a general cry in the education community that we need to catch up with--it used to be in the '60s [1960s] that we catch up with the Russians [Soviets], you know.  We weren't, we weren't strong enough in math and science across the country.  And once again, in the African American community, this is not one of the strengths of the educational curriculum I guess in terms of--I don't know if--it's not the curriculum's fault, but, you know.  But what's the, what are your thoughts on strengthening, you know, math and science capacity in the schools?
Speaker 2: I think you strengthen math and science and all of the other content areas by strengthening support of education in the home.  The issue we have today, as a larger issue, is preparing young people to compete in a global society.  And competition in a global society requires language and the appropriate usage of language.  It also requires the numeracy of the literacy in terms of numbers and mathematics, and that sort of thing.  And it also requires some understanding of the geography of the world, and of course, the commerce of the world.  Financial literacy becomes one of the key things that kids need to have some understanding about today.  So, the issue right now is preparing kids for a global society.  And that means giving them a good foundation in all of the content areas, from mathematics, to reading, to foreign language on down.  But first and foremost, give 'em a language base--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for communication.
Story_ID: 305270
Speaker 1: In 1995, you became the deputy superintendent of external affairs for the state of Georgia Department of Education [Georgia Department of Education], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did you do in that capacity?
Speaker 2: Well, that, in that particular role we handled a lot of the liaison activities with other state agencies, with the university system in a special P-16 project, where we were looking at a seamless education system that would go from pre-school through college.  We also were responsible for all of the leadership development for principals and aspiring principals, through the Administrative Leadership Academy [Georgia Leadership Academy].  And we also had responsibility for professional development.  And this was professional development of not only administrators, but also of teachers; of administering the funds from the state to local school districts that would help them prepare their teachers in various areas for working with young people.
Story_ID: 305271
Speaker 1: You worked for the State of Georgia in education, I guess from '77 [1977] through 2002?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What would you consider to be the highlight of your work, you know?
Speaker 2: There were two or three things.  One was, when I was in charge of state schools and public libraries [Office of State Schools and Public Libraries], it was the expansion of the public library system.  We had a state board of education that was very interested and supportive of that.  And we had also a governor, Governor Harris [Joe Frank Harris], who was also very supportive of strengthening public libraries in the state.  They foresaw the need for having our citizens close to information, and that sort of thing.  I think another highlight was the work that we did with our state-operated schools for the handicapped, and building new facilities for the campuses for the school for the deaf and the School for the Blind [Georgia Academy for the Blind, Macon, Georgia].  I'm particularly proud of the work we did there, and especially in implementing a program for young hearing impaired students.  We had many young people who were born with hearing impairments.  And the idea started with a teacher in the Atlanta Area School for the Deaf [Clarkston, Georgia], of having a program where there would be a cadre of people to work with parents of these young children who were born deaf or hearing impaired, to get them prepared for coming toward the school.  And that program developed into what's known as the Georgia PINES program [Georgia Parent Infant Network for Educational Services].  And from that work, a lot of good came forth for deaf students.  I am very proud of the work that I was involved in, in the area of curriculum and the development of the quality core curriculum for Georgia schools.  This was not, of course, the first curriculum that was developed for Georgia schools.  But it was our first shot at looking at a curriculum that was getting ready for a new century.
Speaker 1: Can I just--we're getting ready to roll out of tape.  I just wanted to ask you like what year was the public library system--.
Speaker 2: That was back in '78 [1977], '79 [1979], '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: And the handicapped schools, the new schools for the handicapped?
Speaker 2: It was '80 [1980], '82 [1982], '83 [1983]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that area.
Story_ID: 305272
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were telling us before we broke, about the quality core curriculum that you developed (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was one of the things I was very proud that we were able to do [through the Office of Instructional Services, Georgia Department of Education].
Speaker 1: About what year was that?
Speaker 2: That would have been around '83 [1983], '84 [1984], somewhere in there.  It ushered in a new era for us in terms of the kinds of things we were focusing on in schools--science, mathematics, foreign languages, and of course a heavy emphasis on language arts and language development for young people.
Story_ID: 305273
Speaker 1: Okay, the other area that we--that I was proud we were able to do during my tenure as--in the role of associate superintendent for curriculum and instruction [for the Georgia Department of Education], was integrating vocational education into the general education curriculum, and not having that as a separate stand-alone kind of entity.
Speaker 2: Has that become, I mean does vocational education, when it's left as a stand-alone like that, become sort of a satellite of the regular school curriculum?
Speaker 1: Well--.
Speaker 2: Seemed like it did when I was in school.
Speaker 1: Well, it--.
Speaker 2: Like, I would go to shop--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and it'd be in the basement and it'd be separated from everybody else.
Speaker 1: Well, it was, but it was separated a bit more than that.  It was, we were preparing kids for areas that were not necessarily the most desirable in terms of getting the value from the dollars we were spending on education.  Like, to become a beautician--when they could get a good footing in high school and then go to a technical college and take that up, and start where they needed to start, rather than spending all those hours in the secondary school doing that.  So--.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So instead of being taught to read, they were being taught to be a beautician, instead of--.
Speaker 1: In some instances we had, you know, basket weaving and other kinds of things, in the name of vocational education (laughter).  And there is definitely a place for occupational training, and I don't want to downplay that at all.  But at the secondary level, the emphasis really needs to be--as much as you can place--on the acquisition of the core skills that's needed in language, and science, and mathematics, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Sooner or later, you're going to have to--.
Speaker 1: And all of that is incorporated in the vocations, and the technology of all of that.
Speaker 2: All right.  That's something that I don't think people will have thought through, you know, in terms of that.  So, the State of Georgia actually prioritized--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the basics.
Speaker 1: We were one of the first states to integrate our, to bring our vocational and general curriculum together in the South.
Story_ID: 305274
Speaker 1: What was the state of education in the South?  I mean how did it stack up to the rest of the country, or the North, I mean in--back in the days when you started, I mean before you developed this core curriculum [through the Office of Instructional Services, Georgia Department of Education]?  Was it, was it--you know, we've heard lots of peculiar things about southern education, you know, students not being able to go to school back in the days--. I mean when you were coming up, some people didn't go to school because of agricultural responsibilities, or you know--I don't know.  I mean, what was the state of education here in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always felt that we had a fair, a very decent educational system even when we were segregated.  We probably had a better educational system, as African Americans, when we were segregated than we did when we integrated.  We had more variety when we integrated, and we were more centered in diverse sort of ways with education.  But you had more of a focus on the fundamentals of reading, writing, arithmetic, good citizenship, and some other things that made the quality of life for one good--that was emphasized in many of those schools.  Now, the problem I think is compounded when you try to compare apples with oranges.  To compare a school in the Detroit [Michigan] inner city in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] with a school in a very rural remote area in the South, I think you're really comparing apples and oranges.  Those kids are exposed to a lot more stuff than the kids in this rural setting would be exposed to.  A lot of that would manifest itself in different ways--language, critical thinking skills as opposed to obedience rules; seeing an array of occupational areas that they could go into as opposed to seeing people who can do only these kinds of things, at least as far as the aspiration goes, unless you get away from here.  I used to tell my kids when I worked in the rural area [Sylvania, Georgia] that the day you get your high school diploma, I hope you get a bus ticket to get as far away from this place as you can.  Because you will have a new life when you get away and you see what's happening in other environments.  There was nothing for them there to aspire to.  And you know, I say, "Go, get away, and get as much education as you can, and then come back and help change things."  And many of them never returned.  Once you leave this village tribal setting, and you go into a place where it's much more expansive, with opportunities and with other kinds of things, it's very difficult to come back to that former environment, unless you wait many years when you're ready to do some other kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's been the story of black migration--
Speaker 2: Migration, yes.
Speaker 1: --in the 20th century, basically.  A lot of people leave these rural settings and never come back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Except to visit maybe.  But--
Speaker 2: I shudder to think what would have happened if many of them had stayed and taken advantage of the educational opportunities that were available to them in some of those places, like going to some of the colleges that were around, and what have you.  But I taught kids who came out of high school who would have been well-prepared to go somewhere, but they just didn't have any support system.  They had nobody that had the money to send them.  They would have, they normally would have had to be very bright to get scholarships or to get some kind of loan to go.  Many of them did not see the advantage of taking out a federal loan, or getting a loan to go to school.  They saw that as, they didn't see the long-term advantage of it.  It was difficult to get many kids to see that sort of thing.  And all of that has to come into play, when you talk about making comparisons I think, between the North, South, and other areas.
Story_ID: 305275
Speaker 1: The year I guess that you retired from the Georgia--from the State of Georgia, you became the president of the Association for the Study of Curriculum [sic. Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD)]?
Speaker 2: That was the year before I retired, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.  Well, tell us about--now you've been a part of ASCD for many years.  And you were the co-founder of the African American Critical Issues Network within ASCD.  What is that?
Speaker 2: The African American Critical Issues Network was a network that three or four of us got together and decided at a conference in Orlando, Florida--.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: I guess that must have been around '81 [1981], '82 [1982].  There had been a heavy discussion on assessment testing.  And all of the presenters were white presenters.  And most of the emphasis was on kids that they had done experimental research with, and other kinds of things.  And several of us led by Dr. Helena Hodges, who was with ASCD at that time, decided that we, there were some issues in education that were really not being addressed by either the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development--which was one of the largest educational organizations in the world--or really the American--the AERA, the American Educational Research Association.  So we came up at this time with critical issues impacting negatively African American students.  Chief among those were testing, language acquisition, standard American English, and also fostering a culture in schools where the diverse backgrounds of students were embraced, nurtured, and supported.  So, the network grew from about four to maybe a hundred fifty members, and then later to more members.  And each year at the annual conference, we would put on a special program that would address some critical issue that was impacting negatively African American students.  I've been involved with the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development since about 1978 when I first went to the state department of education [Georgia Department of Education] as a member.  And later I got involved as a member of the executive council.  And from my membership on the executive council, I ran for president-elect of the association.
Story_ID: 305276
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I had been involved in a lot of the committee work of the ASCD [Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development] also, the new governance structure they were trying to bring about.  I served on the international advisory committee, the international polling committee, and just found their work to be--the work with the association to be incredibly helpful to me in my role at the state department of education [Georgia Department of Education].
Speaker 2: Okay, let's see.  Now, you were, you became president of the ASCD in 2002, right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Now what did you do as president?
Speaker 1: As president, I presided at all of our executive committee meetings.  I had an option to travel during that year of my presidency to New Zealand to visit the educational schools in that area.  We visited schools and colleges and universities.
Speaker 2: Did you pay particular emphasis to, I mean attention to the Maori schools?
Speaker 1: We did, we did.  As a matter of fact, as we talked with people there, they were very concerned about initiatives that had taken place in America dealing with desegregation, because they had similar kinds of problems.  There did not seem to be some of the problems that we experienced in America with the Maori population, but some of our conditions and concerns were similar.  As a matter of fact, I visited schools with heavy populations of those children, and we had a lot of interaction with educators there.  They were putting a lot of emphasis on recapturing their culture, and recapturing their history, and incorporating their history as a major part of the curriculum also, similar to some of our experiences here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that sort of, kind of, rings true all over the world, I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That people need to know who they are, on some level.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Well, with ASCD, I did get a chance to do a lot of international travel.  And in looking at educational systems, we spent some time in Israel, in Jerusalem, and the Palestinian area looking at--and in Tel Aviv [Israel] at the university there.  We spent time in England looking at some of the issues that they were starting to address as it related to more children of color coming into their system, and similar kinds of concerns about what did you do in America?  How did you handle this, as more and more children come into a culture that has been British primarily, although these kids are coming from former British colonies?
Speaker 2: You've got Indians [Native Americans], you've got, you know, African groups.
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: Caribbean groups.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Lots of different kinds of people.
Story_ID: 305277
Speaker 1: I know the theme of the conference [for the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD)] I think in 2003 was Igniting the Passion for Learning.  And this is at the core of the message you usually give teachers, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the theme that my committee and I selected for that annual conference.  We had, and we still have a challenge with young people of igniting for them a passion for lifelong learning.  And I think we start with learning, period.  Believe it or not, these kids will not wait five or four years to receive or to hear about new and cutting-edge kinds of information.  It flashes on the screens of their computers as soon as it happens.  As soon as whatever research group has concluded this, we hear about it; we don't wait until it's published in the textbooks.  There are new ways of acquiring information and data, and all of us have to become what I consider to be lifelong learners.  Every day, we're learning something.  We're all students, learning something new and different.  And the challenge in schools is to take away the boredom factor, especially at the secondary level.  And there has been a lot of emphasis now placed on education at the secondary level.  Kids seem to be very excited in elementary.  They're quasi-excited in middle school, and you know, that's a difficult period.  But high school gets to be a challenge.  And igniting a passion not only for learning, but for teaching, in teaching, in teachers, becomes a challenge.
Speaker 1: Now, that is a challenge.  And how do you think--it would seem like, well, you've got a captive group.  You've got teachers and they earn a salary, you know, the school system is paying them.  I mean, like, can't they--you know, what--it seems like it would be easy to get them excited about--.
Speaker 2: It's far more than just money.  It's far more than a paycheck.  It has everything to do with leadership in the schools.  It has everything to do with how much support do you give them, how much nurturing do you do?  How much listening to them do you do?  How easy do you try to make their work?  They deal with some very challenging situations.  They have no control over who comes in their classrooms, but they're expected to deal with every child who comes in there, and to be effective in doing that.  They're expected to raise test scores, they're expected to raise achievement levels.  There's a lot of expectations, but many of them don't get the nurturing and support they need from whoever the administrators are and the other people there.  And this is something I think you have to do if you're going to ignite that passion.  Because all of them are there--I believe with all my heart that all of them are there because they want to be there to teach.  I don't know of too many folks who go into teaching just to say well, I need a job, so I'm going to teach.  Most of them go there because they're committed to making a difference for young people.
Story_ID: 305278
Speaker 1: So what happens to teachers that--they go into--is it easy to just--I mean because you hear, you know, stories about apathetic teachers who just seem to be going through the motions.  And I've heard teachers complain that the product that they get, in terms of the student, is so disconnected from learning that it frustrates them to the point that they stop trying, or they may pick one or two students to teach, I mean to really teach.
Speaker 2: It's a challenge.  It's, it's a very different world out there.  And I don't know what we can do to eradicate some of the issues that you're talking about.  One of the things that a lot of emphasis has been placed on in schools is bringing a closer relationship between the home and the school, so that we can cooperate intelligently in the education of children.  And that's a daunting task, too, especially with parents having multiple occupations and schedules that they have to work around.  And many children have been pretty much on their own, young people.  But I do think it starts with creating a culture in the school where you celebrate what people try to do.
Speaker 1: Is there a model that you know of where the schools have, I mean, a regular neighborhood school has been able to reach out to the parents?
Speaker 2: Oh, there are plenty of good examples all over the country.  But that's one of the things we have to avoid, and that is there are no aspirins that you can pass out and it will happen.  Everything has to be customized to the culture in that building.  And we have to stop this business of programs--of buying a program, and this and that and the other.  Programs don't really make a difference.  It's the people we've entrusted to operate and implement those programs who really make the difference.  However you cut it, you come back to the people factor--whoever's in that classroom, whoever's in that building as the principal.  And I think schools are becoming, I hope they're becoming small enough again for us to start making that kind of a difference, and igniting those kinds of passions in teachers and in young people.

Speaker 1: We live in a time, too, in the black community especially, and it's probably true in the Latino community, and to some extent in the white community that--to the extent they go to public school-- that the students that have a harder time learning, or, and have less resources and connections in the educational system end up becoming isolated from the more successful students.  In Chicago [Illinois] I know we have magnet schools, and everybody--any concerned parent in Chicago knows that if you really want your son or daughter to get a good education in the public school system, which black people dominate by over 85 percent, you've got to know where to send them to school.  And you have to know some teachers to get them into these magnet programs, and where the other students are concerned about learning and they have parental support.  The other students just seem to be, you know, they go to regular public high schools, and they struggle; I mean it's a struggle.
Speaker 2: Well, that's unfortunate, because of several factors.  First of all, we've always known that parents who take an interest--parents who are vocal, parents who speak up, get the best for their children.  Schools have always responded to middle class parents in ways that they've never responded to parents who live at or below the poverty line, for some reason.  We ought not to have come to a point where we have to identify a school for a kid to be successful in.  But that's the story of where we are in education in America today.  And that's a part of the fallacy of No Child Left Behind [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001].  When we make the assumption that we are going to do all of these kinds of things just because we want more--we want you to tell us your test scores--we're going identify your school as a failing school--who wants to send their kid to a failing school?  And then there are some parents who could care less, as long as they get them out of the house.  And that's unfortunate, too.  So we've got some major--what I like to call--you've got to create a culture for appreciating the value of an education.  And that's something we've lost in lots of places.  Kids are not going to be able to function without it.  And we need--and it's unfortunate--we wait--and let them wait ten years after they get out of high school, or five years, to realize that they need to go back and do what they should have done five or ten years ago.  But parents are the key to most of this I think, parents and community leaders.  But we've also got to have some boards of education in place.  See, we fail to look at the governance part of the educational system.  You've also got to have some boards of education in place, and insist on excellence in these school settings, whether they're urban, rural, or whatever, and will settle for nothing less than that, rather than throwing in the towel and saying well, this is the way the kids are; this is the way the community is, and there's nothing we can do about it.
Story_ID: 305280
Speaker 1: That brings us to maybe the discussion of No Child Left Behind [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001].  That seems to be a product of a belief in government that started even back during the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] years, of looking at quantifiable results of things--everything, you know.  If you're going to have a social service program, if you're going--whatever you're going to do--what are the quantifiable results?  And if you couldn't really show a quantifiable result, you know, then you must not be doing anything, you know.  So I think that's the--correct me if I'm wrong.  What's the thinking behind the emphasis on testing, and No Child Left Behind?
Speaker 2: Well, I think a lot of it is built on a business model.  And when you look at the fact that we spend billions of dollars in America on education, the bottom line is we ought to be seeing far more success than we're seeing.  The variable that we're dealing with is human, and you can't process and program kids in ways that you could in the grocery store over here.  The manager over here wants this kind of productivity.  He has all of the caveats to get it.  When a kid shows up in my classroom, I have to deal with them where they are.  It may be six months before I can get him to recognize the language, some of the language he's going to see on the test.  But that's where we probably ought to be.  If there's one good thing about No Child Left Behind, I think it is the fact that we are asking people to make decisions based on research.  We've got a wealth of research in education that we've not spent a lot of time using.  I question, as others have, getting to the forefront of the heavy emphasis on testing.  And I really have a problem with identifying low performing schools.
Story_ID: 306775
Speaker 1: We were talking about No Child Left Behind [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001], and you were giving us your analysis of that.
Speaker 2: Well, there are some good features to it, but I think there are some features that could stand some major kinds of revisions, in terms of what our expectations are.  As I said earlier, teachers have no control over who comes into the classroom.  That's no reason to give them the excuse to fail, but at the same time, I wonder if some of the expectations are as realistic as they possibly should be.  But time will tell.
Speaker 1: As we sit here today, in fact today it was announced that the State of Connecticut is suing the federal government over the No Child Left Behind legislation, saying that it was--to require them to meet the standards of No Child Left Behind by law, it's not fair, because they don't have the resources.  They've been allocating resources by which to keep up with the testing, you know, and--
Speaker 2: It's expensive legislation.
Speaker 1: And they said that as a result they're forced to basically teach children how to take a test in the classroom, rather than--and I think you had some strong feelings about that--teaching kids to take a test.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I think you--certainly we want to have them be successful on the testing instruments.  But you've got to give them a language base, and many kids don't have that.  We could spend far more time on language development with young people.  Standard American English is almost, it's a prerequisite for doing well on tests, from my perspective--
Story_ID: 306776
Speaker 1: So, you were, you were president of ASCD [Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development] for one year.  And I know you're involved in other professional and educational organizations.  Do you want to talk about any of the others?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  All right, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I've had a very rich career serving in lots of various roles.  I was the chairman of the National Dropout Prevention Network.  I did some of their early work with the federal government in testing the definition for dropouts.  It's, I just worked in a lot of different areas.  I served on the advisory committee for the SAT when they were doing the transitioning from the old SAT to the new SAT.  So I've had lots of rich, rich, experiences in education.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your current position with the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], as it's popularly known.
Speaker 2: I am the Grand Grammateus of the Grand Boule of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity.  And that is the position of executive secretary.  I manage the day to day operations of the fraternity.  The Boule is a fraternity of men of high achievement who reside throughout the United States.  And our members, we have 112 member Boules, and we have one member Boule in Nassau, in the Bahamas.  It's a very challenging position, having an opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest minds in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is an African American organization?
Speaker 2: Yes, founded in 1904.  We just celebrated our 100th anniversary last year in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with Alpha Boule, the founding member Boule.
Speaker 1: And what is the purpose of the organization?
Speaker 2: Binding men of like qualities together is our ultimate goal, and fostering and nurturing brotherhood in its purest and truest sense.  We are a graduate chapter; we have no undergraduate chapters.  And one is invited to become a member who embraces those tenets of getting to know the best of one another, and fostering brotherhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But other than the social aspect of it, I know there are things that--the Boule actually supports various initiatives in the community, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We have a strong public policy program, a social action program, where we encourage our member Boules to give back to communities by developing programs for young people.  We give scholarships to young people.  We have mentoring programs for young people, and leadership development programs for young people.  To see them with very influential men and to interact with them, we think it is, and will be, an inspiration to the young people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm sure you've probably heard this.  Now this is, there's a conspiracy theory about the Boule and what it's supposed to be doing, and who the African American members of the Boule are, and who they're accountable to.  Have you heard any of that kind of talk?
Speaker 2: I've heard that.  I won't respond to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's stuff on the Internet about it, you know.  But it's taken on a--.
Speaker 2: We are who we are, and we don't apologize for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And our ultimate goal is always to do good, and to look out for the betterment of our communities, and the improvement of the quality of life for African American men and women.
Story_ID: 306778
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask.  And you've addressed some of it already.  But what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That we will stop some of the rhetoric about why things are not as they should be, and get on with the task of helping to ensure that they are as they should be.  That we will reassess leadership, and start holding people completely accountable if they're going to represent us.  And it appears that we're going to have that as a major, major area of governance to deal with, based on the political landscape.  I think we're going to have to re-think the way we've done things in the past.  And this is going to be especially true in view of the younger generation that is coming forth in new leadership roles that will probably embrace some things that may be different and out of the box.  Knowing who we are becomes critically important for any group of people.  And we've got to make sure that that story is told, that it's told with high levels of accuracy, and that it's permeated throughout America society.  I'm often reminded of a quote from James Baldwin that young people may not do what we want them to do, but they are going to be, and they're going to become a part of what we let them be and become.  And we have a major, major piece of work to do in trying to address and redirect some of the energy, the emphasis, and the vision for young men and women of color.  And I think we're going to have to live with the reality that in America, race still matters.  And I don't see that going away for quite a while.  Now, I know that the demographics from the futurists tell us that by the middle of this century we're going to see a heavy browning of America.  And maybe by that time, it will have, you know, dissipated.  But I do feel that we're going to have to remain sensitive to issues that are keeping people from being as successful as they could be.  We are probably one of the most, we probably are the most envied nation the universe.  But--and there's no reason today to say that anybody couldn't be anything that they wanted to be.  If it's an Indian [Native American] chief, opportunities or resources are there; it's just a matter of taking advantage of 'em.
Story_ID: 306779
Speaker 1: On regard to the change in the demographics of Atlanta [Georgia] and of Georgia, what has the growing Latino population, mostly from Mexican extraction, done to the balance of--here?  Because it used to be, as you said, black and white.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's increasing.  We haven't seen, from my perspective, a significant increase in the governance.  They're serving as mayors, city council people, and those kinds of folks.  But I think that's on the drawing board.  And that's why I think we're going to start, we're going to need to start holding people accountable if they're going to represent the government, and that sort of thing.  I think there's a new order of things coming for this new century.  And I don't know quite what that order is, but I do know it's going to have an international flavor to it.  And we aren't going to be able to, and nor should we, hold on to things that we were celebrating and honoring twenty-five or thirty years ago in this new millennium.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we're gonna have to share power.
Speaker 2: We're going to have to share it, and we're going to have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Political power.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 306780
Speaker 1: Tell me, when you look back at everything you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No.  I probably would have stayed in the classroom a little longer.  Because you can make such a difference with young people in a classroom, but the economic realities, as opposed to staying there and moving on to administration, makes it very attractive to move into administration.  If I had not gone into teaching, I probably would have gone into some area of music.  But I have no regrets.  I've had a beautiful journey in education, and a career.  And I really have no regrets.
Story_ID: 306781
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done up to this point, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I tried to help as many people as I could.  I tried to touch the lives of as many young people as I could.  And I tried always to treat others as I wanted to be treated.  I think in the process, I taught a lot of lessons to people who probably had no prior exposure to people of color.  And I guess those contributions to human kind, would probably be more important to me than some of the plaques and the other kinds of awards that I have received over the years.
Story_ID: 306782
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family?  Do you have children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, I was--oh yeah, I have two daughters [Rachelle Williams and Tara Williams], a Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] graduate, and a Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama] graduate, who are both doing very well.  One is a management consultant.  The other is a graduate student in music, and teaching at the university part-time.  My wife [Sandra Pryor Williams] is principal of an elementary school in the City of Atlanta [Georgia].  And herself, she is from a distinguished family of educators.  Her great aunt was Lucy Laney [Lucy Craft Laney], whose portrait hangs in the State Capitol [Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia], who founded one of the first private schools for blacks in Georgia.  That's my family.
Story_ID: 306783
Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered--as I told you about the legacy piece, you know, he tried to make a difference.  He tried to do what he could with what he had.  And he did the very best that he could do in everything that he tried to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
