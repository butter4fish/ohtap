What about junior high school kids?  Rough.  What   s rough about them?  Didn   t want to be restricted in any manner.  How did you teach them?  You just don   t do that. But I never had to spank anybody. There   s a way  to get their respect and you have to find it.  Did you have a favorite student?  Oh yeah, but I tried not to show   you can   t keep from showing it,  because they can see what you do. I had the reputation of having good  discipline, and I taught junior high, seven through nine. And if you can  find a rougher bunch to teach school, I want to see them. Are you a  teacher?  Yeah.  You   re going to be?  Already am.  Are you still in school?  No.  Huh.  No.  Oh.  19  Bishop  R.
