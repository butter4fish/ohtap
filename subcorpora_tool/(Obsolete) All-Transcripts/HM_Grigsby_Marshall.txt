Story_ID: 93811
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family.  I'm first going to ask about your mother then your father.  But can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Rosalyn, R-O-S-A-L-Y-N, Thomasena, T-H-O-M-A-S-E-N-A, Marshall, M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L, Grigsby, G-R-I-G-S-B-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born on January 16, 1919 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now what was her background and what do you know about her ancestors?
Speaker 2: She is a retired schoolteacher.  She taught Biology and Chemistry primarily at the high school level.  She also for a time was a reporter.  She was stringer with the Pittsburgh Courier and with several other publications, but primarily she spent most of her life as an Educator.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about her parents, what (unclear)
Speaker 2: Her mother died when she was 16 years old.  I'd never had a chance to meet her, she had three very strong aunts who help to raise her and they were the ones responsible really for getting her into school.  She went to Barber-Scotia College [Concord, North Carolina] and then on to Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina].  Her stepfather was a Presbyterian Minister who also worked with the Postal Service on mail cars with the railroad.
Speaker 1: What was his name, do you know?
Speaker 2: His name was Reverend Allen E. Cephas, C-E-P-H-A-S.  Allen Edward Cephas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us if you have any stories from that side of the family that are passed down from the 19th century about slavery or reconstruction or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I really don't. I spent most of my time with my father's side of the family, because my mother's side was pretty much scattered.  We would meet, but not on a regular occasion, so.  The one story that I do that I do recall from one of her aunts she had an old rope bed that she said that her grandfather, who was a slave, carried this when they became free and carried it from place to place.  That ultimately ended up in my possession, they left it to me.  But that was a very strong--it is a very strong heavy piece of furniture, and I can just imagine someone carrying that on their back, particularly throughout North Carolina.  Which was hot during the summer months, hot and swampy and everything else, particularly when they ended up in Halifax County in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Now a rope bed is a bed by which the mattress is supported by ropes?
Speaker 2: Well no, the mattress is the rope, so it just the wood and it has the holes that are bored in it and just rope strung back and forth and that's the mattress.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Good thing I asked that question (laugher) cause people listening at this wondering what's a rope bed, you know? That's--okay.  Now can you tell us about your mother's personality, you know, what was she like?  She's still living?
Speaker 2: She is still living; she at this point has Alzheimer's so she suffers with that.  But she was a very--trained as a scientist, she was very matter of fact.  She was someone who, she was the disciplinarian in the family.  She was the one who one could always count on to be there because everything was kind of ordered in a scientific kind of way, as opposed to my father, who's an artist, and a very free spirit in that regard.  So, but she was just someone who reminds me of a rock that's just constantly there and strong and steady.  Which is really another reason why it's difficult to see her in a state with advanced Alzheimer's.  This was a person who was constantly organized and providing for others in her--through much of her life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 93812
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Jr. [HM].  That's J-E-F-F-E-R-S-O-N, E-U-G-E-N-E, G-R-I-G-S-B-Y.  He was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, on October 17, 1918.  His family--he comes from a long line of educators.  He for as I mentioned, was an artist, or is an artist, but he also was an art educator.  He taught in the high school for a long time and then on to Arizona State University, where he retired as Professor Emeritus from the Art Department of Arizona State University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell me what was his background?  Like did he--did they stories from 19th century from his family about what was going on?
Speaker 2: Most--there weren't an awful lot of stories that we heard his family--his mother, his mother's mother, my great grandmother was very much Cherokee and there's a strong Cherokee lineage in his side of the family.  And so there were a lots of things that we picked up as kids on the interaction between Cherokee Indians and North Carolina and African Americans and how there was strong community.  There was a great deal of intermarriage back in those days. And so, there's an awful lot of things that we learned about--we learned about her and that side of the family, but not so many stories per se that I can point to.
Story_ID: 93813
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so your father [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, HM] came from a long line of educators--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how he and your mother [Rosalyn Marshall Grigsby] met?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a story about how they got married.  They both were teaching at Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina] at that point.  And my father was on his way to--had joined the Army was on his way to overseas for during World War II, and my mother came down to visit him Fort Rucker, Alabama.  And he was telling her that they were going to a movie and when they walked down the road--there's a fork in the road, one fork went to the theatre and the other to the chapel.  And so he took her over to the chapel, she didn't know what was going on, but ended they got married that day.  Which she said, has said on occasion that was a good thing because she wasn't gone be let back home unless she came back married, going away to visit a soldier back in those days, back in the early '40's [1940].  So that was--that's a fascinating story that they've told over the years.
Story_ID: 93814
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your father's [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, HM] personality like?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's extremely outgoing, very gregarious, he loves people, as we jokingly remark, there's not been a party that he hasn't liked.  So he--has always kind of the life of the party and he's very much a people person and his personality has been that over the years and has--and is still so today.  I mean he's still very active, he's had a stroke and he has some difficulty in movement, but that hasn't affected his attention, his ability to function.  He continues to serve on a number of boards with a number of organizations, particularly as it relates to the arts in Arizona.  I mean he's considered the Dean of African American Artists in Arizona as he and his good friends and contemporaries in whose presence, my brother and I constantly found ourselves with people like Jacob Lawrence and Romare Bearden and Hale Woodruff.  Matter of fact, Hale Woodruff was his PhD advisor at NYU [New York University, New York City, New York] and was also his first art teacher when he was a student at Morehouse College, and that's how he kind of got started on the--on the road to be a creative artist.
Speaker 1: What medium did he use?
Speaker 2: Primarily painting and primarily abstract although over--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Oil or (unclear)
Speaker 2: Oil, watercolor, a great deal of--for work in lithograph, silk screen, serigraph.  Over the years, his focus has changed, some of his earlier works are--are pieces that are very descriptive and very, you know objective.  You see pictures of people and the like and then he became more stylistic.  Particularly as he got more and more into his research on--for his PhD, which was a comparison of mask between the Kuba Tribe in Belgium and the Quetzalcoatl Indians, which is from the northwest coast of the United States.  And he did a--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Belgium Congo?
Speaker 2: Belgium Congo, yeah.  And he did a comparison of the styles and the images of and the whole process depicted in the works of those two cultures.  And as a result, much of his work began to take one--a good bit of--for African flavor and the like.  And that was expanded on over the years as he's done sabbaticals throughout Africa and throughout Central and South America, and the Caribbean and other parts of the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it exciting to grow up around that kind of--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh it was absolutely exciting, I mean it always was--it was, as I mentioned in terms of my mother [Rosalyn Marshall Grigsby] being very organized and orderly and my father being very free spirited and creative, at times, it was organized chaos.  And it was--I mean it was like the left brain and right brain that would pull you in different kinds of directions, but it was absolutely fantastic.  And because of my father's very outgoing style and both of their heavy community involvement, there was always a steady stream of people throughout and in and out of our house.  They served over the years as State Department Representatives so that as the State Department were bringing groups of people through Arizona on tours around the country particularly Africans and people from other parts of the world, they always ended up at our house.  So I mean, we grew up having dinner with Kings and Queens, people that as you sit back and read about, you'd say, wow, you know, that was fantastic for us.  It was--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Can you remember some of the names of the people?
Speaker 2: I don't remember some of the names of the people who came through, we've got tons of artifacts of things that people left.  I do remember one time when Leonard De Paur, the famed chorus director, they were doing a concert in Arizona.  And we looked up and there was this big bus that pulled up and the whole chorus came in, and spent a couple of hours at the house, they jumped on the bus and went on down the road to their next tour.  Other of his [father, Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, HM] friends that would come by or would visit, folks like Langston Hughes, many of the Harlem renaissance folks, because he spent so much time in New York.  He--well he and Jake Lawrence and Bearden in the early days that's where they kind of began their professional careers together.  So many of those friendships lasted--all of them lasted over the years and those kind of folks were in and out of our house.
Story_ID: 93815
Speaker 1: Okay. Now I want you to reflect back on growing up, and you can started off in-- well you grew up basically in Phoenix [Arizona], I guess--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: With summers in Charlotte [North Carolina], but what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Phoenix back in the '40's [1940's] '50's [1950's] and early'60's [1960's] was a very open community from the standpoint of for a youngster being able to go anywhere.  I mean I--we'd get on our bicycles and ride all over town to--and there was no reason not to do that.  It was just a wide open desert community.  Now it's interesting that there were very, very few people--black folks in Phoenix and Arizona, for that matter, still aren't very many, but there were even fewer in those days.  But most of those who there, were there either because they were on their to Los Angeles [California] and ran out of money or their car broke down and they ended being stuck in Phoenix or they mustered out of War World II at Fort Huachuca down in Southeastern Arizona and they could only get as far as Phoenix and not back to wherever they were from.  And then there was a migrant community what a lot of folks didn't realize, still don't, that although Arizona is very much a desert it is one of the major agricultural states in the union.  So there's tremendous agriculture activity--agricultural activity there, and so there were a lot of black folks who did migrate farming.  And so that was kind of the genesis of the three branches of folks--black folks who ended up in Phoenix.  But it was a small tight knit community, basically everybody knew everybody.  Which was good and bad, I mean as a kid to me, you could never get away from anything everybody was always looking over your shoulder, they knew who you were and the like. But it was good from the standpoint that we were able to really forge some, some real close bonds over the years.  One of the--my father--we got to Arizona in--we were a little different from the three groups that I've mentioned.  Either running out of money or agriculture or getting out of the army there.
Story_ID: 93816
Speaker 1: Phoenix [Arizona] was also a very segregated community which we didn't as kids experience until the beginning of the Civil Rights activity, the Greensboro Sit In.  But in the '40's [1940's] Phoenix opened a black high school that was for essentially to serve black students from all over the state.  I mean it was just one black high school and--Carver High School is the name of it or was the name of it.  The Principal who was appointed was a classmate of my grandmother's at [Clark] Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  And so he came south to recruit a faculty and my father [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, HM] having just gotten out of the Army could not find a job teaching in Charlotte [North Carolina], at that point, and so he agreed to go down to head up the Art Department in this newly created black high school.  And so he and a cadre of about 15 to 20 people ended up moving to Phoenix for that purpose.  And at one point, it was, certainly in Arizona, and one of the few High Schools in the Nation where every member of the faculty had at least a Master's degree and these were all black folks who where there.  And when Phoenix integrated the schools just before the Brown [v.] Board of Education Decision, of course it closed Carver High School and moved all of those folk over to the white high school and the Principal became an Assistant Principal and you know the old story.  But, so that was kind of the early part of how they got there and what we experienced growing up.  But there was a start difference when Civil Rights Activity began.  We then began to realize that--that the lunch counters have and the like in Phoenix were just as segregated as they were throughout the deep South.  At that point, and I'm talking now about 1963, '62 [1962] no, actually, going back to 1960, that's when we started.  My brother and I started out in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Youth Movement and we began some sit ins and the like for the--ironies--the funniest story that I ever recall is that there was a particular drug store that had a soda fountain.  And it was not far from where I went to school and I would stop there--and I was-my brother and I were the only black kids in this one elementary school at that point.  It was after my parents moved to where they live now.  First five years, we went to Booker T. Washington Elementary School, which was all black, but then we moved, then we were districted into another school.  And we with this one lunch counter, I would go to everyday after school to get a Coke or whatever.  And that lunch counter turned up on the list that we had to picket.  They were letting me eat there every day didn't realize that I was black; they thought that I was just like the other white boys who would come in.  And I thought it was particularly funny when we went in there with the NAACP Youth Movement and shut em down, which we did.  And then shortly thereafter they opened up--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Did they stop and say hey we served you (laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughing) Na, they were so shocked, that they--(laughing) but it was really amusing and then we went on to other activities.
Speaker 2: Now did that often happen to you, because you can be, you have the countenance, if I may, of guy like Frank Silvera, who was a black actor who I think, had some Hispanic ancestors.  But he played everybody on the screen, you know-(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: It happened, it happened and but wore off and then, not folk would look at me and then, you know, there's some--we don't quite know what it is, they couldn't quite put their finger on it. But it would depend on who I was with in terms of how closely folk would look.
Speaker 2: So if you're hanging out with black people, then obviously black, then--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: They'd say that you were probably black too but--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: But, you know, my thing was getting as immersed in causes for Civil Rights and Racial Justice and the like, which is one of the reasons why I ended up going to school in Atlanta.  Because growing up in Phoenix, you learn very little.  First you encounter very few black folks and then you learn very little in school about any of the history and during that period, we're talking early to mid '60's [1960's].  I wanted very much to be in--to learn more to be in the thick of things, and so that's why I went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] to go to the school where Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had gone to school and where Dr. Mays was President, and so.
Story_ID: 93817
Speaker 1: Now before we take you there, I want to back track a little bit and take you back to grade school.  What was the name of the grade school you attended?
Speaker 2: First from Kindergarten through fifth grade, I went to Booker T. Washington Elementary School.  And then for the sixth, seventh and eighth grade, I went to Emerson, Ralph Waldo Emerson Elementary School.  We did not have Junior Highs in Arizona system, at that point.  And so for high school, from grades nine through 12, I went to Phoenix Union High School.
Speaker 1: Phoenix Union High School.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was one of the largest high schools in the nation, at that point.  We had almost 7,000 students at that school.  And it was literally like being in a city.
Speaker 1: Now you said you started off at Carver though first?
Speaker 2: No, I started off at Booker T. Washington.  Carver was the High School that my father [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, HM] went to Arizona to work, started the Art Department.
Speaker 1: You never attended that one?
Speaker 2: No, that school closed, see by the time they closed Carver in 1964.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh no, sorry, in 1954.
Speaker 1: Now, is Carver now a Cultural Center or something or?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  Carver High School now the building still stands and it was purchased by the Alumni Association of Carver High School, which is a Black Group of Alumni's called, the Monarch Association.  And they have created the Carver Cultural Museum [George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center] and it's, that's a part of it and we're right in the midst now of creating the Eugene and Thomasena Grigsby Art Gallery that is a part of that.  That will be located in the original building that he went to Arizona to set up the Art Department some fifty, almost sixty years ago.  So that's the part of that complex and it's gonna be more than just a museum, it's going to be a Cultural Activity Center and the like.  And so we've been working on that for a little while.
Speaker 1: There's an artist in Chicago that's working on that too, he's a designer used to be a designer for Sears.  I can't think of his name right now, Charles something.  He designed the View Master for Sears.  He's a--to think that they have a little a Hall of Fame in the Carver Center now--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) picture amongst others, you know.
Story_ID: 93818
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--well, now how did you like school when you were a kid?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always enjoyed school and it's kind of hard when both of your parents are teachers.  And from elementary school, I guess from Kindergarten through sixth, fifth grade, my mother [Rosalyn Marshall Grigsby] taught at the school I attended, so kind of hard to really be bad.   And then from high school, all of high school, my father taught at the high school.  So, you know, I kind of grew up in that environment, and so I literally--they knew me and it was hard for me to not do the right thing, in those days.  I mean now it's a totally different environment.  So I really grew up enjoying school and working hard.  Things tended to come more easily for me, so I didn't have to work as hard, I don't know whether that was good or bad, but academically, I've always excelled in what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were your favorite books when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I've always liked biographies and history and so whatever I was reading it was almost always nonfiction.  I've never been a great one for fiction.  Other than when, you know, recently started reading Walter Mosley and others and so, I'm expanding on my fiction reading.  But I've always been a--really a student of history and so anything that had to do with biography.  I mean, I'd read all kinds of folks just to learn a little bit more about how they grew up, what they thought, what they encountered, what they experienced.
Story_ID: 93819
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of your favorite teachers in school?  Did you-- Were there any grade school teachers that were outstanding that really--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh sure I had fantastic grade school teachers.  I go down to--the one I can't remember who I had for Kindergarten but Miss Aldridge (ph) for first grade was fantastic.  Miss Townsend (ph) for second grade was--she was a beautiful woman and also very intelligent.  Now here's a second grader, you know observation.  Mrs. Banks for third grade, I--these were all family friends.  I mean is this the community that we all lived in.  So Mrs. Banks--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So these are all black teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was for--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So Phoenix was segregated community (unclear), alright.
Speaker 2: Then Mrs. Greenfield in the fourth grade. And my favorite was Mrs. Knox in the fifth grade.  She was from, I think from Oakland area, from California but Mrs. Knox was a teacher who, and all of them, but she in particular was the teacher that absolutely was convinced that every black child could learn to be whatever he or she was destined to be and that she was gone make sure you learned in her class and would take no--cut no slack.  I remember she would always have Spelling Bee every Friday.  And stand up in front of the class, and you know, just do a regular Spelling Bee and if you missed the word or something, she'd take an eraser and throw it at you (laughing) but, these were wonderful people, marvelous people who I would not have, and would not give anything for the quality of the educational experience that I had.  When I went to, as I mentioned my family moved when I was in the fifth grade and we had to go to another, basically an all-white elementary school.  My teachers there were they were friendly and they were nice, but they weren't of the same caliber of literally wrapping their arms around you and/or chastising you whatever the situation called for.  They were just kind of regular teachers and not the same kind of loving nurturing environment that I had for the first five years.
Speaker 1: So you, I guess, would you think teachers in the segregated schools and, they seem to have more of mission, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, absolutely, no question.  Their mission was to arm all of their youngsters with as much knowledge and information that they possibly could because they knew what the world was like and they knew the kind of environment that these kids were gonna go out into, and so they took that as a--really as a mission and a passion.  There's one teacher, although she wasn't one of my teachers because she taught seventh grade and I moved to when we were--I was in sixth grade.  But she's Mrs. Hardy who is, she's 98 years old but I still--every time I go back to Phoenix I go there--she lives in a nursing home but I go by and visit her.  Her mind is just as sharp, she lost her eyesight, she cannot move, can't walk around but her mind is just as sharp as I remember it being as a kid in that elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Let's see. So, you didn't get this same kind of reaction at the white school--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black students there?
Speaker 2: My brother, just the two of us yeah.
Speaker 1: This is at Emerson.
Speaker 2: That was Emerson, yeah.  And he was only there for one year, he's two years older.  He did the eighth grade there and I had to do three years, so. So it was one year, there was two of us and two years, there was me that folk didn't know quite who--what I was, but after this elementary, I mean the drug store, would serve me for those three years.
Speaker 1: So the company you kept determined what you were--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Treated as? That's interesting.  But--
Story_ID: 93820
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, well tell me about high school [Phoenix Union High School, Phoenix, Arizona], you went to--was the high school integrated?
Speaker 2: High school was integrated, yeah.  They--at that point as I'd mentioned just before the Brown Board of Education case in '54 [1954] was handed down, Phoenix decided to integrate the schools.  And they closed most of the black elementary schools and the one high school that they had.  And moved everybody to Phoenix Union [High School] and it was, it was a in terms of all of the different group of students going to school together, that happened there was still not much interaction between groups of students.  But we were all in one school together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was your high school experience like--were there any teachers there that kind of rose above the hum drum?
Speaker 2: There were some, there were some that I remember--that was a time of expanding kind of turmoil, my developing a sense of varying sense of awareness in terms of the whole issue of race in America.  And so exploring a number of different issues, and there were some teachers who were helpful--there were very few black teachers at the high school. When most of them--when they closed Carver High School, most of them either retired or went to elementary schools, they didn't move over to the high school.  But there were still some teachers that I remember very strongly.  Most of my classes in high school were in the advanced program called Double A in English, and Biology and Chemistry and Math.  But the experience was certainly not as nurturing and as warm as it had been in the earlier years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how was your social life, as if you had much of a social life?  Did you go to parties and--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  We had parties all of the time.  I was social person and was involved, and you know, regular activities.  I wouldn't say anything out of the ordinary, I was constantly moving all over town, but I would characterize it as a very, very standard kind of early social activity and upbringing.
Speaker 1: Did you go to the prom, that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I went to, yeah, I went to one prom--actually early on I was much more involved in kind of social activities in and around school and at parties at the like.  As I got--moved up in my, through high school, I became much more involved in looking at Civil Rights types of activities and the like, and much less in kind of social activities.  I spent more time kind of observing and studying in the like and quite--actually I finished high school in about three years. I'd taken everything I could take and they wouldn't let me register again, told me I'd finished.  So I went over to the local Junior College.
Speaker 1: When did you finish high school?
Speaker 2: In '60 [1960], I actually finished in '63 [1963] but my graduation date was '64 [1964] because you didn't--I had to come back to march with my class, which I actually never did.  The reason that I didn't, was I had been out of the high school, in Junior College, but at that point almost full-time working in--we started a chapter of CORE, Congress of Racial Equality, and involved of lots of activities there in City and the State Capitol and all kinds of activities.  And the night--one of the requirements to graduate, to march with the high school class was you had to go to practice.  Because it was such a large class, it was 800 and some students in my graduating class.  And the night that the practice was scheduled, was the same night that [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] was speaking in Phoenix and I said that's a no brainer, I'm not going to rehearsal, you know, mail me the diploma in the mail.  And that's what happened, so I wasn't missing Martin Luther King over at Arizona State University.

Speaker 1: So it actually sounds like you were fairly well attuned to the Civil Rights Movement and what it meant.
Speaker 2: I was and am, for that matter, but I was because that was kind of nurturing environment that I came out of.  I mean I came from folks who were very much committed to, not only to education, but committed to helping to make life better for folks who were struggling.  My grandfather [Jefferson Eugene Grigsby, Sr.] was Principal of a high school in Charlotte [North Carolina] for 30 something years and was involved in all kinds of activities.  He started the first Credit Union in Charlotte for black school teachers.  So they were constantly doing all kinds of activities, and my parents, the same.  Although I remember one time it got a little bit tense because quite frankly, my parents were public school teachers which meant that they were at the mercy of folks in the public sector.  And things were particularly rough--this was, I guess this was during the spring of 1964, that was the time that our State Senator was trying to get the nomination for the Presidency, Barry Goldwater, and we were very much anti-Goldwater.  So we were sitting in and doing all kinds of stuff and I remember when the State Troopers drug us out of the State Capitol.  My parents were walking on the picket line with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and they were complaining, not loudly but they were letting me know that I was putting their jobs in jeopardy by doing and having a high profile.  And I realized that, and of course as a young brash movement person, I said, you know, maybe that's what you bourgeoisie Negroes need, that some of you to have your jobs put in jeopardy, yeah.  But they--to their credit, they were on that picket line and when my mother looked up and saw this cop dragging me down the street, she went after him with that sign.  And I had to get up and stop her, cause I didn't want her going to jail.  But they were very supportive and it was that kind of environment. And so I almost couldn't help but catch that kind of, that kind of spirit.
Story_ID: 93822
Speaker 1: Now, who organized your CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] Chapter in Phoenix?
Speaker 2: My brother and I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You all organized it yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had--what happened--the reason that we did it, was that we had been picketing the State Capital for a while and we decided that wasn't enough, we needed to go in, and the NAACP would not sanction that.  They said no, we're not gone do that so we got on the phone and we called the CORE Headquarters.  The sent an organizer out and we talked to him about that.  As a matter of fact, James Farmer came out at one point, and we talked.  So again we kept agitating for further involvement on the part of NAACP and they wouldn't do it so at one meeting, that was the NAACP Youth Meeting, when the President said that they couldn't sanction that, we, my brother and I got up and said okay, the NAACP meeting is over. The first meeting of CORE had started and everybody there joined in.  And we just--the next day we went in and took over the State House.
Speaker 1: Now it seems to be a time period when a lot of young people in NAACP Youth groups were becoming increasingly agitated, I guess, with the national in not taking action.
Speaker 2: Yes, but I mean now in retrospect I certainly understand and understood what those dynamics were and that even with the differences in tactics, the fact that as we got into difficulties, as folk went to jail, it was the same NAACP members who provided support and the like.  So they were doing much, much more and had been on the firing line for much longer.   Obviously those of us who were young and brash and wanted to do more, you didn't see all of that at that point.  But they were providing a very significant role, particularly in Phoenix.  During that time when there was very little support that was coming from anyplace else.
Story_ID: 93823
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you this.  Were you aware, during that period of time that of the Nation of Islam presence in Phoenix?
Speaker 2: Well the Nation, really not during--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Elijah Muhammad had a house--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Elijah Muhammad had a house, and actually the house he bought, that was Louis Jordan's old house, so right of Broadway in Phoenix, so yeah.  And it was right across the street from an old childhood friend, so, I mean, we watched that house when it was built and Elijah Muhammad, when he moved in funny--Louis Jordan had a big swimming pool, Elijah Muhammad covered it in (laughing) and you know and just cemented it over.  But he really never had much of a presence in Phoenix in those days.  That was much more of a summer home, so you didn't get a sense of--I mean a winter home rather.  You didn't get a sense of a nation presence as such during the days when I was there.
Speaker 1: Kind of very low key--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah um-hum.
Speaker 1: Cause I know Elijah Muhammad was there when Malcolm X was killed and immediately went to his home in Phoenix (unclear), he had respiratory problems.
Speaker 2: Right, but see that was '65 [1965] so here again those were--that was an area where he was kind of holding out and dealing with the respiratory issues, which during those days and earlier, I mean a lot of people who had respiratory problems were sent by doctors out to Arizona because of the dry air.  Unfortunately, it's not that way anymore cause the folk who got--went to Arizona also took with them all of the stuff that created problems for them back East, so now it's as much pollution and smog and allergies and everything else in Phoenix as it is anyplace else.  But much of Mr. Muhammad's base, at that point, was still out of Chicago and where he was--and that's where much of the activity.  So as--we didn't have that much direct further--and I'm talking really like from late '50's [1950] through about '64 [1964].  Which is, I left Phoenix in '64 [1964].
Story_ID: 93824
Speaker 1: You're in Junior College, now what Junior College did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Phoenix College.
Speaker 1: Phoenix College.  And you'd plan to go to a black school, you planned to go to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I did.  But the only reason I went there was because I was, it wasn't until that last year that I realized that I had finished, or was gonna finish high school.  And there was no, in those days, there was no mid-year admission into Morehouse, so I just kind of had to hang around.  So I didn't want to not do anything or not be in school, so I went out to Phoenix College and enrolled in some classes.  Which it was the one time in my academic career that I didn't spend much time or energy dealing with school, cause I knew I was just in a weigh station until I went to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, so you knew you weren't going to be there long.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When did you arrive at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: I went there in the fall of 1964 and that was--that whole transition going down there was quite an experience for me.  In that when I left Phoenix, my folks didn't have any money for plane fare, all of that, so I had to go on a train.  So they put me on a train in Phoenix and of course, no sleeping cars either.  I mean, so you sit up for three days and two nights back and forth.  I remember getting to New Orleans at like midnight and the connecting southern railroad train didn't leave out til like seven in the morning.  So I had to sleep in the train station all night.  But one of the most, I guess chilling thing that I recall on that train ride was that we went through Meridian, Mississippi, three weeks after they found the bodies of Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney.  And so just going through that town, having been actively involved in Civil Rights activities and knowing that they had just found these bodies and the environment that I was kind of moving into, was something that really both hardened me.  Because I knew that I was getting to something that was very different from the experiences that I had growing up in Arizona.  But it was also frightening, you know, you doing that all by yourself and not knowing what you're going to run into.  And then get into Atlanta, in those days, and with the likes of Lester Maddox and all of the other stuff, and this is before the Selma to Montgomery March all kinds of activities.
Speaker 1: This is the tensest part of the '60's [1960] I guess--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Voter registration campaign going on in Mississippi.  When workers disappeared, I think in the spring, and they surfaced in the fall around the time of the Democratic National Convention, it was late August.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was later on, that's when I went through there.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get through Mississippi without any trouble?
Speaker 2: Got through without any trouble, I mean it was, I was very much quiet, kept to myself and didn't say anything and just kind of sat there.  So I didn't run into any kind of difficulty.  And at that point, they really had not, the segregated train cars were not in place, at that point.  So I didn't, I didn't have to deal with the issue of where I was going to sit on the train.
Story_ID: 93825
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you think as you passed through there, would you ever volunteer or be a part of a movement down there?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  That's when I really, one of the reasons I went to Atlanta was to become involved in that activity and participated in some activities in Atlanta but not to the extent that I really thought I would and that was primarily because of some very old lying, very much involved folks told that first and foremost your job is to get an education, and you stay here and you make sure you do that.  Folks like Dr. [Benjamin] Mays, who was my Freshman Advisor when I got there, and I had to report to him every week and tell him what I was doing in class and the like.  And Sam Williams, who was my Philosophy Instructor who was President of the State Branch of NAACP in Georgia and was a Baptist Minister who never left home without his .45 in his--in the glove compartment of his car.  A host of other people who were both actively involved, were also educators and who in some respect really embodied kind of the best sense of DuBois talked about in terms of the Talented Tenth and realizing that their job was to help, to educate the next generation of students who came through there.  And they couldn't have everybody come joining in all of the movement activities and have everybody getting killed.  So that kind of helped keep me from going down to Albany and going over to Selma and some of the other places that were going on while I was literally there, as much as I really wanted to be involved in that.
Story_ID: 93826
Speaker 1: Well what was life like on the campus, did you get the chance to know Dr. Mays?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  We--and knew him and worked with him literally up until the time he died.  We, as I said, he was my Advisor so I had to report--he and his wife Sadie Mays.  And then a number of people that took me under their wing, he's one.  Never will forget when Martin King was coming back from Oslo, having won the Nobel Peace Prize, I had to ride with Dr. Mays in his car to the airport, cause we went to the airport to meet Dr. King and his family.  Dr. Mays couldn't drive a lick, and he wouldn't get on the expressway, and he drove all the way from campus to the airport with one foot on the brake and on the accelerator.  And it was like that all the way out there.
Speaker 1: But he--I've interviewed, at least two people, James Compton [HM] being one of them that was a chauffeur for Dr. Mays.  They were students, and their job was to drive him around, so there may be a good reason for that.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, sure, absolutely.  And in those days, and to some extent now, you know College Presidents were driven around.  When I was a President I basically insisted on driving myself, but I didn't want the trappings of all of that and everything else.  But he, we became friends over the years in a way that I never realized.  One of the things, he would always come to every year to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and speak in the Chapel.  And while I was at Howard, I spent 11 years at Howard; several times I would pick him up from the airport and take him to the campus.  But whenever I encountered him, I always gave him the respect of telling him my name.  Cause I didn't expect him to remember who I was, I mean the man travelled in incessantly and was constantly involved.  I remember the last time I spoke with him; I had picked him up from the airport.  He had a plane ticket in his pocket, cause he was going someplace else, and I walked up to him and he said Grigsby, if you tell me your name again, I'm gonna scream (laughing) it was funny.  But later on, I discovered something about him, and this was after he had died, he and a good friend of his, Sam Nabrit, and Sam was the first black recipient of a PhD from Brown University.  He got a PhD in Chemistry and he was, [President Dwight D.] Eisenhower appointed him to the Atomic Energy Commission.  I mean, he's involved in all kinds of stuff; Sam was also the President of the Southern Fellowship Foundation which was the organization that underwrote my graduate education, so he supported me through the years.  Sam, he also ended up being the Chairman of the Search Committee for the Presidency of Benedict College and he is the one that basically engineered to get me elected President at the college.  And told me a few years after that, said that he and Mays were traveling on a plane going somewhere, and he said that keep your eye on Grigsby and that if the right situation opens up, make sure he gets in it.  And so you never know what kind of impression you're making on people, and you never know who's looking over your shoulder and who's making opportunities available that happened long before you even got on the scene.  But he was a--and also there was and is a black good ol boy network too that looks out for folks. That was an interesting experience that I had with him.
Story_ID: 93827
Speaker 1: Now, did you get to know Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] at all?
Speaker 2: I met him on three or four occasions but never got to know him, certainly not like I got to know Dr. [Benjamin] Mays and some of the other great folks who were in and around Atlanta during that time.  But we did, we first met as I mentioned, when I was in high school in Arizona and then I was in the Glee Club on Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], so we sang on three or four occasions when he was in and around Atlanta.  And fortunately or unfortunately, we also sang at his funeral, on the funeral that was held on the campus in April of 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay, who were some of the other luminaries that around the campus in those days?
Speaker 2: I remember seeing Maynard Jackson in and out of the buildings all of the time and as I was watching his funeral a couple weeks ago, which just reminded of the many times that I ran into him in Atlanta when he was struggling trying to figure out what he was gonna do.  Julian Bond [HM], [Andrew] Andy Young [HM], those folk were always in and out of the campus.  But awful lot of just regular folks who were people who made a difference.  Now, these were the kind of folks who had a tremendous impact on me.  I never would have been whom I am to this day, whatever that is, had it not been for obviously some of the earlier experiences, but certainly some of the experiences I had in and around Atlanta and at Morehouse.
Story_ID: 93828
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about Atlanta U [sic, Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]? So what did you major in at Atlanta U [sic]?
Speaker 2: Political Science.  Yep, that kind of help to lay the foundation for further exploration in the political arena.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were there in your last year, Dr. King, as you said earlier was killed in April, a month before you graduated--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right, correct.
Speaker 1: So did this, how did this, well you know, I supposed it kind of disrupted the campus activity?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  It was I mean it was very traumatic.  The night the word came, matter of fact, I was at the moment, I was over visiting a girlfriend, over at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so we immediately--I left and we went to campus and people were just kind of beside themselves.  The several stores in the area were by then were already on fire, and students were wanting to take out revenge and do anything they could.  And so some of us played a role of trying to calm folks down so they wouldn't go out and do that.  But it was a chaotic situation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said you were part of a funeral services on campus?
Speaker 2: [OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION]
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So in those days, I know a lot of the people that were working with Dr. King in Memphis and those places, you know came into Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's where they organized The Poor People's Campaign basically.  Were you a part of any of that?
Speaker 1: I was just there, during that time, I remember seeing the caravans coming through and visited on a couple of occasions here in Washington when things were set up.  But it was not a formal part of that, by then I was on my way to Chicago to graduate school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 93829
Speaker 1: Alright.  So you went to the University of Chicago [Divinity School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You went to the School of Theology?
Speaker 2: Yes, to the Divinity School.
Speaker 1: Right, now how did you decide to do that, now before this time, I--we really haven't heard of a church being a big part of your, or religion being a big part of your life.  Was it or did you have?
Speaker 2: Not in an organized sense, it was not.  Although part of the nurturing environment that I had in Atlanta really helped to open up some real questions that I was having.  And a couple of instructors, in particular, Lucius Tobin, who taught religion at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Sam Williams, who I mentioned earlier who was--taught Religion and Philosophy they--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Williams was the one that carried all these packets of guns--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  They brought kind of a depth of religious spirit that I really hadn't encountered before and I began, particularly under Lucius Tobin to actively study, would take courses in Religion.  And courses on various books of the Bible, and his approach was something that resonated with me.  I mean he was a Baptist Minister, but he, he always talked about what he called Sunday School Tommy Rot.  That that was the antithesis of what true religion really was, and that one has to study the historical contexts, study the cultural contexts, study all of that to get an understanding of what the Old and New Testaments are about.  And that fascinated me and I began to take more and to think more about what he was talking about.  And then literally took every class that he taught and took everything that Sam Williams taught.  And at that point, as I was moving toward the end of my tenure at Morehouse, it really began to come together to me, that what I really wanted to do was to do a joint major in Religion and Law.  That law grew out of the religious culture of a people.  And so I wanted to study both of those, not quite sure what I wanted to do it, but instead of coming out of the whole notion of wanting to continue involvement in some kind of helping profession.  And so these were kind of un-crystallized ideas that I had, but I knew I was getting close to the time where I would be leaving there and I had to figure out what I was gone do.  So I decided--well another experience I had was one summer I was in Phoenix and I talked with an old family friend of my parents who recently died.  But he was a constitutional lawyer, was a very strong advocate of social justice and the like.  And I sat down with him I spent a couple of hours and told him about my interest in really wanting to study law and religion.  And I was shocked by his response.  His response was that if you really want to study law, study law, and if you really want to study religion, do that but don't try to mix up the two.  Well, that just made me even more determined that, that there is a nexus and that was before Law Schools and Divinity Schools really created joint programs.  Now there are a number of joint programs in Religion and Law.  Because, I mean, it's only natural, you can't really understand the legal structure of people.  We can't understand what the devil is going on in Iraq and Iran without understanding the cultural impulse or cultural dynamics.  I mean, the legal structure is grounded in people's understanding of who they are, and that's grounded in their understanding of religion.  So that's what I wanted to pursue, but there was no academic program around that did that.  So I said well, next best thing, I'll apply to several different schools and that'll determine what I do, it was almost like a crap shoot.  So I applied to Yale Law School, University of Michigan Law School, I think, Yale PhD program and Political Science, I think Harvard Law School and University of Chicago Divinity School.  And so I said, wherever I get accepted, that'll determine what I do, got accepted at all of them.  Chicago gave me the most money, so I ended up going to Chicago.  So that's how it happened, started out really wanting to pursue an academic study of religion root, and the more I got into it the more I realized that I really was pursuing was how simply an intellectual curiosity, an intellectual quest, but it was something that, that ultimately  I'm going have to ground on myself in, and that's when I decided that I really was looking for kind of a complete immersion in that and ultimately was ordained as a Unitarian Universalist Minister, the only first one ever so ordained by my home church in Phoenix.
Story_ID: 93830
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you this.  Now, when you were coming along, I guess, and you started paying attention to the Civil Rights Movement during the era of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], and his activities, Dr. King would often say when challenged by the judicial system or legal systems in the southern states, they would say segregation is the law, and he would reply that yes, but say, there's a higher law, you know, that you don't, we're gonna obey that higher law, but it's wrong to do these things, even though they are the laws in the states of Mississippi and Georgia and Alabama.  Were you thinking about that--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I mean, I--it wasn't so much thinking about that because that was more, as I saw it from a strategic and strategy standpoint, that only is there a higher law they we are going to obey, but also we gonna deal with any consequences for violating the law.  So it's not simply saying that we going to ignore what it is, we're going to intentionally not do that.  And whatever you say are the penalties and consequences, we'll suffer that too, because there is this higher law, and--it's  the quest of the higher law or the under penny that really gives meaning to a culture and to history that that's really what was driving me further.
Story_ID: 93831
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, was the University of Chicago [Divinity School, Chicago, Illinois] the right place to go for this kind of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, it's kind of hard to say.  It was right for me at the time, and again I encountered some instructors, Charles Long, who really was one of my main mentors and became my dissertation advisor, had a tremendous impact on me in helping me to understand more about religions and various religions world culture.  He was in the history of religions and that took an awful lot of work in that arena.  And that helped me to understand even more so the importance of understanding different cultures.  And how you go in and try to analyze those things that help people to understand who they are within their own context.  Which again, if you talk about the smallness of the world, on the one hand, you've got all of these different things going on.  And all these different cultures that will never fully understand or be able to participate in, if we don't seek to understand who the people are and what they believe, and how they view themselves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Chicago was very much kind of the place for that.  I was not interested in a Theological School that was primarily a denominationally based institution that had a particular doctrine that you had to adhere to.  So that never really driven me and once that just enabled me to be able to function in an awful lot of different arenas.  I mean, when I was elected President of Benedict College, people thought that the Board of Trustees had gone completely to hell, that here's this long line Baptist Institution electing a Unitarian Universalist Minister as the President, but got along fine.  While the eleven years I spent at Howard discovered and then learned ways to exist in all kinds of environments and cultures.  So, I've been able to move in awful lot of different circles.
Story_ID: 93832
Speaker 1: Now what is--at University of Chicago [Divinity School, Chicago, Illinois], what is your philosophy of religion as you hammered it out at the University of Chicago, is it the same that was hammered out there or has it changed any?  What was it, I mean, why did you decide to become a Unitarian instead (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean that was the environment in which I grew up.  My parents, and again that has a story behind it, as well.  When my family moved to Arizona back in the mid '40's [1940's], my mother was Presbyterian, had gone to Episcopal Churches, my father was Presbyterian.  They could not find a church home in Phoenix.  They to the Presbyterian Church, they weren't welcomed there, they went to the Episcopal Church, they weren't welcomed there.  They went to a number of different places and could not find any welcome mat for them.  And there were a group of people who were meeting in the basement of the YWCA, who they ran into and some setting, I'm not quite sure how, who invited them to come and join their community, they happened to be Unitarian.  And so that, from meeting in the basement of that church, or the [Y], to physically building the first church, and I remember doing that as a kid.  I mean we literally built the building, raised the walls, and laid the flagstone out there and the like.  And then from that experience moving to for another temporary period of time to the Jewish Community Center, were services were held.  And then ultimately to where that church is located now in Paradise Valley, Arizona, which is a very upscale community.  And moving out there, once that building was built and being part of that evolution.  So, I mean, that's the only church I grew up in, but I also had some very ambiguous feelings about it.  Because again going back to the Civil Rights activity and to the spring of 1964 in particular, this physical sight is located at a hill just below the house where Barry Goldwater lived.  And there was nothing between Goldwater and this house but a few cactus plants.  And I remember one Sunday going to church and we were in the streets trying to block his getting the nomination, and I counted more Goldwater for President bumper stickers in that church parking lot that I had seen in Phoenix all day.  And I said there's a disconnect, I got a problem here.  And I began to be disenchanted with some of the folks.  Because if you proclaim to feel open and support justice and all of these kind of things, and you're supporting a person who's position, political positions are very much opposite of all of that then, I gotta re access.  So I kind of fell out for a while, and that's when I left and through the Atlanta experience moving in and out of all kinds of churches and as I mentioned I think, sang in the Glee Club.  So we travelled up and down every highway and byway throughout Alabama and Mississippi and Georgia singing in churches and the like.  So I got inside all kinds of houses of worship, and then just that whole nurturing experience began to take--have an effect on me.  But then when I went to Chicago and back through that May, finally made a decision that I had to do more than just pursue an academic study of religion, it was back to that home church that I wanted to be ordained, which is what I did.
Story_ID: 93833
Speaker 1: Okay, alright so you were at University of Chicago [Divinity School, Chicago, Illinois] from '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: From '68 [1968] until, I left Chicago in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.  By that time, you had earned a PhD? Or Doctor of Divinity.
Speaker 2: Yeah, finished in the end of, actually the spring semester of '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then was working both at a church as well as in some political activities in Chicago.  At that point, became very active as an extension of kind of Civil Rights activity.  I had become the Executive Director of an organization called the Black Legislative Clearinghouse, which was an organization of Black State Legislators.  And we provided educational research and support for them before there was a national organization on the scene to do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, were you associated with Operation Breadbasket at that time?
Speaker 2: I was, yeah, and with Jesse [Jackson, HM] and Calvin Morris [HM] and a number of other people, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Willie Barrow [HM] who was one of my daughter's Godmothers.  So yeah, we in those--in those waters, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 93834
Speaker 1: So where did you go after you left Chicago and why did you leave Chicago?
Speaker 2: That's when I went to Dayton.  At that point, I was, I really was nominated for a position that I'd say I'd look at and again it was kind of that circles of mentors, that circle of black elders, they had gotten together and said, you're the right one to go to Dayton, Ohio and to work with the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.  It was the accrediting agency, is the accrediting agency for graduate theological education in the United States and Canada and Puerto Rico.  And they had done very little as it relates to African Americans, Black Students, Black Religion, the study of religion and the like.  So some of the Elders, [Charles] Chuck Long and Shelby Rooks, and [James] Jim Cone [HM], some of those guys, said that, you know, they just gotten a position funded for someone black to come on staff to work both with the member institutions.  There were about 170 or so schools member institutions and so they, they kind of cajoled me into looking at that and then was elected to go over there and do that, and did that for two and half years.  Basically travelling around the country, meeting with member schools, and working with their students and the like helping then to essentially be more responsive to black students and to be more responsive and inclusive in what they were doing.  And as a result of that, another one of the Elders said I like what you're doing, so come on to Howard, work with me there and so, spent 11 years at Howard doing that.
Speaker 1: Now Dayton, Dayton is the home of the United Theological Seminary with George Brown, no.
Speaker 2: Charles Brown.
Speaker 1: Charles Brown, Georgetown had some other good black theologians there.  It seem to be really giving some deep exploration of black religion.  They brought in Thomas O. Beebee, and they talked about African religion and philosophy challenge some of the--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: But none of that was going on back in the '70's [1970's] in Dayton.  The only thing going on at United at that point was Charles.  And Charles was a lonely fireman in a hostile environment, as he expressed on many occasions.  But United, over the years, has been one of the institutions that has been more responsive to diverse needs and has taken that role seriously and has really tried to build on that more so than a number of other institutions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you left Dayton--your position was to travel around the country, basically.
Speaker 2: Basically, yeah because, I mean, the association, when I first went there, was housed in downtown Dayton, in the Third National Bank Building and then about six months later, I moved out to Vandalia by the airport.  Primarily because there were four, one, two, three, four, five professional staff members and all of us were constantly on the road.  So it was easier being there than it was that it was being downtown Dayton.  And they bought a house that converted into an office building.  But there wasn't much activity in the Dayton area; I mean other than whatever one personal involvement happened to be.
Story_ID: 93835
Speaker 1: Now what was the most active or progressive theological school that you visited when you were making your visits?
Speaker 2: At that point--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: What were some of the ones, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I mean, yeah, I mean you had the very different kinds of institutions across the board.  Union Seminary in New York, traditionally was an area that was one of the most creative academically and theologically, because of its New York City base and because the kinds of people who were there and its history.  That's, as a matter of fact, that's where I first met [Bishop] Desmond Tutu when Desmond was doing some exchange work years ago and I was one of the panels talking about African religion and that the intersect between African and African American Religion and the like.  So union has, was during those days was certainly one of the key players in that.  Howard was not at that point, but it has since become one of the key players in that whole movement.  I'd like to think that Larry Jones and I when we were there did something to help move it from that point to being one of the real key areas of dealing with creatively and intellectually and academically with the whole notion of black religion and preparing young men and women to move into a variety of different circles.  The schools out in the West Coast, Colgate Rochester of course, has long since been kind of a bastion, but Colgate was kind of still living on the prior work with Martin and other people who'd been through there.  Boston University was another one, that's where Charles went to school, was another one that was kind of living in earlier periods. But it was a time of, you know, reflect back on the Supreme Court Decision that was just handed down on Affirmative Action; well this was a time that was at the very beginning of that phase.  When very few schools were really looking at ways that they could be inclusive and they would, you know, do an inch, by inch, by inch kind of thing and incrementally.  But there were very few that were really out on the cutting edge and that was one of the positions, one of the jobs that I had in that position, was to go around and talk with schools about the importance of being inclusive and helping them to figure out how they may take some steps and move in that direction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 93836
Speaker 1: Oh Howard, back to Howard.  Howard University [School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] had a--I've interviewed a lot of people who had memories of Howard Thurman being at Howard, how he would bring students to his home, you know, on a weekly basis to discuss philosophy and religion and then, you know, recently, I guess, Cain Hope Felder is like a, sort of star of Howard's Theological School.  Do you have any--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I brought Cain to Howard.  And then also to Calvin Morris [HM] brought Calvin to it, to Howard.  I was involved in the process.  But, yeah, Cain is doing an awful lot of work a tremendous amount of work in that area, groundbreaking work that's fantastic.  But you mentioned Howard Thurman.  Another one of my mentors, another experience of picking somebody up and driving them around when he came to visit with us.  Howard Thurman refused to fly and he was, I don't know whether he was afraid of planes.  I think that probably was part of it, but he refused to fly, so he would always travel by train.  And so, I mean he lived in San Francisco Bay area, so, I mean that was always a vast undertaking to have through when he was coming back East.  He was such a wonderful and marvelous person, and the earliest experience I remember of him was when I was a freshman at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and he came to speak.  And he talked in very conversational tone he was not a grand orator in terms of loud and thundering and all that.  But he just talked in conversational tones and, at least my experience, you ended up feeling what he was talking about and it had a way of overpowering you.  I mean I remember one time he was, he just sat on the edge of the stage, you know, just talking to some students and was talking about a student who, a young man who had been in an accident.  And that he just had this conversation with this young man who was in critical condition.  And it was just going on and on.  I don't remember all of the details of it, but I found myself just crying like a baby, and trying to figure out why I was so caught up and so engrossed in this conversation.  Which clearly ultimately had a whole religious meaning in terms of accessing your own life and where you are and taking responsibility for where you're going.  So, I mean he was, he was fantastic and I thought the world of him, still do.  Got all of his books and he autographed all of them to me, so those I treasure, along with Dr. [Benjamin] Mays' books and others.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's had a tremendous impact on everybody he seems to have come in contact with.  People talk about him, you know--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: And the listening rooms that are set up in various places around the country, yeah.
Story_ID: 93837
Speaker 1: What about, did you ever meet [Reverend] Gardner Taylor [HM]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Gardner still comes to Howard to speak every year, every Easter Sunday.  He's there, Gardner, every time he comes there; we have him over to the Divinity School to speak to students and to give lectures and to preach, and just to generally interact with students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is--he was part of, along with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], in the National Baptist Convention around whether the priorities should be saving one's soul, or changing the world, you know, finding justice, you know.  Is that debate still going on?
Speaker 2: Not so much now, no.  Not per se, they're different debates going on.  But the debate of being in the world versus not, is, which was really characterized by the split between the National Baptist Convention and the Progressive National Convention, which really emerge with Gardner Taylor and Martin King and others because J. H. Jackson and much of the leadership of the National Baptist Convention would not, did not condone the kind of activity and agitation that they were advocating.  So much so that even Olivet [Baptist Church] in Chicago, I mean, Jackson changed the address of his church to 32nd Street, I think it is when they changed Cottage Grove to Martin Luther King Avenue, oh no, South Park to Martin Luther King Avenue. So that his church wouldn't have--his stationary wouldn't have Martin Luther King's name on it.  But that particular debate is not over.  The debate is over, I think, the one that I hear emerging most often now though, is kind of the Mega Church Movement.  And how it's important to develop all these Mega Churches that are kind of looking inward, and self-contained as over against one that is very actively involved, like a Trinity United Church of Christ, [Reverend Dr.] Jeremiah [A.] Wright's [Jr.] [HM] church and the like.
Story_ID: 93838
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were talking about the Mega Churches.  What exactly do you mean by Mega Churches, I know you mean big, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Well the Mega Church phenomenon now is, is kind of feeding off of the whole notion that bigger is better.  And that bigger signifies somehow a sense of being blessed, if you will.  And it grows out of the kind of televangelist movement and certainly out of the whole Christian--of the Crystal Cathedral movement with Schuller and, Robert Schuller, yeah.  And so a lot of folks, the black church, a number of black churches have kind of bought into that concept that the main role that we have is to have is to create bigness.  Not so much that it is governed by what you provide for people other than kind of a sense of spiritualism.  But what is it that you're doing with all of this bigness that you're trying to amass.  I mean that's the question.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a rags to riches aspect of this too, I think that's appealing to black people.  I mean do you think because--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I mean, but that's not new.  I mean-(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Schuller starts in the drive in.  He's white of course.  But you know, you've got the Reverend Ike, and like he starts out poor, he becomes a Mega, you know.  I think, Prophet Jones was a pimp acutally and became a, you know, he starts off poor, becomes a pimp, then becomes a big in Detroit.  I mean these--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, you know, if you study the, you know the Black Church Movement, I mean, there's an awful lot in, a lot in sense in which people live vicariously.  I mean the whole notion of wanting the Pastor to have the newest Cadillac and have the best suits and all of that.  So I mean that's not new, but having more and more and more is not really something that is a part of the historical black church movement.  And so, I mean, it's not simply wanting congregation wanting their leader to be kind of live in ways that they would like, but can't so they help to do that.  But its gone way beyond that and it's been the creation of another kind of movement.  That quite frankly I think is, certainly not in sync with the likes of Mays and King and Thurman and others.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're right.  Well I've heard stories that in some of these big churches they admonish the congregation not to drive a raggedy car and come through the parking lot, you know.  I mean that success has to do with prayer and so forth--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: But it also is the linkage of the notion with success with material things.  And success with size that if you are big, then somehow or another you're doing what you should do and the Lord is smiling on you and therefore, don't show anything that you're not that is not symbolic of tangible success in that sense or material success in that sense.  But that's not the history that I read in the Old or the New Testament, that wasn't--I don't find anything that says that that we're going to give you more and more and more, I do find an awful lot of things that say if you feed the sheep and if you take care of injustice, then you don't have to worry where things are going to come from that that will be taken care of as long as you're doing what God admonishes you to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you think that some of the Mega Churches, Mega Church Movement is appealing to the materialistic-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, I think so, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: It was a study that I read about that, now this may be getting too deep, I don't know a science, that we may or may not be able to unravel.  But now as I was saying, there's a certain group compulsion in large numbers--there was a documentary about Benny Hinn, I think it was HBO.  That they discussed, they think that there's a--when people get together in those numbers, million people at a rally or something, that certain feel goodism that occurs that compels people to jump on stage and actually have something physically wrong with them and dance about as it if there's nothing wrong with them.   Later they're in the hospital (laughing) it's a certain group dynamic, you know when people get together at those kind of numbers and profess to believe the same thing.  Do you have any thoughts on that?
Speaker 2: Well, religion is a tremendously powerful and potent phenomenon and it can have tremendous impact on individual lives.  There's no question that people sometimes do things quite differently in large groups than they would do individually, moral man and moral society.  I mean you get a whole notion of kind of a group anonymity that allows people to do things that they would seldom do, if they were just by themselves or on their own.  So, not to really get too deeply into how this impacts individuals and all that, I would simply say that an awful lot of vicarious living in the Mega Church and the like.  I wouldn't--is not unlike some senses of when the lottery gets up to two hundred million dollars, everybody gotta go out and have a--buy a ticket.  There's a hope that if you are around all of that quote success then somehow it's going to rub off on you.  And that, I don't think, is really the fundamental drive of religion, as I understand it.  It certainly--and it's helping mold whatever can help people to deal with the--what Howard Thurman used to call the Vicissitudes of Life.  I mean, if that can help you deal with the ups and downs and the daily ins and outs of life, then fine, but that's not the sum total of it.  And that's not the end all, that's the primary purpose.  It is to enable you to then go forward and do some other things.
Story_ID: 93839
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of Black Church, in your opinion, do we need as a people?
Speaker 2: Not any one single kind of Black Church. It's not monolithic never has been monolithic.  There are a variety of different ways in which people worship, and I certainly wouldn't denigrate or try to characterize in negative ways what people experience.  What I would say that traditionally, traditionally there has been a strand throughout the history of Black Churches that has held themes such as justice in very high regard.  That have held themes, such as care and concern for one's fellow human being in high regard, such as the care and feeding of those who are less fortunate in high regard.  So those are the themes that, I think of that, certainly need to continue need to be present and the extent to which they are not, I think is the extent to which a church that may happen to be black and not being faithful to its history.
Story_ID: 93840
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's catch up your career now, and then we'll get back to some more philosophical questions towards the end.  But you went to Howard, we had you at Howard, I think, stopped our chronologically.  You taught in the Theological Department at Howard [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You were there from?
Speaker 2: I was at Howard from for a period between the summer of '74 [1974] and January '75 [1975] I was half-time in Dayton and half time at Howard.  So I was kind of commuting back and forth.  And then in January of '75 [1975], I moved to Howard full-time and was there from January '75 [1975] until the summer of '85 [1985], so about ten and half years.
Speaker 1: Alright. What would you consider the highlight of your--your tenure at Howard?
Speaker 2: Well I think the most significant highlight is being able to participate in revitalizing an institution.  Howard University, itself was founded in the basement of The First Congregational Church in Washington, D.C. and was founded as an institution to provide Theological Training for African Americans.  That was its founding and then early on, it was determined that if that mission were broadened to a more broader kind of educational experience, that further funding would be available to it.   So it moved away from just being a Theological Institution to what eventually emerged into what Howard University is to this day.  But historically it was founded as a Theological Institute.  Now when Larry Jones who was Dean at Union Seminary in New York, when he--when [James] Jim Cheek [HM] appointed President--appointed him Dean rather at Howard, Larry asked that I come with him, and that one of the--the condition was the creation of a position that would be Associate Dean and that one he asked me to come and that's the one that I filed.  But the challenge was that the mandate was that either we revitalized the school or the University would consider closing it.  Which was a significant historical cost to bear if you will, consider closing the purpose for which it was originally founded.  And so--and then there were a couple of reasons one of which was economic.  But at the time there were 17 Schools and Colleges that made up the University.  Only one of the 17 was precluded from participating in the Federal Subsidy that the University gets, and that was the Divinity School, a School of Religion at the time, because of the separation of Church and State.  And so all of Howard's--the School of Religion's budget had to come out of the 40 percent of the resources of the University when the 60 percent came from Federal sources.  So it was a drain on the University and it was a stepchild, it felt itself to be a stepchild, it had roughly a hundred students, so the challenge was to do something about it.  And over the years, I'm proud to have been a part of--by the time I left there; we had quadrupled the enrollment, quadrupled the budget and moved three times into a larger and larger facilities.  Because we developed a curriculum that people were interested in and we tried to be different.  We tried to be the only University-Based Divinity School in the country that had as its focus the study of Religion by for and about black folks.  And every other University-based school of Religion, whether it be Yale or Harvard or Boston, were schools that did not have that as its mission, number one.  And then number 2, to try to develop a curriculum that made that study relevant and real in the world today so that we had courses like the Church and Community Service, and things like that looking at ways that the resources of churches could be more focused on empowering the communities in which they existed.  And then plus, I had a personal thing that I was working on and I was able to accomplish that.  And that is there--everybody assumed and took for granted that because Howard School of Religion was a Theological Institution and the University's Charter was set up as it was, it was precluded from getting any Federal support.  And I said that's not true, there ways we can do that.  And so I created a program and got funding for the training of Military Chaplains at Howard funded by the Federal Government.  And so we got federal money into the program but that was just to prove a point that we could do that.  So just being creative and looking at ways to take what folks to traditionally accept as the norm, it doesn't have to be like that.  There are other ways that we can look at putting this thing together, so I feel good about that.
Story_ID: 93841
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after Howard [University School of Divinity], you--did you go to Benedict [College, Columbia, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I was at Benedict, at that point, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's where our friend Latta Thomas [HM] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Latta Thomas, absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about Benedict College.
Speaker 2: Well, I had fun, I mean first thing when Sam Nabrit called me and asked me how does it feel to be a President, I said I don't know cause I never been one.  And then I began to realize or asked what in the devil have I gotten into?  But it was a wonderful period of time, I enjoyed immensely.  Again, looking at an Institution that had a very solid history and series of accomplishments on the part of its graduates and students, but really was nowhere close to achieving the positional that it could have.  And so I knew first and foremost of what I wanted to do was strengthen the infrastructure, make sure that it was one of the strongest academic programs that we could put together.  So I was putting much of my initial energy in doing precisely that.  Making sure we created an honest program, created a number of programs where we could attract the best invictus and used that as kind of the foundation, for not only attracting other students but also attracting faculty and building the strength of the institution.  I believe very strongly that, that even in periods of hard time, quality sells, so if you can develop a quality product, you can market that product, and the track record is pretty clear.  We were able to develop a number of things that emerged as leading issues in small colleges and at one point being recognized by the Knight Foundation as one of the Five Creative College Presidents in the country in a small Liberal Arts Instructions, back in 1991, '92 [1992].  So I enjoyed working on that and looking at just imagining what could be possible and helping the work to bring that about.
Story_ID: 93842
Speaker 1: As I said, I saw my mission as helping to strengthen the infrastructure of the institution which is what we did through the academic programs and were able to be recognized in a number of arenas as having a top notch quality programs.  As again, I mentioned the Honors Program became one of the leading of its kind, certainly throughout the state and in throughout the Southeast and became a model for a number of other Institutions.  We created an Environmental Science Program, the first of its kind in the state.  Looking at the whole notion of helping minority youngsters get into the whole minority--in the whole Environmental Field and used in ways to address what, has emerge over the years.  As another issue that is Environmental Racism, where much of toxic waste dump activity takes place in minority communities, that those become the expendable areas, and so that was another arena that we worked on.  Our Teacher Education Program, now everybody recognizes the importance of identifying top notch teachers, well we had a program that was completely moribund, demoralized and the like.  When I left there, it was at the top of its game.  It was creating things that have since become kind of routine, such as we created something called the After Program, The Armed Forces Teacher Education for Retirees.  We have Fort Jackson sitting right there, an awful lot of people retired from the Military out of Fort Jackson, tremendous resource.  All they needed was--and many of them wanted to get into education, so we created a whole program and had a unit out at Fort Jackson where we created a cadre of black males, teachers for Elementary and Secondary schools.  So doing a series of things like that, you know, I feel good that we were able to accomplish much of that.
Story_ID: 93843
Speaker 1: Okay.  That sounds--all sounded good.  Now where did you go to next after Benedict [College, Columbia, South Carolina], and why did even you leave Benedictine? Benedict College, sorry.
Speaker 2: Couple of reasons.  Number one, my wife, at the time was quite ill, she subsequently died.  There was a strain of having to deal with that situation.  When I was there, the average tenure for College President was four years; I'd spent eight years there.  So I like, as I characterize it, that's two life times of doing that.  You wake up at the beginning of each year and you got a 12 million dollar budget, you got about seven million in hand, so you got to raise five million dollars right out of the shoot, so you do that constantly, non-stop.  And so all of that, I really have--decided that time for me to look at something else and so I decided to leave.  Again, a friend of mine, who was a member of Board of Trustees at the time, [William] Bill Clay [HM], who's a Congressman from Missouri, was in line to become Chairman of the Educational Labor Committee, he asked me to come to Washington to work with him, one--the reorganization of Higher Education Act.  So I said okay, that sounds like something that would be interesting.  Move from the arena of being on the ground and being in the trenches to dealing with government policy, helping to set that--moved there temporarily, Bill Harvey, who was another friend of mine, President of Hampton, leaned on me to come spend some time with him as the Provost and Executive Vice President down there.  So I split time between Washington and there and then it was--during that period when my wife actually died.  So I decided to move back to Washington to stay here full-time and been here ever since, was on the Hill till I left, when Bill retired.
Story_ID: 93844
Speaker 1: So what was some of the highlights, I mean, your experiences here in D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well, being involved and helping to shape federal policy as it relates to Higher Education.  One particular item that I take pride in was when the Army Bus Appropriation Bill of 2001, we created a special program, a funding program for low income youngsters as a part of one of the, you know, trio programs to be able to put that in place, to make that happen, that's real money that's on the street right now.  But that was quite, you know, gratifying.  Not so gratifying had to do with being on the Hill during the Gingrich Revolution and all of the negative and anti kinds of things that went on that have, if anything, gotten worse over the years, being on the ground involved in that.  But watching all of that evolve and having some small role to play in helping to work the shape the federal policy has been real something that I've enjoyed.  And that's kind of led into what I'm doing now.  When I left the Hill, deciding well what I'm gone do next?  And I had all of the varyied experiences, particularly as it relates education and policy formation.  And then people started calling me and asking if I would help them with a project or another.  And next thing you know, I'm busier now than when I was on the Hill.
Speaker 1: So you're basically consulting then?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you think of the discussion amongst the Republican Administration, I mean the Republicans and the House and the Senate and the Administration about funding religious organizations that do social services?
Speaker 2: Well, I think as much of what goes on in this town is smoke and mirrors that really is campaign activity.  Religious services have been organizations have played prominent role and is delivering social services for a long time, going back, certainly back to the Great Society Programs of the Johnson Administration.  I mean churches that administered Cap Programs, administered Head Start Programs, all kinds of things.  So that's not new, what's new is this administration wants to blur all of the allied, it wants to allow religious organizations to discriminate, to not to have to follow any kind of employment policies or anything else of that nature all under the banner of playing to that constituency as a political ploy.  And I think that's cynical, I think it has no sincere effort to it at all.  It also is a cynical way to try to cut federal funding for those programs.  To say okay, now church community, you take over these programs, we'll give you a little bit, but not as much as we were giving, and certainly not as much as is necessary to address the real fundamental root causes of the problems, but we'll hand it off to you.
Speaker 1: So you think the religious community really being used for--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 93845
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is some of your hopes and concerns for the Black Community today?
Speaker 2: I'm concerned that as I look at black young people today, that there is a woeful ignorance of history, a tremendous buy in to the whole materialism of the society.  A sense of really not having a feel for one being in the link--being a link in a long chain that would have others coming after.  That we have a responsibility for trying to move the ball a little bit further down the field while we have that opportunity.  So, I concerned about that and, I don't know, you know, quite what to do with it.  I mean, the world, obviously is changing very significantly the whole impact of communication and media and all of that is much more in the lives of young people.  I look at my own children who are, I mean they're much more involved in all kinds of electronic movements and all of that and fortunately for them, they're doing some other things as well.  But for the most part, I don't see young people being actively involved in looking at the world in ways, and raising questions about how can I help to make it a better place to be?  Now, that's the concern that I have.  On the other hand, we still live in a very resilient world, and so I still live with hope that as our young people mature more, that we'll see yet another wave of folks stepping forward in helping to carry the torch on.  But the task is getting more and more difficult because the Institutions that help to nurture and support you and me and others who came before us don't seem to have the same kind of strength.  I mean their educational institutions and the like, are really, really tough.  When I look back at those teachers that I had, and I can take off every teacher that I've had in elementary school, our kids aren't having those kinds of teachers, aren't having those kinds of supportive educational experiences.  And that has to make a difference, I'm concerned about that.
Story_ID: 93846
Speaker 1: Do you have a specific goal that want to achieve in the future, some major goal you want to see reach fruition?
Speaker 2: I really have never set any kind of long range goals.  I've always believed basically in the philosophy of doing the very best job that you can where you are now.  And if you do that, then don't worry about the next day and the day after that, look at what it is that you're confronted with and then figure out the best way to address that and deal with it.  Now that includes being creative, and being creative means you got to look beyond just what you see. That you got take into account the vision for the future and everything else, and work toward that.  But not spend an awful lot of time or energy trying to figure out how I'm going to get from A to B.  That if I do my job well, then I don't have to worry about B, or C or D.
Story_ID: 93847
Speaker 1: Okay.  What would you consider at this point as--you're still young relatively, by today's standards.
Speaker 2: I certainly think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah. What would you consider as your legacy, at this point?
Speaker 2: Probably the lives that I have touched and all of the young people that I've been able to interact with, certainly through and in the higher educational arena.  From the years at Howard, at Benedict, at Hampton, just having had impact on them.  Hopefully positive impact on my children, such that they will carry that message and vision forward.  But that's kind of what I see.
Speaker 1: And sir, lastly how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Somebody that tried to do the best he could.
Speaker 1: Okay. Thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Alright.
