Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask.  They're short questions and they, they only really deserve a short answer (laughter) and so the first one is, ma'am, what is your favorite food?

Story_ID: 192033
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you about your family history.  Now, I'm gonna ask you about your, your mother's side and your father's [Johnie Wilson] side of the family, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name is Woodie, W-O-O-D-I-E, that is not a nickname it's her given name, Durden, D-U-R-D-E-N, McLean, M-C-L-E-A-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 28, 1914, in Swainsboro, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, I know what my mother was the youngest of seven, or is the youngest of seven children, and she was born to a woman who valued higher education.  In fact, my grandmother, my mother's mother, was a graduate of Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], although she was born in 1876 she completed her education at Spelman in 1898 and began teaching before she married my grandfather.  My mother tells me that in those days that married women were not permitted to continue teaching, that most teachers were single and that's probably why they used to call them old, old maid school marms because they were unmarried.  So, after my grandmother married by grandfather she stopped formally teaching, but she became a public speaker and would travel all over speaking and she was also a contemporary of many other early black women in history like Mary McLeod Bethune and Lucy [Craft] Laney.  My maternal grandmother was a contemporary and a friend of theirs.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your grandmother's, your maternal grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Lilly Belle.  Durden was her married name, (simultaneous) yes.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right, all right that's something.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: And my mother's, my mother's father, Lawton Durden was a businessman.  He was--he managed,--he was a landowner and he was a successful landowner farmer in Swainsboro, Georgia, and had at that time the only general store in an area called the Cross Greene County area of Georgia.  So, he had gas pumps, two gas pumps, and a general store, which sold everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what part of Georgia is that, I mean, geographically is it?
Speaker 2: Geographically it's probably east of Augusta, Georgia, and it's, I don't, I don't know how to describe it in greater depth other than it's on the old Savannah Road [Georgia] going towards Savannah [Georgia].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what I was gonna say it's between Augusta and Savannah, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it's not close to, it's not close to Atlanta [Georgia], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, closer to Savannah?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Story_ID: 192034
Speaker 1: (Phone ringing) Are there are any stories that they passed down from that [maternal] side of the family about life in the 19th century or?
Speaker 2: Many stories.  Well, my, one story that I always, I found it fascinating as a physician the fact that my mother's [Woodie Durden McLean] oldest siblings were twins, and they were born in 1903 and that in 1903 and with medicine being whatever it was on that da--that time, they were delivered by midwives, but because they were twins they were so very small.  They were premature, and they were small enough that my mother tells me that her mom told her that the midwife placed them in these Mason jars, not their heads, but just their lower bodies and put them and wrapped the jars and put them near the fireplace.  So, I look at that as probably the earliest type of incubator and it was so that they would preserve their, their body temperature.  Now, it couldn't be the jar that I imagined today that's like a fruit jar, but large jars they were placed in, the jars were wrapped and placed near the fireplace.  Well, it was amazing to me to hear that story because they each lived to be in their--well one died at age eighty-nine and the other died at age about ninety-three and here we're talking about twin deliveries at home in 1903 that were delivered by midwives, placed in jars, incubated, and grew into exceed their life expectancy being black men born at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah that is an amazing story.
Speaker 2: So, I, I always found that story fascinating, particularly as I became a physician and really reflected on that on what the adverse conditions had to have been during that period of time to have been in the rural South and just sort of amazed at the resourcefulness and creativity of people that the things they had to come up with to survive.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's something.  Any other stories?  Is there any, is there, there any information about how your, about your grandparent, your grandparents on how they, their, their parents or your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, I have information and it's a little bit fuzzy for me right now, but I was always fascinated by the fact that my grandfather had so much land and I actually have documents that show how the land was deeded over generations and how ultimately my grandfather's [Lawton Durden] land was forty--I'm sorry, seven square miles of property, which is quite, I realized it's quite a bit of property and I recall being so impressed growing up going to visit in Georgia and feeling that no matter how far we drove this was property owned by my grandfather.  Well, much of that has since been divided amongst my mother's siblings, all of whom are now deceased and their heirs, so it isn't that extensive now, but my grandfather secured his land from his family as well as from my grandmother's [Lily Belle Durden], his wife's family and he was a very smart businessman, so he kept records of all the deeds and all the bequests or how it was bequeathed, so we do have all of those records.
Speaker 1: Yeah is there or was there a story about how so much land was accumulated in the mid-19th century and you know I guess--was it accumulated before the Civil War or after the Civil War or do you know?
Speaker 2: It was, it was probably over time.  And I say over time, some was before the Civil War and I'm sure much of it was after the Civil War.  Some of it was actually purchased and there are the purchase documents that are available.  Some was as I said just through being bequeathed, and there are always, there are these stories that I don't know the full details.  My mother [Woodie Darden McLean] has them about how my great-grandfather purchased my great-grandmother out of slavery--that my great-grandfather was not a slave he was an indentured servant, so he received pay, and he purchased my great-grandmother out of, out of slavery and married her and because he was an indentured servant and working he purchased property.  He always purchased property and acquired property, so I, I've heard, I grew up hearing those stories.
Story_ID: 192035
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's name is Johnie, J-O-H-N-I-E, Daniel, D-A-N-I-E-L, Wilson.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 3rd, 1919, and he was born in Hephzibah, Georgia.  Don't ask me to spell it.  I'd have to look it up.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Hephzibah.
Speaker 2: It's H-E-P--I, I can look that up and give that to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, it's A-H-E-P, we know that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now is that--
Speaker 2: There's a Z in it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there's an H I know that.  Yes, I've not been there.
Speaker 1: Almost a biblical name, I guess Hephzibah.
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: Hephz--yeah.  Is that near Swainsboro [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I don't believe it is, no I, I don't believe that's its geographically close, but it's probably not that far because each has been to the other's birthplace, but I have not been there.  So, it's probably not terribly far.  When you think of the State of Georgia, I mean, the way that we travel today it seems as though you probably could say that anyplace within the state would be within a few hours by car.
Speaker 1: I guess, Georgia's a pretty big state.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is a big state, and I always, I judge things from Atlanta [Georgia] and I know from Atlanta to get to Swainsboro takes us about three and a half hours driving.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it south of Atlanta or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, okay well what do you know about his side of the family, about your father you know?
Speaker 2: I know that my father is the--well let's see my father was--he has one surviving sibling at this time, my aunt Sophie [ph.] and I know that my father had three other brothers all of whom are deceased, and I know what my father and his brothers moved from Georgia to Washington [D.C.] in the early, probably late 1930s and my father at that time was about fourteen or fifteen years old, and he and his brother started working to support my grandmother [Emma Andrews], his mother, who at that time was a widow and to help support that, their household and they formed a business, they drove taxis.  They did whatever was necessary to purchase a home, which they did, on Harvard Street Northwest [Washington, D.C.], and my grandmother never had to work from the time that she and her children moved to Washington.  And my grandmother lived to be almost 102 years old.
Speaker 1: Now, is there any, is there any information about the early history of the family, you know, any old information, you know?
Speaker 2: There, yes, yes, there is and I'm just not as conversant about my father's family history, and I, I know much of it from having attended family reunions and actually reading family documents.  I know that my father's father died in an accident in 1928, so that would make my father having been born in 1919, that would have made him nine years old at the time of his father's death.  And I know what my grandmother did teach, my father's mother did teach for a while and I know that she remarried and married a minister and then he died or I don't recall if they divorced or if he died, but then her final husband who was, last name was Andrews, he died and that's when they moved to Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did your parents [Johnie Wilson and Woodie Durden McLean] meet?  Is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is a story about how they met, but I don't really know of the details because that story's rather fuzzy, but I know that they, I, I know what they met on a train going to Georgia.  My mother was travelling from New York [New York] to Georgia, and my father got on the train in Washington [D.C.] and was going to Georgia and I don't know the whole story beyond that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: But, I, I was always fascinated because I, I love old movies and the whole idea of that, you know they met on this train and they found out they were from near the same place and they found out they had many other things in common and obviously they liked one another.
Story_ID: 192036
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well tell us about your mother's [Woodie Durden McLean] personality.  What kind of personality did, does she have, you know, how did she grow up and did she have a chance to go to school and do some of those things that?
Speaker 2: Okay, well my mother was always been during the course of my lifetime a very independent spirit, and she remains as such.  Very strong willed, very determined, and, and very focused.  One of the things I've come to appreciate about as I've matured is that she inherited her sense for being a very good business woman, probably from her father [Lawton Durden] because she's quite an astute business woman.  But, my mother was the youngest of seven children.  She lost her mother [Lilly Belle Durden] at a very young age.  Her mother died when she was fourteen, when my mother was fourteen, and as I said earlier her father was a rather successful businessman and because he was then left as a widower with his youngest child at that time being fourteen and being a girl at home he did send my mother away to school so that she could complete her education in a, in a boarding school and she would go home, go back home rural [Swainsboro] Georgia on her vacations.  But when she completed high school, she, my mother, immigrated to New York [New York] where her older siblings were, and she continued her education while working.  She attended Hunter College in New York City [New York], so she had at that time a sister, her only sister, who was living in New York City and her sister died at a very young age and my mother had to assume the responsibility then for getting helping her sister in her latter stages of her young life.  She died of leukemia in her twenties, so that I think all of these losses early in my mother's life just served to make her very, an even stronger person and more determined individual.  As I said, she is an excellent business person, so she has always had an entrepreneurial spirit.  When my mother was attending Hunter, at one point she wanted to become an architect, and she then went to Pratt Institute in New York, but was not able to get into the architectural program perhaps as a woman at that age or stage rather or as a black woman, I don't know, but she went into--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It would have been tough either way you would think in those days, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, but she went into fashion design, and she graduated from Pratt with a degree in fashion design, and she opened her own business.  It was called La Mode Dress Boutique in New York City and it was a rather glamorous kind of lifestyle as I saw it as a child because my mother completed Pratt when I was about three years old, so I had a chance to attend her graduation, but I also had a chance to experience my mother as a fashion designer and watcher her drape and dress elegant beautiful woman and watched my mother prepare to do fashion shows that were really extravagant fashion shows.  At that time if you can image in the late '40s [1940s] going into the '50s [1950s] at Small's Paradise [Harlem, New York, New York] and at other well-established places in New York.  Her fashion shows were not just fashion shows they were entertainment extravaganzas where she would have well known entertainers entertain and then have her fashions shown, and sort of almost like a supper club kind of setting, and I was just extremely proud that, you know, that was my mother doing all of those things.
Story_ID: 192037
Speaker 1: Now, who, who were some of the entertainers that performed at her [Beard's mother, Woodie Durden McLean] fashion shows?
Speaker 2: One person I remember in particular because I was fascinated by the fact that he had one leg was [Clayton] "Peg Leg" Bates--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and I was just absolutely fascinated by that.  Sugar Chile Robinson, I was fascinated by the fact that he was a prodigy of the piano, and I was also taking piano lessons, but he could really play what we called then as a boogie woogie piano, and he was a child, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah well Peg Leg Bates he was a national tap dancing star basically--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who appeared on the 'Ed Sullivan Show'.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He owned a resort in New York too, I believe Kings, it was called Kings Lodge in Upstate New York [sic, Peg Leg Bates Country Club, Kerhonkson, New York], yeah.
Speaker 2: I've, I've never, I never been there, but I do, I think I do recall now that you're saying that I recall hearing something about that in later years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But, there were lots of luminaries that were sort of in and out of that aspect of my mother's [Woodie Durden McLean] life.  Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, later Congressman Adam Clayton Powell was the minister who christened me, so Abyssinian Baptist Church [Harlem, New York, New York] was a part of, of our life during that particular aspect, though that is not the church in which I grew up.  I grew up in a church in Brooklyn [New York, New York], Concord Baptist Church [of Christ].
Speaker 1: Concord yeah.
Speaker 2: With [HistoryMaker] Reverend Gardner Taylor.
Speaker 1: Gardner Taylor, yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, the Progressive National Baptist Convention, yeah he was the founder of.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's probably the largest black Baptist church in, in the United States in terms of population, I believe; I think Concord is.
Speaker 2: I don't know, it certainly was at one time--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I don't know if that's still the case, but I maintained my membership at Concord Baptist Church all the way through marriage.  It's where I was married also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 192038
Speaker 1: So your mother [Woodie Durden McLean] really had a career as a fashion designer, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and a well-established designer and well known, and she gave it all up in 1952 when my sister was born because she wanted to stay at home.  She found that being in, in that profession and that particular lifestyle did not give her the opportunity to spend a lot of time being a mother.  She was able--I tagged along.  I was a tag-along child, much of it, but I just absolutely enjoyed it.  I loved it.  I'm still very proud of my mother, but when my sister was born in 1952 my mother felt that it would be too much, and she wanted to stay home for  a few years with her new baby, so she sold the business, but still being an astute business person she sold the business and somehow managed a structured sale so that she managed to have income that allowed her to stay at home for two and a half to three years without going to work and being a stay at home mom until my sister was almost three years old, at which time she went to nursery school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother decided when she went back into the workforce that she would not pursue that, her, her previous profession 'cause it was very demanding.  At that point, she decided she needed to have some kind of job as she says that would give her benefits and provide security for retirement, so she entered civil service and went to work for New York State, and she worked for a number of years with New York State Department of Motor Vehicle[s] and moved from there to New York State Department of Education.  But, in essence, she became a civil servant and retired from civil service with all the benefits that she had looked forward to.  While doing that, my mother also had a second job.  She could not stay too far away from retail and fashion, so she worked at Macy's Department Store.  That was her part-time job.  So, she worked there two evenings and all day Saturday, and she did that for about thirty-five years because she found out if she worked for at least thirty or thirty-five years she would get a lifetime discount, and so she has a lifetime discount at Macy's and she's still a veteran shopper.
Story_ID: 192039
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what about your father [Johnie Wilson], what kind of personality did your father have and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Oh, my father also is a very, still is a very strong, independent spirit, very strong-willed, and my father has always been a worker, always been very determined and a provider.  As I mentioned that he provided with his brothers, for his mother [Emma Andrews] early on in life, and he continued doing that.  My father with his brothers owned taxi cabs here in Washington, D.C., but then he went into the service during World War II [WWII] and when he left the service my father also became a government employee, and he worked for a number of years until his retirement at the [U.S.] Naval Research Lab[oratory] here in Washington, D.C.  But, in addition to doing that, my father has always been a community activist, very, very involved in the community, particularly here in Washington, D.C., attending city council hearings, being neighborhood commissioner, just being extremely involved.  And even now at age eighty-four, he is still involved.  He maintains the district cable, television on almost twenty-four hours to constantly rewatch the hearings and to make council people very aware of what his feelings are.  He says he has to keep them doing their job the right way.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did he, how was he inspired to get involved in politics do, do you know?
Speaker 2: I really, I really don't know what his inspiration was, but he has been cited as a community activist.  He's received many awards and accolades by the District of Columbia, and I'm really very proud of him.  And it's rather interesting because politically my father and I are not always on the same page.  Things that he advocates I'm not always in favor of.  I can remember when there were student protests at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], not terribly long ago since my graduation, my father took paper towels, toilet paper, food, he took water, he took all kinds of supplies for the students who were protesting, who were holding the administration building hostage literally.  He took things down there to support them to keep them going.  Well, I didn't feel at the time that that was appropriate 'cause I didn't feel that the students should have been doing that and it was always amazing to me that my father being of his generation would be the one who I always thought was more radical and he would view me as a young person as being rather conservative in my approach to things.
Story_ID: 192040
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were talking about your paternal grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yes, my paternal grandmother, Emma Andrews [ph.], was just a fascinating person to me.  Number one, she had an excellent memory and it always amazed me that she lived through so many eras.  She remembered, and she could remember all the presidents from the time of her birth, and she was born in 1887, and she could just recite all the presidents and I certainly could not recite the presidents in order, but she recall the first flight when the Wright brothers [Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright] flew.  She recalled so many inventions and so many events in history, but I really enjoyed and I was fascinated hearing her tell me the stories of people who had been slaves.  My grandmother was born after [The] Emancipation Proclamation, but she knew many people when she was growing up who had been slaves and some of them who were just a little bit older than she, and she would tell me how many people that, what people don't, didn't talk about.  How many people had been blinded in one eye, marred, had limbs cut off in form of punishment, had been so severely scarred by events in slavery and how they still managed even after Emancipation Proclamation to go on to be, be productive beings in society.  But, her stories were always just so vivid to me that I regret now that I did not have a tape recorder or take a tape recorder and just spend days asking her to record many of her recollections of that particular period of time.
Speaker 2: Oh its, if, you know, it's important to remember what you can about what she said and write it down.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But people tend to lose, lose memory, I mean, as a, as a group we lose memory of what happened during those days unless we pass it--
Speaker 1: Very true.
Speaker 2: --that information down.
Speaker 1: And I was very impressed by the fact that my grandmother was an extremely neat person, always cared about her appearance and even up to the date of her death she read the newspaper every day even though her vision was failing.  She had very thick glasses near, near the end of her life, but she would read the Washington Post [Washington, D.C.].  She would get up in the morning do her personal care herself and near the end of her life her arthritis was very problematic, but she would do her personal care and she would dress and every day she would have a fresh linen handkerchief.  And she always had a linen handkerchief somewhere on her person, and she would read the newspaper.  On the date of her death, she had gone through that routine.  She had dressed, had read the paper, and had I guess at some point decided to lie down in her room, take a nap.  Her bed was fully made and she just lied on her bed and when my aunt, who lived with her, didn't hear her stirring around late in the morning my aunt called to her to see what was going on, went into her room, and my grandmother was lying on the bed fully clothed, newspaper folded there by her chair, and she had died.  So, she died very peacefully and she was dressed and not in a state of disarray or any pain or anything.
Speaker 2: We should all be this lucky (laughter).
Speaker 1: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she remained very lucid and very mentally alert up to that point.
Story_ID: 192041
Speaker 1: Your nuclear family included--now, you, you lived in Brooklyn [New York, New York] with your mother [Woodie Durden McLean].  I take it you didn't live with your father [Johnie Wilson] at all?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up pretty much in Brooklyn with my mother.  I did live with my grand--my father's mother [Emma Andrews] and my father off and on during periods of time of growing up because my father was in the service.  So, my father wasn't, wasn't always at home either in Brooklyn or in Washington [D.C.].  He was in the service, but because my mother was in effect was a single mother and was starting this business and at that point I was the only child my, my paternal grandmother offered to take care of me so my mother could get her business going.  So, I actually lived here in Washington for a while with my grandmother and saw my father very frequently when he was home from the service and then my mother would come to Washington and stay for periods of time and then go back to New York [New York].  So, I was between Washington and New York until I was perhaps about age four or so and then I started spending almost all of the time in New York, only coming to Washington at school breaks.
Story_ID: 192042
Speaker 1: I want you to take us back to your childhood and give us some idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay, I had, well I guess every child thinks that he or she had an idyllic kind of childhood, but I, I, I absolutely, I know I did.  My home was always a hub of activity, growing up with my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] I mean she was, if you ever saw the movie 'Auntie Mame' my mother was that kind of take charge kind of person, always loved to entertain.  So, there were always lots of people coming in and out of our apartment in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  Some names, some were well known names and some are just friends and neighbors, but they were always to me as a child growing up they were fascinating people who always seem to dress well and they were always doing exciting things.  Several things, my mother loves entertaining until today she does.  So, there was always some party or some event that was being planned.  If it weren't a big fashion show outside of the home, there was something being planned in our home, some dinner my mother was giving or what have you and I was always right there with her.
Story_ID: 192043
Speaker 1: So, I was always a part of the plan, and my mother always allowed me to express my opinion to the chagrin of her siblings who felt that she let her child be "too grown" and to the cha--chagrin rather of some of her friends that my mother did not insist that I call people Mr. and Ms. unless she did or refer to her friends as aunt and uncle.  She said, "No they're not your aunt or your uncle," you know, my brother, whatever, those are your uncles and however she addressed people was how she told me to address them.  Well, I realize now as an adult that many people did not subscribe to that, but she taught me to always be respectful, but she felt that I, I could address people as she addressed them unless she otherwise instructed me to do so.  So, that always put me a little bit at odds with my cousins who had to address people differently.  Their parents had advised them differently, and they had to say, "Yes ma'am," and, "No ma'am," and my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] told me I didn't have to say that.  So, it made it a little difficult when we would go to Georgia to visit my maternal grandfather [Lawton Durden] because here are all the cousins, all the grandchildren are going down to visit Georgia and I'm the only one who is not saying yes ma'am or no sir to adults in the group and it became a little problematic at one point I guess to my grandfather who had this general store and as his suppliers were delivering things and they would say, "Oh I see, you know, your grandchildren are here," or what have you and they would ask us our names or where we were from and we would each respond in the manner in which we were familiar responding.  I can remember one person saying to my grandfather that you have a pretty smart little Yankee there.  This was a white man who said this to me, referring to me, and I didn't understand the connotation of that comment, and I just remember saying, "Oh no I'm not a Yankee I'm a Dodger [of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team, Brooklyn, New York]."  I'm thinking in terms of only, you know, the Yankees [baseball team, New York, New York].  We didn't like the Yankees, I'm from Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: Baseball, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no don't let anyone call me a Yankee I was a Dodger and I didn't--and my grandfather sort of looked at me in a startled way.  I didn't realize that I had misspoken, but he told me later on that I should never respond to an adult who was not speaking to me, that this man was speaking to him.  Well, I certainly don't remember how I felt about that at that time, but that sort of stuck with me because that was a difference in child-rearing practices that was a very different period of time.  We're talking about the '50s [1950s] in rural Georgia, and I grew up in Brooklyn New York with an independent very think, different thinking kind of woman, a woman who was doing things that women, and particularly, black women were not doing during that era, and she was doing all of this and she was raising her child in the manner in which she wanted to raise her child but my grandfather was trying to making it very clear that children did have a place, and they were not to interfere in as he said grown up conversation.  Well, I remembered trying to sort of a reason with him in the sense, but he was talking about me and I remember saying, "But Papa he was talking about me and he said I was a Yankee and I'm not a Yankee, I'm a Dodger," and my grandfather saying, "He was not talking to you he was talking to me and you're not to supposed to interfere in grown up conversation."  Well, I later on I understood that's why there was this dilemma about the way my cousins were being reared by my mother's siblings, and the way I was being reared because they never would have ventured to have interrupted that conversation.  But, we, when I say we later my sister, and we were in a household where my mother encouraged us to express our feelings, to ask questions, and if we had something to say to be polite, but we certainly had a voice always at the table.  So, answering your question what was it like growing up in my household I felt like I was a little adult in a sense.  And I can remember in a couple of instances my mother talking with friends or someone in my presence and they would say something like, "Oh Woodie [Durden McLean]," you know they would--when adults are talking hush tones around children.  That's when children really listen because they know that they're about to say something they're not supposed to hear, and my mother--they would say something like, "Oh Beverly," that's my middle name, "Beverly is in the room."  My mother would say, "That's okay, that's okay," and then she laughs about it today.  I would pipe up with, "I may be little, but I'm grown."  Now, I don't remember saying those kinds of things, but my mother shares with me today the kinds of things like that that I would say.  I would say, "Oh that's okay I may be little, but I'm grown."  So, I probably felt from a child that I was almost on the same par with adults, but even though I was little my mother always empowered me with the fact that I had certain kinds of rights and that was exciting to me that she would ask my opinion on things even to the point of talking about politics.  I can remember very, very well when Adlai Stevenson [II] and [President Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower were running for president, and I, I can remember the whole emotion of Republicans and Democrats and whatever it meant to me at that point as a child and being very curious about how my mother would vote and for whom she would vote.  And I can remember my mother discussing this with me, and my wanting to actually go with her to vote and to see how, how she was going to pull the lever, and she told me I could not do that.  But, because I could remember challenging about, "Ma, you have to vote for this person," and she would not tell me how she was going to vote, but she told me something that was really important she said, "It doesn't make a difference about your label, it doesn't make a difference whether you're called a Democrat or Republican.  You only vote for the person, you don't vote for the label," and that's something that stuck with me.

Speaker 1: Now yeah this is so, so you had a sort of different, really a different upbringing from a lot of black children, you know, having that kind of latitude.
Speaker 2: I had a lot of latitude and I had a lot of exposures.  I had a lot of exposures.  I can remember going to the Apollo [Theater, Harlem, New York, New York] with my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] late at night and falling asleep in her lap, but watching live shows, watching live entertainment because she wanted to go.  So, she wasn't going to leave me with a sitter she said.  She wasn't going to leave me anyplace.  She would just take me every place with her.  So, I can remember like waking up and seeing, you know, performances on the stage falling asleep, but also I remember my mother even with her very busy schedule took me to young people's concerts all over New York City [New York].  I can remember my mother always taking me to Radio City Music Hall [New York, New York] to see the Christmas show and Easter.  She always recognized the importance of the live performances.  We would go to the movies, but we would also always go to live performances.  My mother would take me to museums, and I realized later on because she shared with me, that she tried to find as many free opportunities to take us to, to expose us to things because at that point she was on a very limited kind of an income, but she maintained a lifestyle that when I think back I don't, can't quite understand how did we do it.  We really didn't have a lot, but I always felt like we had a lot.  I took piano lessons from age three.  I had many opportunities.  I travelled with my mother.  I felt a part, very much a part of her life, a part of what she was doing, and I always felt she was doing exciting things.  As I said, she was entertaining.  She was just doing so many things.  It was always a flurry of activity.  My mother--some of her entertaining it's funny to me because she is an avid card player.  Right now at age eighty-nine my mother plays bridge on a national level.  She plays tournament bridge.  She's a bridge master, and she really has always been a game person, a card playing person.  And I can remember some of her gatherings at home were card parties and, but now those were serious because my mother was a serious game player, so she doesn't like there to be a lot of talking or joking because she is all about winning.  And I can remember just seeing all of these people playing cards and you just hear the cards hitting the table.  You heard very little talking because to her that game playing was serious.  So, as I was growing up she would involve me in games, Scrabble, Monopoly.  Monopoly was too slow.  I--was really sort of slow.  Scrabble was immediate because you could get your scores immediately and you formed your words, and she would always have a dictionary on the table and she would challenge, as my sister and I were growing up, we'd play Scrabble.  She didn't have any mercy on us.  She didn't say, 'Oh that's okay that's close enough."  She would challenge and have us look up in the dictionary and if it wasn't valid she would deduct the points.  We lost those points, and it would really annoy us that we would always win and we'd say, "That's not fair you're smarter than we are and you know more," and she says, "Well you know you have to keep at this until you can win."  And I can remember the one day, the first time I won at Scrabble.  It was such an achievement that I didn't want to play with her anymore because I felt I probably wouldn't be able to duplicate that success.  But, until--
Speaker 1: How old were you when you did that?
Speaker 2: I was probably when I actually won, I think I was probably about eleven, eleven or twelve and I would just really look for words.  I mean, I would just look in the dictionary constantly and, and extend my vocabulary.  I mean, I would just try to find the words that would utilize the letters, the X, that would utilize the letters that would give me greater point value, but I knew my mother would insist that we, that it was a proper word that could be used that conformed to all the rules of the game and I was just constantly doing crossword puzzles.  I just knew I had to figure out a way to beat my mother at Scrabble.  How to do the triple points or the triple score words or what have you and when I did it was such a sense of achievement, and she was very happy that I had, that I had gotten to the point that I could beat her.  Then she and my sister continued in their Scrabble quest over years, but I, I wasn't as interested in that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: Tell us about school.  Now where did you go to school in Brooklyn [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I went to school, public school in Brooklyn, started at P.S. 67.  In New York City [New York, New York] schools every, schools have letters before their name.  During that time, it was P.S. for public school and a number of the school in my neighborhood.  And I entered in the first grade and stayed and graduated from that school in the eighth grade.  Then I went to high school, a really unique high school in Brooklyn, Midwood, M-I-D-W-O-O-D, High School in Brooklyn, which was not in my neighborhood.  And the way I happened to go to Midwood was really interesting because what my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] did again, giving tribute to her creativity and resourcefulness, she took it upon herself to find out which was the best public high school in Brooklyn and she did this by checking the scores, the National Merit Scholars and, and at that time the region scores of all of the city high schools and found out that Midwood was the top, and she determined that that was the school where I would go.  During that period of time, you could only attend the high school in your district, so you were given choices of schools in your geographical area.  The schools in our geographical area my mother determined were not good academic institutions.  There was one commercial school.  There was one known as a vocational or a trade school, and then there was one general high school that was supposed to be academic, but she checked and found out that many of the students did not graduate and very few of them went on to college and she determined that I would not go to any of those schools.  So, when it was time to indicate for second and third choice in elementary school in the eighth grade for high school, my mother had me write Midwood, Midwood, Midwood, my first, second, and third choice and I can remember my teacher saying, eighth grade teacher, saying, "Oh well this is wrong we can't complete this in this manner you have to indicate a first, second, and third choice they have to be different schools and they must be the three schools in this district," and I went home and told my mother that we had to do it and she said, "No, you won't do it that way, you're only putting down where, where you wanna go and this is where you want to go," and she told where I wanted to go and she sent it back.  So, ultimately she had to go to the principal, and the principal said that my form could not be submitted to the Board of Education because it was not completed properly, and he said that I would not be able to go to Midwood because it was outside of my zone.  And my mother told him the reasons why I would go to Midwood.  He told her, he made the mistake of telling her that he had not been successful in getting a white child in Midwood, so he certainly was not going to move my name forward.  Mind you, my principal was a white male, Mr. McHugh [ph.].  Well, when he told my mother that, that just gave her ammunition to do what she knew she needed to do next.  She went to the principal of Midwood High School to make him aware that she wanted me to attend there.  He told her that he was bound pretty much by what the Board of Education would do, and she took all of my report cards and what have you, grades one through eighth, and he called the principal of my elementary school and said, "Well she is the top student in P.S. 67 in your eighth grade," and my principal I found out later told the principal at Midwood High School that that didn't count, that being the top student in that school was meaningless in terms of how I would fare with other students, that that wasn't significant.  Now that was unusual because you would think a principal actually downgrading his own school, but that was the extent to which Mr. McHugh was willing to go not to have me, Negro Lillian McLean go to Midwood ninety--well I'll tell you about that percentage in terms of racial percentage in a few moments.  But, in any event, Dr. [J.] Bernstein, the principal of Midwood shared that information with my mother.  So, Dr. Bernstein then said, "Well you know it's right in the next two weeks there is a city-wide"--they would, even then they would do this IQ testing and what have you, "there's a city-wide test being given for all eight grade students on achievement IQ," et cetera, et cetera, "why, why don't we just wait and see how your daughter fairs with that and then we can pretty much see if she's going to be able to keep up with the school."  Well, as good fortunate and God would have it, I scored the highest in the region on that exam.  I am so thankful I had no idea of how important that would be.  My mother did not put that pressure on me because as far as I knew my mother was just--my mother said you're going to Midwood and that was it.  So, the scores came out and I scored the highest, so it was no longer in the hands of my principal, my elementary school principal.  My mother then took her case to the board of education, and the board of education said that I could, I could go to any high school in the city where the principal would accept me, and Dr. Bernstein accepted me and that's how I went to Midwood.  So, it was two bus rides and a subway ride away.  It took me, it would take me an hour, about an hour and twenty minutes each way.

Speaker 1: Was it [Midwood High School] in Brooklyn [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was in Brooklyn.  It was at the other end of Brooklyn.  When I entered Midwood High School in the ninth grade that was in 1957, and it was the year of the Little Rock Nine and there was only one other Negro student in the ninth grade at Midwood and there were over 1000 students entering the ninth grade and there was one other young lady, Cheryl McCoy [ph.], who is now deceased and I were the only two.  And I, and I didn't know a soul at the school, didn't know anyone there and I can remember watching on TV the Little Rock Nine kids being escorted to school and feeling a certain sense of isolation.  I remember feeling at least they know one another, and I didn't know anyone, but probably by the third day of school or so I was befriended by one young lady who was in the hallway and witnessed these guys trying to literally trip me as I was walking down the hall looking for my class.  And one of them stuck his foot out so I could fall, and I saw it with my peripheral vision and I just sort of jumped over it and kept going.  And I remember this one girl came over to me and introduced herself, Audrey Bomse and until this day we're best friends.  She became, you know, immediately she said, "What, what class are you looking for?" And I told her and I found that we had two classes together.  She was also in the ninth grade.  Her father was a pediatrician and became a very influential person in my life in terms of deciding on going into pediatrics.  I became almost a virtual member of their family and Audrey of mine, though she was a Jewish girl in a traditional Jewish home from Brooklyn and I was at that point a Negro girl living in a section of Brooklyn that her parents probably had never even entered Fort Greene [Brooklyn, New York, New York], but Audrey became a virtual member in my household and I became one in her household as we continued through high school.  She is now an attorney, which is fascinating.  She's living in Israel, and she's on a mission with the UN [United Nations].  She is on sabbatical from Rutgers University [The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], but here she is a Jewish woman, a survivor, well actually the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, working as to protect the rights of the Palestinians in the West Bank.  So, we laugh about it.  She spent a weekend with me just a couple of months ago.  We laugh about the fact that she was a maverick in 1957 when she just sort of came over introduced herself and befriended me when no one else did at that school and how today she's still fighting for the rights of those who she feel, who she feels are not being adequately represented or rights protected.
Story_ID: 192047
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers who influenced you?  I know you must have encountered some teachers that were concerned about your development and helped.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I had a teacher in the eighth grade [at P.S. 67, Brooklyn, New York, New York], Mr. Navadni [ph.], was the teacher in the eighth grade who during this entire period of applying to high schools and having to complete the choices that I mentioned, always putting Midwood [High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York], Midwood, Midwood, Mr. Navadni said to me that he felt that he was between a rock and a hard place because he had to tell the students that they had to put down the choices that were in the district in which we lived.  And at the same time he said to me, but he felt that I would be successful wherever I went to school and he was a silent supporter of my being able to go to this other high school Midwood, which was out of my district.  But, he was told that every student had to do it in the manner that, of course that school principal dictated that we had to do, but he would always pull me aside to tell me that he would say, "Lillian you're going to do very well in whatever school you go to."  He was all--despite the fact that my principal was indicating to others that just because I was the top student in P.S. 67 would have nothing to do with anything else I do in life.  Well Mr. Navadni kept tell me that it would have everything to do with whatever happened to me in life.  The fact that I was the top student and the fact that I was, he didn't say top student, he said the fact that I was a good student and he told me to always hold fast to my dreams.  So, he was a teacher who had some influence on me.  In high school [at Midwood High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York], there were teachers who had influence.  One was Mr. Gordan [ph.] who was a social, social studies and history teacher, a great influence because Mr. Gordan wrote the review books for the regions and history and if you had a class with Mr. Gordan it was not like a typical classroom kind of setting.  He had forums, open forums, and therefore encouraged comment, exchange of ideas, and it was the first time I had in a classroom setting the opportunity to express my ideas and to have them respected by a teacher who would challenge it, but challenge it in a respectful manner, not put it down, not be dictatorial, but encouraged this kind of exchange amongst the students.  So, he had a terrific influence on me.
Story_ID: 192048
Speaker 1: Were you engaged in high school activities [at Midwood High School Brooklyn, New York, New York]?  Did you run for student office or engage in any of the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, general social activities of high school?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, yes.  In high school, I was, I became a very active of everything.  I was in chorus, in girl's chorus in high school.  I was in the honor athletic society, which was called DOCSA [ph.] which served many purposes.  I mean number one it was a way of recognizing the students who seem to have some kind of athletic ability, but what it did it excused us from regular PE [Physical Education] and we had more concentrated kind of physical education, different kind of PE, so we were sort of student leaders in PE and not just participants.  I was also a booster, which was not a cheerleader.  I didn't make it to cheerleading.  That was one of the emotionally unsettling aspects of high school.  I wanted to be a cheerleader.  I went to tryout and I practiced all the cheers.  I knew all the cheers.  I had all the enthusiasm, and I can remember being before a panel of girls that you know had to make the decision and they told me that I didn't make cheerleading squad because my legs were too small, that they didn't look good in the boots, and that, I mean, a little comment like that really always had an impact.  I always became then self-conscious about my legs.  I know--then I noticed cheerleaders have big legs 'cause they fill the boots, and my legs wouldn't fill boots, but I did make booster squad.  I in terms of student government activities Midwood High School was structured like a city.  It was called the City of Midwood.  So, we didn't have a student body president.  We had the mayor.  We would elect a mayor of Midwood, so the school was structured in a very interesting way.  We had commissions and commissioners, and we had councils.  So, I was the FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] commissioner, and I think back now when I smile I thought it was natural that I would be the FDR commissioner.  The FDR commissioner was really the commissioner that had to deal with equal rights and civil rights and what have you for the school.  So, the school really did function very much like a city and it, it was fascinating to hold office in such a structure, in such an educational kind of structure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you graduate with honors?  Did you?
Speaker 2: Yes I did from Midwood, yes.  I graduated in the top 5 percent of my class.  It's interesting I graduated in a class of 1,155.  By the time I graduated, there were three other Negro students who entered Midwood in the tenth grade.  So, they were five of us at graduation of 1,155.  There were five--at that time we were Negroes, Negro students, and I graduated in the top 5 percent of my class.
Story_ID: 192049
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you were on the verge of graduation [from Midwood High School, New York, New York] did you know what you wanted to pursue as a career in college?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact I knew from elementary school [at P.S. 67, Brooklyn, New York, New York].  The only recollection that I have of what I wanted to do as an adult was to be a physician.  I--there was never anything else that I wanted to do.  I knew that I wanted to pursue medicine so much so that in elementary school there were many teachers early on who would say, "No you mean you wanna be a nurse," and I said, "No I want to be a doctor."  So, that was still during the era that you didn't hear young girls speak of becoming doctors, but I knew I wanted to be a physician and that was always what I wanted to be through elementary school, through high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any role models before you of doctors in the community that you knew or where did you come up with that, that idea?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure where the idea originated.  My mother [Woodie Durden McLean] may, may have clearer idea of that because she just tells me that when I was very, very small that she would take me to the doctor when she would go that I would accompany her so that I was very comfortable going to the doctor and then when she would take me for my medical care she said I did not object to going to the doctor and she just remembers when I was very, very small saying that I wanted to be a doctor.  And someone, I don't know now who said this or what, but someone had said something about, "Well maybe she really wants to be a nurse," and my mother recalls that I said, "No I wanna be a doctor because the doctor tells the nurse what to do."  So, I had an understanding of the roles in terms of the authority that was given the doctor.  I didn't truly understand perhaps what being a physician entailed.  There were no physician members of my family at that time.  I was the first.  I had role models in the since of our family doctor who was a doctor who was respected within the community and was regarded as a family friend also, but on a social level he wasn't really a part of, of our lives.  I had in high school my best friend's father who was a physician, a pediatrician, so that was probably my first experience on a social level of being around a physician other than being a patient was with being with Dr. Bomse, Audrey's [Bomse] dad, and seeing him in his office and under, seeing his role as Audrey's dad and as my friend's father and having him tell me what it was like being a doctor.  That's the first one-on-one experience that I had with a physician was when I was in high school.
Story_ID: 192050
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you choose a college?
Speaker 2: Interesting way, well let me start at the back end and go back because a guy I was dating in high school [at Midwood High School, Brooklyn, New York, New York]  was going to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and therefore I wanted to go to Howard also.  That's the back end of it.  The front end was that a part of my mother's [Woodie Durden McLean] plan and--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: We were talking about how you chose a college.
Speaker 1: Yes, a part of my mother's plan in choosing a great high school was so that I would have great opportunities for college because I understood very clearly that I would need to have scholarship assistance, and scholarship based on merit to attend college.  And my mother felt by making sure I was in the right academic setting in high school, a high school that churned out scholars and that their students went to top universities, that if I'm in that kind of setting that, that's what would happen for me.  So, as things would unfold when it was time to select colleges and I started applying I was applying what they were then known as the seven sister colleges, like Vassar [College, Arlington, New York], Barnard [College, New York, New York], Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and then I applied to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], which for no other reason other than I'd met one person who had attended University of Michigan that spoke so highly of how much fun campus life was like, what it was like there, that I applied there and then I applied to City College of New York [New York, New York] because as a city resident I was entitled to go there and that was sort of my sure school and then the, my boyfriend in high school who at that time was Austin Sobers [ph.] he was applying to Howard because he was a legacy student.  His parents had gone to Howard as had his grandmother and he thought that that was going to, that was going to be his selection because he wasn't as good of a student academically as I'd been, and he thought that his options might be a little limited.  So, then he said he was applying to Howard and he encouraged me to apply to Howard.  My mother became very upset because that wasn't in her vision that I would apply or attend Howard.  So, when we did all of our exams and what have you and I got a New York State Regent scholarship.  I was a New York State Regents scholar, which gave me, afforded me the opportunity that if I selected a school in the State of New York, any school where I was accepted in the State of New York I'd have full scholarship in terms of tuition paid and all fees paid plus I was eligible to get a stipend, which would be "spending money."  And I was accepted at Barnard, which was in the city, but I was also accepted at Vassar, which was up in Poughkeepsie [New York], and I was accepted at City College in the Honors Program at City College in terms of New York State schools.  University of Michigan I was accepted and I applied to Howard and I was accepted, and my mother said, "You're not going to Howard," and I wasn't quite sure at that time of all her reasons, but she said to me because it's a party school and she said, you know, "You'll, you know, it's just a party school you're not going there."  And I was adamant that I wanted to go there because that's where my friend was going, and she said well I, you won't get a dime to go there and the reality is I wasn't going to get any money from the Regent Scholarship to go there and at that time there was something called the National Negro Scholarship [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Fund, right.
Speaker 1: --Fund and they would not give me funds to go to Howard because they were only funding students who were going to predominantly white schools.  They would match whatever scholarship aid.  This was not the United Negro [College] Fund [UNCF].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This was something that preceded it, and this was taking place in the '60s [1960s] when there was the effort to integrate many institutions of higher learning, so if you were accepted to any of the predominantly white schools and you got any scholarship aid this found would match your aid equal whatever you got and they would not match for any historically black college [HBCUs].  In fact, they were not even being called historically black colleges and universities then, but Howard was not eligible for me to get funding.  My mother said so you won't go because I'm not spending any money and you won't have any aid to go there.  Well, it just so happened that I found out that there would be an exam offered for Howard for a scholarship that was coming up that was maybe a week or so away and I just made it in terms of the deadline for applying.  I took the exam and I got a scholarship, and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 192051
Speaker 1: I came to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] was upset at the time because she felt I had given up many opportunities.  I'd given up lots of scholarship money to come to Howard, but I told her that I wanted to have the opportunity to no longer be one of the few.  I didn't want to be one of five, didn't want to be one of two, I didn't want to be when you look at the picture of my elementary school [P.S. 67, Brooklyn, New York, New York] you will see that I was always academically in a situation where I was in the minority always.  And I wanted to be in the majority, and she said, "But Howard is a black school and you're not going to get the same kind of educational opportunities," and I subscribed to her at that time that I would do well wherever I went.  I remember what Mr. Navadni [ph.] in the eighth grade told me, and I told my mother that and she said, "But all they do is party."  That was her idea of Howard.  And I said, "Good 'cause I wanna do that too," and I came to Howard and I did all of it.  I was a good student, and I had a fantastic time and I did party and I enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: Now this is 1961?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right, so what did you major in at Howard?
Speaker 1: Zoology.  I was a zoology major because that's what most pre-med students majored in, and again I was focused on going into medicine.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Who were some of your teachers at Howard?
Speaker 1: Let's see Dr. Clark [ph.] in Zoology, Dr. Anderson, Winston Anderson, who at that time was my lab instructor in zoology, but he became a life influence and a life friend, and he later became the chairman of the Department of Zoology at Howard.  In fact, he still holds the title of professor, and I believe chair, but he was my lab instructor at Howard.  And let's see naming teachers, Mr. Franklin [ph.] in history.  Mary Frances Berry was my history teacher.  She was a grad student at the time, but she taught me history.  Interesting, I mean, I can think I can picture Dr. Crump [ph.], histology.  I can picture just about all of my teachers, and I didn't anticipate being asked to name some of them.  In undergrad, I've just named a few of them.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what about some of the other students.  Now that was, now '61 [1961] was a time of a great deal of activism and Howard students--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --participated at the national level in Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC]--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and so and the movement.
Speaker 1: Didn't realize at the time that I was really sort of a part of history.  Didn't realize Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was ahead--he was already on campus when I got there, but he was a class or two, I think two classes ahead.  There were a lot of, I mean he, he wasn't, he was an activist, but I didn't know him on campus as an activist.  It's interesting I discovered his real activism when I got beyond undergrad at Howard that he was there on campus.
Speaker 2: But you, you knew him as just another student?
Speaker 1: As just another student, yes, yes.  I didn't appreciate the level of his activism until years later because there were so many students who were involved in so many things.  As you said the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee they were just stu--everybody had some level of involvement.  It was just a very busy, a very active campus.  That it was a matter that any one student's activism seemed outstanding at the time.  The other thing that was interesting about those times students were also very serious about getting their education, and we were, we recognized that we were sort of on the threshold of something of change and we continued to hear from instructors and from others that we had to be prepared for the change, for all of these changes.  [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was the president at that time.  I mean, there was this, there was a sense that change was going to be occurring, and it was going to be good change and we needed to be academically prepared.  So everyone was serious about being a student, but at the same time we were serious about preparing for our roles in life beyond the university.

Speaker 1: Now did you realize at that time that your reverend [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] back in Brooklyn [New York, New York] was involved the Civil Rights Movement as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, I certainly did, and I didn't realize that he was going to become or was at that time the dean of preachers in the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Reverend Gardner Taylor.
Speaker 2: Reverend Gardner C. Taylor, absolutely, absolutely.  Yes, I did realize that his level of involvement and [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] was a frequent guest speaker at Concord Baptist Church [of Christ, Brooklyn, New York, New York] as were many of the other Civil Rights people, but again when you're living through history at that period you don't always recognize the significance of that moment, you just, you, you know who the people are, you know their names, you know what they are doing, but you don't understand what their mark in history will be as time goes on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I realized that I've been extremely privileged to have been taught by a minister to nurture.  I've been in the company of, of so many world greats, and I appreciated what was going on at the time.  I just didn't understand what their mark in history would be.
Story_ID: 192053
Speaker 1: Well, so you had, you had a good time in, in campus life at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and--
Speaker 2: Wonderful time.
Speaker 1: Your grades were still good?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grades were still good.  Well, there were a couple of things that I realized early on number one:  Unlike some of my friends including my roommate, I had a scholarship and I had to maintain a three point average to maintain my scholarship and that it was very clear that if my average went below that, that I'd lose my scholarship.  And it was also very clear to me if I lost my scholarship, I'd be out of school and if I were not in school I would be in the workforce.  So, I had motivation to keep my grades up, but I also enjoyed having a good time.  So, a couple of things that I'd learn to do:  I would come in immediately after class and do whatever my assigned stuff was to do.  I would get it all done and, so that when the bid whist parties would start at ten, eleven o'clock I could always sit through a couple of hands because I'd already done my assignments unlike some of my friends who would come in and get started with the bid whist planning to stay up half the night and study and would fall asleep and maybe not finish, that when I was sitting and playing in the dorm I'd already done pretty much what I had to do.  And I'd always been able to get up, wake up early and do my work really early to do review or what have you.  So, that's always put me in good stead, so I could do both.  I could do my academics and I could participate fully in dorm life and I could be ready for all the parties and what have you that campus life had to offer.  And Howard was absolutely wonderful; I loved every moment of it.
Speaker 1: Now was your high school boyfriend [Austin Sobers (ph.)] still there, and did you all continue too?
Speaker 2: Yes, my high school boyfriend and I entered at the same time, and we continued to be friends.  We did not continue to be boyfriend and girlfriend in that sense beyond the first few months at Howard and that's a long story that I won't even put on, on tape.  But, but a very interesting story in that we remained each other's very, very dear friends and never in my life had I been in a setting where I've been around so many black people.  I had never in my life.  I was absolutely amazed.  I was overwhelmed, and it was, it was just wonderful.  I had never seen so many fine black men or women in any single setting as I did on Howard's campus, nor had he.  I mean, we had both been in somewhat isolated kinds of settings, and there were all kinds of opportunities, social opportunities, networking opportunities and we understood that we didn't need limit ourselves, that we each needed to enjoy the feast that, that we so before us, but we remained very good friends and we remained each other's New Year's dates all the way up to the point of our marriages.  That it was understood that New Year's we'd be each other's dates.  We'd go back to New York [New York] and we would still date and what have you, but we understood that our, that we had, our paths were diverging and we were not boyfriend/girlfriend, but we were still, we were lifetime friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And our, our families remained friends and it's fascinating to me that an organization that his father was in when we were growing up that my husband [HistoryMaker DeLawrence Beard] became a member of and my husband and Austin's father became good friends later in life, so it's, you know, a very small world in a wonderful world.
Story_ID: 192054
Speaker 1: Okay, now you went on to medical school at Howard University Medical School [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] too now.  Often people go to medical school someplace else and they think they have a greater opportunity someplace else.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Why did you end up choosing Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, a number of reasons.  First of all, one of the things that I, I didn't share with you was that when I arrived in Washington [D.C.] to attend Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] it was an opportunity for me to reconnect with my father and my father's family because my father was based here in Washington D.C.  So, I reconnected with my father and my grandmother [Emma Andrews] and my whole father's family immediately.
Speaker 1: Was he still in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: No, no my father at that point worked at the [U.S.] Naval Research Lab[oratory].  He was a government employee.  And my father was married and had three other children, but I was able to immediately reconnect.  So, I felt that I had a family root in Washington D.C. as in New York [New York].  So, as to why I chose Howard's Medical School because I was very comfortable in Washington, and it was just an, an easy and natural transition to go from upper campus to lower campus to the medical school and I had lots of friends.  It's interesting the friends that you make in college really do become lifelong friends, so I, I felt a sense of community in, in the Howard community and a real sense of family in the Washington D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, well how, how was medical school at Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, in one word it was rough, but it was good.  It's interesting because I started talking with, with friends who were attending medical schools elsewhere, and it didn't seem that their course load was a difficult as the course load at Howard or it didn't seem as though they had to memorize as much detail as we were required to memorize at Howard or they didn't have the volume of material and I realized later on what was going on and that is because Howard was not considered to be a premier medical school by whites.  It was understood to be the premier medical school for Negros.  It was considered as premier by whites.  All of our professors in medical school made us learn beyond what anybody else had to know, and it was that old adage that I didn't grow up with because I attended--I did not attend segregated schools whereas my husband [HistoryMaker DeLawrence Beard] attended segregated public elementary school and high school, and he said that that was always the principle that you had to know, not as much as, you had to know more than.
Speaker 1: Or twice as much as the same thing.
Speaker 2: Or twice as much, exactly.  So, in medical school I can remember feeling that we, we were being forced to learn twice the amount of anyone else, of any of my friends who were in medical schools, in white medical schools, who were white students in white medical schools, and we were, you know, always being held to the task and it was a lot of memorization.  It was a lot, but it really did put me in good stead, put all of us in good stead because when we completed medical school and we went into the world of internship and residency we all excelled in every program in which we entered.
Story_ID: 192055
Speaker 1: You were talking about how you had to learn twice as much as other people in medical school at Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and--
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that is certainly the way my classmates and I, or I should say schoolmates and I felt that we were having to memorize virtually the entire textbook.  But, we were told that we would need all of this information and that it wasn't good enough to just know just enough, that we really did need to know and understood more, but I felt that the load was a heavy load.  However, I must say that after graduating and entering my internship and going through my residency, I recognized that I was so well prepared being a Howard graduate.  I was proud to be a Howard graduate, but I knew more than most of the, my peers in, in my internship and residency.  I'd had many first-hand experiences training at Howard University Hospital [Washington, D.C.] as well as doing work at D.C. General [District of Columbia General Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  While in medical school, we were fully prepared for all the things that we did face in training in residency.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there a sense that there was a historical reason for black students having to learn, you know, as they used to say twice as much?  Did you find when you graduated from Howard that people would try to find an area of weakness where you did not know in, in other, I mean--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely and I maintain that even today in the year 2003 when I'm speaking with young students of color be they black, Hispanic, Asian.  If they're not white in this, in America, they will have to prove themselves in terms of were not on equal footing.  We're not being judged in a color blind society, and we still have to prove our, our worthiness for certain positions and it's, and it's based on not only our experiences, but it's knowledge-based.  So, it is, it is still very important.
Story_ID: 192056
Speaker 1: Now you talked about some of the professors, a couple of your professors, which seem to be, I mean, Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] seemed to be a magnet for some outstanding intellects and, and remarkable characters and one was a man by the, by the name of Dr. [William] Montague Cobb (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, Dr. Mon--Dr. Montague Cobb, a world renown, not only historian in terms of medical history, he was an anthropologist as well as a medical doctor, as well as an excellent violinist, as well as a world speaker, and Dr. Cobb was just a walking encyclopedia of everything.  So, when he taught anatomy, he was the professor of the department of anatomy at [Howard University] College of Medicine, when he taught anatomy we did not just have to master anatomy we had to understand violin pieces as well as the composers.  We had to understand the anthropology or the anthropologic reason for certain aspects of evolution in terms of body types changing, and he wanted us to be very well rounded, so we got a history lesson, a music lesson, as well as we had to master the anatomy at the same time.
Speaker 1: Any other professors there that you re, remember that--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, Dr. Ruth Lloyd who was also a professor of anatomy.  She was a Ph.D.  In addition to being an excellent professor, she was also my mentor and became a personal lifelong friend almost from day one in medical school.  I felt that I was almost adopted in a sense by Dr. Lloyd.  She was a Mount Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts] graduate who got her Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio] in anatomy.  And she not only was an excellent teacher, but she took such personal interest in the students and not only shaping us academically, but just in terms of being a nurturer and being very interested in what our future may hold.  Dr. Lloyd and her husband who was also Dr. Lloyd [Dr. Sterling M. Lloyd, Sr.] traveled from Washington [D.C.] to New York [New York] to attend my wedding, and as I said she just became a personal friend through the years, so I, I highly treasure my relationship with Dr. Lloyd and her family.  In fact, her family--doctor--her son became one of the deans of the medical school, Sterling Lloyd [Jr.], and her son-in-law is [HistoryMaker] Hugh Price who was the president of the National Urban League [New York, New York], or the executive director [sic, CEO] of the National Urban League, that was Dr. Lloyd's son-in-law.  So, it's a family of, of achievement, and she was also the sister-in-law of Dr. Montague Cobb.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, so anything else about medical school you wanna share?
Speaker 2: Wonderful, wonderful friends were made, relationships established.  Even now I am thirty-three years past graduation from medical school I can pick up the telephone and call any of my schoolmates or classmates where ever they are in the world, other physicians, and get expert, excellent consult because we've gone into so many disciplines, but we've all established our mark in, in the world in medicine from Howard University College of Medicine and we've developed core friendships and relationships that have continued through time.  So, it was, it was a wonderful experience, it seemed torturous at the time.
Story_ID: 192057
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you were there [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] during a tumultuous period in terms of the nation's politics.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --I think while you were in school--
Speaker 2: Yes exactly.
Speaker 1: --and, and you're young and you got all this pressure from your studies too, I mean, did you ever feel like just giving up at any point or like it wasn't gonna work or?
Speaker 2: No, giving up was never, never an option, never crossed my mind.  I, I understood another saying that I didn't know at that time, but I frequently will share with younger people and that is quitters never win and winners never quit.  There wasn't a reason to give up.  I understood and appreciated that I was there on the shoulders of so many others who had not been able to get to where I was, but it was because of their efforts that I was where I was including my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] who as I mentioned earlier did work all those years, I mean, literally six days and two nights a week so that we could have the extras, the piano lessons, the trips, the outings, the plays.  Those were the extras.  They were beyond just food and shelter.  So, I wasn't going to, I had no reason to give up.  I didn't, I didn't come from stock that gave up.  I never experienced anyone giving up, so I had no reason to give up.  School was my work.  That's how, that's how we looked at it in our family.  My mother went to work and I went to school, my sister and I went to school.  That was our work, that was our job, and we were expected to, to do well, not for her, not for anyone else, but the payoff was going to be for us just in having some kind of fulfillment and it didn't occur to me to give up.
Story_ID: 192058
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you decide to become a pediatrician?  Was it because of the influence of Dr. Clark or what was it?
Speaker 2: Dr. Bomse, the influence of Audrey's [Bomse] father, Dr. Bomse.  He was certainly a very good picture for me of, of what a pediatrician was and how a pediatrician's life could be shaped.  But, I think it was really my exposure in the clinical years of medical school.  I had the opportunity to do an externship at Walter Reed [U.S.] Army Hospital [sic, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], and it was during the pediatric rotation in medical school [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] in my junior year that I really felt that I was a part of a team.  When I was at Walter Reed, the director of the department there, Colonel B. Hughson [ph.] was the first person who didn't just refer to me as the medical student.  Usually on rotations it's like, "Oh the medical student can go and"--with this anonymous medical student.  Colonel B. Hughson turned to me as a third year student and said, "Dr. Beard what do you think about this patient?"  Well, all of a sudden I'm a part of the team and Colonel B. Hughson is asking my opinion.  That made me really want to be an active part of the team.  True, I was a medical student, but he actually asked what I thought of the patient, so it made me want to get to know everything there was to know about the patient's history, about what was going on because on rounds I was going to be asked to give my opinion.  That was the first rotation where I knew I was a part of the team, and it's the little things like that that influence our choices.  So, that made me feel very important and very comfortable with pediatrics.  But, then again I, I really liked surgery because I seem to have had some very good manual mechanical skills in terms of surgical skills, tying, suturing, the things that you think of in surgery.  And I can remember at that time Dr. Lewis Kurtz and the department of surgery at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] making the comment to me that I was a natural for surgery, that I had the hands for surgery, and I felt gee maybe I should go into surgery.  And Dr. John Clark and the Department of OB/GYN [Obstetrics and Gynecology] telling me I was a natural for OB/GYN and I felt like well maybe this is it because the actual aspects of caring for women and delivering babies I had the opportunity to deliver several babies as a medical student and just seeing new life come into the world, being there and facilitating it and handing a baby to a nurse or to the mom it's, it's such a good feeling and I felt well maybe this is what I want to do.  So, I was in conflict about what I truly wanted to pursue.  But, in the end, pediatrics really did win me over.  It was the opportunity to be a part of another individual's life for a long period of time.  I could be there from birth all the way through their childhood into adulthood that I could be a virtual member of that person's family and that's what pediatrics has been and I'm now treating the children of my children.  I'm on my second generation, so it is really a full circle of love and I'm a virtual member of so many families.  I'm a part--I get the invitations to the kindergarten graduations, the college graduations, the weddings.  I get the birth, their birth announcements and I see their children now, so it's, for me it was an excellent choice of specialties, and I truly enjoy it.
Story_ID: 192059
Speaker 1: Now, you, you graduated from Howard [University] Medical School [Washington, D.C.] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970] and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where were you, where did you practice when you first, right after you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, when I graduated from Howard's medical school I did my internship at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and I stayed on in Washington because I got married at the end of my freshman year of medical school.  My husband [HistoryMaker DeLawrence Beard] was in law school at the time, and we graduated literally one week apart and I always had visions of returning to New York [New York] after medical school and doing my training in New York, but my husband really did like Washington [D.C.] and wanted to remain here, so I did my training at Children's National Medical Center.  Then, I went into practice.  I joined a senior pediatrician, someone who had been in practice for seventeen years as a solo practitioner.  I joined her in practice when I concluded my residency and fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all right now who was you, the senior partner?
Speaker 2: At that time I joined [HistoryMaker] Dr. Bette Catoe in practice, and we were partners for twenty-eight years.  We no longer practice medicine together.  We dissolved our partnership.  She has since retired, and I've moved my practice to Children's Pediatricians and Associates in Silver Spring, Maryland, as of March of 2002.
Story_ID: 192060
Speaker 1: How has pediatric medicine changed since you, you learned it and what are the, what are some of the issues now I guess in, in terms of--
Speaker 2: Oh it has--
Speaker 1: --raising children?
Speaker 2: --it has definitely changed over time.  Well, pediatrics happens to be one of the specialties where you have the opportunity to really practice preventive medicine and if you think about it not just during the time of my practice, but if you think about it just in the span of one century and you look at what the leading causes of childhood deaths were a century ago we were looking at diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, gastroenteritis, or diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, or other infectious diseases.  Those were the leading causes of death in children.  Today, we look at lifestyle changes that contribute to morbidity and ultimately to earlier mortality such as obesity.  That's a major factor today, and that's a major risk factor for adult onset of, and childhood presentation of diabetes, heart disease, all of the kinds of things that just through lifestyle can shorten your life.  And then we're looking at unbridled rage in young people manifesting itself in so many random acts of violence that are causing the loss of life.  So, we no longer have to worry about the communicable infectious diseases that kill hundreds of thousands of children because now in pediatrics we have vaccines or immunizations to protect against those, but we're still looking for answers for violence.  What causes it?  What to do about it.  We're still looking for answers as to why are young people today larger and larger and why are we seeing earlier presentation of type 2 diabetes and--
Speaker 1: They are basically fatter right?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right.  They're fatter because they're less active and we're consuming more fats in, in our diet.  Our diets have changed.  So, to answer your question what changes have taken place in pediatrics?  We have, we have different areas of emphasis now.  We understand how to prevent communicable or infectious disease.  We understand the value of hand washing and good hygiene and public health, aspects of hygiene.  We understand that, but we don't understand, we don't understand how changes in our society are--how they've actually contributed to and how they continue to impact on loss of life with so many young people.  We have not gotten the handle on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Asthma, I believe, is also like a big, is getting, you know, worse.  I mean the number of people that have asthma seems to be rising.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely were seeing--
Speaker 1: Especially in the black community and in poor communities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)especially, especially in the urban areas in the cities, and there are a lot of factors.  I mean, there are a lot of theories, but there are a lot of factors.  One factor has to do with definitely more crowded conditions.  People are living literally in, in smaller areas, but also in our sense of being more energy efficient we're living in, in literally closed spaces.  We're working in closed spaces and more energy efficient buildings and settings, so where the, the environmental air is not fresh.  When you are out, we have more environmental pollutants in the air.  There are so many factors.  We don't have the complete answer as to why there are more respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, but we are definitely seeing more asthma and we're seeing it more in urban areas and that's where there are more areas of crowding.
Story_ID: 192061
Speaker 1: Let's talk about three of these areas you just--the respiratory diseases, the obesity, which we hear a lot about now, and, and rage, which is really disturbing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --too and let me--I guess we all know that it's, violence has risen because of this rage and I'm gonna ask you what you think about that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then we'll talk about the book and some other things, but in terms of respiratory disease on the rise, asthma, this seems to be rising and rising and rising other respiratory problems.  In the old days, they used to tell us that if we sat out on a cold step we'd catch a cold in our behind and all that sort of thing, cold weather causes colds.  Is that, is that, you know, what's the wisdom on that?
Speaker 2: Well we know what cold weather doesn't cause colds, but we, but we do know that cold weather causes, will cause you to have a chill if you're not properly clothed and the whole chilling effect does alter your body's ability to respond to viral infections or certain kinds of infections, that a chill will certainly alter, I should say, your body's immune reaction to some things which will therefore make you more susceptible perhaps to cold, but cold weather itself doesn't cause a cold.  And you mentioned sitting on a cold step--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --will give you a cold in your behind.  No it doesn't.  It will make you have a cold bottom if you sitting on a cold step and you're not properly insulated or protected.  It will certainly make you feel like you have a cold in your behind if that's the case.
Speaker 1: People say those things--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and even I'm amazed in 2003 people talk about that is--
Speaker 2: Well, you know actually as a physician I hear all of those kinds of things, and I appreciate more and more the origin of the thinking because you just sort of work back and you understand the origin of the thinking.  Even I, I still hear people saying when they have a cold and they're coughing up lots of phlegm or they hear the child coughing up lots of phlegm they'll get upset if the child doesn't expectorate, spit it up and out.  They'll say oh that's gonna go back down in your chest and cause pneumonia.  My mother [Woodie Durden McLean] says that to me or to someone and it does not.  And I tell parents no it doesn't go back into your chest it actually goes into your digestive system and it goes through the whole process and comes out the other end, so yes mucus is there and it comes out, but it's not going into your chest and no it won't cause pneumonia, but perhaps whatever is causing you to cough like that may cause pneumonia.  So, you have to try to understand why there is a particular belief and try to get back to the root of it and, and dissect it and explain it.  But, there's a lot of wisdom in what we consider to be folklore and it's not all to be very quickly to, to be, you know shouldn't dismiss it.
Speaker 1: Dismiss.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there is some wisdom.  It may not be factual in the way we understand it today, but there is a reason for the particular belief and you try to figure it out.
Story_ID: 192062
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  In terms of obesity, what, why are so many young people so fat these days?
Speaker 2: Well, for one when I was in elementary school [at P.S. 67, Brooklyn, New York, New York] physical education was a part of the curriculum on a daily basis as was outdoor recess and good weather, but there was always recess and we were encouraged to be active and there was a lot of outdoor play after school, bike riding, skating, and in fact it wasn't just the kids who were active there were families who were active.  I can recall my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] bike taking me bike riding when I really could ride a two-wheel bike.  My mother also had a bike and we rode from where we lived in Brooklyn [New York, New York], the Fort Greene area of Brooklyn.  We rode across Brooklyn to Coney Island [Brooklyn, New York, New York] and that, I mean that was, seem to me then to be an all-day thing.  Now, I'm talking about when I was like ten years old, eleven years old.  Here my mother was riding one bike and I'm riding a bike and we're riding literally on sidewalks getting off the bike to cross the street to go and we're riding across Brooklyn on a bike.  You rarely find families doing that, city fam--inner city families.  We were a city family and we did that.  My mother engaged in all kinds of physical activity with me.  My mother rode horses.  She would go horseback riding.  I did that.  I would go roller skating.  My mother really didn't roller skate with me, but she watched me roller skate.  But, there were all kinds of opportunities to be physically active.  Today, there is very little mandatory physical education.  School systems have pretty much eliminated phys ed [physical education] from the curriculum as a cost saving.  This is across the nation as one of the cost-saving measures.  With outdoor recess, of course, it depends on the climate, but they're less likely to do outdoor recess the way it was done when I was growing up because they're greater concerns about liability and safety issues of the children and in terms of going out and just having lots of opportunities to run and play after school that has gone away in many, many communities because there are more parents who are working and there's a fear factor of children safety when parents are at work.  So, you have more children who are indoors for longer periods of time and they have screen time.  They're either in front of a television set or a computer screen, and they're sitting, so they're inactive.  And what are families today eating?  More families are eating fast foods.  So, we, we are truly a convenience food, fast food society.  Even in my practice with young families when I'm asking about who cooks?  There is silence and then when I find out what young families today regard as cooking they feel that if you open a Swanson's dinner, frozen dinner, and you pop it in the microwave that is cooking.  Rarely are young people literally cooking in the sense that my generation or I understood cooking, and they think nothing of.  You see two-year-old kids walking around with a little pack of French fries, and they think nothing of giving kids high fat laden snacks and meal treats and then they come in to see me at age three to say, "He won't eat anything but French fries," and I have to therefore help them go back to trace that.  "How is that he won't eat anything but French fries?  Where did he get French fries?  How were they introduced to him?"  So, we've developed as a society a different taste and we want high fat, convenience foods.  So they're laden in fat grams and in calories, and we're not willing to put forth the effort to be as active today as perhaps two generations ago and we're seeing the result of it.  Not only are kids fatter today, but as a society in the United States we've become more and more obese.

Speaker 1: The last thing you mentioned was rage, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that's I guess they have to be like psychological, sociological, and maybe physiological origins of this rage.
Speaker 2: We're seeing rage across social and economic lines.  It's no longer just the rage of the inner city.  It's not the rage of black Americans.  It's not the rage--we're seeing it across the line.  You look at the Columbine [High School massacre, Colorado] students.  They were affluent white students in an upper middle class community, and what they exhibited was rage.  You look at what's going on across the nation, but then at the same time you turn on your television set and just look at your evening news and you're constantly seeing images of bombings, of fighting, of--if you're in the western part of the United States you're constantly seeing a helicopter overhead pursuing an automobile that's on a freeway that's something, I mean, we're constantly seeing what I consider to be almost gratuitous acts of violence.  They are just so much a part of our imagery, our every day imagery that I think we're in the midst now of a cycle of being almost immune where we're, we just, it's like someone, some explosion or some random violent act just doesn't impact us the way it did perhaps when I was a child.  I look at the video games, and they are astounding, you know, just how you, how you zap, kill.  All children's games from earliest ages are about killing and destruction, and that's considered sport and fun.  So, there's not the same value placed on life as I knew it growing up and its frightening because I think that we experiencing maybe an entire generation that, that's just less sensitive to the value of life and rage always, anger always existed.  Having a disagreement, disagreements always existed, but the extremes that are used now to resolve conflicts are unbelievable.  They're just unbelievable.  And you know we say things like, "Oh well that crazy."  We use the term crazy so very loosely, but if we look all around us we're seeing these "crazy" acts going on every day.  Here in the Washington [D.C.] area at this time we're going through now the second trial of the sniper [of the Beltway sniper attacks].  Just a year ago we were held hostage in this metropolitan area by two men who were creating havoc with random acts of violence, perhaps with a plan in mind.  But, they didn't seem to have very much empathy or feeling about killing to accomplish what seem to be a bizarre scheme.
Speaker 1: Right, they're saying now it was about money or something.
Speaker 2: Well, they're saying, well what the allegation is that he was hoping to create enough havoc that, that ultimately his plan was kill his former wife and she would therefore be just another sniper victim and he would be the sole remaining parent and he could regain custody of his kids, that all of this was about his regaining custody of his kids.  The court had awarded her sole custody, and he began this whole vendetta to try to create all of these random killings around the metropolitan area and then ultimately Mildred, his former wife, would be one of the victims and therefore he would be able to step in and be the dad.  The court would say, "Oh yes well you're the father so now you get those kids; their mother is dead."
Speaker 1: It seems like it's tougher to be a parent these days in a lot of different aspects, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, absolutely it has to be.  It really is and, and parents today have less extended support systems.
Story_ID: 192064
Speaker 1: We were talking about why it's more difficult to be a parent these days.  Now we're taking you out of medicine almost into sociology, but as a, as a pediatrician I know, I know you encounter some of the, you're into prevention and I guess, you know, to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --understand the causes of why can help maybe make for healthier people, I guess, or healthier kids.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that parenting truly is, has always been difficult, has always been a difficult task, and there's no one manual that teaches a parent how to be a great parent, but one factor that remains universally important is time.  And it's important to invest time in your youngsters, and there are many, many parents today who have put off parenting so that they could fulfill their professional goals and they then saw parenting as something they fit into a niche in their schedule.  And their time is limited as they see it to accomplish all that they want to accomplish for themselves and for their children, and they have forgotten the true meaning of giving your children time.  When you use the term quality time so frequently and so loosely, but it's actual real calendar clock time that kids need.  They need it because they have to be nurtured.  There are about four million babies born every year in the United States.  So, that's four million opportunities, four million new lives.  That means that for the most part I can just say on average that about seven to eight million individuals are responsible for these four million babies coming into existence.  But, they're not going to be treated equally, has nothing to do with color or socio-economic status, it has more to do with the understanding of the people who bring these lives forward, understanding the importance of putting in the time.  It's just like a plant.  You have to take care of it, you have to water it, you have to prune it for it to flourish.  It's so similar, it's a wide stretch for an analogy, but with children it's not enough to just have them we have to nurture them.  We have to give them time.  They seek approval, and if they don't get nurturing and approval from parents they'll get it elsewhere and sometimes when they're getting it elsewhere those are not positive influences.  They don't recognize at the time that there are positive and negative influences.  They don't put a value on the sphere of influence.  They just know they want to attach to someone, and if we're not giving our youngsters the time there is always some other person or someone's willing to put forth a little bit of effort and divert them.  So, as to how we've evolved into where we are today, with so much conflict and rage and violence, I don't really know all of the answers, but I do know that I see children who are so hungry for adult attention and adult time.  Even in the schools today, teachers are more hesitant about giving children hugs because we have lots of concerns about appropriate and inappropriate touching.  I have friends who've been teachers for thirty plus years, and they talk about on grades K [kindergarten] through three how many times they would get into the classroom, the kids would come up and hug Ms. Smith or Ms. Jones, and now they have to be really, really careful.  They can't let the kids hug too much.  They're very careful about where they touch them.  They touch them on their head or their shoulder.  That it's very different, so that means kids today on those early elementary school levels are not getting lap time at home.  They're not getting actual tactile encouragement as much in the schools, and we've become sort of a hands off kind of society and I think it makes a difference.  I enjoy in my practice setting you come into my office and you will see lots of hugs.  I hug my patients.  I hug the parents because I happen to be of a generation where hugs were important, and they're still important.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems as though fear is really dominating the, the landscape.  Everybody's afraid of something, you know, they can't--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --positive things aren't done because of fear, you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  We're not only afraid in a physical sense in terms of physical safety, but we're afraid of, of someone else's perception--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and what can happen.  It's, you're right, fear.  Fear is a major factor in, in mandating or dictating sometimes what our actions are even toward others.  We're less inclined to be involved even if we see something going on that we think is not appropriate.  We're less inclined to be involved because we sort of fear retaliation.  We fear getting involved because of our own risk, be it legal or personal injury or whatever.  We just, we sort of isolate ourselves, and I think it's reflective in what's happening with our children.
Story_ID: 192065
Speaker 1: Now on the positive side, now there are things that we know today that we didn't know a long time ago even how to analyze what's going on now, in a sense, but on the positive side we're starting to go back--well we're doing two things I guess going back and into the future to look at prevention and to go back to some natural things we did a long time ago and--
Speaker 2: Exactly we are--in fact I recently authored a book that was released March of 2003 entitled 'Salt in Your Sock: and Other Tried-and-True Home Remedies,' and it's really a compilation or a collection of what I call family treasured recipes for wellness.  And these are home remedies that were shared with me over time by families in my practice, grandparents, aunts, parents.  These were for the most part anecdotal references for measures that we use to treat common ailments.  Many of them were not recorded.  It was passed on through oral history.  None of them were remedies or therapies that I learned in medical school, and many of them I dismissed from, immediately upon hearing them.  I was like, "What that is absolutely ridiculous or unsanitary or how did that work?"
Speaker 1: Salt in your sock is one.  It comes up, you hear it and just say, "How can, what can that be used for?"
Speaker 2: Ahh, you have to get the book, but I can, I can share with you that's one that was shared with me by an Italian grandmother who told me that she didn't take any of her children to the doctor for earache.  An earache happens to be one of the number one reasons that people call their pediatrician for painful ears, ear infection--
Speaker 1: Ear infections are really--
Speaker 2: Exactly, but painful ears, like, "I think he has an ear infection because he's holding his ear and crying or screaming."  And she told me that what she did was to heat salt in a frying pan.  Now mind you she was doing this in Italy.  She was using coarse sea salt, put it in a frying pan and I said, "Frying salt?" And she said, "Of course not."  First of all every home had a skillet, so a frying pan was not only used to fry it was a common essential kitchen tool.  Put the salt in, get it completely, all the granules completely hot and then she said you put it into a thick sock, knot the sock, put that sock to the ear that was aching and put the child to bed lying on the side of the heated salt in the sock.  And I said, "And what happened?" And she'd say, "Oh, the the next day the earache was gone," and I said, "That simple?"  Well, I talked with an ear, nose, and throat specialist, a laryngologist, just to say you know what and he said, "[HistoryMaker Dr.] Lillian [M. Beard] of course it works," and he reminded me that heat--you probably hear, heard a lot about using sweet oil or heated oil to be dropped into an ear that was aching, the heat speeds the circulation in the area, so it drives away the pathogens or some of the bacterial viruses that are causing the infection.  But, the salt actually would draw fluid.  Think about it, have a cup of salt near a cup of water and after about an hour or so what happens? The salt gets clumpy because it actually absorbs the moisture from any of the fluid that's right there.  So, the salt would draw the fluid from the middle ear cavity, and we know that what causes an achy ear is increased pressure in the middle ear cavity usually because there's fluid there.  So, if you reduce the pressure by drawing off the fluid you diminish the pain.  Now, it doesn't treat ear infection, so it doesn't treat what's causing the ear to hurt, but it relieves the pain, and I have shared that remedy with many a parent about two a.m. in the morning when I get a call about an achy ear.  I've said do you have some salt.  Now most people don't have the coarse sea salt they have table salt and today we don't have to put it in a frying pan you can put it in a cup and put it in a microwave, heat it, put it into a thick sock, same principle, draws the fluid until I can see the child the next day or the ear can be evaluated to see if there is infection and then treat it properly.
Story_ID: 192066
Speaker 1: But what these remedies are, these what I call family treasured recipes for wellness, they are what I consider to be tributes to the creativity and the resourcefulness of generations past because we didn't always have medicine as we know it today.  In fact, the medicine we've gone the full circle.  We've gone from leeches to lasers and now the pendulum is swinging back to leeches.  Leeches are being used now in research.  In fact, there was a report just last week in the Annals of Internal Medicine about leeches being used to treat osteoarthritis to relieve the pain of osteoarthritis.  So, here can you imagine in 21st century medicine that leeches are being used to relieve the mali--the particularly maladies and of course what they're really looking at is what is that is injected when the leech attaches.  The leech injects something into the body.  What is it in that protein and the saliva that's giving relief?  That's what's actually being studied, but again it's the creativity and the resourcefulness of generations past.  You think about how did people get through life?  How did--as I explained to you earlier about my mother's [Woodie Durden McLean] oldest brothers, the twins, surviving a premature birth, delivery in the year 1903 and living into the 21st century, again the creativity and resourcefulness of the midwife to keep their body temperature at a particular level by putting them into individual glass jars and putting those jars, wrapping them and putting them near the heat of a fireplace.  That was being resourceful for that time, but it permitted and promoted their development.  So, my book, 'Salt in your Sock: and Other Tried-and-True Home Remedies,' is such a collection of, of remedies and I say they're tried and true because the ones in the book have been tried and they do not cause harm and I have ample warnings throughout the book it's not intended to replace your doctor's advice.  It's really meant to complement your own human wit with the advice that your doctor may give you, and it, it employs items that you have around your home, primarily items that are in your kitchen such as salt.

Speaker 1: Now there's been a return to natural birth at least more natural than it was during the, I guess, the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, a return to natural birth in the sense of just using fewer pain relievers and using less sedation and or anesthesia and I say that's, that's really admirable when it can be done, but child birth does not have to be an extremely unpleasant experience.  I think that when we say more natural birth, I, I feel that maybe at one point in time sedation was, was greater than it needed to be or analgesia or pain relief was being administered with a heavy hand, but I don't--
Speaker 1: At one time the women would go into the labor--
Speaker 2: --and would be put to sleep.
Speaker 1: And wake up and have a baby--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and that would be, that's all she remembered.
Speaker 2: Exactly and I think that the options other than that are so varied and, and are certainly preferable, but there are times when that extreme of sedation is maybe needed depending upon the situation.  But, I don't, I don't think that women have to give birth in the fields today as they did at one time, that it does not have to be a screaming painful kind of an experience.  It should be a memorable pleasant experience, and fortunately in today's medicine it can be working with the obstetrician or the, or the midwife it certainly can be and more and more families are opting to have that as a family experience, where it is memorable and not where you just wake up and suddenly there is a baby.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there, is there anything else about pediatrics you think we need to know, I mean, that you'd like to tell us in this interview?
Speaker 2: I think, well I think that being a pediatrician is, is unique, field of pediatrics is unique because you have the opportunity again to be a part of a person's life from birth all the way through into early adulthood.  So, my patients range from being delivered when I first see them as a newborn in the hospital, and I continue with them until their twenty-second birthday.  So, there is no other specialty in medicine where you have the opportunity to be a part of a person's creation, growth, and development and to actually experience and to participate in their molding into adulthood, and I, I just feel that pediatrics, the field of pediatrics is so special for that reason.
Story_ID: 192068
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh I have so many, so many.  I, I want us as a group to appreciate our individuality.  I want us to stop being critical of one another for having divergent views and choices because we are truly not a monolithic people.  We're all a compilation of just generations before us and varied life experiences and I want us to resist the urge to allow anyone to identify us as well what is the African American opinion on this or what do blacks think about that because we don't have one thought and we don't have one opinion, and we have to stop putting one another down for having different, different opinions on everything be it political party, be it choice of mate to marry.  I have, just to digress for a second, I have so many friends who are so worried about whether or not their kids or their grandchildren are going to marry outside of the black race, and I subscribe to the fact that you should be worried about the fact of whether or not they find someone who appreciates them for their individual worth and who will respect them and who will share like values, and forming a life together has nothing to do with color.  I think that it's up to the individuals to maintain information about heritage, but I don't think it's fair for parents to put the responsibility on their children about how they select mates; just my personal opinion in terms of what my hopes are for us as a race.  I don't want us to disappear, so I'm not encouraging that we, that we disappear as a race, but I certainly hope that we can figure out how to have more mutual respect for diversity within the black community at large.

Speaker 1: When you look back on the things that you have done though so far and you're still fairly young--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --and look younger, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's to be determined by others.  I really don't know.  I think I've been extremely fortunate in that I've been able to realize most of my dreams, and I continue to rebuild the dream and reinvent the dream and I continue to want to realize things.  I always wanted to be a physician, and I am a physician.  I always after becoming a physician I wanted to be a good physician, and I'm honored that I'm recognized by my peers as being a good physician and by my patients and patient families as being a good physician.  The Washingtonian magazine identifies every couple of years what they consider to be the top docs [doctors] in the area [Washington, D.C.], and I'm privileged have been on that list many times including the most recent listing.  I always wanted to have the respect of the people within my community, and I feel that through my actions and deeds I've earned the respect of my community and I, and I enjoy that and don't want to do anything to alter that.  I've always wanted to have the love and to give the love to my family, and I have that.  I'm so fortunate in that I have a mother [Woodie Durden McLean] and father [Johnie Wilson] who are very much a part of my life and a husband [HistoryMaker DeLawrence Beard] who is very nurturing and very supporting, and, and I have siblings whom I love and, and I feel their love.  So, I, I have family and I'm appreciative of that, and I'm able to give.  I've always wanted to be able to give to others, and I do that every day.  I feel that my day is not complete unless I feel that I've been able to give to someone else, and every single day I have the opportunity to do that.  So, I feel fortunate that I can give and give back because I am where I am today because of so much that was given to me in many instances by total strangers, just kindness, just encouragement, just the opportunity, someone just opening a door to give me an opportunity to take that next step.  I'm so appreciative that I'm constantly trying to open doors for young people and for colleagues, and I'm a facilitator of people networking because I feel that there's, there's so many opportunities and sometimes all someone needs is a little encouragement to, to make that next jump, so I'm, I'm just proud and happy that I can be a part of that.
Story_ID: 192070
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do different?
Speaker 2: Possibly.  If given the chance to redo some things, possibly, but I don't know.  I could not identify that one whatever it might be.  I'm sure if I had the knowledge that I have now and the opportunity to redo some things that I might do some things a little bit differently, but I just don't know.
Story_ID: 192071
Speaker 1: One last question and it's similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a good friend, as a caring individual, as I guess as caring individual and where someone could--I'd like to be remembered as a good person, probably as most of us would like to be remembered.

Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker Dr.] Lillian McLean Beard.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: Ahh, now you know it's interesting I look at this and it takes my mother [Woodie Durden McLean] to tell the story that from these photos this is another one at three months Carnation, which was the Carnation Evaporated Milk wanted to engage me as a Carnation baby.  However, my mother was really excited because it was from something called Baby Picks.  They picked my picture out for me to be a Carnation based on that photo.  However, she was all set to sign until she found out they were paying white babies about five times what they were offering her, and they were asking her to sign away her right for me to be a part of any other commercial or whatever I think until adulthood, and she, she wouldn't do it.  She refused it.  So, here it is all of these years later that I'm a national consultant to Nestle who brought the Carnation and it's interesting 'cause my mother likes to tell the story that you see that they wanted me when I was a baby and she didn't let them have me and now they have a chunk of me as, as a professional adult.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, here I am at my first birthday and I say supporting myself for the first time alone because my mom said that that was the first time that I was able, that I stood in a chair.  I'm standing on a chair, I'm standing on the chair--

Speaker 2: Was he a Garveyite, I mean were their families Garvyites?
Speaker 1: No, Garvey Wilson.  Garvey was his name.
Speaker 2: Yeah I know, but why would they name him Garvey, that's what I (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh, you know I don't know.
Speaker 2: Garvey was had--
Speaker 1: Marcus Garvey I know.
Speaker 2: --the largest black organization.

Speaker 2: It was during the '40s [1940s].  No, I don't know what year.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is my mother Woodie McLean.  She was to me really a glamorous woman.  This was also taken in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me with my mom and I'm just smiling there as is she.  I was always happy to be in her presence.  She always made me feel extra special.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, did you want to shoot your friend who you mentioned?
Speaker 2: Oh, Audrey.  And there's my best friend from high school, Audrey Bomse.  She is the first person who befriended me at Midwood High School on about the third day of school, and we've remained friends through the years and she is an attorney now living at the time, at this time in Israel as a part of the UN [United Nations] mission defending the rights of the Palestinians in the West Bank.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And that would be a current photo, 2003?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes that would, that photo was taken June 2003.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph at my grandmother's 100th birthday party celebration.  It's my grandmother [Emma Andrews] seated in the middle, and she's flanked on the right by my dad, Johnie Wilson, and his brother, my uncle Garvey Wilson, and my aunt who is standing above her, Sophie Williams [ph.].  My aunt and my dad are still living.  My uncle Garvey and my grandmother are now deceased.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, would you give us--I know you said it was her 100th, what, could you give us a year?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was in 1997 [sic, 1987].  My grandmother was born in 1887 in South Carolina.
Speaker 2: This is a photo that was taken in July of year 2002.  My dad is seated and with me and my two sisters.  My father's other two daughters.

Speaker 1: This was in 1983 and in Israel.  I was in Israel and that is [Prime Minister] Menachem Begin and who was the prime minister of the State of Israel at that time and I was honored to have been in his company and one of the last groups actually to be in his company prior to his passing.
Speaker 2: Here I am at that time First Lady Hillary [Rodham] Clinton, now Senator Hillary Clinton at Children's Hospital and Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.  I was a member of the board of the hospital, and Mrs. Clinton paid us a visit during the holiday period. In fact, it represents one of several opportunities that I've had to be in the company of Mrs. Clinton.  We've shared space on committees in reference to children's health issues also.
Speaker 1: I'm here with Margaret Thatcher who was the former Prime Minister to Great Britain, and I was chair of the National Women's Economic Alliance Foundation headquartered in Washington, D.C., and Mrs. Thatcher was our keynote speaker for a program, and I had the pleasure of introducing her.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I'm here with former president, [President James Earl] Jimmy Carter, and this was done at WUSA [television station], the CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] affiliate here in Washington, D.C., where I was the health contributor on, to the station on the program entitled, 'Broadcast House Live,' and Mr. Carter was promoting a book at that time and was a guess on the program.
