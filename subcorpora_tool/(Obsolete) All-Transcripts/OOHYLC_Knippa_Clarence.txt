 Finchum  .  Today is July 30, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and we   re doing a  project called Oklahoma 100 Year Life. Today we   re here in Tulsa to  speak with Reverend Clarence Knippa, who will turn 100 next month, I  believe. We   ll let him tell us about that. Let   s begin with having you tell  us when and where you were born.  I was born in Texas in the country near the post office at Swiss Alp.  Born at home?  Yes.  And what did your parents do for a living?  At that time, they were farming. They moved to Austin when I was  about two years old.  What did they do there?  They entered into the meat business. He had a meat market     He got out of farming, then.  Yeah.  And did your mother work outside the home?  No. She had seven children. She was very busy.  She worked, but at home. (Laughs) Where did you fall in those seven?  5  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  I   m the third.  Third, okay. Almost in the middle. Where did you go to elementary  school?  In Austin, to a Lutheran parochial school.  And you were born August 19, 1913, and you would have graduated  from high school then in   let me do my math     In    30.  In 1930. And what was the name of the high school?   Concordia Academy .  Did you have a favorite subject?  I had a history teacher who was really good. I enjoyed her classes more  than any of them.  Did they have 4-H or FFA or anything like that?  No, no.  In high school, did you have an idea of what you might do for your  career?  No.  So after high school, what happened?  I did go off to school in Winfield, Kansas for two years, a junior college.  It was a pre-ministerial course, a school to train people to go into the  seminary. I had to take Hebrew and Greek.  Do you remember any of it?  Not too much. I didn   t really keep it up. I still know words, you know,  especially biblical terms. It has a Greek basis. I enjoyed school.  Is that where you met your wife?  No, I met her at the convention of Lutheran young people. I knew her  briefly from previous conventions, but I went to this one after I finished  6  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  my internship. They had a camp afterward, and we decided by the end of  the camp that we were going to get married. (Laughs)  Pretty quick courtship.  Yeah, she came by the house to meet my parents on her way back home.  Where was she from?  Fort Worth.  So a Texas girl, too, huh?  Yeah.  Did you spend most of your career living in Texas?  No, not most of my career. I was there ten years. I came here in    46.  Came to Oklahoma? To Tulsa?  Yes.  What brought you here?  To be a pastor at Grace Lutheran Church. I was a pastor for thirty-two  years. I have been married for more than that. (Laughter) Longer than  that.  Pastor at the same church for that length of time?  Yes.  That   s not too common these days, is it?  No, but Reverend  Mouzon  Biggs and Rabbi  Charles  Sherman just  recently retired and they were in their churches for more than thirty-three  years.  Well, 1946. That was right around the end of the war. Were you in the  service?  No. Sometime before the war, one of the pastors was in the Reserves. He  wanted me to go in as the Reserves chaplain. I thought about it but my  wife, we got pregnant and that ended that.  7  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  So how many children do you have?  We had five. Four are living.  Five. So your wife was busy, too, then?  Yes. She was the best thing that ever happened to me.  How long were you married?  We were married sixty-nine years.  Sixty-nine, wow. What was the secret to that?  Well, I guess we both were able to get along with each other. (Laughter)  You don   t hear about that too much these days, either.  She was real good. Her mother warned me and said,    I   m going to tell  you, she has a temper.    (Laughter) She always had quick changes in  moods. She could get angry, but she would be over it in a little bit.  So if you decided to get married after a week, did you actually go ahead  and get married soon?  No, I was going to marry after I finished my last year at the seminary. I  didn   t have anything permanent. It was during the Depression. I did get  appointed on the staff in a church in Houston, but I wasn   t making  enough money to get married so we waited another year. Then we  decided I would never be making enough money so we got married,  anyway. (Laughs)  What year was that?  That was in    37.  Thirty-seven. So that was at the end of the Depression.  We were married for sixty-nine years.  What was your favorite thing she cooked for you?  She made a dish called hot chicken salad. Boy  That was real good,  unusually good.  Did she work outside of the home?  8  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  No.  She didn   t have time, either, with five kids.  No, and her parents were not exactly poor. They weren   t excessively  rich, but they had more than they needed. The fact is I don   t think I  could   ve done as much as I did if they hadn   t helped us. I didn   t have to  worry about trying to raise something to make some money or anything  like that. Those were years when we didn   t get much money.  The thirties, forties, and fifties, I guess, were pretty tough.  Yeah.  Once you came to Oklahoma, did you have an opportunity to go  elsewhere?  Oh, yes. When I was about forty-five or so, I got a lot of calls around  that time. They wanted someone fairly young, but had a lot of  experience. (Laughs) I had a call to a church in St. Louis that had 1,800  members, which was considerably more than I had here. I turned it down  because I just liked Tulsa. I was doing well in the church here and I had  the freedom to get involved in the community activities. It was just a  good place to be.  Good place to raise the family.  Yeah.  I understand you had a role in the formation of Tulsa   s homeless  shelter?  Yes.  Talk a little bit about that.  The Community Service Council had a study on homelessness in Tulsa  and came up with the conclusion that the chief need was a place for the  homeless people to go in the day time. Salvation Army said they weren   t  able to do that. So they came to the Tulsa Metropolitan Ministry and I  was on the board of that. In fact I was on the board of both  organizations. They appointed a committee to look into it and I was on  that committee and I made the motion that we get it started. We started  on real humble circumstances, a warehouse and remodeled it a little. We  had a couple months of getting things ready, writing up the operations  9  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  and everything. Then we thought,    Where are we going to get the  money?    To get that resolution passed, to get it started, I knew we would  have to put in it    provided we could raise the money to do it.     You know, like in so many things, the Jewish community really  contributed. One of the men on this committee was Maynard Ungerman,  an attorney, a Jewish attorney. He said,    I   m going to be talking to  Henry Zarrow at the basketball game tonight.    He agreed to support us.  We went about two years and he just footed the bill. He is really a nice  person. Then he said,    I think maybe it   s time the board take  responsibility for that,    but he stayed on as honorary chairman of the  finance committee. I had a number of interviews with him in his office.  He had a real heart for homeless people. That was a good experience,  from this little start in that warehouse.  Somehow, one of the women that once in a while volunteered there was  a doctor   s wife, and she decided they needed to have a clinic that  provided things. We had a little room off of the warehouse and made it a  clinic. Gave that room to them. They didn   t have running water, even.  They had to carry water in buckets to the room and started the clinic,  treating minor things.  Later, not too many years   I forgot exactly which year, we decided we  needed and wanted a new building. We started with Henry Zarrow and  he got the big gifts, you know. We built a  1,750,000 dollar building  that was planned. We had it planned. Our director went to a couple cities  to learn more about places. We, I think, came up with a real workable  building.  Is it still there?  Oh, yeah. We located it   the Zarrows owned property right next to the  Salvation Army. That was ideal for us because it was to be a day center,  and Salvation Army fed people. They could eat there and we didn   t have  to build a kitchen. We didn   t have a kitchen, except a small kitchen.  That worked out real well. I was active on the board from then on until I  became inactive and they made me on honorary member. That was quite  some experience.  You were also in Tulsa in the sixties when the Civil Rights Movement  was going on. Did you have any comments about that?  Oh, yeah. I was in that. John Wolf was a pastor in the Unitarian Church  and was the person who would pretend like   I told him, I said,    He was  the artillery. He softened up the situation. Then the other came more  moderate.    It seemed to be I could go in and get it done. I fortunately  10  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  had good connections with some people in the north side of Tulsa. One  incident that is interesting to me, we were trying to open up restaurants  for all people   blacks as well as whites. We called up the commissioner  of the police department and told them what we were going to do. After  a while he said,    Well young minister, I think you can keep this secret. I  talked to the owner of this restaurant and told him that I was not able to  protect his building from having someone throw a rock through the  window, but I could arrest them after they do it.    I thought that was kind  of interesting. He was on the vestry at Trinity Episcopal Church. He was  really tolerant   we could picket as much as we wanted, as long as we  kept the law. He has to enforce the law, but he would make sure we were  protected while we picketed.  So you actually picketed?  I didn   t picket. I stayed in the background as much as I could. I worked  with the planning and everything but the picketing like that, I didn   t do  that. I felt that it might interfere with my ministry status if I did that so I  didn   t but I worked with it. The fact is that was one of the rewarding  experiences because we had a pretty good transition in Tulsa, for a city  that burned down the  Greenwood District .  In the 1920s.  Still not completed yet. They still don   t have the same opportunity that  whites have.  Do you recall when JF Kennedy was assassinated?  Oh, yeah. There was an article in the newspaper with what I was quoted  as saying on some things at that time. Did you find it?  Yeah, just looking through it. What was it like as a pastor? What were  some of the things you did to help your congregation through, or other  people?  In the Civil Rights Movement?  When JFK was shot was there anything unique about being a pastor,  leading a church during that time?  Oh, yeah, it was a time of grief. I just preached. I don   t know the content  but I did preach a sermon that included that.  I   ve read a lot on the Interfaith Movement in Tulsa. Can you talk a little  about your role in that, and maybe some of the struggles with getting it  11  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  approved, as a Lutheran minister? What was that all about? What was  that whole ecumenical movement about?  I joined the Ministerial Alliance, which was rather unusual for a  Lutheran minister to do. They asked me to be president and then I would  automatically become vice president of the Council of Churches. I said,     I don   t know if I could do that because I disagree with some things.     He said,    Who doesn   t?    (Laughs) That turned on the light for me. It is a  council, not a church. That opened up my eyes to the fact that our church  citizens    view toward participating with other churches like that was not  exactly correct. So I did that. Later on, I told the president of the  Missouri Synod, and of course, he was the one I worked for first when I  got my own church. I knew him well. He said,    You won   t do anything  wrong, just go ahead.    (Laughter)  What kind of other churches did you work with in Tulsa?  Oh, the Council of Churches became the Tulsa Metropolitan Ministry.  First the council just consisted of Christian churches. Then the Tulsa  Metropolitan Ministry included Jews and other faiths. I never got any  static from the hierarchy. Odd, I was reported by somebody who came  one Sunday and heard some possible things. My friend wasn   t president  anymore but  the Synod president  called the district president here and  told him to handle it, you know. He called me up and told me when he  got a letter. He said,    Now I   ve done my duty.    (Laughter) He said,     Forget about it   .  We had controversy in our synod. The ultraconservatives were getting  into control, and some of them asked why I didn   t leave the synod, you  know. The center of the controversy was around the seminary in St.  Louis. They were firing professors for not adhering to what they said  and believed, you see, for participating in some practices like interfaith.  So they walked out, the faculty. They would pick them off one at a time  and said the faculty decided they   d all leave, except one. When they  walked out, they had no salary. So a number of us across the country  helped raise some money to pay their salaries until they could get  situated. Of course, then I couldn   t keep all that controversy out of the  congregation. There were a lot of members who were deeply loyal to the  synod. They would try to take the congregation out of the synod. They  were very hurt. I said,    As long as they don   t bother me, I won   t want to  hurt them.    So we stayed in. Grace is still in there, but it is more open  than most Lutheran churches to interfaith activities. That award over  there is     The National Conference of Christians and Jews, did you receive that  for the interfaith?  12  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Yes. I think I helped, I don   t want to be boasting, but I think I helped to  create the kind of atmosphere we have between the churches here in  Tulsa. At least some who lived through that period think so. But we do  have a good atmosphere between the churches and the Jewish  community. I tell you, without the Jewish community Tulsa wouldn   t be  what it is. They are the vanguard of progressive things. Rabbi Sherman  was a real good friend of mine. Before he came, I was a good friend of  Rabbi Rosenthal, too.  I understand that you   re retired. When you retired, did you continue to  serve the church and community?  Oh, yeah. For a number of years, until I had this stroke, I was active.  When I retired, we planned to stay a year and also be a member of the  church, there. I tried to get some idea of what other denominations do  with their clergy. I got information from a number of them, but like  some of them, you can   t stay in the same church. You have to get out  completely. The best rules I could find was the ones in the Jewish  community for their rabbis. I wrote that up and that worked out real  well. My successor was there for twenty-five years. He and I got along  real well. They wanted to add on to the facilities. They had a committee  to raise the money. When I read what they were planning to do was ask  people   I told Jim he   ll never raise the money that way. He said,    Well,  would you take over?    I said,    I want to think about that.    Well, we had  a fund raiser in our church when I was pastor. When I found out what he  did I said,    My goodness, we paid a lot of money for a guy to do that.  We could do that ourselves.    I learned how to raise money. In fact, I  really never had any problem with getting money that we needed. We  raised a lot more than we expected at that time.  What was religion like when you were growing up? How central was  religion in your family?  Very much so. My parents were involved. We went to Sunday school,  parochial school, and even the  Concordia  Academy High School     going all the way through Lutheran School, the whole system.  You went to Lutheran schools?  Yes. Of course, I took courses at the University of Texas in the  summertime. I was supposed to have an internship between the second  and third years of seminary. A year of that but people didn   t have any  money. It was Depression period, yet. I got connected with my  convention of young people I worked with. I went to the University of  Texas during that year. I also worked with the younger people in my  13  church. That   s how I got  Oliver Raymond  Harms    attention. He was  there. That fall, after seminary, he asked if I would come down and work  with him. That was a good move. Not financially, but it gave me a good  experience.  After the first year there, they asked me to start a church in a unique  neighborhood. There was a real estate developer who was developing an  area that had been drained from swamp. They designed it for the  industrial worker who would have a job and if the factory didn   t have an  order, they would lay them off until they could get work again, and then  they   d call them back to work. They developed this property, only fifty  lots, fifty feet wide and 250 feet deep. That gave them plenty of ground  for a garden and they could raise their own food. That was an interesting  thing. They said being out there those people may not be able to get a  church for themselves. They sent me out there to start a church, and I  started a church there and did real well. The district decided we   d  support it and we opened up a school, too. We had a community  organization to keep the community clean. We put out flyers asking  people not to put a refrigerator on the front porch, (laughter) or cars in  the yard, just in the driveway only, and try to keep the community up  and going. I had a good experience with that, too.  War came on, and when we went to work, children were kind of left on  their own. We figured we ought to have something for them. My wife   s  folks bought the property next to the church. It was vacant. We thought  we   d make a playground. Of course, we got that and we needed to light  it up at night so we could have night activities, too. So one of the  members worked for the trolley. He was able to get poles and then we  had to get them set and electric put on. A public service company was  the utility for that area. I went to the office there. I said I wanted to  speak to the president of this corporation. I don   t know why I had the  guts to do it, but I did that sort of thing. He said,    Do you have an  appointment?    I said,    No, I didn   t know who to call.    So he called up  and he said,    How much time do you want?    I said,    Oh, about ten  minutes or so.    He said,    Send him up.    I went there and he kept me for  an hour while I explained what we were trying to do.  He agreed to do that, to set that up. He said,    But who is going to do the  wiring and lights?    I said,    That   s the next step.    He pulled out the  yellow section and looked through the electric companies. He said,    You  know, I hate to tell you this, but the companies that are most likely to do  that for you are Jewish.    What triggered this   one of the kids got a BB  gun and shot another kid in the eye. That   s what started us on trying to  get something in the neighborhood for the kids to do.  That was an interesting congregation. Two of the men couldn   t read or  14  Finchum  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  write. They were illiterate. I would never say to the adults,    Sing.    I  would say,    Those of you who want to sing, let   s sing song such and  such.    One of the men worked for the railroad yards just south of the  area where we were. When we had this school, we had gotten surplus  products that the government gave to non-profit organizations. You still  had gasoline rationing and people didn   t have the gasoline to volunteer  to run errands. I went down and this one fellow that couldn   t read or  write went with me. When we got to the railroad yard to get to the  boxcar to finally get the surplus food, the guy started rattling off the  number of the boxcar. It was real long. I said,    Wait a minute, I   ve got to  write this down.    He said,    Go ahead. It   s alright, I got it.    He could  remember the number, a long number like that. That taught me  something. This fellow couldn   t read or write, but he could read the  numbers, you know. It was nine digits long and he knew them just by  hearing them. Remarkable. I gained a lot of respect for people that didn   t  have an education. The other one with little education was one of the  finest and best men in the congregation and only had two years of  school. It was a good experience. They depended on the pastor more  than any usual congregation.  Did you have to have an outside job or was that your main   ?  Oh, no, that was my main   The Synod had the rule that you had to have  a call to a congregation. That would be a permanent call until you  terminated it. They wouldn   t ordain you until you had a call. I had some  people to be married and a group of sixteen adults, one confirmed. I  couldn   t because I didn   t have any ordination. I had no standing, so  district took over and agreed to support it. I was ordained then. I could  do that     Some folks who are clergy have favorite memories of a Sunday service  or a homily. Do you have a favorite one?  Well, I remember one incident. I was subject to get migraine headaches.  We had an evening service because the shift workers couldn   t be there in  the morning. So time for the evening service came and I had what I  called a sick headache, where everything just hurt and they had to  postpone the service for about ten minutes for me to get through. I came  out and my wife told me later that I was white as a sheet. (Laughter) But  as time went on, the sun went down and it got dark. I was preaching, and  that was one of the most emotional services I think I ever had, in that  setting. By the time I was through, I was okay. At Interfaith, we were  talking about that. I was very active in that, as I mentioned.  Were you active in that in retirement, as well?  15  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Yeah.  What do you think is your secret to living a long life? What is your  secret to longevity, in other words?  Picking the right parents. (Laughter)  Picking the right parents. What do you mean by that?  Genes. I think   and of course, my mother cooked well and my wife was  a real good cook. Made sure we had a balanced meal and everything so I  always ate well.  What was a balanced meal for you?  You had to have a protein, a meat, and vegetables. Fruit   I remember  when I was growing up, Dad would buy oranges and apples by the box  and we ate them. We could help ourselves any time we wanted to.  In those days, fruits were a luxury, too.  Yep. But I had a good diet all the way through.  What about exercise?  Yeah.  That diet can be, at least from my experience, a diet is something that  pastors and people who lead churches   it can be a struggle sometimes.  Some days, you may not eat very well and other days you may eat too  much  (Laughs)  Yeah. There was a time when I was starting to get a little heavier. I cut  back on that right away. I quit playing golf after we had children  because if I could take off half a day to play golf, I   d be with them rather  than playing golf. I figured that was more important.  Was there ever a time when you had some doubts in your faith? And how  did you overcome that?  You have doubts. Paul Tillich wrote a little paper book, about that thick.  (Gestures) A short book, the Dynamics of Faith. He had the faith of a  baby and the doubt of a scholar. The very nature of the case   he said,     Have faith. Doubt is the very nature of scholarship,    you see. You  question things. I did that. Of course, I didn   t lose my faith, but I don   t  think I took it without question.  16  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  Bishop  A lot of folks who we interview who are 100 have a motto or philosophy  they live by. Do you have a philosophy or motto that you live by?  I think my faith actually molded me.  How did it mold you?  I think it gave me purpose in life, and direction, too. I was involved in  community things, in addition to the pastor work. I did my work as a  pastor. I made sure that was done, but I also spent a lot of time in  community activities.  Can you describe for us a typical day for you, now?  Now?  Yes.  It   s eating and sleeping and reading. (Laughter) And ballgames.  Baseball or other?  Baseball and football. I   m a Texas Ranger fan.  And football?  Texas  Dallas  Cowboys.  Do you like a particular type of book? What type of books do you enjoy?  I like autobiographies and books like this one here  1913: The World  Before the Great War . I   ve read a few novels, but I don   t read very  many novels.  Did you ever think you would make it to 100?  Oh, no. I didn   t think I   d make it to this century. (Laughter)  Do they have plans for you next month? Birthday is August 19   Oh, yeah. I guess we will have an open house in the lounge up there.  We   ll have it between two and five and we expect about 100 people.  One hundred for 100.  17  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Bishop  Knippa  Finchum  Knippa  One hundred.  One hundred for 100.  Yeah   When you think about it, when history is written about you, what would  you like it to say?  That I was a person of integrity with interests in the welfare of other  people. One occasion was the anniversary, I don   t know which one it  was but I had been in the ministry quite a while, and I said the words of  Saint Paul apply,    I fought the good fight. I   ve kept the faith.    I don   t  know how well I   ve fought   that   s for the judge, but I fought the good  fight, the right fight, and that   s the way I went about my life in general.  I think that   s a good place to stop, so we thank you for sharing your  stories with us today.  Okay.  -------  -------
