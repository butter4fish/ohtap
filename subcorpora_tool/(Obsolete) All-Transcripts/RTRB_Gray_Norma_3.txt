REDMAN: All right. My name is Sam Redman and I’m back. This is our second
tape of two tapes today with Norma Gray, on May 10, 2011, in Berkeley,
California. When we left off, we were talking about how Norma found work on the
University of California campus that eventually turned out to be part of the
Manhattan Project. In the interim, between tapes, we were actually talking a
little bit more and we were reflecting a little bit more on, I would say,
American culture during the war versus sort of today, being in two wars. In sort
of a similar sense, we were in wars on two fronts; today we’re in two
different wars. Sort of the awareness or lack of awareness of certain things
happening and the instantaneous nature of our media today. The Port Chicago
disaster, for instance, it’d be twenty-four news today.

GRAY: Oh, yes. Twenty-four hours for a week, probably.

REDMAN: Yeah, certainly. So how do you think that changes ideas and feelings and
sentiments towards events like the war? In some sense, do you think people were
shielded a little bit from the gore or the violence of war?

GRAY: We probably were; but today, we’re so overwhelmed with gore and violence
that it becomes a problem for us. It’s just something that you begin to
accept, which is maybe good, maybe not good.

REDMAN: Right. So to a certain degree, the violence still doesn’t register to
us, but it’s because we’re over-exposed rather than being maybe under-exposed.

GRAY: Right. Under-exposed. Oh, yes.

REDMAN: Okay. I’d like to ask you another question related to museums, which
is something I’m personally interested in. My understanding is that in about
1943 or 1944, people started to have a little more money in their pocket, they
were maybe working in defense industries, and some people started spending their
money on going to museums. Certainly not everyone, but my attendance increased
during that time. So I’m just curious, in terms of awareness of the world, as
far as the natural world or the globe, you’re reading suddenly about the
Philippines and Japan and you’re reading about Australia or you’re reading
about the countries in Europe. Did the war sort of stimulate, do you think, an
interest in the world as a place, politically and environmentally and geographically?

GRAY: Well, I notice something very similar today. You practically know the
names of all those Arab countries you never knew anything about in your whole
life. I suppose that the same thing happened during the war. Young men had been
to all these places, so when they came back, they had an idea of what these
were. I suppose yes, that you would. But I see it as if you’re bombarded with
this news every day about other countries, of course, you’re going to get to
know where they are, who they are, just like today.

REDMAN: Sure.

GRAY: [As] I say, a few years ago, I bet nobody could’ve named the Arab countries.

REDMAN: Right.

GRAY: Now everybody can name them. That’s just what happens. Of course, you
have more awareness, and maybe those who are adventurous want to go and see what
that’s all about, yes.

REDMAN: And other people just want to learn about Burma, perhaps.

GRAY: Right. Right.

REDMAN: Okay. Interesting. So let’s talk about, then, what your job became on campus.

GRAY: Well, my job was great. I had what was called an A pass, which meant I
could go into any of those buildings any time. I was a messenger girl. What they
did was send me, with blueprints and plans locked in a huge, red, locked tube --

REDMAN: Quite large.

GRAY: Oh, very large, yeah. It was quite large.

REDMAN: Several feet.

GRAY: Yes. So that was my job, to take those either to the cyclotron or over to
where I think I met Mr. Phillips. Who’s the man for the science library?
Edward --

REDMAN: Teller? No.

GRAY: No, not Teller, Oppenheimer.

REDMAN: Oppenheimer.

GRAY: But the one that the -- Lawrence.

REDMAN: Lawrence.

GRAY: Lawrence Hall of Science is named after --  There was one other fellow,
and I’ve forgotten his name. But they were four other men who were very
vitally involved in what was going on, and I met them. I think three or four of
them died of radiation poisoning, because --

REDMAN: Oh, is that right?

GRAY:  -- they really didn’t know what was happening. So my job was to
transport plans, in locked cases, to the cyclotron, to wherever they told me.

REDMAN: Okay. Now, did you wear any sort of uniform doing this work?

GRAY: No. No.

REDMAN: Okay. So it would’ve been plain clothes.

GRAY: Yeah, it was certainly plain clothes. I remember I walked down from the
cyclotron one day and I was called into the office and berated. Didn’t I know
that there might be Russian spies hiding behind the trees? That didn’t
register with me in the beginning, but Russian -- they used the word Russian --

REDMAN: Interesting.

GRAY: Come to know that probably they were trying to get all the information, as
well as other people.

REDMAN: Sure. Did that surprise you at the time, thinking, well, the Russians
are --

GRAY: Yes. Yeah, the Russians were are allies; what are you talk --  Yes, it did
surprise me. I didn’t even think about it until later.

REDMAN: Fascinating.

GRAY: At the moment, I was shocked because I was being disciplined for daring to
walk instead of take the transportation that I should have.

REDMAN: Okay. So they wanted you to take the bus or to --

GRAY: Oh, yes.

REDMAN: I see. As opposed to walk.

GRAY: Well, there were buses that shuttled. There were shuttles that went
between places.

REDMAN: Oh, I see. So it wasn’t like a public --

GRAY: Oh, it wasn’t a public bus. Oh, no, no.

REDMAN: Okay. But you had chosen to walk to get the exercise?

GRAY: [laughs] Yeah. Well, it was fun to walk.

REDMAN: Yeah. Okay. Well, it is.

GRAY: Then one of the other things that I really remember is at the same time
they were building the bomb, there were people experimenting with nuclear
medicine, in one of the brown-shingled buildings. It’s still there on the
campus. Often, I had to take messages there. At the time, they were
experimenting with children who had fatal cancer. My contention to anybody who
gets upset about the atom bomb is that nuclear medicine has probably saved a
hundred-thousand times more lives than the atom bomb ever killed.

REDMAN: Interesting.

GRAY: So it shows you that in war, there are many things going on.

REDMAN: Can you tell me, was that sort of the extent to which you were familiar
with medical projects on campus?

GRAY: Yeah, that was it.

REDMAN: Okay. Now, as far as meeting some of these famous scientists, can you
recall how sort of those interactions may have happened, either accidentally or intentionally?

GRAY: Oh, no, I was just taking messages to their offices. Yes. But there
wouldn’t have been much interaction, but I did get to go and meet them because
I had to deliver something.

REDMAN: Sure. Now, I know especially following the dropping of the atomic bomb,
but maybe even a little at the time, these scientists were quite famous figures
and they were something that you would’ve read about in the newspapers.

GRAY: Right, exactly.

REDMAN: Absolutely, then afterwards, they became --

GRAY: Yeah, afterward.

REDMAN:  -- real celebrities.

GRAY: More afterward than during, yes.

REDMAN: Their work was extremely top secret.

GRAY: Well, the project was very secret. We didn’t know what we were working on.

REDMAN: Did you have any sort of inkling about what it was?

GRAY: No.

REDMAN: Nothing whatsoever.

GRAY: Had no idea, no.

REDMAN: Okay. Did you contemplate ever, or did you sort of fantasize about what --

GRAY: No.

REDMAN: Okay.

GRAY: No, and I can remember later on, I was typing these reports and the
reports would be more blacked out stuff than stuff you had to type. They were so
censored. I can still remember that.

REDMAN: So okay, tell me about that. So this was another part of your
responsibilities, was to type out reports.

GRAY: Well, later on, when I was no longer a messenger girl, I was doing typing
of these reports. I’m the world’s worst typist, by the way.

REDMAN: Okay, but you had the security clearance.

GRAY: Oh, yes. But you didn’t get to read it. I don’t know why they had us
doing it. We were making facsimiles of things. They called them faxes at the time?

REDMAN: Facsimiles, yeah, or copies.

GRAY: Exactly. That was what we had for copying.

REDMAN: Would you type them, then, on multiple sheets of paper or onion leaf,
the really thin paper that could then be duplicated?

GRAY: Whatever they were using. Whatever they were using for the facsimile
machines or the fax machines at the time.

REDMAN: Sure.

GRAY: Yeah. Oh, that was very avant-garde, of course.

REDMAN: Okay, yeah. Yeah. [they laugh]

GRAY: I pulled --  Yes, old stuff.

REDMAN: Yeah, I printed this this morning, yeah.

GRAY: This is a little aside, but one of my nephews is an opera singer, and he
came here to sing a role in Doctor Atomic. [laughs] I asked him if they would
have a role for a messenger girl. But they didn’t.

REDMAN: They didn’t. Okay.

GRAY: No.

REDMAN: So tell me then, when the bombs were actually dropped, did you have any
sort of awareness? Okay.

GRAY: No, none.

REDMAN: When did you come to be aware that you were working for the Manhattan Project?

GRAY: Whoo! When? It was years later, I’m sure. Just as this information began
to develop and come out, and then you realize, oh, yeah, that was the name of
the thing I was working on. Yeah. But I’m sure it was several years after the
war before I realized what it was that I had been working on.

REDMAN: Interesting. So it wasn’t something that when you learned of the
dropping of the bombs, that there was some sort of light bulb that went off
that, hey, I’ve been connected with this project in some way.

GRAY: No. No, It was later, much later.

REDMAN: Interesting. Okay.

GRAY: Yeah, much later. They were very secretive. [laughs]

REDMAN: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more, then, about the security
procedures, beyond fingerprinting and --  If you were to walk into the building
at the cyclotron, do you recall what sorts of --

GRAY: I had my pass that I wore. It was like a thing around your neck, with an A
on it.

REDMAN: I see.

GRAY: No, there was no stopping.

REDMAN: That was that.

GRAY: No, stopping, yeah. There was no stopping you or wanding you or anything
else like that.

REDMAN: Right, yeah, exactly . Okay, so it’s not even like going through
airport security nowadays.

GRAY: Oh, no! No. No, you had a badge. You had to have your badge, yes.

REDMAN: Okay. Did the badge have a picture on it, do you recall?

GRAY: I don’t recall.

REDMAN: Okay. Just out of curiosity.

GRAY: No, I don’t recall if it did or not. Just had a big A on it.

REDMAN: Okay. Now, you would always carry things in those tubes, in the locked
tubes? Or were there other times that --

GRAY: Now, did I? I can’t even remember if I took stuff other --  Maybe if you
were going to the medical group, you might have been just carrying something, yeah.

REDMAN: Okay. Okay.

GRAY: But the tube is very --  that’s something that you would remember carrying.

REDMAN: Remember, sure. And it was red, it was a giant red [laughter].

GRAY: Red, yes. [they laugh] So it would be identified.

REDMAN: Right, exactly. This is not intended to go to the Soviets. Okay. So you
felt at the time like the dropping of the atomic weapons were necessary. Then
certainly, when your husband came back, realizing how close he had come to being
in line for the invasion of Japan.

GRAY: Well, another thing that happened -- and this was years and years later --
we went to Japan.

REDMAN: Do you recall about when this was or what decade?

GRAY: It was in 1987, something --  about twenty years ago. We went down to
Hiroshima, of course. We wanted to see it. There, we saw a monument that was
made for the children of Hiroshima. Now, you’re thinking it’s because all
these children were killed. No. There were children killed, but this was a
monument because virtually, there were no men left in Japan to work, and they
had brought in twelve-year-olds to work in Hiroshima. Of course, they were all
killed. So they have a special monument to these children. So that, I think
again, convinced me that probably, the atom bomb was the best thing that could
happen because if there had been an invasion in Japan and they had no men --
They were exhausted.

REDMAN: It would have been devastating, you think.

GRAY: Oh, it would’ve been devastating to them and also devastating to us,
yeah, to have made the invasion. And they were preparing for the invasion.

REDMAN: So that’s something that you certainly have reflected on --

GRAY: Oh, yes.

REDMAN:  -- but it’s a feeling that you’ve maintained, you think.

GRAY: Well, I think it just gave me more reason to think that it was more
reasonable to do it. And the other was that this was thirty-five years after
they dropped the bomb. Hiroshima was a totally rebuilt, lived-in, going city;
whereas there had been all these dire predictions of nothing could be done. It
was like Tokyo.

REDMAN: Okay, yeah. It’s a busy place.

GRAY: And it was thirty-five years later, yes. Yeah. So those things have made
me think that maybe it wasn’t the worst idea, the worst thing that could’ve happened.

REDMAN: Sure. Sure. So I’d like to ask, at the end of the war, in particular
VE Day and VJ Day, do you remember what you felt at those times? Was it a mix of
emotions at all? Were you happy the war was over?

GRAY: VE Day, we were happy. Well, because I think we had seen those horrible
pictures of the camps, and I think that probably, that was most in our mind.
Because the war was still going on for us. We still had a war that wasn’t finished.

REDMAN: So you were thinking, in some sense, about the concentration camps of
the Holocaust and --

GRAY: Yes. Oh, yes.

REDMAN:  -- what an atrocity that had been.

GRAY: Yeah. One of my uncles went into one of those and he would never talk
about it. Later on, we did visit Dachau. I can recall there, thinking, if people
were doing this at random, you just had a random bunch of people and you put
them in the gas chamber --  There was a page in a book for every single person
that went through. I was horrified by that more than anything else.

REDMAN: So the organization, really.

GRAY: Oh! Oh! I couldn’t believe that people would do that kind of thing.

REDMAN: Interesting. Okay.

GRAY: But anyway, the feeling was more how wonderful it was that that was not
going on anymore. Then VE Day, I was actually working in San Francisco --

REDMAN: Okay, or VJ Day.

GRAY: VJ Day.

REDMAN: Oh, okay. Wow.

GRAY: VJ Day, we were working in San Francisco. Of course, we were young girls.
So our boss came in and said, [laughs] “I think all you girls better get out
of here and go home.” So we did. I remember being sent home, probably about
noontime --

REDMAN: I see. Okay.

GRAY:  -- on VJ Day. He was right, because the whole city just erupted.

REDMAN: Yeah, yeah. It was a little chaotic, yeah.

GRAY: Yes, very much so.

REDMAN: I can imagine it would be a little rowdy in the city of San Francisco.

GRAY: Well, but he was very nice, because we were seventeen- and
eighteen-year-old girls.

REDMAN: Yeah. Yeah. It was a positive happy day, but you better go home.

GRAY: But get out of the city. [they laugh]

REDMAN: Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I’d like to ask something before I forget, that
is an event that takes place in 1946, and a lot, a lot of people have forgotten
about it. There was a three-day-long strike called the Oakland general strike
that shut down the city for about three days. Do you recall that event? There
was a group of unions that had a big strike in Oakland in ’46. Okay.

GRAY: In Oakland?

REDMAN: Yeah. It seems like a lot of people have forgotten.

GRAY: No, I don’t remember. I don’t even remember it. Probably, closing down
Oakland seemed like a good idea. [they laugh]

REDMAN: Okay. So similarly, I’d like to ask about a city that my guess is that
a nice young girl like yourself, during the war, would’ve had no familiarity
with. But my understanding was that El Cerrito was a bit more like Las Vegas --

GRAY: Really?

REDMAN:  -- than it is now.

GRAY: El Cerrito?

REDMAN: El Cerrito, of all places. Okay, but that comes as a surprise.

GRAY: That comes as a total surprise, yeah.

REDMAN: Interesting. Okay. All right. So yeah, sort of the last question I’d
really like to ask about the war is sort of, if you could reflect on the war,
and in Berkeley in particular, how do you think the war may have shaped Berkeley
in any particular way? It seems, in some sense, kind of like it was isolated
from a lot of the war; but in another sense, it might’ve been influenced by
the war.

GRAY: Well, I don’t know. You asked about the immigrant thing, and people feel
like a bunch of black people came into Berkeley at that time. But in 1936, when
we arrived here. St. Joseph’s already had a black community. So it wasn’t --

REDMAN: It wasn’t quite a shock.

GRAY: The fact that there were different people coming in was really no shock to
Berkeley at all. Berkeley didn’t really change all that much.

REDMAN: Okay. So now, Richmond changed a lot, it seems like.

GRAY: Richmond changed a lot, because it was a very small place that all of a
sudden became a big place.

REDMAN: Okay.

GRAY: Maybe they weren’t quite as settled a community, so that more bad things
could happen there than would happen here.

REDMAN: Okay. Okay.

GRAY: Yeah. Of course, at that time, we had the premier police force of the
whole United States in Berkeley.

REDMAN: Is that right?

GRAY: Oh, yeah. Yeah. So we’ve always been a kind of, I don’t know, a
contained community.

REDMAN: So one of the things, then, I’d like to ask about is immediately after
the war, a lot of people came back to California, of course. But then may
students who had been at Berkeley resumed their studies, people who had gone off
to war.

GRAY: Sure.

REDMAN: I’m curious. It seems like that would’ve been a time where a lot of
new students would’ve come to campus, in ’46, ’47, ’48; but it also
seems, in some sense, like a quite idyllic time, in that people were relieved to
be done with the war and moving on with their life. Was that your case?

GRAY: Probably no. I didn’t go back to school ever. That was one of my fears
in life, was ever having to go back to school.

REDMAN: Okay, so you were ready to be done.

GRAY: [laughs] So I was done. And my husband never went back. He and his
brothers started a business, rather than go back to school. So we weren’t
involved in what was going on --

REDMAN: On campus.

GRAY:  -- on the campus. But I feel that it was probably a more mature group and
probably a more settled group. Now, after the war, housing was a pre-mi-um. We
didn’t marry until May of ’47, and two weeks before we got married, we
didn’t have a place to live.

REDMAN: Okay. A little bit of a panic there at the end?

GRAY: There was nothing, to begin with.

REDMAN: Nothing to be had. Okay.

GRAY: Talking about the people coming back from[sic] campus, they would come
back and then they would marry, and they would move into housing. We had made
some friends and tried, through then, when they had found some, to find some.
But it was a real problem after the war.

REDMAN: It seems likely to me that most soldiers coming back from the war
wouldn’t want to move into a fraternity house, that they --

GRAY: Exactly. They’re a little bit more mature, they’ve done things. Yes, yes.

REDMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. So with that, I’d like to sort of ask
you, to then conclude, if you can reflect on --  We’ve talked about a lot of
subjects today. We’ve talked about a lot. Everything from farm life in Iowa to
bicycles in Berkeley -- gosh, I’m looking at this list -- Port Chicago, a lot
in there. But you mentioned that the war was actually a fun and exciting time,
in some sense, for you and a lot of other young people at that time. Can you
sort of reflect on the place of the war in your life?

GRAY: The place of the war in my life. Well, my father didn’t have to go to
war; he was too old and had too many children, so he didn’t have to go. So the
war didn’t really impact our lives that much. It just, I think, opened up new
venues that we wouldn’t have thought of even trying to be in before.
Especially my sister and I singing. We would sing for school, we would sing for
nice wedding groups and things like that; but here was a whole new venue that
opened up. Probably, stayed that way after the war, that it opened up our
thinking a little bit maybe, yeah. But I think fun is probably the bad word to
use for it.

REDMAN: Sure.

GRAY: But it was new adventures. It was doing new things and doing the things we
liked for new people. More of that than anything.

REDMAN: I like that. That’s very interesting. All right, well, I’d like to
say thank you for sitting down with me.

GRAY: Oh, you’re very, very welcome.

REDMAN: I appreciate it. Excellent.

GRAY: Good.
