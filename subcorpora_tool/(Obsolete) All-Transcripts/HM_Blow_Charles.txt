Story_ID: 669075
Speaker 1: So I want to start out, if you don't mind, I'd like to start out by asking about your father and if you would give his name. We--you know what we do is genealogical information first, so--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) if you give his name and his year or birth.
Speaker 2: I don't even know his year of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. His name is Toi Edward Blow [Toi Blow].
Speaker 1: Can you talk about him? Give, give information about what you know about his growing up.
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about his growing up because his parents died when I was an infant, and I don't remember them; his parents and his grandfather. His grandmother, I didn't know at all. So I never knew of his family much, other than his siblings. So he had the, there were two sisters, who I knew very well because after my mom [Freddie Blow] and my dad broke up, they stayed together, and near them was one of his brothers. So I knew that kind of, that group of the part of the family very well. What I know is that he--what--from what I'm told, he was a musician and he, he had a band and, and he was a very handsome young man, and I think he knew that, and he, and the girls and then the women liked that, and that didn't sit well with my mom, so well. But eventually, he and his bandmates had a car accident, one of them, I think one or maybe even more were killed in that. And I don't think he ever played again. He became a construction worker from that, so I ne- I've never heard my dad use an instrument ever. I've seen guitars all around the house when I was a kid, but I've never heard him play. I don't think he's ever played again.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you know, you, you talk in your book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] about, you know, him being somewhat irresponsible in, in a way, right? Or that's your memory of him.
Speaker 2: Yes. I think that he, you know, there was a lot of kind of loose living, not taking care of home the way my mother would've liked. Still, you know, doing--being too much in the streets, as he had been when he was a musician. And that just didn't jive well with family life, and so it just--they didn't--it didn't last long after I was born.
Story_ID: 669076
Speaker 1: Now, your mother, can you give her name and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her name is Freddie Mae Blow.
Speaker 1: Okay. And her year of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know the year. I think it's--her birthday's November 27th, I don't know the year, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And can you talk about her and what you know about her?
Speaker 2: You know, she is in some ways, a very conservative woman. You know, never known her to ever take a drink in my life. Never known her to ever go out to a party of any sort in my life. She--you know, she didn't watch television, really; she watched a couple shows with us, but she watched the 'Wheel of Fortune' and the news. She read the newspaper. She reads books. So there's a part of her that has a really conservative streak. She--everything in her closet is either black, brown, navy blue, white or cream, there are no colors. You know, there's a--and she, I think, inherited a lot of that from spending a lot of her childhood with my great-grandmother [Catherine Sneed Richardson], who was a very conservative woman. She dropped out of school young. She, you know, she got married to my father [Toi Blow] very young. They had us five boys very quickly. There are five of us stretched over eight years. She was often in and out of illness every time she got pregnant, and you know, back then access to healthcare, she didn't even know what was wrong, she just knew she was sick. And that kind of took her out of being able to both finish school and to work. And when I was--shortly after I was born, she went back to work. Somebody helped get her a job, it was at a chicken processing plant; horrible place. But she did that work and they paid her almost nothing, and she--while she was doing it, she went back to school to finish her college degree. So she's--she has all these boys, she's working this grueling job, and she's also going to school at night. And she eventually got that degree and she became a teacher, first a teacher's aide then a teacher, and she kept going to school her entire life. I remember, you know, sometimes, you know, there was no one to keep me so she'd take me to class with her, and I'd be in the back doodling and she'd be in the front taking notes. And she, she kept at it and she got a master's degree and she got several certificates and now she is a school board member in her local district [Bienville Parish School Board]--
Speaker 1: That (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) after retiring.
Speaker 1: --that's a, a wonderful story, rite of fortitude. So what--do you know what she got sick with when she was getting sick? Has that ever been stated--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: --just that she--
Speaker 2: --we don't know, she just knew she was really ill. And I don't know if it was just during the pregnancy or if it was kind of postpartum or not. I don't know what the nature of the sickness 'cause I was the last kid, so I never saw her sick, but she told me that she got sick.
Story_ID: 669077
Speaker 1: Did she [Blow's mother, Freddie Mae Blow] ever talk about her growing up at all?
Speaker 2: She did. I mean, she was with my--she lived with her parents. She had one brother. And they--my grandfather was a celebrated war veteran and he came back from the war [World War II, WWII] injured. And they--he, you know, he got some sort of payment of the injury in addition to working when he got back, and that--they were able to buy a house and they had things that other people didn't have, but, you know, they didn't quite manage the money right. And eventually, they moved to Houston [Texas] and my mom just didn't want to be there and she wanted to be back with my great-grandmother, which was her grandmother. And they put her on a bus, or she got on a bus or she--there was a bus and she, she was on that bus back to Louisiana from Houston, and she spent the rest of her growing up with--at my great-grandmother's house. And so that became kind of, you know, her de facto mom.
Speaker 1: And her, her--your great-grandmother's name was what?
Speaker 2: It was Catherine, maiden name was Sneed. She was married four times, so the last one was Richardson, so that's--I knew her as Catherine Richardson [Catherine Sneed Richardson].
Speaker 1: Okay. And did she ever nickname your grandmother--great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: We called her Mama Tat [ph.]. Everyone called her Tat.
Speaker 1: And your, your--so how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: I mean, I think that, that she's, you know, there are two, two moms; there is the conservative person who, who doesn't, who doesn't want any carousing, and don't want to be any part of that. But she also has an incredibly short temper, and so when she feels wronged, all hell is to pay for that. And not, not towards children, but you know, when a, when she felt like someone had, you know, crossed her or done something really wrong to her and injured her honor, her sense of honor, that was, that was not good.
Speaker 1: Someone was gonna pay a price really?
Speaker 2: People paid prices, yeah.
Story_ID: 669078
Speaker 1: So your siblings, can you give their, their names and birth order?
Speaker 2: So the oldest is Frederick [Frederick Blow], the next is Frank [Frank Blow], the next is Marvin [Marvin Blow], next is Douglas [Douglas Blow].
Speaker 1: Okay. And were they named after any specific people in--
Speaker 2: No. I think my mom [Freddie Mae Blow]--you know, my, my understanding of it is just that she knew we had such an odd last name, that she wanted the most conventional first names that she could find, and so that's why we have these very standard names.
Story_ID: 669079
Speaker 1: Now what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: The earliest one would be watching my [maternal] great-grandmother [Catherine Sneed Richardson] die. We--and I didn't even remember it right, my mom [Freddie Mae Blow] had to correct my memory of it. But we had gathered at my great-grandmother and great-grand- my great-grandparents' house be- it was the day that she was dying, and my great-grandfather knew that this was the last and so everyone was there. And he called us into the room and I was convinced that this is her birthday and that we were there to give her some gift because there were so many people gathered, and that seemed to me, logical as a, you know, three, almost four year old kid. And she--there were people all the way around the bed. It was--the bed was a hospital bed and it was in what used to be their den, and it had a big picture window that faced out onto the street. And I was at the foot of the bed and there were people all the way around it, and she turned, which I thought in that moment, she was turning to see the gift that the person on the other side of the bed actually had the gift, and she turned and that was it. She died, and she fell still and everyone screamed, and I didn't understand why people were screaming. And my mom ran out of the house and--which was my want at the time, I did--I was always with my mom so I ran right behind her and she threw herself to the ground near the, the hog pen. My great-grandfather raised hogs, that was--and she's crying and she's rocking her back against it, and I don't know why she's crying, but I know what tears are because even little kids know what crying is. And I just remember the hogs trying to lap at her hair, and I was just trying to swat away their mouths to keep them from lapping at her hair, and that was the first memory.
Speaker 1: So how old were you about, at that time?
Speaker 2: It was three--I was going on four, so it was, you know, three and a half. I mean, the halves kind of mean something when you're three and four and fives. Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That is true.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 669080
Speaker 1: Talk about your growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, what do you want to know about it?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's a lot there (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know there's a lot there, that's true. This is such a good book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow]. But talk about--you know what I'm gonna to ask you, I'm gonna ask you to start with what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Big sweet gum trees, and the smell of honeysuckles, and ponds, and the bugs that skip across the surface of ponds, and gravel, and red clay dirt, and farmed trees, that feels like Gibsland [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Gibsland is the, is the name of the town?
Speaker 2: Gibsland is the name of the town where I grew up.
Speaker 1: And how far is Gibsland from, from Shreveport [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: It should be about forty minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And can you describe the, the, the--I can--you probably not even a straight--I mean, can you describe the area that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: So Gibsland is a square, roughly square anyway, I can't, can't be too sure it's an absolute square, but it's a, roughly a square. The--maybe probab- I'm gonna guess a square mile or two, not very big. There are only about a thousand people who live there, maybe there are a few more when I was growing up; I think it's shrinking a bit. There was--Main Street [sic. South Main] cut through town from the, from north to south. And most of the white community lived on either side of Main Street; most of the black community lived on the west side of town. There was a, a ditch, depression that ran through town and we--black people mostly lived on one side of it and whites lived on the other side of it; that ditch also cut north to south. Main Street had a few businesses, but it was like one of each thing, so it's like one drycleaner, one bank, one restaurant, one feed and seed, one dry goods store. And the, there are two schools that became one school system when I was born. They--before that, they were segregated, so the Gibsland school [Gibsland High School, Gibsland, Louisiana] was for all the white kids and there was the Coleman school [Coleman High School, Gibsland, Louisiana], which had begun its life as Coleman College, which was the only school in North Louisiana for--to, to--for black kids, and it was formed to educate the sons and daughters of former slaves. And it didn't survive as a college, but it became our high school, so it had that kind of--you, you felt that sort of history in the place. It kind of pulsed through the place and you never forgot it, and teachers never let you forget it, so you did feel like you were connected to something slightly bigger than this tiny town. But they became one school system, so the Gibsland school became the elementary school [Gibsland Elementary School] and then Coleman, which became Gibsland-Coleman High School, became the high school. And there was one juke joint that I knew of, which was on the black side of town right before the city limits, right off of our street. And there was the bootlegger, who was kind of cattycorner to the, to the field where my [maternal] great-grandfather had raised the hogs. And, you know, we had some colorful characters. There was a hermit, that I remember, who I never heard speak and I never heard--saw come out of his house, and he had these chest high weeds covered the entire yard, but he was one of my great uncle's friends and so he--when I--my great uncle kept me as a kid when I was about four, right before school, so he was my babysitter, so we'd go--walk to all of his friends, walked me back to our house for the afternoon when my mom [Freddie Mae Blow] would get home. So he'd visit all these colorful characters and that was one of them. There was the person we thought was the--was a witch; we were absolutely sure of this, all the kids were, but my mom said, you know, "There's nothing wrong with Carrie [ph.] but crazy," you know, her name was Carrie. But she never spoke and she had these moth eaten clothes and she kind of went through the streets of town with her hand up over her face and big brimmed hat; I mean, it was like out of Central Casting, if there was a witch. So that was kind of the flavor of town. There--and for such a small town, there were quite a few churches, we'd (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many?
Speaker 2: I don't--I can't even count. So we had--there was a Methodist church down the street from our house, and my--
Speaker 1: Was it A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] or just Methodist?
Speaker 2: Just regular Methodist and my family split between those, so like my great-grandfather and that group went to the Methodist church. I mean, we went to the Methodist church for Sunday school because it was right down the street, and some of my uncles were members there and--but then we went south of town to Shiloh [Shiloh Baptist Church (ph.)], that's where my home church is what they call it; that's where my mom went to school--went to church and where her dad had gone to church. But there were, you know, there were churches sprinkled all around town, and you, you--none of these churches would have more than, you know, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty people on any given Sunday because there weren't enough people, but they were churches and they were--had their own histories, and they kept it.
Story_ID: 669081
Speaker 1: So this is really, I mean, in many ways, you know, ver- small, really small town life and, and, and in the South too, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: So, you know, when--in your book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] you talk about a lot of what sort of strikes me is that it's a poor town [Gibsland, Louisiana], you know, but so rich, in terms of natural resources; so can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: The resources being what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, there were berries, and there were, you know, there was a lot of food around.
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think that, people learned how to survive. The way my mom [Freddie Mae Blow] told it, you know, people were almost starving when she grew up. People ate everything. There was--there were no scraps. I mean, I, I don't know how the dog survived because there were no scraps for anybody's dogs, it was like they ate everything and they learned how to cook everything. And to supplement that from a, just a nutritional standpoint, everyone planted nut trees and fruit trees in their yards because that was the only way you could get it. So ev- I don't know of a yard that didn't have a pecan tree. And in our yard, there was--there were two pecan trees, one had stopped producing nuts, but there were two pecan trees. There were--along the fence row, there were two crabapple trees. The blackberries produced every other year, so you had blackberries every other year along the fence row. There was a peach tree across the street, but also, in--on our property. There was a prune tree. The neighbor, right across the street, had a plum tree. There were people with pomegranate trees. We--the only way to get all this fruit was to--if we grew it and so people had--and you just shared it. You couldn't even eat all the apples or the plums or the peaches, so you'd walk by and, "Oh, they have plums in their yard." And then you'd ask, knock on the door maybe and say, "Can we get, get some plums?" And maybe they'd say, "Go for it," 'cause they couldn't eat it all. And that was kind of the way you supplemented because people didn't have enough money to buy it, and they--but they did know enough about basic nutrition that they knew that they needed that; and people grew their own vegetables. So that was, a big part of growing up was the kind of growing and, and collecting and processing of food; that was the way we spent many of our days, particularly, in the growing season. We--you know, you--your--, "You can go play, but after we go to this garden and hoe out all these, you know, pick all this corn," or whatever we did, and that's what we did. And many times there were, there were larger farms and at the end of the season if they couldn't--they had more than they could pick and sell, you could, you could buy the right to go out and pick. So they--you'd say per bushel or they'd give you a day and you--for a flat fee, and all of us would show up at six [o'clock] in the morning, groggy, and we'd go out and pick as much of whatever they had as we could find. And through the entire course of the night, we'd be processing it and preparing it to be kept for the winter, and that was my life. I mean, some--I don't even think people completely understand what it means to be working poor in America and how, you know, we didn't have wealth there of any sort. My mom just--she couldn't bring herself to even--I mean, I think it was a relatively new idea for her back then, but anyway, she just didn't even understand the concept and the idea that she would be taking charity from somebody was just too much for her to bear. So--but that meant that we had to grow things, and so that was part of what being working poor was, and many mornings you--she's waking us up at like five in the morning because the hog, or the hogs, have rooted their way out of the pen, and we have to scout--we have no idea where they are. There's no GPS [global positioning system] on the fro- hogs, so you have--you have--there's a forest, you have to like put on clothes and like fan out through this forest and see if we can find this hog before we have to go to school, and kind of usher it back into the pen. So by the time I get to school, I'm, I'm exhausted; it's three hours of like running through the, the woods trying to find a hog that nobody knew where it was, so you could--that's part of the working poor experience.
Speaker 1: And this--and we're actually talking about the mid to, you know, late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yes. I mean, I think pe- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, this is--this is what--
Speaker 2: I think people think of like '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] when--I heard a lot of publishers say that when they read the book until they hit a computer, and they're like, "Wait. How--where does the computer come from?" No, this is not, this is not like pre-civil rights era, this is, this, you know, '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, even, you know, some--a lot of your descriptions brought back memories of my childhood and I'm, I'm fifteen years, sixteen years older than you, but I just, you know, it brought back things I hadn't thought about in a long time, but they, they were my childhood.
Story_ID: 669082
Speaker 1: You talk a lot about not having a sense of place, you know, and can you tell me, do you think you were as aware of it as a child as you were--you know, 'cause I know you were--you know, you went to live with your un- uncle--
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandmother.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother.
Speaker 2: When, when I was--but that was before I could even remember.
Speaker 1: Right. But then you ended up living--
Speaker 2: Back with my mom [Freddie Mae Blow].
Speaker 1: Right, with your mom. So, but it's also just sort of--you know, as the youngest one, or maybe she's got a lot going on, you know, and you talk a lot about that, and I'm just wondering, what made you aware, or the feeling of that? And how do you feel you differed from your--well, your--wait, one of your--two of your brothers were living--
Speaker 2: One of my brothers already lived with my grandmother and, and continued to for--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --for his entire time growing up. I don't know what made--I think it was individual to me, in a way, among my brothers. I don't, I don't get the sense that they felt lonely. And I think that people can sometimes think that loneliness means the absence of other people. I think loneliness can be just the absence of an ability to connect and feel that you have a place and a purpose in any group, including in a family, but also in a community. And I think that by the time I came along and the time my memory really starts to develop and I can really, you know, process things. I'm just four, five, three, four, five years old, and at five years old my parents break up, and the, the stress ratchets up dramatically because we--you know, my dad [Toi Blow] may not have always been doing the right thing, but being a single parent is being a single parent. And so now my mom is being a single parent, and also, taking care of an elderly uncle, and there's one salary, and that means a tremendous amount of stress. And she, she's, as I said, really averse to charity, and so she couldn't bring herself to take any handouts and that meant that she feels like, and I, I admire her for this, doing the absolute most that she can do. There was--I used to not think my mother slept, literally; when, when I went to sleep, she was awake and she was working, and when I woke up, she was awake and she was working, and the bed never seemed to be disturbed, and I thought, she doesn't sleep. She literally works all night, 'cause I--that's all I knew of her. And I--now that I am a parent and a single parent, I can understand how exhausted she must have been.
Story_ID: 669083
Speaker 1: Describe though, can you describe yourself as a li- as a young boy? I mean--
Speaker 2: I mean, I think I was, I was a quiet kid. I was, I was, I think, in some ways, maybe more thoughtful and contemplative than other kids. I played alone a lot and some of that was because that's the way things broke, in the house and in the community. There was--I was the--not only the youngest kid in--youngest boy in my family, I was the youngest boy in our little universe, in our block, in our community, and I didn't know there were other boys. There were two girls who were cousins of mine, they were both, I think, a year or two younger than me and they lived in the next two houses over, but they were girls and they liked to, you know, play with the dolls, and I was like, I don't want to do that. And I just didn't know that there were other boys. And I remember going for the first day of school [Gibsland Elementary School, Gibsland, Louisiana], which I couldn't wait to do because my brothers would always leave and I would be left at home, and they'd come back and they'd have books and things to do, and I was fascinated by books. I didn't care what it was, it was a book and there was stuff in it, and I couldn't figure out what was in it, but it was something in it because they stayed--they stared at it all night and I wanted one. And so I was really excited to go to school and I remember going the first day and there were all of the parents for--particularly for the young kids, and all of the kids were sitting in bleachers in the, in the, in the gymnasium. And I remember standing up and like looking across and thinking, where did all these kids come from? I have never seen kids. Where did the kids--I--my universe just didn't have kids in it, it had a bunch of old people, which is where I spent my days, with, with olderly--older people who were my great uncle's friends, and that's what I thought the world consisted of. And it was kindergarten when I realized, no, there are actually other people who are your age and there's some boys around.
Story_ID: 669084
Speaker 1: You know, you start the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] out talking about Chester.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did that take you a long time to come to, the--how you were gonna start the book and how--I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, you--I think kind of the structural way of, of how you write the book, you know, you have to--I had to think about how to do that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --how to make the narrative work. Whether or not I was going to discuss it, that didn't take a long time to come to. I put it off writing 'til later in the process 'cause I knew exactly what that said. The other parts, I knew I had to do more work on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and maybe part of me didn't want to see it written until later.
Speaker 1: I see. Because your mother [Freddie Mae Blow] didn't know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --until you wrote the book?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, okay, I'm going out of chronology, but it's just that this is about your childhood.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how do you tell your mother? I mean, how do--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean--
Speaker 1: --because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) it was--
Speaker 1: --I mean she's a very proper woman.
Speaker 2: She's a very proper woman and she has, as anyone does in, in old age, they have a narrative in their head about what their life says, and if there was going to be a eulogy, this is what people would say. That's--you know, you have that kind of--whether or not you articulate it as such or not, you have that in your mind. And so to know that one of your children was hurt in your house while you were there and you didn't know it, it's, it's hard to hear and I know that, and, and that was hard for me to let her know that. And, also, it was important for me to let her know that it is not really her fault, even though as a little kid, I think I had passed some of the blame onto her. The thing about child sexual abuse, unfortunately, is that many children don't tell, and many kids like me become really good at covering the pain of it. And so there would be no--there was nothing to see, you know. The--this is a kid who's getting straight A's in school and he's captain of the basketball team and president of every club, there can't have been something wrong with my kid, and be--and to some degree, all of that is compensatory. You're trying to, through your own works, erase what you see as a blight in your life, and so I was brilliant at covering it, so it's not her fault that she didn't see it or know it. And it's not even my fault that I didn't have the wherewithal to share it. It's just the way that, that structurally, I think, the way child sexual abuse expresses, I think it's the way it is internalized; it is the way children just do not know how to deal with it. And unless you or some professional is really keen at picking up subtle changes when they happen, because I think right afterwards, I think it--there are changes, but if the kid can survive that, that immediate aftermath, they can learn to cover.
Story_ID: 669085
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Talk about what happened.
Speaker 1: --coming to, to--telling her? I, I kept thinking, you know, how do I tell her? And I didn't know how to tell her. And I, and I had finished the first draft of the manuscript and, and I don't know, having some conversation with my agent, and I said, "Oh, yeah, I'm gonna just say--," something in the conversation, I said, "I'm gonna just talk to my mom [Freddie Mae Blow] about it; make sure she knows that--what's in it." He says, "No, don't talk to your mom yet because it'll change--you know, this will--this is your first draft, you don't know what the, the several--there'll be several more drafts and you don't know what they'll say." And something about that didn't strike me right. I, I was, I was actually in the car and the--there's a system in the car where the, the phone comes through the, the car, the speakers, and I pulled the car over immediately and I said, "The fact that you don't want me to tell her, it means that I need to tell her right now," and I called her. And because at that point, if I were to have followed that advice, then it's--then it really did feel like a deception because I felt--I had felt originally, that was the moment to tell her and then someone was telling me not to. And it was really hard for her to hear. It was really hard for her to hear. And I could hear her choking up and my mother doesn't cry; you know, I've seen her cry once in my life, well, at that point, I had seen her cry once in my life, and--or twice, when her, her, her uncle and her mom died, that's--she cried at those funerals a little bit. But like, I could hear her choking up and that was hard for me 'cause that's not the way I conceive of her. And, you know, she said, "And you didn't think you could tell me?" And she--and the words were coming out in this, you know, really hard way through choking back something, and it was hard. I don't even know how--I remember her asking that, and I don't know if I answered her or how I answered her. And I immediately went home and made a copy and sent--put it in the mail and sent what I had because I said, "You need to see it now." And I bought a ticket to go, as soon as, you know--I couldn't go the same day, it was a really expensive last minute ticket, but like, I think it was like two weeks later or something and I went and--to talk to her about it. And it was still tough for her. It was just hard, you know. She--you, you could tell she had been crying, she told me she had been crying. It was really hard to have that conversation with her.
Speaker 2: Had she read the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow]?
Speaker 1: She said she read most of it, and I could tell by some of the things she said, she--that she used references, that she got really far into it, but she said she couldn't finish. So I don't know if she has eventually finished and I have--I don't talk to her about whether or not she finished; she has it. I sent her the final and I wrote, you know, as corny as it sounds, you know, my--we call her Granny, she--which she hated at first, when she first became a grandparent. So we call her Granny, you know, "Wind beneath my wings," and that's what I, you know, wrote, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow]." And I sent it to her. And so she has it and I feel like, you know, when she feels like it's--she's ready, if she hasn't already read it, she will, but I think things like this take their own time. And I have three kids and I--it would be tough for me to hear that something had happened, you know, twenty feet away from me that, that hurt my kids and I didn't know it; it would be hard for me to hear that.
Story_ID: 669086
Speaker 1: So, you know, there's the other thing of, in the black community that you just don't air your dirty laundry; you know, I mean there's that. She, she [Blow's mother, Freddie Mae Blow]--so the question I--talk about what happened, you know, what we're talking about with the--this whole thing. What happened with Chester?
Speaker 2: Right. With--so Chester was one of my uncle's kids who came to stay with us one summer; I don't know if it was a week or two or something, whatever it was. And one night, I mean, we, we--he wanted--he made it very clear that he was my--he wanted to be really good friends, and he was older than me, and I thought this made me feel like a big boy and--
Speaker 1: How much older?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly, you know, I'm seven; he's a teen, young teenager probably. And, you know, we had just a small house, there's a lot of us in it, so we share beds and he--we were sharing a bed and one night there was kind of inappropriate touching from him and it was such a shocking thing to me, and it, and it was what I constantly refer to in the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] as a betrayal. I didn't, I didn't call it abuse for a very long time. It was just a betrayal. Like I could not believe that someone who, not only that I trusted and loved as part of my family and--but that my family loved and trusted in every possible way, would betray that trust. And, and, you know, he--the next day he asked about doing what we did again--last night again today, and I said, "No, I don't want to." And the, the night before, I couldn't even--you know, seven years old, I just--the words couldn't come to me. I just didn't know what--I was stiff as a board. I didn't know what was happening. And that next day the words came and I just said, "I don't want to do that." And he never said a nice word to me ever again, and then he became a bully for me, and I think it was designed to keep me from ever telling and it worked; I never told anybody. And, and it really, I think, damaged my ability to, in some ways, trust people because he seemed so close to us, and it just seemed that if someone that close to you could hurt you, it could always happen that way.
Speaker 1: Well, and then remember also, I think, that's what we were starting to talk, that you were--really didn't have your place at--I mean, you were feeling lonely. I mean--
Speaker 2: I think, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) lonely.
Speaker 2: --the deal was I was lonely, and like sort of being--feeling apart, but I, I'm convinced that, that predators can recognize difference and ostracism in children, even before the children can recognize it in themselves. And rather than child sexual abuse making children different, I think it's more likely that being different makes children more likely to be the victims of child sexual abuse. And when you flip it and turn it around and look at it that way, you see how important it is to show children who are a little bit different extra love, give them extra spaces in which to be vocal and express themselves, and to be patient with them and just to envelop them in your love and protection, and I don't think we do that enough.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this difference--so after that, you, you feel--he, he's calling you punk--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're feeling a--you know, a cha- you're feeling almost responsible, sort of--
Speaker 2: I feel immedia--
Speaker 1: --in a way.
Speaker 2: Immediately, I felt responsible because I--you know, seven year olds, we look--I think we carry these memories with us--I carry it with me as a forty-four year old, as if it happened yesterday, so it's that fresh and that's why I can write about it such--so vividly. And I think we end up thinking about it with a forty-four year old mind, and so we, you know, really kind of process every nook and cranny of it. But I think as a seven year old, you do feel like this is so different than anything I've ever heard of happening, and I've never heard it happen to anyone else, so I must've done something here that made this happen, and I couldn't figure out what that was.
Story_ID: 669087
Speaker 1: The other thing I want to ask you is besides, you know, and you talk about when you were living, you know, with your mother, was it where, you know, everybody called you--how, how did--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Char- Char--
Speaker 2: Charles Baby [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow].
Speaker 1: Charles Baby.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Charles Baby, yes.
Speaker 1: And then you had one that called you chocolate?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you were part of that community--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --sort of?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. At--but this is the thing, do--at what point has anyone in your family or your, your--I don't know if your brothers or your mother subsequently, said that they knew you were bright; at what point did they feel that you were smart and bright?
Speaker 2: I don't know if, I don't know if anybody ever said that to me. My uncle used to say, "Oh, I knew you were gonna be smart because you were always reading books." You know, he'd joke like that. But for the first time that anyone, that I recall anyone saying that I was smart was when I transferred from the school I went to, my mom--which was just Ringgold's, which is about thirty miles south of town, back to our, our school in our town, Gibsland [Louisiana]. And I guess I was in the third or fourth grade, I, I can't forget--I can't remember, and the first day, the teacher gave me--gave us a math test. And I was a bundle of nerves, and I'm the new kid, and I'm just scratching down, I guess, as fast as I can, and I realized that I'm finished first and I turn it in and she grabs me. And I never had a teacher hug me ever, and she grabs me and pulls me close to her one arm and she just starts--you know, puts the hand out so you can hold the paper and starts checking it. And she's smiling and, "We're gonna call you Speedy Gonzales," which now is really an offensive term, but back then, that was part of the cartoons we watched after school. And I thought, wait, I'm smart? Like I--it just--it was the first time that it had ever dawned on me and that she was so happy and that I wanted to see her happy all the time; I wanted somebody to be happy and approving. And so I just decided that I was always gonna get great grades so that Mrs. Thomas [ph.] would always smile and--when she'd check my paper.
Speaker 1: And plus, before that remember, you had been put in the--or--
Speaker 2: For a time, right after the betrayal, what--which is what I call it with Chester, we--yes, I--we--the--I was so out of it, you know the--between the exhaustion of the kind of working poor lifestyle and the kind of emotional exhaustion of having my parents [Freddie Mae Blow and Toi Blow] recently split apart and then the abuse, it was just too much for me; I was a kid. And I started to withdraw and they didn't know what was happening and they didn't, they didn't seem to care very much. They just said he's not keeping up and we're gonna move him out and they didn't tell me even, they just directed me one day to another classroom. And my mom, she, she knew--she didn't know what was happening, what was wrong, but she knew that I wasn't slow and she protested until they moved me back to the regular class.
Speaker 1: So, this whole--so talk about the--give me the name of your schools.
Speaker 2: So I start--I went to kindergarten at Gibsland Elementary [Gibsland Elementary School, Gibsland, Louisiana] and then my mom got a job at Ringgold Elementary School [Ringgold, Louisiana], which was south of town. So I went to Ringgold from first grade to, I think, third grade. I came--and then she got a job back in Gibsland, so I--we came back to the Gibsland schools, and so I went back to Gibsland Elementary, that would've been from fourth to sixth grade; and it was just two schools, there was no middle school, so--and then the seventh grade, you move to the upper school, and that was Gibsland-Coleman High School [Gibsland, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: So high school began at seventh grade (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 669088
Speaker 1: Can I ask you about holidays? That's the--you know, I wasn't--you know, how, how are hol- how are holidays sort of celebrated 'cause--
Speaker 2: I'm--I mean, the holidays, as I remember them that we really celebrated were Christmas, Thanksgiving, 4th of July there would be some cookout. And we do Juneteenth in the South, that is the day that slaves in that part of the, of the South found out that they were free and that's June--generally celebrated on June 19th. But the big, the big holidays would have been Thanksgiving and Christmas, and you know, it was big meals and people gathering and all of the relatives would come. We--you know, they'd determine the, the adult would determine at whose house it would be celebrated that year and everyone would show up at that house, and there's a lot of food. My mom [Freddie Mae Blow] and my grandmother are great cooks and we ate 'til we went to sleep. So those were all happy times, you know, for me. We didn't have a lot for Christmas. We--you know, I remember when, particularly I was really young, you got like one or two things and some clothes because you needed clothes anyway, but they'd pa- put them in a box and that was part of your gift. But, you know, it, it was ha- those were happy times.
Story_ID: 669089
Speaker 1: What role did church play? Did it play--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mom [Freddie Mae Blow]--you--we were--you know she was very--she wasn't hyper religious, but she was a religiously observant person. And she--we had a church, her home church, which was Shiloh Baptist, which was about twenty miles south of town; that church shared a preacher because these little--so many churches, not enough preachers, so they shared a preacher with another church. So he would preach two Sundays at their church and two Sundays at ours, and ours was second and fourth Sundays, so we only had church on second and fourth Sundays; so on those Sundays, very often we would go, or at least one of those two Sundays we would go to church. Now, my mom, you know, she believed in it. She--you know, she, she, she's a religious person, she doesn't like all that hoopla and she doesn't like the orchestration of it, and she doesn't like things to drone on. So she had about an hour in her, and then she was like, "We gonna--when y'all put your money in the plate, you walk right out that door. I'm gonna be right behind you," and that was the way she looked at it, but she'd come home and she'd play her gospel music while she cleaned up.
Speaker 1: You know, and that's sort of funny. In the old--you know, the church services would go on and on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On and on and on.
Speaker 1: --especially in Shiloh Baptist Church [ph.], I mean--but, you know, I thought that was so funny that she was the, the, the, the--whatever.
Speaker 2: Right. The, the offering?
Speaker 1: The, the offering in the plate and then she'd be gone. But what song do--what songs remind you of that time period in church? Do you have any songs if you hear them today?
Speaker 2: There's--I mean, well there's, "Guide me, o thou great Jehovah" ['Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah']. I don't know how that--what the name of that song is, but that's the--that was the, the opening prayer song. And so you--they'd sing one verse and then the, then the, the congregation would follow with the same verse and it would just--they would just draw it out. And so they would do it again, and they would draw out the next verse, and they'd do this, and then they would start to preach in between the draws on the, on the verses. My mom had several favorites, "Please be patient with me, God is not through with me yet" ['Please Be Patient with Me']. She liked--there was one, this came later, I think, but, "I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody about somebody who could save anybody" ['I'm Just a Nobody'], that was a favorite. There was just kind of like gospel standards that they played. Then we're kind of separated from kind of urban centers, so you don't get a lot of the new songs so you're very much leaning on the standards, the old, the old hymns, and so that's what they sang.
Story_ID: 669090
Speaker 1: What subjects are you attracted to in school then? In the, in the, in the--
Speaker 2: Hm. I liked, I liked English because I like writing; I liked history. I am--I was not a great math student and, and people think that because I use numbers in this column [at The New York Times]. (Shakes head) I was not a math student, I didn't like it. I did it--well now there were some, you know, algebra is, is elegant and so I liked it, but some of the other subjects I didn't like so much. Science was int- was--I liked a lot actually, because I found myself inventive. And whenever they let us do experiments, I, I loved that and I could come up with great experiments to do.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: I have to sneeze.
Speaker 1: Oh, sorry. You got to sneeze.
Speaker 2: (Sneezes) Sorry.
Speaker 1: You know, that's interesting about the science part because until--we interviewed 211 of the nation's top scientists, and I had worked primarily with--I mean, my background was in the arts, and I--that's the whole thing, they talk about creativity and discovery, and I never thought of science in that way because it was all overwhelming to me.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So math and science was all like a foreign territory--
Story_ID: 669091
Speaker 1: I know that you spoke of, of you know, a lot of coming of age--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, as a young black male--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and had--who had this experience with abuse and then a lot of issues around identity--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] is a coming of age memoir.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It ostensibly stops when I'm twenty-one years old--
Speaker 1: Right. Right.
Speaker 2: --as the last six pages try to bridge the gap--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --between twenty-one and forty-four.
Speaker 1: That's right. But I'm talking about, can you talk about that period of time as sort of--'cause you've had this abuse experience--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so you're trying to figure out--
Speaker 2: You, you--talk about the period of time of, of the, up to twenty-one?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean, not twenty-one, I'm talking about from like seven to, I don't know, fourteen or something like that. So you're--you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, there's a--you know, trying to figure out where I fit in the world and putting my foot into different parts of the world. I--one, one of the, I think, the beauties of being able to tell this story, which I think probably exists in most stories, is that even small communities, just--they're very complex and there are a lot of different kinds of characters, and particularly, wanting to be able to, to explore the black male experience and, and to illustrate and fully form people in all of their splendid variation. And there are heroes and there are villains and there are layabouts and there are hard workers and there are, you know, all kinds of people, and so I was--I tried to fit in with a number of different kinds--groups of people in the community [in Gibsland, Louisiana]. And I just couldn't quite find where I felt most comfortable, and I eventually just started to be more alone, which probably is not good for a kid who's already suffering from what I retrospectively look at and think is probably a depression, a depressive episode. But for me, it was, it was the only way that I could save myself, is to find a space away from people where I could just have no social pressure, and I could daydream and I could, you know, draw my portraits, and I could think big thoughts and it was actually therapeutic for me.
Speaker 1: So what were you daydreaming about? What were your portraits of? You know, can you--
Speaker 2: I drew--I drew portraits of people. I, I, I--you know, subconsciously, maybe I was populating my world with people because there weren't many real people who I felt very close to, so I drew portraits of people. They weren't people that I knew, it was--I'd start with eyes and I'd, you know, work my way down and there would be a portrait of some person who I didn't know.
Story_ID: 669092
Speaker 1: And, you know, I--a lot of that time was spent in a house across--that was right across the street from our--the house that we were living in, and it was on our property, and my [maternal] great-grandfather had rented that house before he died. And he rented it to a young couple that had two kids and one day the--all, all the neighborhood kids had gone to play on a pond, and the boat they were in capsized and everybody else was saved, but those--both those siblings drowned. And soon after that, their parents moved out of that house; I mean, it's hard to stay in a house where you're remembering things, and they seemed to leave quite a few things. I mean, it--there were dishes everywhere, there were--you know, it looked, it looked lived in, but there were no windows, the doors didn't shut. It was falling in on itself, but it--there was something romantic about it to me and it was a--it seemed perfect; it seemed like the perfect hideaway. It seemed like a house and I describe myself as, you know, I was the dead kid who came home because I kept thinking to myself as having died after the--after that abusive experience, and that--and everything that, that I was experiencing was because dead boys could not do those things. That if I couldn't cry it's because dead boys forget how to cry; if I couldn't be with other people because dead boys don't necessarily know how to relate to other people, and that I was kind of both literally and spiritually apart from the world.
Speaker 2: You know, and you think about this, you know, of how that--the--those whatever period of time had this--I mean, really in some--I don't want to say took away your childhood in some respects, but it profoundly impacted.
Speaker 1: It impacted I--is the--I think is the right way to say it. You know, when I look at it now, I think that there are a lot of gifts in the ashes is what--is the way I described it. Is that it, it, it provides--it, it takes a lot, but life--because life is irrepressible, it gives as much as it takes. And it gave me a tremendous gift, the ability to read people very quickly, because it became a defensive mechanism. I had to be able to know that this person had no ill intent, and I had to be able to judge it very quickly. I had to be able to read people enough to know that the facade that I was putting up that I wasn't hurt or depressed, was working, and if I did--if it wasn't working, I need to calibrate it. I--all of that ability works very well in a journalism career (laughter). You're able to sniff things out; you're able to read discomfort in people much--very easily. And it makes--you know, and having to create a new self requires a tremendous amount of creativity, and I think it, in a way, it made me a, a very creative human being because I had a lot of practice.
Speaker 2: Thinking and creating?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 669093
Speaker 1: --You also have attraction to girls as a young--
Speaker 2: I think the, the, the, the primary attraction--
Speaker 1: Was, was to girls?
Speaker 2: Yes, is to girls. And whatever--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way. That's--
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes. But no, it's fine. And whatever attraction I--kind of same sex attraction I had seemed to be somewhat ephemeral. It seemed to be--it seemed to not gel in the same way that the, that the--my attraction to girls could gel; that, that I both could fall in love and make love, it, it, it made complete sense to me, and I couldn't figure out what the other attraction meant and how it would, how it would manifest and how it should be exercised, if it should be exercised.
Speaker 1: And so talk about Evelyn, then.
Speaker 2: So Evelyn was--
Speaker 1: And what, and what--that's in--you are in high school [Gibsland-Coleman High School, Gibsland, Louisiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm in high school, yes. We're in high school. So she, she--
Speaker 1: You're like, is it--are you--
Speaker 2: I probably am fifteen, sixteen, somewhere in there when she comes back to--she has family in Gibsland [Louisiana], and she comes back to live with--between her grandmother and her aunt. I'm not exactly sure which was the permanent residence, but she floated between these two houses and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so this--1985, '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's where--that's where it would've been. And, you know, I just knew her as a, as a, as a friend. She dated another friend of ours and he was one year older than us, and she was a great basketball player, that's how everybody knew her. And, and she was really funny and really cool. And when we became seniors, her boyfriend had moved--had graduated and got into trouble and gone to prison. And she made it clear that she was interested in seeing me, and it was out of the blue, and I didn't know what to make of it, but, you know, I'm a se- at that point seventeen year old boy; seventeen year old boys don't think about anything. So she's making overtures, and I am incredibly receptive to the overtures because I don't know how to make overtures myself. And, eventually, you know, we are intimate, and--but we use--take no precautions, use no--there's, there's--it's not safe sex, there's no contraception used on my end for sure, I didn't think on her end either. She didn't say anything about it and neither did I, and shortly thereafter, she says that she's pregnant. She doesn't say, "You are the father of my baby." She never says this. I just assumed that why--that you're telling me because we had sex and you are pregnant and that means that I am the father of your kid. And she said nothing to disabuse me of that notion, and so I just start to assume that that's the way it is and we operate as if that's the way it is. And she has a baby and she even gives, gives the baby the name that I suggested. And, you know, I tell my mom [Freddie Mae Blow] and my mom's like, you know, she--first she says, "Is it yours?" And she--and I say, "Yes," and I realize at that moment that I never asked.
Story_ID: 669094
Speaker 1: When she has the baby, I go to my mom's [Freddie Mae Blow]--my mom's a teacher at the high school [Gibsland-Coleman High School, Gibsland, Louisiana], so I go into my mom's classroom to say, "Oh, Evelyn just had the baby," and she's--she never stops, she's cleaning up because it was one of her off hours. She says--and she's sweeping or something, she says, "You know that's not your baby, right?" And I just said, "What?" And I didn't say anything, I just walked out. And I just keep trying to buy things, and I didn't have much money, you know, we didn't have--you know, I cut yards and things to make money. I didn't have a job, but I would buy whatever I could afford, so I bought like diapers and, you know, whatever I could afford to buy. And I was visiting once and my cousin came in, who was a friend of hers, and, you know, we--me and this cousin, we weren't really tight, but she says something that changes everything. She says, "You know Charles [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow], this baby doesn't look anything like you." And it--I don't know, it just--I never thought about it, I never thought about asking her if I was the father of the kid, I never thought about counting the months from the time that we had had intercourse to the time that the baby was born, nothing. And even when my mom was saying, "You know that's not your kid," I just kept thinking, oh, my mom's disappointed and that's the reason that she's saying this. And in that moment, I'm holding this baby, and I realize in my bones I feel I am holding someone else's kid. And I didn't say anything about it, and, you know, I finished the visit and I left. And I went home and I started doing math. And I started looking--we--you know, we didn't have Google back then, but we had encyclopedias, so I'm looking up, you know, gestation periods and I'm just trying to figure out like, "Wait, if it's, if it's really short then it's--like how much can the baby weigh?" And I'm just, you know, nothing's adding up to me. And within a week or two, she leaves and doesn't leave any record. She leaves no telephone number, she--nothing. No way to trace her, no way to know where she's going, and, and then everyone starts to say, "You knew that wasn't your baby, right?" And I, and I just felt so--I don't know, I just felt like, well, why didn't you guys say something? I don't know, I felt really embarrassed, I guess, is the way to think of it. And it's sad because actually, at that point, I had wanted it to be my kid. I had thought of it for so many months and I had grown so attached to the little girl that I thought I actually now want this to be my kid and it's not. But it was to me, like another kind of betrayal, but a--in a way, I don't know. I don't want to rank them, but in a way, in a different way, a harder betrayal because you know, how are you supposed to fall out of love with something or someone?
Speaker 2: Right. And your--were you getting yourself psychologically ready to be the father and--
Speaker 1: I had completely given myself over to this idea, okay. Completely. And I, I had stopped beating myself up about being irresponsible about it; I had, I had, I had--it was part of who I was going to be.
Story_ID: 669095
Speaker 1: So now college, let's talk about college.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, you know, when the thought or when the discussion--now, what about your brothers and their academics?
Speaker 2: So all of my brothers went to Grambling State University [Grambling, Louisiana] except one. The brother who grew up with my [maternal] grandmother in Arkansas went to school in Arkansas. And I don't know--forget the name of the Arkansas school; he went to school at one of the public universities in Arkansas. But all of the rest of them went to Grambling, my mother [Freddie Mae Blow] had gone to Grambling, Grambling is where you went. So I didn't really necessarily want to go there because I kind of wanted to run away.
Speaker 1: You wanted to spread your wings.
Speaker 2: I wanted to get away, and--but because I had thought, you know, that I was a father of a kid who was going to be in Gibsland [Louisiana], I thought I should stay close, and part--that, in addition to them offering me academic scholarship, seemed to make all the sense in the world to just stay close, and so I accepted an offer to stay at Grambling, and accepted an academic scholarship.
Story_ID: 669096
Speaker 1: Now, you know, before we also get to that experience, you talked also about meeting the governor of Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was in eleventh grade [at Gibsland-Coleman High School, Gibsland, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Right, eleventh grade. And that--how that, you know, affected you; can you talk about that so--
Speaker 2: Yes. So we had gone to, it's called the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership summit [HOBY State Leadership Seminar], and they have these things apparently, all of the country. And Hugh O'Brian, I think, became famous for playing Wyatt Earp on TV ['The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'], and he had a big interest in kind of youth leadership and he started--he, he or his foundation or whomever started these conferences. And so what the--the conference would gather together one or two representatives from each school; schools would nominate someone who they thought was the best, brightest, most--kid with the most leadership potential, and you would go to be your school's representative at the summit. That year, it was held in Shreveport [Louisiana] near--in a, in a hotel right next to the airport [Shreveport Regional Airport]. And so there's a ballroom, and we'd come into this space every morning and they'd make us say--it felt cultish to me, it was like, "To be enthusiastic, you must act enthusiastic." We said that like 5 million times. And so you just kept saying this all day long whenever they'd want you to say something, "To be enthusiastic, you must act enthusiastic." And so one of the--they took us around to see business leaders, and they took us to, you know, a television station and, you know, all these places we--that they took us so we could see what business leaders were doing in the community. And one of the trips was to go south to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] to visit the Governor's Mansion [Louisiana Governor's Mansion]. And so we drove down and--on buses, and we filed into one of the receiving rooms in the Governor's Mansion and in strolls Governor Edwin Edwards. And he is--you know, he's not a big man, but the ego is--was, at that point, enormous. He filled the entire room. He didn't have to say anything. And, and that--all that day they had been telling us about all of the, you know, the wild Louisiana governors and Earl Long [Earl K. Long] and his, and his brother [George S. Long], Earl--what is the other Long?
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: I forget the other Long's name, and, you know, which one got shot [Huey Long]? And here's the--where the bullet went into the wall, and this one's, you know, wife [Blanche Revere Long] committed him to an insane asylum while he was still the governor and he got back out. And, you know, it was just--it just seemed so larger than life and I just thought--and I met the governor and I was saying, "These guys are having a ball down here. I want to be the governor," and that's--in that moment, I said, "This is what I want to do. I want to be a politician. And I don't want to just be a politician. I want to be the governor of Louisiana."
Story_ID: 669097
Speaker 1: So now, the, the other thing is that you graduate valedictorian?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so were your grades, when did they start being consistently high grades?
Speaker 2: The--when Mrs. Thomas [ph.] gave me that math test in fourth grade.
Speaker 1: And that was the--
Speaker 2: And from that point on, I was the--that had the best grades in my class.
Speaker 1: So you talked about the fact that it was a nurturing environment?
Speaker 2: It was, it was the most nurturing environment. It was a small school [Gibsland Elementary School, Gibsland, Louisiana], the teachers were--they seemed to me generally older than the schools of the, of the school where I had been [Ringgold Elementary School, Ringgold, Louisiana]. That the, the legacy of it having been this black college [Coleman College, Gibsland, Louisiana] was drilled into us over and over and over again. There was a way that kids at Gibsland-Coleman [Gibsland-Coleman High School, Gibsland, Louisiana] walked and the way they dressed and you--it was, you know, not because you had a lot of money, but you--there was a way that you comported yourself. And, you know, there was all these old pictures around from, you know, seventy years ago of people sitting up straight, and they're all black, and they are--there's these Victorian dormitories and it's just--it made you feel like you, you know, you weren't starting from scratch, that you are the extension of something. And all of that was kind of, kind of drilled into us and you, you became part of a lineage, in a way. And, and everything about the school to me was different, the, the, the cafeteria, the cooks were the people in the neighborhood and they were good cooks, so you couldn't wait to go to eat lunch, and that was very different from the other school that I had been to. And you knew everyone and they all knew you and they all know your parents and they had, you know your parents had had some of them as teachers. And it was just one of those things where you felt like you were not just going to school; you were actually going to some preparatory situation where it was part--an extension of your family. It was an extension--the--they went to the same church as you, you saw them on the weekends. It was, it was a whole wraparound experience.
Story_ID: 669098
Speaker 1: So when you go to Grambling [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and you go--you want to go someplace else, but your mother [Freddie Mae Blow]--
Speaker 2: She, she doesn't--she's not happy about this idea that I want to go anywhere else. She can't see me at the--I, I don't think you--you know, Betty Wright has, you know, in, in the lead up to, to 'Tonight is the Night,' she says, "I'm the youngest child," I was a really big fan once, "and you never grow up to your mother." You never grow up to your mother. I'm forty-four years old, and I still have not grown up to my mother. So she, she still saw me then as her baby, and she just couldn't imagine that I would be too far that she couldn't jump in a car and come to save me from whatever she thought she was gonna have to save me from.
Speaker 1: So when you, when you went to Grambling, though, you decide, you decide, okay, I'll go, and you get money--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right? And so is that environment a continuation of your high school environment [at Gibsland-Coleman High School, Gibsland, Louisiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It feels somewhat contiguous, but it's different because Grambling, at--particularly at that time, I don't know about now, but it drew a lot of, of kids from the Great Migration. So people who had grown up in the South, they were sending kids back. So these were kids who grew up in California, or Detroit [Michigan], or, or wherever, and so it was--it, it felt very diverse geographically. So it didn't feel like the--you know, the southern--the central southerness that I remembered from Gibsland [Louisiana]. It was different than that and they were bringing a lot of experiences that were not familiar to me at all. And also, it was the challenge, I think, to, to--it challenged me to think more broadly about what the African American experience is and was because it was not central and southern, it was, it was all over the United States, and, and, and those experiences were very different from what I was experiencing. And, you know, some kids were showing up, you know, they may as well have had PS- PTSD [posttraumatic stress disorder] because they had been in areas where there were tremendous amount of gun--gang violence. And, you know, they didn't have blue or red shirts because you couldn't wear blue or red where they grew up. And, you know, it was, it was very strange for me in a way, but it really made me stretch this concept of what, what identity was, in terms of, of racial identity, and also, what social justice was because they were bringing to me concepts of justice that I had not had to confront.
Speaker 1: And so concepts of justice?
Speaker 2: Well, I think just, you know, the idea of, of, of aggressive policing, it's not--that's not something that I would have any--
Speaker 1: Knowledge.
Speaker 2: --knowledge of. The, the, the, the concept of, of, of the gangs and the, the drug apparatus being able to lure people into their way of thinking, or coerced them into their way of thinking, or you feel like you have no choice but to join, and that becomes part of the, the slippery slope to kind of prison and being off the rails. I didn't know anything about that, that wasn't my experience. And so I'm having to think more broadly about what are the experiences of people who are my same age and what are they going through across the country?
Story_ID: 669099
Speaker 1: So it's the meeting, and then you're meeting people--you hadn't really not been around so much city people either had you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, never.
Speaker 1: That's the--
Speaker 2: No. I mean, the, the, the biggest city we ever went to was Houston [Texas] and we were on the outskirts of Houston, so we never--I never saw their--many other kids.
Speaker 1: You don't even have a southern accent. Did you ever have one?
Speaker 2: Yes, of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--but I--there was--so I, I spent a lot of time erasing everything, right? So when I, I won my way to the International Science Fair [International Science and Engineering Fair; Intel International Science and Engineering Fair], and I checked out every single book on etiquette at the local library, which wasn't a lot because our local library wasn't very big. But I checked out every book and I read it back to front so I would know what--if some food dropped on the floor, I would know what to do, and which fork to pick up and everything. And when I was--I was a mass communications major at Grambling [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], and one year I show up to the wrong class by mistake, and it was a broadca- broadcast class, and I knew, I was like, I can't get up and leave because I'm in the back of the class, so I'll just wait it out. And one of the things she said the very first day was, "News anchors sound like they could be from anywhere and everywhere. You shouldn't be able to peg where they're from." And from that point on, I never went back to the class 'cause that wasn't my class, but I would watch the news, and I would repeat the way they were saying it right after they said whatever they said, so that I could get the way they were saying it and not the accent the way that I said it. So I would train myself out of the accent.
Speaker 1: So this was all very conscious?
Speaker 2: It was very conscious.
Speaker 1: And do you ever slip back into it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, the--if my mom [Freddie Mae Blow] called, my brothers called, you wouldn't quite understand what I'm saying.
Story_ID: 669100
Speaker 1: So talk about what else Grambling [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] means to you, you know, what the experience--who was mentoring you? You know, Grambling is very well known for its, its--
Speaker 2: It's the football and then bands and things like that. But as soon as I get there, I, I didn't want to be a nobody again; I had spent enough time doing that. So I, I had always been president of my class and president of all the clubs in high school [Gibsland-Coleman High School, Gibsland, Louisiana], so I figured I'd just do that when I went to school so I became--ran for freshman class president and I became freshman class president. I was elected. And immediately, the other class presidents, we all had to do this kind of ceremonial thing where we'd escort the queens of each class into the games every home football game and escort them up to the boxes where all the donors were so they could see all the bright and beautiful Grambling kids; the ones, you know, who had won office, and they would be more likely to get money, I guess, I don't know what it was for. But all of the other presidents wanted to pledge a fraternity, and I was like I don't even know what this is. I have no concept of that. But they were so adamant that that's what you did, that's what you had to do, so I said, "Okay, fine. If this--if--you guys are smart, you've been elected to class office, if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me." And so I tried and was accepted to join a fraternity.
Speaker 1: And can you talk about that experience?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, it's a brutal experience. There's a, there's a tremendous amount of hazing involved in it, and, which was a shock to me. We, we were told before we were accepted to the fraternity that there was going to be hazing. I don't think you can quite prepare yourself for how barbaric it is, and--but you are kind of groomed to, to accept it, not only accept it, but to un- to agree with it as something that is necessary to build bonds between young people. And I think a lot of young people fall victim to that sort of thinking, in part, it's because it actually works. It's a group trauma and people who are traumatized as a group will in fact bind themselves to each other. But I, I have seen--you know, I'm old enough to have seen so many people be able to make lasting meaningful relationships that have nothing to do with trauma that I know that, now, how kind of ridiculous and wrong that is and how dangerous it was and how--because it's completely unsupervised. And of the people who were seriously injured or died doing it that I knew of, many of them had--basically, just had un- undiagnosed or undisclosed medical conditions and because no one knew that you were doing it, no one even knew to--that you should get some sort of physical before you started it. It's, you know, so I think, you know, I treat this subject soberly in the, in the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] because I think it should be treated soberly. I think some people are--you--are very flippant about it, say, "Oh this is kind of a crime with no victims because people submit to it and everybody knows that, that they're--what they're getting into when they get into it." But I think differently, in, in the sense that, you know, what does it say that our best and brightest are being this cruel to each other and what kind of psychological scars did that leave on people; both the people who are subjected to it and the ones who were doing it? You have to kind of get over a bit of yourself every time you are cruel to another human being and that can't be healthy as a society.
Story_ID: 669101
Speaker 1: But you went into leadership at the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --after you went over the line, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Right.
Speaker 1: --you actually--
Speaker 2: Right. It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't like something I pursued, but like, I--you know, I, I'm sitting in a corner, literally on the floor sitting in a corner, and, and someone nominates me to be the president of the group, and I literally just become a member of the group. I have no idea what it's about, don't know what to do, and they vote yes, and I had to now figure out what, what am I doing? How am I supposed to do this? And how do I--you know, part of the leadership role is actually to prevent people from getting hurt, so part of your job is to put on the brakes for the people who--for whom some of them, there are no brakes. They don't even sense that, you know, that something becomes lost in them and you have to pull them back from that. But, but even seeing something be lost in a, in a, in a boy, a young man is a, is a disturbing thing because you think how--what is--what's happening? This is no longer about cohesion, this is not about helping them to become close to each other. This is something--there's something damaged about you that, that you want to do--be this cruel to another person, and you see enough of that and I--eventually, I just had to quit. I, I had to say, "I can't do it. I can't be the president anymore because I can't do this anymore."
Speaker 1: So what--was that the--typically the case? I would think that upperclassmen would be--
Speaker 2: No, it's always upperclassmen. They--there's--there are a few people, what they call neophytes, presidents, and I was one, and there were very few of us. And, and every time I'd meet someone else who said they were the neophyte president, I--there's like, you know--
Speaker 1: But is it that they saw something in you or they--that's what I--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think--
Speaker 1: Did they have a gap in leadership? That's what I didn't under--
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I think it was--I don't think it was a gap in leadership, I think that they genuinely saw something in me and because there was the group of people I pledged with, there were so many of us and they all voted as a bloc, and that meant that they could outvote anyone else, so everybody else split their votes between the people they liked and they all voted for my, my line brothers voted for me then I won. But I, you know, I had also been president of, you know, my class since I was sixth grade, I was president of the freshman class [at Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], and when I was on line, I became--I was reelected while pledging to be president of the sophomore class, so this idea of leadership was part of how they had defined me; and as a pledge, I was rather resilient, and all of that, I think combined to--for them to think that I would be good at this. And also, I wasn't, I wasn't a party person so you--if other people wanted to have a lot of fun, they needed somebody sober to, to conduct the business and that was me.
Story_ID: 669102
Speaker 1: Tell me about the journalism department [Grambling State University Department of Mass Communication, Grambling, Louisiana]. Well, you started as English right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then--so what was the switch to journalism?
Speaker 2: So, I, I, you know, pulling one of those all nighters when you have an assignment and you don't do it, you can't--you don't know what you're supposed to write. And, and so it's the night before, it's a freshman writing class and it's one of these big kind of auditorium classes, two hundred or three hundred people in it, and they--the assignment is to write a personal experience and I have no idea what to write. So I just say, "Okay, what can I think of?" And I said, "Oh, my bap- the day I got baptized, I'll write that." And I stay up, and we had--there were no computers, or at least I didn't have one, so we had typewriters, and we had, we had--I had a computer at home, but like we didn't use them to--
Speaker 1: To pa--
Speaker 2: --to do papers, you didn't use--you still used--I still used a typewriter. And so I'm up from my typewriter, my whiteout and my NoDoz and my Dr. Pepper, and I am burning through the night writing, writing, writing, writing, writing, the sun comes up, I don't even proofread it. I--it's, it's probably littered with errors, I have no idea, I just snatched the last page out of the typewriter and run to class, turn it in. And then a couple of weeks later, the professor gives back the, the papers, 'cause it takes a while to grade two hundred or three hundred papers, and he says, "There's one paper that really stood out, and I'd like to read it to you." And I'm just chitchatting with whoever's next to me, and I--he starts reading it and I realize he's reading my paper. And everybody stops and they listen, and when he's finished, everyone applauds. And he says, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow], I'd like to see you after class," and he's the, he's the English professor. And he starts to ask me all these questions about, "So what are you gonna do with your life?" And, "What are you--with this English major?" And I said, "I'm gonna--I want to be a lawyer, and then I want to become a politician." And he said, "So what if you don't go to law school, what are you gonna do with this English degree?" And I don't think he really liked his job. So he said, "You want to be a professor?" You know, and I said, "I don't think so." He says, "Well, why don't you, instead of majoring in English, major in journalism, that way at least you'll have a trade; you'll still get a chance to write, a lot of the classes overlap." It just made sense to me. I'm a kid, you know, I'm eighteen years old, freshman, so I said, "Fine." And I changed my major to journalism, mass comm [mass communication] is what they called it, and, and I kept the pre-law double major on- only I never really took many classes in the pre-law, and by the time we--time that I could graduate in--with the mass comm major, I was like, "I'm out of here. There's no way I'm gonna stay and finish this pre-law degree." And so I was a journalist.
Story_ID: 669103
Speaker 1: Just one other thing though. You--while you're there [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], you were editor in chief of the student newspaper [The Gramblinite] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you--now what about your student magazine, The Razz [ph.]?
Speaker 2: So I, I did--I started that and it started with me and it ended with me.
Speaker 1: But what, what was its approach versus, you know, the student newspaper? What was, what was, what was different about that or--
Speaker 2: It was lifestyle. It was, it was, it was what was cool on campus. And I was gonna gather together all the cool kids and interview all of them and all the people--the singers, and the athletes, and, and I--my brother took some of the pictures, he's a photographer, so we did, we did modeling spreads. I really wanted it to be like GQ, that's what, in my mind, that's what it was; it wasn't, of course, but in my mind, that's what it was.
Story_ID: 669104
Speaker 1: Now, you know, Charles [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow], I want to know because this is the late '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, and I--what is--who are--what music are you listening to? You know, who are you influenced by? What, what in sort of popular culture is striking? I just want to--
Speaker 2: So, so musically, this, this is a time when you have the conscious rap, so you have--hip hop is big, right? So this is--so you have the, the conscious guys and that's--
Speaker 1: Common.
Speaker 2: --Public Enemy, not Common yet.
Speaker 1: Not Common yet.
Speaker 2: But, but Public Enemy, De La Soul. You also have West Coast rap, which is kind of gangsta rap, so it's a lot of anti-police songs and gang songs and a lot of profanity. You--we have--there's also what probably is becoming neo soul because it's, it's Anita Baker and Sade and--but we didn't call it neo soul back then, but it was a different kind of soul music from our parents' soul music, very jazzy. Actually, I went to school [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] with Erykah Badu, who they say is the queen of neo soul, but we were all influenced by this music that's happening around this. And movie wise, you know, 'The Color Purple' comes out right as I'm going to college, I think, or maybe the first year I'm in college. 'School Daze,' all the Spike Lee movies are huge when I'm in college. So 'School Daze,' 'Do the Right Thing'--'School Daze' is when I'm in school; 'Do the Right Thing' may be a few--late in my college career or slightly afterwards, but, but he is a phenomenon. 'Boyz n the Hood' and Singleton [John Singleton], they are all like these young mov- black movie directors making--kind of documenting our lives and showing it back to us on the screen, and so all of this is the swirl of pop culture that we're in.
Speaker 1: So what, what are, what are the things that you gener- what, what are you, at that point? I mean, what generation are you? Are you X [generation X]?
Speaker 2: I think I'm--
Speaker 1: Are you--
Speaker 2: Am I X? I don't know if I'm X.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I'm X. X sounds so familiar.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter). Okay. But what is your gen--what are you thinking of? You know, is the--
Speaker 2: Meaning--
Speaker 1: --is, is it a time of hope? You know, what are you--
Speaker 2: It's not, it's not--it, it, it feels--the--things feel fragile in the sense that it feels there is a lot of--kind of public consciousness is happening. You're leading up to the Million Man March, the Rodney King beating happens during that time, and the riots that follow happened around '91 [1991]; I, I don't graduate 'til '92 [1992], I think it's '91 [1991], '92 [1992], somewhere in there. Things feel kind of fragile and volatile in this time. I remember the Nation of Inla- Islam [Nation of Islam] used to come to campus and have meetings on campus. It's--it really does feel like there is a resistance and that, and that there are people who are deciding to be part of some sort of resistance, though, it's not taking any sort of shape.
Story_ID: 669105
Speaker 1: The other thing I, I, I had missed, though, was--and I was getting ready to ask what you were doing summers, you know, while you were in college [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana]. So you actually interned one summer?
Speaker 2: So the first summer, I am--it's right after I have pledged the fraternity, I'm exhausted, I sleep pretty much for three months.
Speaker 1: But do you go back home or you--
Speaker 2: I go to my mom's house and I go to sleep and I wake up and it's time to go back to school, pretty much, that's the way I remember it. And the next summer I work--help my brother to, to--next oldest brother, Douglas [Douglas Blow], he's reroofing houses. He's a really good handyman and so we reroof houses all summer. And, you know, and I go to juke joints 'cause I can do that back then, you'd go, you have to only be eighteen years old and my brother deejays in addition to roo- he does everything. And so I'd go to these juke joints--I still go--I will go to a dive in the city be- and people will be shocked that I'm in the dive, and I think, I grew up in juke joints. Like, it's literally like the place in 'The Color Purple' where there's rain coming through the ceiling, that's kind of where we were. The drinks are in mason jars not because it's cute and cool, that's because that's what they had, so I grew up like that and that feels very authentic to me. So I did that and towards the third year, I--or maybe it's--I think it's the third summer, I'm starting to realize, okay, you actually have to do an actual internship; you can't sleep your summers away, you can't put roofs on houses, you have to have something on a resume. I think I'm gonna go to CIA [Central Intelligence Agency]. That does not end well and I'm not going to go to the CIA, and they were really interested and then they were not interested at all. And I say, okay, I'm gonna have to do this journalism thing for real. This is actually my major. And I begged the Shreveport Times to give me an internship, and I pestered them. They said they didn't have one, they couldn't do it, and I, for months, I stayed on them until they just said they'll give me an internship. And I took that internship and I realized that I had--you know, this is early--late eighty- no, this is early '90s [1990s], maybe 1990 or so, and I'm realizing I have a set of skills that are becoming in vogue in print journalism. There--every--USA Today has been born and they have all these charts and kind of visual journalism that they're doing, and Time magazine, and Nigel Holmes adopts, I think--I don't know if Nigel starts first or, or USA Today starts first with this approach, but Time magazine and USA Today are both doing these really kind of whimsical art driven display things with data information. And, and then everyone picks up on it, even The New York Times picks up on it; there were like these little things in the corners that were data driven. And I realize I have the perfect two skills for this, I, I'm artistic by nature and I am being trained to be a journalist, and I can put these two things together and I can really do this in a way that not many other people can. And it's kind of a fluky thing, and--but immediately, it becomes clear to me that out, both in that newsroom and even when I go to job fairs among all the other applicants because I have both these skills.
Speaker 1: But you also have a, a huge persistence ability. You are--you know, 'cause it--you, you are willing to do whatever it takes to get a job or to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now where does that come from?
Speaker 2: Part of it is watching my mom [Freddie Mae Blow], like her scraping and scratching and like never giving up and always--
Speaker 1: Did your brothers have that same thing?
Speaker 2: I think that--I mean, they're all, they're all like really hard workers, and I--they didn't--I don't--they didn't pursue careers that were in kind of the creative fields as much as I did. My one brother's an accountant, and one's a teacher, and, you know, so they set their eyes on a job and they got the job and they're happy with the jobs that they have and I think they work hard at those jobs. But for me, I had always, you know, I--flipping through encyclopedias, I kept--you know, I was seeing things that I kept thinking, this is out in the world somewhere. I don't know where it is, but it's out there somewhere and I have to go find it. And so for me, there was nothing to lose, in a way. It really, it really wasn't even taking a chance because what's the worst that could happen, I come back here? I've been here, so what. If I gamble it all, the wor- the best that could happen is that it works, and the worst that could happen is that I come back to this place. And so I, I consistently just gamble it all and I take risks and just assume that it--why not?
Story_ID: 669106
Speaker 1: So you were part of the--you had an internship here at the Times though (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that was your--that's what--
Speaker 2: That was--so I first interned at the, at the Shreveport Times, and I--they liked what I did there and they offered me a part time job, so it was two or three days a week, I forget, forget what it was. And it was a full shift, though, so from one 'til nine [o'clock]. So I would have to do my classwork 'til noon, drive sixty minutes from Grambling [Louisiana] to Shreveport [Louisiana], and then do a full day's work, so I was exhausted. But I did that and one of the, the, the business editor kind of thought of himself as a mentor and he says, "You know, The New York Times is having this shop conference in Atlanta [Georgia] this weekend, you have to go." And I said, "There's no way I can go. I come over here, I'm working all these hours, I can barely get my homework done as it is and study for tests. I can't go away." He says, "No, you're going away because you have to go." So I begged one of my friends whose girlfriend has graduated and moved to Atlanta, I was like, "Can you--can we just drive there together? I have no money to get a hotel. Can we drive there together, and I'll sleep on the sofa and then I can go to this job conference?" And he says, "Yes, let's do it." And we drive and he drops me off at the job conference, and I walk in and there's a guard at the door, I don't know if it's an actual security guard, but he was watching the door, and says, "Well, you can't come in 'cause--because you had to preregister for the conference and you're not preregistered." And I said, "Well, what is preregister? What does that mean?" And he says, "Well, you had to pay a fee," you know, and I don't know what it was at the time, and you had to write an essay, you had to fill out this form. I said, "Give me the form. Give me a pencil." Got the form, I got a pencil and I sat down and I wrote an essay on the spot, I gave him whatever money he asked for, I said, "Now, I'm going into this job conference." And he said, "You know what? You go ahead." And I went in, and I had my little thing. I remember how I had it set up because we had those hard discs at the time. So I had a piece of--I, I, I thought I was so creative. And I had this piece of corrugated cardboard, and I cut out just enough space that the thing would stay in, and so it was pressed into the corrugated cardboard and that--and I made a book of my clips of my resumes, so it was like I had bindings and the corrugated cardboard, it looked very slick. They were heavy because I had a lot of them, but I'm dragging these things around and I'm giving them out. And everybody's very impressed that this kid has come and he has these discs and he has all this--these clips and he does this--he combines these two things that we've never seen combined before and he's just a kid. And I get to The New York Times booth and they say, "We can't interview you because you had to sign up ahead of time and our list is full." And I said, "That's fine. I, I understand. I'm just gonna sit here until someone doesn't show up." And this is early in the day, probably like eleven, twelve. I sit there until they break down, and this is like six or seven o'clock at night. I'm reading a newspaper over and over. I was reading the same story, but I'm pretending just to be engaged. I'm remembering all the etiquette cues that I've read in these books, and I'm sitting up straight, and I'm, you know, trying to communicate without having to say anything. And every time someone comes for an interview, I say hi to them and when they leave, I said, you know, "Good luck." And, and when they leave, I'm--they, they talk about who they just interviewed so I'm getting all this kind of opposition research 'cause I now know exactly what they want and what they don't like because they're saying it right in front of me, as if I'm not there. And when they're breaking down they eventually say, "Okay, we'll interview you. Fine. 'Cause you sat here all day." And I said, "Thank you." And I just launch into my thing, and using everything that I've learned all day from hearing them talk about other people. And when I'm finished they said, "You know, this is really impressive, but we don't have a graphics internship at The New York Times." And I said, "Okay, that's fine." And I leave the--you know, they had said this is very impressive so I'm walking on clouds, at that point, because The New York Times said I was very impressive. And I go home to my friend's house and come back the next day, 'cause the thing's, thing's over two days, and everywhere I go they said, "You know The New York Times is looking for you," the other newspapers keep saying this, "The New York Times is looking for you." Now, all I can think is that maybe I picked up a pen or something, or something I, you know, while I'm grabbing my things, I grabbed something that belonged to them and now they're like, "Get it back." And so I make my way back to their--to the desk and they say, you know, "We're really impressed with you and we did--but we did not have an internship, but last night we called back to New York [New York] and they made an internship just for you." And I became the first graphics intern at The New York Times.
Speaker 1: That's really pretty impressive.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 669107
Speaker 1: What was their internship program like, at that time?
Speaker 2: At that time, it was a minority internship program [at The New York Times]. They took a--I don't know how many kids, it didn't seem like many, probably under ten kids from across the country, and it was just kind of an introductory exposure sort of an internship. You know, we--you got to do a little work. They gave you a story too if you're a reporter; they gave me a few graphics things. They gave me a byline on my first day, which I thought was--I was really excited about because apparently, the graphics people didn't often get the bylines. But it was, it was like an eye opener. I, I remember coming--first my mom [Freddie Mae Blow]--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you really hadn't been north had you?
Speaker 2: No. No. I had never been to New York [New York]. I had nev- the farthest north I had ever been was to Virginia when I interviewed with the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and that was just, you know, just in and out. And so I arrive--my mom, being overprotective as she is, sends me with I don't know how many bags. I don't know--she'd never been anywhere either, so she doesn't know how I'm gonna get all this stuff to--we--you know, they told us to take the vans. I didn't know what--I was just following directions and I took the vans and they dropped us off at Grand Central [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York] and I have so many bags, I mean, it must be like seven things, like trunks and TVs and pots; I mean, it's craziness, and it's raining. And the guy just puts it on the sidewalk and he drives away, and I'm standing over seven bags thinking, how do I get to the corner? So I take each bag and I walk two steps and I put it down and I take the next bag and I do two steps; it must take me an hour to do this, to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 2: --to the corner to hail a cab. And I eventually find a cab that will actually take someone with seven bags in the rain. And he takes me to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], which is where we were staying, but Columbia's gated and the, the doorman's on the interior of the building. So he puts me out with seven bags outside the gate at Columbia, and I have to do this thing all over again in the rain where I took two step per bag. It takes forever for me to get all this stuff to a room, and all I can think of is, oh, my god, I got to do this to get back home.
Story_ID: 669108
Speaker 1: How long was the internship program [at The New York Times] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I don't know, it was a few weeks. I mean, I don't--I would, I would assume like eight weeks or something--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't know how long it was.
Speaker 1: But, but, but so are you exploring the city during this time and--
Speaker 2: We, we explored a little bit. You know, we have--there's a, a--there's a suite and there are three of us; one girl, two guys in the suite, and it's like three stories. And my--I'm already engaged by this point, so--and my soon to be wife is interning on Long Island [New York], so we spent a lot of time going back and forth, but it didn't even--I didn't have to explore it, I was just blown away. Like, the first time I come out of the, the subway--first of all, getting on the subway, there's a train that goes underground, it's crazy to me, like, I don't understand what's happening. And then I come out of the subway in Times Square [New York, New York] and there's just people everywhere. I just--I'm just stunned and I just, in that moment, I remember thinking, the world has been happening and I wasn't in it. Like, this is the world and it's moving really fast and I have been missing this whole thing. And--but we, you know, we explore the city, but we're--again, we don't know where we're going. We--you know, the people, "Go to the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York]." And we go, like, walk around and buy backpacks and like weird things because we don't have money and we also don't know where we are.
Story_ID: 669109
Speaker 1: You get married then, right?
Speaker 2: I--we go--
Speaker 1: You get--
Speaker 2: --back, I go back, we--the--I have another semester in school [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay. And then--
Speaker 2: And I leave and I go to work in Detroit [Michigan] for a--and then we get married after that, so that year.
Speaker 1: So you get married while you're working in The Detroit News?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: So now, what is your--what is Greta studying? Her name is Greta, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. She--well, that's not her--that--that's the name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --written in the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: But, she, she's a physics major.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so she was doing physics--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in--on Long Island [New York]?
Speaker 2: On Long Island.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so what happens then, you--so tell--talk about The Detroit News 'cause you, you make--your description even makes me laugh because Detroit was--
Speaker 2: Well, well, first I, I came to interview, it was winter and it's really pretty in the winter and I--you assume that all these buildings during the daytime have people in them, and then I show up and it's not--it's spring or what--no, I show up--it's not spring, it's--I show up, it's January, February, it's still winter, but it's daytime and I'm realizing this is completely abandoned so that was a shock first. And--but I just say, you know, it doesn't really matter. I'm just--I'm going to work and this is a really big--at that time, they were really good at information graphics, which is what I was doing, and my boss is an amazing person. He's--
Speaker 1: And what's his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Felix Grabowski; he's since died, but I mean, literally, one of the best bosses I've ever had and taught me everything--well, a lot of what I learned about how to be a boss, about hands off, give people time to be--space and time to be creative, support them in what they do, fight for them if you have to, you know, it was--he was great. And--but I, you know, I show up, I get an apartment. I don't know the lay of the land, all I know is I need to be close to work 'cause I'm gonna work all the time. And so I get an apartment, which is too expensive for me, but it's--looks really nice.
Speaker 1: And where's, where's it located?
Speaker 2: It's, it's on the river [Detroit River]. It's called River--Harbortown [Detroit, Michigan]. And I get the cheapest one in this really fancy place, so it's on the first floor and it's a one bedroom on the first floor. And--
Speaker 1: Had they developed the RiverWalk [Detroit RiverWalk] at that point?
Speaker 2: I don't think there was a--yes, the RiverWalk was down the street from me.
Speaker 1: It was done?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's the next development over.
Speaker 1: So this is--
Speaker 2: So Harbortown has this--the, the tall buildings.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when New York--Detroit is trying to really redevelop--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --itself?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, and I have nothing this--I mean, unlike coming to intern [at The New York Times], this time I have nothing. So I have a clock radio, no television. There's no furniture in the house, so I sleep on the floor. I have one pot, one pan, some silverware. And I sleep on the floor, I listen to the news on the clock radio and I just say, I really don't care because I'm gonna work. And so I--my--it's an evening paper, so I think my shift was 4:15 to 2:15, or something late, and--but the researchers came in early. And I said, "No, I want to know how to do your job and my job." So I said, "Can I watch you? I'll get you coffee, I'll go run some errands for you, whatever you want to do." So I worked their shift and my shift, and I worked one for free and I worked one for pay. And so, so that I could build up the rolodex, so that I could learn how--you know, how do you--how are they conducting the interviews? I want to hear the--hear them on the phone going through the process of the interview. And I did that and I started taking on more projects of my own. My only thing to my boss was, "If something happens, I want to go, go to the scene of where it's happening, and I want to report visually, the way people report crimes and stories." And he said, "Go for it." And so when something would happen, I'd listen to my radio in the morning, if I hear it, I said, "Carl [ph.]," I said, "hey, I'm going 'cause there's a fire on So and So, there's a, there's a standoff some- somewhere," and I would be gone. And he let me do that and they really got to trust me. And they, they had a Sunday review section, and they basically ran wire stories and I talked to the editor and I said, "Would you let me do large explanatory graphics about top- world topics on your cover?" And he says, "As many as you can do, I'll run." And I did everything. I, I--the UN [United Nations] became my best friend. I was calling every day because I had listened to them build up the rolodex, and I knew how to do the interviews, and, and I worked all the time. And, you know, my--and when my, my to be wife came, she's like, "Okay, I'm not sleeping on the floor," so we--that--we did go out and buy like a basic frame and a mattress and a sofa, but I was like, "I'm not worrying about this--like furniture. I'm going to work," and that's what I did is worked.
Story_ID: 669110
Speaker 1: At this point in time, I also--what is the newsroom you're coming into? Because this is the beginning of--I mean, the Internet has happened, and at this point, the Internet is viewed by news organizations somewhat as a marketing tool, you know, I mean they're actively--I think that's what's starting to happen--
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: --is it or is it a little later?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember the Internet.
Speaker 1: You don't?
Speaker 2: I don't remember it at all in, in Detroit [Michigan]. I re- the first I remember actually using the Internet (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Maybe it's a little later.
Speaker 2: --yes. As a, as a tool, as a journalism tool is when I got to The New York Times.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's probably--okay, that's--that may be. That's probably correct. Okay, that's probably correct. Yeah. So, so what, what else were you learning, though, you know, at the, The Detroit News? What, what else do you learn? Do you, you say you end up liking Detroit some.
Speaker 2: I, I, I loved the--I--actually, you know, Detroit's gritty, but it's re- you know, there's a, there's a soul in it.
Speaker 1: Do you call it--did--oh, you said gritty?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. I was gonna say you didn't say pretty?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said it's gritty, and it has soul, and they--you know, there would be like little galleries here, and yes, there was--you know, there was places where it--there was blight and there were empty buildings, but there was also just a resilience and people who love that city, and so I fell in love with it the way they fell in love with it. And--but it was just too cold for me, I just couldn't take it. It--those winters were--I only had one and a half, but that first one was so brutal, I just knew like I couldn't do it, there's no way.
Story_ID: 669111
Speaker 1: So then how do you then go about, you know, coming to The New York Times?
Speaker 2: The next winter was approaching and I knew I couldn't do another one and I sent out resumes to, you know--I don't know how I've--if there were message boards or something, I don't know how you knew when jobs were available.
Speaker 1: Now, would you--you know, a lot of people talk about NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] as their--
Speaker 2: I don't know--I don't recall that being the way that I found out these jobs were available, or if I even knew there were jobs available; I might've been sending out things blind, I just don't remember. But anyway, the, The Boston Globe, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The New York Times were all interested in having me come for interviews, and so I told each of them--
Speaker 1: That's not bad.
Speaker 2: Yes, it wasn't bad at the time. So I said, "Here's the deal, I'm coming in one weekend. You're gonna fly me here, and I'm gonna interview there, and I'm gonna--you're gonna fly me to the next interview, and I'm gonna interview there, and then you're gonna fly me back home." And they all agreed to do this. So I had one, whatever it was, weekend or whatever, and I went and did three interviews, one place flying me to the next interview knowing that I'm interviewing somewhere else, and all three of them offered me a job, and I said, but if they all three offer me a job, I'm going back to The Times. And I went back to The New York Times.
Speaker 1: So what is the--it's different then coming to The Times to work is different than coming to, you know, as an intern is different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. But, but, but, but by, but by this time, I feel, I feel very strong in my experience. You know, the--I think everyone needs to go somewhere that they can make a lot of mistakes and then get it out of their system, and I got a chance to do that, and they were trusting me to do--just anything that I could think of to do, they would let me do it, and, and support it and help me edit my way through it and work through it, journalistically. And so by the time I arrived back at The Times, I, I felt incredibly confident in my abilities to do this thing that I now believe that I had a special gift for doing. And so I was--you know, I came in and we, you know, we did, we did great work and I, I asked them the same thing, "Just make sure that if I, I want to do foreign, 'cause I like it, and I want to do metro because I--if something happens, I want to go." And--
Speaker 1: And you came in, in the graphics department?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay. And who's in that department? How large is the department at the time and--
Speaker 2: They're--I mean, I don't know exactly how many people, I'm gonna guess maybe twelve, and then there's the maps group that kind of reports to the graphics group and that's probably another twenty people, I don't know, or maybe fewer than that.
Speaker 1: How many, how many minorities?
Speaker 2: There is--there are two, three African American men and one Asian woman, as I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so when you--is there--who's in charge of the newspaper? I just want to, you know, I want--
Speaker 2: Joe, Joseph, Joe Lelyveld [Joseph Lelyveld].
Speaker 1: Lelyveld?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lelyveld.
Speaker 1: Okay. He was--now, how long was he in charge? Oh, you--
Speaker 2: A while. I mean, he--it was--he was in charge and then Howell [Howell Raines] became the executive editor, and then after Howell, there was a brief period where Joe came back, and then there was Keller [Bill Keller] and then, then Jill [Jill Abramson] and now--
Story_ID: 669112
Speaker 1: Now, when do you have your first child?
Speaker 2: When we're in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Oh, so you have your first child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yes. Not in Detroit--in Grosse Pointe [Michigan] because my ex-wife did not want her child to be born in Detroit. I don't know what that was all about, but she--so Grosse Pointe's the wealthy neighborhood right outside of the city limits of Detroit, so he's born in Grosse Pointe, she will remind you of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then the other two are--well, let's see, because one is--there, the first two are--how far--
Speaker 2: The, the, the, the old- the first one is born there and then three and a half years later, we have twins.
Speaker 1: Okay. So that's a lot, actually. So are you living--where are you living in, in New York [New York], when you--
Speaker 2: When we move here, we moved to Brooklyn [New York], and I have always lived in Brooklyn. We, we did temporary housing here in Manhattan [New York], but, but we actually moved into an apartment that we were paying for, it was in Brooklyn, it was in Prospect Heights, and then we bought a place in Park Slope [Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay. So at that point in time, I mean, because both of you have grown--did she grow up--where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: Shreveport [Louisiana], so forty minutes--
Speaker 1: She--
Speaker 2: --away from me, yes.
Speaker 1: So you both--okay, so--but this is--I mean, raising kids in a, you know, urban center much different than where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --you grew up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about just economically--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I'm talking about the whole process. And, and Brooklyn, at that time, how well developed is it at that--
Speaker 2: It's developing. It's not what it is now, of course, but, you know, we luck out and we get an apartment that's one block away from the park [Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York], it's right off Grand Army Plaza, you know, two or three blocks away from the train. It's very convenient, like we don't even feel--it feels very connected to the city, and it feels like, you know, you know, he, he--my oldest kid is, you know, he's playing in the park constantly, 'cause it's right there. So in a way, I mean, I always tell people that, that city life feels to me like rural life because it feels like a bunch of really small towns to me. Because you end up going to the same grocery store, the same drycleaners, the same every--so I know them in the same way that I would have known them if I lived in my little town in Gibsland [Louisiana]. So to me, it didn't seem that very disconnected (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Different.
Speaker 2: And because, you know, we were, we were really young when we have all these kids, and we're basically just staying home. There--I mean, they're--we're not going anywhere, we--you know, I, I work all the time, but I, but when I'm not working, I just go home. I remember friends coming and--'cause there--we're still in our twenties, and they would come and they don't have kids and they're not married and they're like, "Let's go out." And I would have to try to figure out where do you go out? I'm asking people at work [at The New York Times], like, "What, what is--what do you do when you go out? Like, where do you go?" 'Cause I had no clue.
Speaker 1: And was she working also or did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Well, I mean, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or until she had the twins?
Speaker 2: --she took time off for our kids, but yes, she worked. She, she did--she worked as a physics teacher in high school, and she did some work at a medical office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 669113
Speaker 1: You know, it appears in looking at your history here at The New York Times that it was somewhat of a meteoric rise, it appears.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--but I, you know, I, I'm told by others, you know, who are older than you who, you know, speak well, I mean, some have had good experience, some bad--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but that there's a Times way to do things, and that there is an indoctrination in some respects, was that any of your experience?
Speaker 2: That wasn't my experience, but, but again, I'm, I'm taking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On the graphics.
Speaker 2: But I'm also taking risks because I always tell myself, what's the worst that could happen? So, you know, when I--I'm only here a year and a half, I guess, and they get rid of the graphics--well, the graphic editor moves onto another desk or something, but they don't immediately name a new boss for us. And, you know, this is--this can be a shark tank, and so when you don't have a boss, there's no one to advocate for you, so we go months with this situation where people think they can just, you know, kind of walk all over you 'cause there's no boss over here. And one day I had had enough of it, and I'm all of twenty-four something years old, and I walked out to the newsroom and I walk up to Joe Lelyveld's [Joseph Lelyveld] office and I said, "I need to speak with Joe." Now, I don't even know how strange that is for people to do, I don't even know, I'm too young and stupid to know better. And his--Maxine [ph.] was his secretary at the time, she says, "He's not in right now, but I can pencil you in for, for an appointment." And I said, "Okay, fine, just whenever you can do it." And she writes it in and I walk away and I leave and I go home and I realize, oh, my god, what did you just do? You got to stop letting your temper get the best of you. Now, what are you gonna say when you actually have to go in and talk to this man? And so I built up the nerve, put on my best suit that, that day and I go in and I talk to him, and I say, you know, I tell him that's just--I'm very honest with him, I said, "Listen, we haven't had a boss in how many ever months, you would never let another desk go without a chief. I don't care who it is, but it needs to be someone because we need an advocate, and it is not fair to us to have us there without an advocate, and I think you know that and I know that." And he's just marveling at me. He--I don't even think he's actually processing what I'm saying, and I remember him saying, "You know, everybody here is scared to come to talk to me. I'm glad you came in." And then he said, "So what do you think we should have in a boss in your department?" And I said, "I," I said, "I actually have no idea, you know. I just got here." I'm like, you know, twenty-four and a half or whatever it was, "I don't know, but I just know we need a, we need a boss." And he shook my hand and let me go and next week my boss calls me and says, "Joe wants to talk to you." And we--my boss and I go down to Joe's office, and my boss then turns to me right when we're walking in, he says, "How old are you?" And I said, "I'm twenty-four, but my birthday's next month." He says, "Say you're twenty-five." 'Cause, you know, it just--he knew that Joe was about to say to me what he said, which was, "We want you to be the graphics director. We want you to be the boss." And I didn't even say yes, because I didn't even know what they were talking about. I didn't under- 'cause I, I didn't come--I didn't talk to him because I wanted a job. I wanted a boss, and I didn't want it to be--I wasn't advocating for me, and I actually didn't have--I had no idea what I would do because everybody--well, not everybody, but many of the people in the department were twice my age, so I didn't know what this would mean. So I said, "Can I go home and talk to my wife?" And they said, "Yes." And so I went home and I said, "What, what am I gonna do?" She said, "You're gonna take the job." So I took the job and I became what they say was the youngest department head in the history of The New York Times. There was one other guy, I think he was in Paris [France] and he had one employee and they--I'm not sure they called it a department or not; if you call it a department, I'm not the youngest; I think he was actually twenty-four, but other than that, that was the way it worked.
Story_ID: 669114
Speaker 1: Okay, you become head. Then what ha- what do you put in place then? And who are you supervising?
Speaker 2: So there are, I don't know, there's probably thirty, thirty-five maybe people who do maps and graphics. And so what we start to do is to lean very heavily on this concept of combining journalism and design. And so a lot of, pretty much, well not pretty much, but most of what we're doing is independent research by the people on the graphics' desk. They're not--you're not looking at the list of stories and saying, waiting for someone to bring you things and, "Make a chart of it," or, "Make a map of it," or, "Make a diagram of it." You're looking at the list and saying what of these things could make really interesting visual explanations, and can we sell that to the desk? And so you look at--you have each--one person kind of coordinating for each desk, and you say, "Can you sell the science department a diagram of how the eye works to go with this eye story?" And they would--and if it worked, they'd say yes. And then you would get on the phones and talk to researchers and get them the facts, all sorts of diagrams and then you'd figure out how to make this display. And you'd explain it and write all the text that went into that diagram. So we really kind of, this, this idea that I really love, I think, you know, was something that came naturally--that already had existed at The Times [The New York Times] and we just leaned on it even further and really welded together these two kind of disciplines. And it really worked. It really worked and I think it changed, to some degree, the way people think about information. And, you know, now we hear terms like big data and information architects. Well, that was kind of what we were doing.
Speaker 1: So what was your usual turnaround when working with the desk? You know--the lead, sometimes these story leads are pretty short and sometimes they're not.
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes, I mean--we love breaking news 'cause we thought we could do it better than anyone. So a lot of this was breaking news. If the shuttle blows up, we're going to figure out how the shuttle's put together bolt by bolt by the time this thing goes to bed. And we will have that explanation of how it blew up and which panel came loose and why that is a problem. And what the g-force is in--how hot does it get on reentry. We, we had this phrase, we would say we became afternoon experts. By the afternoon, you had to be an expert on the subject 'cause it happened that day and you have to get up to speed. So sometimes that means buying books. And you read this, you read this part, and you read that part. We're going to meet at three o'clock and we're going to figure out what's happening. If that is, you know, Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] gets impeached we have to come up to speed on constitutional law by this afternoon so we that we can--I got to this meeting at 4:30, we'll know exactly what we're doing and we will be smart enough to pull it off. And that's how we did it.
Speaker 1: So where did--is there any conflict at all with the rest of the news and editorial team with--was there ever a feeling that you would be overreaching into their areas, or--I'm just--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so because it really was a visual explanation, so if it, if it, if it didn't work as diagrammatically or charting wise, that's not for us to do. We really were looking for the things that leaned, that only we could do. And if it was something only we could do, and the desk already agreed to deal with it--or to accept it ahead of time, no need to work on it, you're blind and then deliver something they don't have space for. That doesn't work. If they agree to it, then we all have buy-in, we all know what we're working on. We all know where the space is coming from and we can do it.
Speaker 1: Charles [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow], this may seem a little naive question, but was there ever a situation where you, you know, that they had felt that you had misin- you know like, the writer itself thought that the image, or the diagram was not appropriate. Was there any (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that that, I think that that, I think it happens but not--slightly differently--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the sense that they think that, you know, sometimes it's just the limited amount of space and they may have to cut in order to accommodate and then the writer may think, well the value that's being offered here may not be the value of what's being cut and you may have that sort of conflict. But very often, they--you would learn things. I mean when we were, when we did the diagram of the Central Park Five, right. Doing the diagram of Central Park [New York, New York] topographically, so you could see all the hills and valleys, and what have you. And then putting everybody's testimony on the map, so that you can see physically there is no way for these people to be in both these places at the same time. It actually is incredibly helpful because then you can, then you can almost write from that, because you say there's no way it can--on the ground when you see it, there's no way it can happen.
Story_ID: 669115
Speaker 1: What do you learn about that process of, you know, being in charge 'cause that's your--how, how old is your staff [at The New York Times]? Are they, are they all--
Speaker 2: Many of them are older, but we have some younger people so there are people who are contemporaries of mine, who were my age, but slightly older.
Speaker 1: But you had said previously that you had been in charge of a lot of other thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Leadership, leadership came naturally to me so I understood it, and I took a lot of what my boss [Felix Grabowski] in Detroit [Michigan] had taught me about giving people space and encouraging them to be creative. And I would say things like, you know, "This is a laboratory, it's not a church. The rules are not that permanent. We're going to try things. We may not succeed all the time. We may fail sometimes, but we will not, you know, we won't be great unless we try things." And so we try different forms. We try to invent new graphical forms, we, we were really ambitious, and that worked. And also hiring people, only people who believed in cohesion of the group, meaning, we're all stars here. There's no star shining brighter than any other one and if you believe that that's you, and you need to shine brighter than everybody else, than this is not the group for you. If you believe that you want to be around other really, really bright people from whom you can learn, this is the group for you. If you can, if you don't mind sharing a byline with somebody else because all of us are going on these big projects together and there's probably going to be seven names at the bottom of this thing, this is the group for you. Because we believe that it's one organism and we are working together.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what are the ages that--from what to what are--what are the ages of your, your, your group?
Speaker 2: I mean, it varied. When I started, I don't know how old they were. I mean, there was one person who was my age and everyone else was older. The person who was my age was hired a few months after me. And we became, you know, really tight because we had the same vision of what it should be. And we hired people who shared that vision.
Speaker 1: (Mumbles) Okay (laughter). So you held this position for nine years, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I was here for nine years. I think I held that position for most of it, and then I was the deputy design director for news for a short part of that, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was there anything about that role, you know, being deputy director for news?
Speaker 2: Ah, it was interesting. It was different. It was--I wasn't supervising an individual, one group of people. I was kind of surveying the entire news report and trying to make sure that whatever was big for us, as a newspaper that day, was receiving the right level of prominence. And that it was receiving an amount of design and art direction attention, and I was going to coordinate all that between the group that I came from, but also between photo and the des- the layout people.
Story_ID: 669116
Speaker 1: I guess, what--so you're working incredibly hard during this whole time--
Speaker 2: I think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: --because you have a lot to prove.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so. Yes.
Speaker 1: And there's no indication, is there any of, self doubt? Are there things that, if you don't have examples of self doubt (mumbles), can you talk about what you're tremendously proud of that came out of that period. And what you could have done better?
Speaker 2: I mean, I don't--self doubt is hard, is a harder (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you felt--
Speaker 2: --concept for me.
Speaker 1: Let me put it this way. You were, I don't want to say insecure--felt a little intimidated or?
Speaker 2: Well, design came very naturally to me. Like it was if I could see it, you know, you have Neo in 'The Matrix' and you can see all the green numbers on the wall. It was as if I could see it that way. That, that, I could, I could read an entire report and it would be that clear to me in my mind about what we needed to do. And how it would look on the page, and how we would design around it. And even how big the text block should be, it was that clear to me. So it was--I was very comfortable in that role. The thing that I think from that period that I'm probably most proud of, ironically, and that's since 9/11 [September 11, 2001]--is the work that we did after 9/11, which was, in a way, helped to explain to an injured nation what had happened. And also helped to calm, in a way, a kind of a jittery city and that was both in the way we design, color choices, everything--all of this has psychological impact. One thing that we did that I was very proud of, is I tried--I said that I was going to read every book about information design that existed at the time. There have been many written since then. But back then, I, we searched for every book that we could find and we had an impressive library and I tried to read every single book about information design that had ever been written, particularly, those that had to do with kind of neurocognition and how people process color, shapes, all sorts of things. So you could, when you're designing you know what the emotion--not just what the information impact is--but what the emotional impact is. You know what sorts of shapes evoke different sorts of emotions. You know that if I shade this in this way, it does something different, and if I make it yellow, then if I make it green. Knowing all that, you can, you can use that when you're designing and part of what we were doing after 9/11 was kind of sedative. It was a calming approach to design. And I think, in our little way, that it was helpful.
Speaker 1: So what, when you--can you give examples of using this color or this design. I mean, what did you do? What was--I mean, that was interesting to hear that. But what was--give some examples (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well there was--well, I mean, I can think from the very beginning, just even before 9/11, just when we were becoming a colored newspaper from a black and white one, you want to make sure that the colors that you use relate to the people who are going to receive the colors. So the way that that color palette was developed, was that we went around the city and sampled colors. So there's kind of tarnished brass color, there is--there is no true red in The New York Times color palette because it's a brick red, because that was the closest reds that we saw in the architecture of the city. There are a lot of very dark colors. A lot of them have black in them. There's--we have several different shades of limestone colors because there's a lot of limestone in the architecture of the city. So when you look at a graphics display, it--you don't know exactly why, but it feels like New York [New York] because it actually is a reflection of the architecture of New York City. And we can then use that kind of color selection information to--we know how people are kind of alarmed by yellows and reds, and oranges. And we know how you people are kind of soothed by blues and greens. You can use that information. You know that people are kind of neurologically unable to measure, to compare area. But they're very good at comparing distances. So if you do bars, that's very clear. If you do circle in your display, you're giving up something because you know that the eye simply cannot measure the difference between one and the other. And so we knew all of this, kind of, on a scientific level when we're making a display. And we're making these choices very consciously because we know that it's not like regular language. You--it is operating on a way that people are not conscious of what you're doing, and you can use that in a way that is, you know, it can be abused, but you want to make sure you're not the person doing the abusing.
Story_ID: 669117
Speaker 1: Now, your staff [at The New York Times], what were their backgrounds then? You know for, I mean, did you have people with, you know, arts backgrounds or architecture, or--
Speaker 2: We had--there's an architect, there is a philosophy major from--well, was a philosophy major from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. There was a journalism major from Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]. There was, you know, mathematicians. We had, I mean, all of these skills we felt, you know, they're all hitting different notes but the orchestra makes the beautiful music and we had all of these particular skills that we could all draw on. And everybody could do something slightly different.
Speaker 1: That's fascinating. And how long did it take you--is that the staff that you came in with? Or is that the staff you built (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I--we built, we built a staff that--
Speaker 1: That, that had all--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and how long did it take you to do that?
Speaker 2: I mean, the entire time I was there, probably like seven years.
Speaker 1: Years, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 669118
Speaker 1: Why do you leave?
Speaker 2: I had always said, and this is for no particular reason, that the only reason I was at The New York Times is to go to National Geographic. And then that's, because I'd grown up with National Geographic. I didn't have it, I didn't have a subscription as a kid, but I would see it as a kid. It was in the library, you know, you go to the dentist office, it's there. And it was just beautiful. And I would just say this, I don't know why I would say this. And one day, the art director of National Geographic called me. I'd never met him, I talked to him once on the phone 'cause I wanted him to do a panel discussion, and he couldn't do it. He calls me and said, "I'm leaving this job. There's only one person in the world who I would like to do it, to take my job and it's you. Do you want it?" And I said, "Of course, I want it" (laughter). So they flew me down, I did the interviews and within a month, I had the job.
Speaker 1: Okay. So who took, who took over your job?
Speaker 2: Steve Duenes who is brilliant and has done much more than we ever did when I was in charge (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was he part of your team?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: So he rose up and you--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was my deputy when I left.
Speaker 1: I see. Okay. So you went--so then talk about your time. So you end up being at National Geographic for two years, really.
Speaker 2: Right. So I, I--my kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't even leave though.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my kids spent most of their time--me and my ex split times with the kids--
Speaker 1: You had gotten divorced at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, we got divorced. And the primary residency is with me, so most of the time it's with me. But she had moved away for--and I didn't know when she was going to come back, and I didn't quite understand it. So she was away in Chicago [Illinois], but she was apparently coming right back but I didn't know this. And so I took this job, and I'm thinking, okay. There's nothing keeping me in New York [New York]. I'll just take this job and I'll move to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and as soon as I took the job, she moves back to New York and so I'm like, okay now this is very awkward. So we are trying to hash out how, you know, can I move, how disruptive would be that for them and visitation, and so it just drags on and on. But Nat Geo says they can't wait, and so they say, "Can you just commute from Brooklyn [New York]? We'll help for the transportation." And I said fine. And so I commute to D.C. and back home to Brooklyn every night, four days a week for nineteen months or something.
Speaker 1: That is--wait, how long is the--that's like--
Speaker 2: It's like three something, three and a half hours one way.
Speaker 1: You're doing seven hours a day?
Speaker 2: Yes. Three babysitters. Somebody in the morning, somebody in the afternoon, somebody in the evening in case I miss a train, a plane or something. Yes.
Speaker 1: So you got--did you work on the train? That's an awful--
Speaker 2: I wrote a book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] on the train (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's an awful lot of time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 669119
Speaker 1: When do you realize that the National Geographic is not for you? And--
Speaker 2: I just, I just get exhausted by the travel.
Speaker 1: The travel.
Speaker 2: On the weekends, I can't even look at any transportation, I want to stay home. It's not good. My kids are like, they're not seeing me very much at all. It looks like we're not moving after all. There's no way that I can continue this indefinitely. I am showing, you know, I'm so used to being the person who works all the time and now that's impossible. I have to--I'm barely getting there at time to go to work, and I have to leave to catch a train, plane, whatever to get back home in time or I will be stuck in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. So, you know, the Charles [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow] that I knew who worked whenever needed, all the time, late into the evening to make sure everything got done, I can't be there. And that's frustrating to me. It's not how I see myself. So I just--and Bill Keller, also, every time he sees me is saying to me, "Charles, this is crazy. You got to come back to New York Times. Come back." So he calls me or something, I don't know how--and we bump into each other again. I don't know why I keep bumping into him. It's like he was stalking me or something. And I said, "Okay, fine Bill. Let's have lunch." And we have lunch and at the same time, I had taken all of December off. And--
Speaker 1: All of what?
Speaker 2: All of December off.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.
Speaker 2: And I realize at the end of December, I'm never going back to work. And I called my boss and I said, "You know I'm never coming back, right?" And he says, "Yeah, I kind of figured out." So that's just--and he said I could work from home, which I knew that can't work. And so I have lunch with Bill and he says, "You know, well, we'd love to have you back. What do you want to do if you come back?" And I thought about it for a while, and I said--I knew that they were doing these things called op charts on the op-ed page. And I always wanted to do an op chart, but we couldn't because I was in the news room. And so I said, "Why don't we do op charts instead of you doing it freelance?" It was all freelance--I knew this because I worked in the art department. "I'll do it on staff. I know how staffing decisions are made. Nobody wants to do a new budget line. You want to take existing money, shift it somewhere and have the same budget." So I felt this is a way you can take the same money--
Speaker 1: And redistribute it.
Speaker 2: --and redistribute it. And I could do this job. And they said, "This is a great idea." And all of a sudden, I was a columnist at The New York Times.
Story_ID: 669120
Speaker 1: This is really sort of a wonderful thing. You know, it's a confluence of things. Now, had you--your last, if I'm correct in your, you know, understanding--your last writing really had occurred, I don't want to say last, but when you were at The Detroit News and you know, you were working both shifts.
Speaker 2: But I wasn't writing. I mean this--
Speaker 1: Oh, you were learning--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was just learning how to research and how to report (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and to do--so you weren't, oh, okay--
Speaker 2: I wasn't a writer.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I--this was them--this was not supposed to be a column as much as it was supposed to be an op chart, as they were doing with an introduction. And I thought, and my boss said, "Are you going to write an introduction?" I said, "Yeah, I guess." And he said, "How long will it be?" And, "Maybe four hundred words?" I had no idea how long four hundred words was. And I said, "Yeah, I guess." And that was the whole of the conversation. And from the first time I published, I realized that the way that we had conceived it was not the way that people were reading it. They were saying, "Why is a really short column with this chart?" Rather than, "This is a chart that has an introduction." So immediately, I had to reorient the way I was thinking about the piece. That people wanted to know what I thought the columnist--not as much what the chart would show. And, which was tremendously worrisome for me because now that meant that I had to do the highest level writing on the job training in the world. The most public, because no one was going to cut you any slack because you have a column on The New York Times op-ed page, so nobody's cutting you any slack; either you get good at this right away, and you'd better be good tomorrow, or not. And I had to learn to write a column, with some of the best columnists in the world.
Speaker 1: And that's what I find--I just find this whole--is the newspaper changing and there's more freedom here, or is how The New York Times worked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have no idea. I don't know how it works outside me.
Speaker 1: I see. What about the editorial--op-ed, isn't that part of the editorial board?
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, not the board. The board is a separate thing.
Speaker 1: But I mean the editorial--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the group.
Speaker 2: Yes. The editorial group.
Speaker 1: Okay. But how large is the--
Speaker 2: It's a large group.
Speaker 1: It's a large group, so aren't there rules and procedures? And are people going to be thinking that you have a small space to begin with, you know, that's around this chart? And, and--
Speaker 2: I think we were making up the rules as we went along. I don't think that there were, you know, I sometimes would say I have more to say than this little space, so I'm going to use less chart and more text.
Story_ID: 669121
Speaker 1: Let's talk about some of the things that you've done, you know with that. You know, during that time. So you were--but see this right here, I don't--now, I asked this--asked about this before, but when you return [to The New York Times], you return in nine- 2008.
Speaker 2: Yes. It's when I start, yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, you return in 2008. And 2008 is called the apocalyptic year (laughter), I mean we have a, I mean there's a new president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama]. But things--I don't know when you start in 2008.
Speaker 2: Well, I think I'm in, so the election is '07 [2007], he starts in 2008--so I cover the election, so I start writing on the blog a couple of, maybe like six months ahead of the election. So I remember writing about things, even during the primaries, I was writing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Using your charts--
Speaker 2: Using my charts, and--yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. But when you--but by the--so wait, so the blog was called By the Numbers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By the Numbers. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And at this point in time, I want to also ask--are you--when do you start appearing on, you know, TV? Is that part of the election, or is it afterward?
Speaker 2: I want to say, you know, I don't know when the first appearance was. It may have been slightly after? I don't know exactly. Someone called and said, you know, "Can you come on this show?" And it was a midday show on MSNBC and I said, "Sure." And I had no idea what I was getting into, and I showed up and did the show.
Speaker 1: So is--was, would you say 'The Demise of Dating' [Charles M. Blow] was one of the significant pieces, or do you think that--I mean, that was, or was it the election? I mean what, what starts really garnering, you know, a following and a readership? (Pause) What is your big--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know what starts the, first--some of the earliest followers, I think, really like the data stuff and so some of them were not particularly happy when I started to do less of it and write more. But of the written pieces, I don't--you know, we don't have internal metrics to tell us how many people read one column over another. They don't give us that. But I can't--but I do know when I started to catch my own stride, and when I started to be much more personal in the column. And, you know, people thought the column was just about numbers. I always say the column is about behavior, beliefs and biography. That I do, you know, I look at polls because I want to know what people believe. I want to know how those beliefs inform their behavior, and I find a way into that through my own biography. I write a lot about things that I care about. The vulnerable children like the ones that I once was, abuse, politics, because I once wanted to be a politician. I mean, if it's personal to me, that's what I write. And secondly, when I started to realize that being the poor kid from the South was not a negative, but in fact, literally was the positive. It was the thing that made me sound different. And if I could capture that kind of storytelling ability that many people in the South have, and do it in writing, then I--then it, then it elevated what I was saying to another dimension and it connected with people on an emotional level. And when I, when I could realize that, then I felt like now I'm a writer. Before that, I wouldn't even call myself a writer. People would ask me what I do, I go launch into this long explanation for what I did. I never said writer. And now I do.
Story_ID: 669122
Speaker 1: You know the other thing I had read was that the--that often the story started with the numbers. You know--
Speaker 2: Yes, I--when I first started to write, I would lead with numbers. So I would look around and see what numbers were interesting to me, and let the column follow the numbers. That in the end turned out not to be, I think, the best way to write a column. The column is really supposed to be about--centered on you. It is about how does this person see the world? How do they interpret what's happening around them, including data. And how do they then help me to make sense of that. They come to you for voice, not for data. And that, you use the data to inform your voice and to help, you know, people to see how you are interpreting the world. And once I flipped it and started to say, this is my worldview. They can be changed by facts, of course, but this is my worldview. This is how I see the world. I se- I believe in a core set of values and using those value judgments, this is how I interpret the news that's happening in any given day. And I think that that becomes what people expect from columnists.
Story_ID: 669123
Speaker 1: But Charles [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow], I, I have to play devil's advocate because most in the--I don't know, I don't want to say the old days or whatever, but being a columnist was like a prize. You know, a lot of times people may have been reporters and everything, and then there are those people that go directly--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, to it but it was viewed as a prize possession.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, to even be able to make a living espousing one's views.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--is there any pushback among people [at The New York Times], I mean, you know, other columnists about what is this? He didn't pay his dues, why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have no--
Speaker 1: --why--
Speaker 2: --I wouldn't know.
Speaker 1: You have no idea?
Speaker 2: And I wouldn't want to know. To me, the way I look at it, I was a manager in this newsroom for almost ten years. I went to page one meetings and helped determine what was going to be on page one for almost all of those years. Worked with three different executive editors, very closely because that's what we had to do. I watched more desk editors come and go than I can ima- than I can count. And when we said we had to be afternoon experts, we had to be for every desk, not just for one discipline. That meant that it gave me an incredibly broad sense of what the news was, how--what to trust in terms of data, how to know a story when you see it, and how to play that story. So I felt very comfortable in the role that I'm in. The--and now I feel that the writing has become what I want it to be. So I don't know about that, but I don't--again, I also don't want to know.
Story_ID: 669124
Speaker 1: How do you find your voice? You know, was the voice always there? How do you find your voice, and how, how much at this point--you know news has changed and people are writing, I think, comments--so how do you know who your voice is resonating with? And how does that, you know, how are you interacting with your audience in that way? So, because, you know, before people couldn't put comments at the bottom, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and so you see whether you pay attention or not, you know, you see those comments coming in and I guess, I'm going to ask also the role of TV in this whole process because it plays a role, too.
Speaker 2: Well, I think you have trust yourself on some level. I mean, you, you--some of it is reactions that you get from people and you hear--I put my email address at the bottom of every column, and I get unfiltered comments that come in from people who agree with me and people who don't. But I do believe that, you know, writing as my most natural self became the truest self. And you don't do that necessarily because you're writing to a audience. I think that that if you start trying to write so that people will comment and like you, then you've already failed. [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou used to say, you know that the bird doesn't sing 'cause it has an answer, it sings 'cause it has a song. You actually just have to believe that you have a song. You have something you want to say. Then you have to write that thing, as truly as you can write it, and let the chips fall where they may. And that may be that people don't like what you have to say. But if that's the case, then that's the case and maybe this is not for you. If you write your truth and people do like it, then maybe you found a match. That this is something you would like to do, this is the place you should be doing it, and this is the way that you should be writing. Now, all of those things have to line up. I think that I've been lucky in the sense that, for me, they have lined up. There is an audience that likes what I write about and that I write about what I want to write about and we have built a relationship, them to me, and me to them. And I think that's the only way it can work. I don't think you can plan it. I don't think you can bend yourself to make that work. I would think ring as hollow and inauthentic if you tried to bend yourself to make people like you. I don't think it can work that way.
Speaker 1: Now, you're writing, I'm mean, you know, is--you're very--I call it almost lyrical in some respects. I mean, especially in your book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow]. You, it's, like, I was reading it aloud, (unclear) anyway that's nice. But, I was reading it aloud and I was thinking god, this would make a nice play (laughter).
Speaker 2: I hope (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's what I was thinking--oh, I didn't know there were those plans, but that's what I can sort--my background's in theatre, and I kept thinking, oh this would really make a--just as it's written in parts. So but, my question about that is that I, you know, I find this story, I'm sorry, I find it just somewhat odd. You started visual and the next thing you're writing. Though, you know, writing was you, but that was, you know, that was a kid, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Right, it was a kid.
Speaker 1: And so that doesn't mean that you can get to--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --The New York Times--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --you know, at the top of your game.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: So I'm just, okay, but I've explored that.
Story_ID: 669125
Speaker 1: Where are you when Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] happens? Katrina is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was here.
Speaker 1: You were at New York Times [The New York Times]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: I have to ask you about that before I get to Trayvon Martin.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And I mean--because this is--you could have been at another point in time. I mean, were any of your family at all affected by--
Speaker 2: Actually, not. Because we're from North Louisiana, so we're--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --it, you know--we're rarely affected by hurricanes that far up. My ex-wife's family's, a part of them live in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I don't know if they were affected or not.
Speaker 1: So what are you thinking of the whole thing because, you know, that was a very, sort of traumatic period of, you know, in American history in that way.
Speaker 2: I'm offended, and I'm angry throughout that period because it again, to me, suggests that people don't know what the lived experience of the poor actually is in this country. You know, every time someone said, "Well, why didn't you just get up and leave?" And people don't quite understand that not everyone has the ability financial or otherwise to simply get up and leave. There are people who are sick, who can't move very easily. Not everyone has a car. Certainly not everyone can get on a flight. And that seemed to, you know, we seemed to be surprised that there were poor people in America and because this was my home state and an experience that I lived very intimately in how poor it is, it was shocking to me to have people in the news business either feign or actually express genuine ignorance about what poverty looks like in this country. And it just--I just thought if we don't know it when we see it, if we don't know that this is a problem, that they didn't just misjudge it, and they didn't just mistime it, and they just ignore all the warnings. They're actually--they had no choices in the matter. If we don't know that when we see that, then how can we be the media? How can we cover these people as full citizens of this country and give them justice?
Speaker 1: And, really, you know, in many ways New Orleans, or one would think--a lot of times they thought of Mardi Gras but they never knew the communities. They didn't really, you know, I don't even know if they feign--I really think, maybe they did not--
Speaker 2: Well, I think people go there and they think of it as a playground and they don't understand that all of the people who are doing the work, the cooks, and the chauffeurs and the--these are people who live here and they don't make a lot of money. And this is, this amazing culture that you're experiencing is really the culture of the poor. This exuberant celebration--poor people get, in my experience, have a knack for exuberant celebration because they don't always get a chance or have a reason to celebrate. And so when they do, they really want to celebrate and so all of that is actually an outgrowth of poverty. It is not, you know, in spite of poverty.
Story_ID: 669126
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the, the Trayvon Martin case. You know, because that, that's something really that happened, it feels, gosh--
Speaker 2: Like three years ago; is that right?
Speaker 1: No, two.
Speaker 2: Two?
Speaker 1: But it doesn't even feel that old. I feel like it was last year sort of, but--so talk about that because that case really--I would like to have your analysis of that case and what kept the story really alive. You know, because the news can play a big role in a lot of things.
Speaker 2: I don't know what--how--what kept it alive. I mean, it was a story but it was a local story for weeks and no one really paid much attention to it. There were--the local papers were actually doing a decent job of covering it in Florida. There were a couple of national writers, black writers, who took an interest. And also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who are you talking about?
Speaker 2: There was [HistoryMaker] Trymaine Lee, he was, I think, at The Huffington Post at the time, and I think now he's at MSNBC. And there was Ta-Nehisi Coates at The Atlantic. Both of whom wrote movingly about what had happened there. And in my Twitter feed, people kept tweeting to me occasionally, "Trayvon Martin, are you going to write about Trayvon Martin?" This happens a lot by the way. People will try to say, are you going to write about this or that, or whatever. It just shows in my Twitter feed, and I don't know what it is. So I Googled this case and it just seemed so odd, you know, why--the kid's not armed and then there's, you know, something about the candy and the soda and the sidewalk and the night, and, you know, something just didn't seem right. Something didn't sound right. But I didn't know how I would write about it because, you know, I'm here in New York [New York], and I wasn't planning on going to Florida at the time. Then I asked my assistant to see if she could get the attorneys on the phone and she did. And I let them know that I wanted to interview his mom [Sybrina Fulton], because for me I just wanted--what I thought I could bring differently--this is about, again about what is most genuinely you--I'm a parent. And I'm a parent of teenage boys in addition to a girl [Iman Blow]. And I just wanted to hear her reaction to somebody calling you and telling you that they've killed your kid. What does that feel like? What is the first thing that the person says? And how do you respond to that? And they agreed to let me talk to her. And I asked her those very basic questions, and every time I asked a question, there was another question because I couldn't--I still couldn't figure it out. Like, you know, why is--it's a kid. He's, you know, someone shot him through the chest. Why don't you knock on every door to see who's missing a kid? How does this kid get taken in and toe tagged as a John Doe? That--no parts of it were making sense to me. You know, I interviewed her several times after that. Just basic, "Did he have a wallet?" "What was in his wallet?" When I call my kids, it shows up as dad. My name's not even in the phone. "What shows up on his phone when you call it?" And she says, "Mom." And I'm thinking you mean to tell me that you're calling this phone all night, and it's saying mom and dad, and nobody answers that phone, and it's in the police custody? None of it--everything about it just didn't feel like the way you would treat a human being, regardless of who was at fault in the initial incident and how you believe that played out. There are grieving parents and this is a kid, and you, at least, owe them to pick up the phone and, you know, say we have the phone and whatever, and--or try to find out who's kid it is because you see mom and dad's popping through on the line. And you don't show up at the apartment with pictures of blood coming out of the kid's mouth, which is what they did with Tracy [Tracy Martin], to say, "Is this your kid?" You know, it just didn't feel right. And I think it didn't feel right to a lot of people in America, not just on the racial social justice level, just on the human--the way you treat other human beings when there's a loss. And I think that a lot of what we see in these cases, is actually part of it is about the way black men interact--or, or, or are forced to interact with authority figures--but another part of it is about just treatment. You know, how do you treat, how do you treat my brown body? If somebody, if somebody kills me, do you leave me in the street? Do you, do you not knock on the door to see if somebody will--I belong to somebody? Something about that doesn't feel right.
Story_ID: 669127
Speaker 1: And so the case--how did you feel? 'Cause there's total attention played on the media in some respects, it might've, I don't know we've had several media circuses but there was a lot of attention to this and what happened, and who was guilty. And, you know, his friend [Rachel Jeantel] sort, you know, I mean--her, sort of being castigated or even people trying to even understand her in a way, you know, her role in society.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And at the end of the day, Zimmerman [George Zimmerman] is acquitted.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so what are your feelings about that having, you know, having followed the case that closely? And, you know, and the end result with all the attention and everything--what was your sense about the acquittal (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well what, what, what I'm very afraid of is that we are learning as a society that the old saying is true, that dead men tell no tales. That we may be learning that it is better to leave the person dead than let them survive, because if you take away their life you also take away their voice. And, therefore, there's only one person who can talk. There's only one person who can testify. There's only one person who can rebut the facts, because the dead person can no longer tell their story. And we're trying to piece together that story with forensics and eye witnesses and ear witnesses and that is only half of the story. And so if we keep having situations where the dead person gets put on trial, as much or more than, the person who actually did the shooting. It teaches us something. Something that I don't think we want to learn as a society. Something that I think is very dangerous to us which is that it is better if they are dead, than if they lived.
Speaker 1: You mean, that if you want to do away with (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If you have to defend yourself it is better if you have killed that person. Because if you look at the case of the woman in Jacksonville [Florida], that husband--she didn't shoot him. But now she's in jail because he can then change his story which is what he did, from saying, "I put my hands on her," to, "No I didn't," you know. "I put my hands on all my other women and--," now he's like, "No that's not the way it happened," because they can change their story. Now, if you look at that case where she didn't kill the man, he's still alive and now she's locked up and facing thirty-five years or whatever she's facing. Then you look at the Zimmerman case, also in Florida, where the kid [Trayvon Martin] is dead and cannot say, cannot change his story, cannot refute evidence, can't look at what's coming in and sit down with five lawyers and then go over how you're going to refute these things. It sends a very shocking and disturbing message, I think.
Story_ID: 669128
Speaker 1: I want to ask you also about a more recent case, I mean, situation and that's Ferguson [Missouri]. You know, you're feeling--because this is, see, in a lot of respects, these are drawing attention to communities, so you were from a rural community, a poor community whether it's urban poor or rural poor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there are, there have been cases--there was the case of Cleveland [Ohio] with the abducted girls that drew attention to, you know, not black--
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: --but still poor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I think people don't understand, you know, there has been, they don't really understand, they can't make sense of it. And--but I want to go back just to the black community, and I want to ask your views of this time period because, look, these cases are coming in rapid succession. I'm in Chicago [Illinois], we have a huge amount of violence--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, happening in that city that no one seems to be able to stem or do anything about.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I would like to have your thoughts about where we are, you know, because--where we are as a society and what your views about the, you know, where as a nation with the black community and I'm talking about the lower half of the society. I don't want--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a broad question so I don't know how, precisely how to answer it, but I do think that we do have to think about how--whether, you know how society values the black body and that's interracial and intraracial. And how much violence is visited on black bodies, and there's a tremendous amount of research that says it's disproportionate. And it starts the moment--it starts in family because black kids are more likely to be spanked. But it also starts as they are introduced into societal structures like schools. They're more likely in the schools where spankings occur. They're more likely to be spanked, they're more likely to get harsher punishments like expulsion as early as preschool and this continues throughout the life, and what kind of damage does that do to the psyche of a kid who can register, even if they cannot articulate that there is a difference in the way that I'm treated, or my friends are treated than the way that other people are treated. And that the people who I, who other people trust to keep them safe are the people who I must be leery or be putting me in danger is a very dangerous signal to send to anyone, particularly kids. That's a very real thing. I think we, we all have to deal with that. And as parents, I think that's very difficult. It's one thing to say we expect criminals to act like criminals, so I can teach you to some degree how to avoid the criminal. Don't hang around with this group of friends, don't go out late at night, don't do this, don't do that. Don't go to this place because I know that there's bad activity there. What do you say to a kid to say, "And by the way, the people who actually are supposed to have the guns may also be a threat. The people who are vowing to protect and serve, may also be a threat, not the criminal." That's a tough thing. That's a tough thing for all of us. I think we all have to deal with that, not just the black parents. Every one of us in society have to look at that and say, "That's not right." No one should have to have that conversation with a child. No child should ever have to hear that conversation.
Story_ID: 669129
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and then and concerns for the black community as we sit here in 2014 then?
Speaker 2: Well, that's, well that's a very (laughter)--
Speaker 1: It's a broad question (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know how to answer that. Well, there are actually some interesting positive signs which is that, for instance, for all kids, black kids included, they're not as sexually active as they used to be. Part of that's 'cause they don't date the way they used to. Black kids in particular don't use hard drugs anymore. They still use marijuana but a lot of places are making marijuana legal. But when it comes to the, you know, the hard things, cocaine, heroin, whatever; many of them kind of came on the end of what we saw which was the crack [crack cocaine] epidemic, and they thought that will never be me. And pop culture made it kind of taboo and made jokes of it. Comedians, black comedians, made jokes of it. Black music made jokes of it. Those kids are having no parts of hard drugs. That's really, really encouraging in a way. But what I think is, you know, we all have to do--is to try to imbue more of a sense of pride and purpose in everyone, in particular, these kids to say, "I know it's not fair. I know it's not even. I look at all the social science, I know that you're getting treated more harshly than your counterparts. I know that you're not smoking marijuana any more than anybody, but you're getting arrested ten times the rate of other kids. I know it's not fair." How can we say, "But love yourself more than they hate you; treat yourself the way that you know you deserve to be treated; don't make choices that would compound the kind of negative architecture that's already almost designed to destroy you." How do we teach kids to have that sort of pride? How do we teach them to have that sort of resilience? How do we teach them to run and not get tired? And, I think, that is, that is the challenge for us because it is natural to be tired. It is natural to say how many decades, how many generations? This is a, this is a, this is a, kind of an ancient cultural fatigue, and how do we help them to acknowledge it, cry it out, and then wipe your face and realize that life is a hill. You can climb it or you can stay at the bottom, and I want to see you at the top.
Speaker 1: Now, if you were, if you were starting your career again, would you choose the same path?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I chose this one (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: I like it. I like my life, so yes, I guess I would do all the fluky things that led to this.
Story_ID: 669130
Speaker 1: I do want to ask what is your--what is--like if I were in your shoes and working, what is like an average day or an average week for you like? You know, here [at The New York Times]. I mean how or--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm ju- I'm juggling a lot so, I mean, I still have the kids. They're--the oldest is at college, in college now, but the twins are high school seniors, so we have college intern stuff and SATs and ACTs. And my daughter's [Iman Blow] a competitive fencer, she's like second in the country in her weapon in her age group and ten- tenth in the world, or something like that. So there's a lot of international travelling and a lot of domestic travelling, and just trying to schedule all that. And her twin brother's co-captain of his high school football team and trying to schedule that, and the visits. So there's that--
Speaker 1: Are they in private schools?
Speaker 2: They're in a private school now. We've done private and public. And there is the writing of the column and trying to make sure you stay abreast every day of what's happening. That's twice a week is the, the columns are due twice a week. And I'm a CNN contributor so whenever they call, you kind of have to be available to go on television and so I have to make sure that I'm not so stressed that I don't--I can't perform and do that job. And I do paid speeches. So it's very--it's a lot happening. So I--the schedule is a big part of life, and waking up every morning and saying where's my body supposed to be today. Is it supposed to be in this city, or another city (laughter), or wherever, but it's a juggle. And I think, you know--first of all, I'm not, I'm one of these people who loves therapy. Like, I don't go all the time, but if I feel like I have something to say, I'll call my therapist and say, "I want to come in." And he believes that I like having the cup filled pretty much to the rim. I just don't like when it goes over. And I do believe that's probably true. I kind of thrive in having almost too much to do.
Speaker 1: Some people do a lot, you know they--so you, but you've balanced and you're going to be an empty nester soon--
Speaker 2: Oh, my god, thanks (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean that, but you said your daughter's travelling internationally?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You said she's travelling internationally.
Speaker 2: Yes, but she--most of the international trips she does with her coach. When she made the national team and so at the world championships, I went to that. That was in Bulgaria. But the other international trips, she travels with her coach because if I tried to do that, there would be no way to get it done.
Speaker 1: That's pretty amazing there. But you've been, you've been the parent then. I mean, you did co-parenting but really you were the custodial parent.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes, they spend most of their time with me. But, you know, we split the holidays, we flip back and forth every year. We split the summer in half. So she gets--they have a lot of time there. And she, you know, she helps whenever whatever she can do to get her--you know, I'm in a book tour so I spend a lot of time over there. She's going to have to get her to airports, and, you know, make sure we don't lose a kid (laughter). It's really important to us, so we have to work together to make sure that happens.
Speaker 1: Now, I was also asking a question of, like in a work week--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what is your week like? I mean, you're saying you have these appearances, you've got the work, you know, balancing the columns. How long does it take you to write a column? And--
Speaker 2: Writing doesn't take long at all. The--but you have to do a tremendous amount of consumption to be able to write quickly. That's my experience. I don't know how the other columnists do it. But, you know, I--the television is always on the news. I am always reading. And, you know, there's--in a way you're never not a columnist. So there is no weekend where you can just say, "Oh today, I'm not going to pay attention." That doesn't happen. So you're constantly, constantly following everything because there's so much to consume you could miss something. So, you know, I'm checking the Twitter, and the Facebook, and the--I check everything that I can check, and I'm reading everything that I can read, so that--I like to write on the day. So I like to come in and say, okay, you've been reading for two days. Of all the stuff you've read, what seems the most pertinent today that will have the most legs tomorrow. And whatever that, feels right to me, I write that. I don't negotiate it with myself. I found that trying to bend it actually makes a worse column. Whatever is on my mind most, the thing that I can't stop thinking about, that is what I write. And that is informed by the fact that I've been reading and watching.
Story_ID: 669131
Speaker 1: And how have you balanced your--the celebrity, the increased celebrity? And I want to talk about, you know, the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] and the process of writing the book. But with the book, and with, actually with TV has come increased celebrity, that puts demands on a person, too.
Speaker 2: It's strange, I mean--well, what ends up happening is that my circle of, or my environment, my ecosystem shrinks. I go to fewer and fewer places unless it's an event, a work event or something. But I don't go out socially too many places at all because it becomes, you know, you want to always make sure that if someone says, "Hi, how are you. I read your column." You want to be very nice and open to that. And you really do appreciate it because that's the only reason you have your job, either on television or in the newspaper is that you have people who are willing to read it. But with all the things that I'm doing in any given day, my mind is, you know, somewhere else. Very often. Very often, I'm exhausted, I have no desire to talk about politics if I'm just out to have a--grab a bite to eat. And so I end up going to places that I'm very familiar with, so that's part of it. And you also have to dress up to go outside. Like, I never had to do that before. So, you know, every time somebody says, "Aren't you Charles Blow [HistoryMaker Charles M. Blow]," and I look down at what I'm wearing and I'm like (makes sound). So (laughter), so I have to like dress the part.

Speaker 1: I want to go back to the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] and the writing of the book. And how that even, you know, you said it took you nine--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --years. So is this something--I'm just trying to understand--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --the process and how you came and why there was this desire and--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I started writing when I was commuting to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and I was not writing to write a book. I was just writing personal essays from my life, and that was because the year before--I think it was the year before, I was having, we were having drinks and dinner with some editors of Essence. Their building this, there was one restaurant that was right across from Times Square [New York, New York] between where Essence used to be, and The New York Times Building [New York, New York]. And so we would often see them there after work. And we were eating together that night, and they said--somehow being a single parent came up, and they convinced me to write this really short piece about having to learn to do my daughter's [Iman Blow] hair for their Father's Day issue. And it lit a fire in me, and I thought, you know, I should just write scenes from my life and I'll try to sell them as little essays to magazines, and that's how it started. I would just write because I had all this time on my hands. And it never--it didn't occur to me that it was a book. That is should be a book, that anybody would be interested in reading it as a book. And as I wrote, and wrote, and wrote, you know, thirty thousand, forty thousand words in a Word document [Microsoft Word] and I'm thinking, okay, this is getting really long, these stories. Maybe there's some connection between them, but I still wasn't registering it as a book. And in 2009, two little boys, both eleven years old, one in Boston [Massachusetts] and one in Atlanta [Georgia], both hanged themselves ten days apart. One's name was Carl [Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover] and the other name was Jaheem [Jaheem Herrera]. And Carl looked a lot like me as a kid, and they both did it because they had both endured so much homophobic bullying that they apparently thought that there was no other way out, and no way that they could go on. And I thought to myself, this can't be. Not on my watch. I can't--if there's something that I can say that could help a kid like this, to know that I know what that pain feels like. I know what it feels like to be bullied. I know what it feels like to get the homophobic taunt. I know what it feels like to walk up to the precipice of suicide. But also for me, in my case, to think better of it and walk back from that precipice. And if I know that on the side of that, you can have a life where you love yourself and you love your family. And you have a family, and you have a life. And you have a career, and you contribute to society. And it may not always be easy, but it is doable. And I thought about it both because I had been that kid, and also because I had kids. And I just couldn't imagine the pain of, you know, cooking dinner, and calling them to dinner and them not showing up. And you going into their room and you see them hanging, and you have to cut down that lifeless body. How does that--how is that even possible? How is that even happening in America that there's that much pain for children? And so, I just said this is what the book is. I wrote a blog post called 'Two Little Boys' [Charles M. Blow] right after that, and I knew exactly--I knew in that moment that this is what the book needed to be. And then I could organize what I'd already written and then write--expand on that and write the book that I wrote.

Speaker 1: That was a process of rediscovery, even though you're doing this, you--are you in therapy at the same time? Or are you--
Speaker 2: Not then, but I--I mean don't--I have gone on and off, I mean but I just--I look at it as like this is another tool. Like, you have family, you have friends, you have therapy. They all form different functions in terms of your (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. But I guess what I'm asking is that also in the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow] you talk about bisexuality.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And when are you coming to terms with that, I guess is what I'm saying--
Speaker 2: I think that that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because, because some people would say, you know, even on both sides--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, the heterosexuals and the gay community would say you have to be one or the other.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Even though the concept of bisexuality, people understand.
Speaker 2: I don't think the, I don't think that everyone does, and I think that is kind of lazy thinking for people to assume that people have to be. And for me, it's been a lived experience for most of my life so the idea that someone would tell me, "Well, you don't exist," when I'm looking at myself and think, of course I exist. I can touch myself. This is me. I exist 'cause I have always existed, and that human beings are sexual beings and sexuality expresses itself in many different ways. And some of those are permanent ways and sometimes it is fluid, and it is very complex and beautiful in its complexity. And the whole conversation about, you know, biphobia or bi erasure is just kind of ridiculous to me. I don't quite understand it. I know there are a lot of people who do a lot of amazing work around trying to make sure that people understand and appreciate that this is an actual identity. It's not a transitory one. That it is a permanent one for some people, and I appreciate and applaud that. I don't think I necessarily always have the patience for that because I think, what are you talking about? It doesn't make any sense to me that you would say that. But it seems like it has always been with me. And, in fact, you know, I told my ex-wife like very early on, so that was twenty-one years ago. So it, to me, doesn't even seem like a new thing. I know that it feels new for people who are reading it in a book, and some people may even look at the revelation as if it is a--the kids, you know, the twenty something year old--the twenty year olds, having to think it through as a present proclamation--but no, it's how a twenty year old thinks it through. And they don't have all the language, they don't have it all right, but they are thinking it through and they're understanding that this is me, and it's okay to love me the way that I am.
Speaker 1: So you told your wife. What did you tell your wife at the time?
Speaker 2: I told her that, I mean, I was like--it's a twenty year old conversation, I don't know the exact wording, but, you know, I remember we were out. We had just been married like a month or something I think, maybe two. And we were out having dinner with--at another friend's house. They were also a young couple, and there was two--at least one older couple, I think there were two older couples there. And I remember like looking at everyone and thinking this is what marriage looks like for the rest of your life. And this woman is going to be my wife for the rest of my life. And, you know, I love her and I want her to be my wife forever. And on the drive home, I was thinking if that's the case, then she should know everything about you. Even if it's like, if you think now that it is part of your path or something, whatever, she should know everything there is to know about you because this is--you're going to be together forever. And I got home and I said, you know, something like, "You don't have to stay," or, "I can understand if you want to go, but I've got something I've got to tell you." And we sat down--still didn't have enough furniture in that house--so we sat on the floor, and she asked questions. I answered every single thing that she could possibly ask. Like, you know, I just--in my mind, either you were staying or we were going but there was not, I was not of the mind that I was a deceptive or dishonorable person and that was not going to be my life. And we talked about everything, and she said I want to be with you. And we stayed together for seven more years. We had three beautiful children, and that was our life.

Speaker 1: But this is an issue of identity and that's why I'm saying, you know, the proclamation--see once you did--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --once you, once you wrote the book ['Fire Shut Up in My Bones,' Charles M. Blow], then that becomes a proclamation and that becomes a statement of identity.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's no more, you know, just friends or, you know, private conversations or even--and so what was the feedback, what--'cause the book got a lot of very positive reviews.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I mean, the feedback has been--you know, there are still people who don't quite understand it, but they--speaking of my friends. I mean, I can't--I don't hear a lot of feedback from other people. I hear people who are close to me and they don't quite understand because they're like, "No, I don't think you really are. I don't know if that's really" (laughter), you know, they want something different. And I'm like, if I'm telling you and I wrote it, I don't know what else you want me to say. But I think people have a hard time with it because--and part of that is because they see so few people who identify. Even though the number of people who say they have had at some point, same sex intimacy as adults, is larger than the number of people who identify as gay or lesbian. But people don't necessarily identify as bisexual and that may be 'cause they're not. Maybe you can have that experience and say, "Not really my thing, tried it, done it," whatever. But I think another part of it, though, is that, you know, it is what used to happen in the black community, in particular, and probably happened in other racial groups, too--which is the concept of passing. You have a person who is of both, you know, white and black, and they can pass as white and so they do. Many people who are bisexual, they genuinely are. They have same sex attraction, and opposite sex attraction and they can pass as either way. And sometimes they just make a choice to pass. Is that really the truest definition of who they are? Probably not. Is that the most honorable thing that you can do? I would say definitely not. What is the harm? Other than the fact--what is the harm in saying, yes, this is me. I can still choose to be monogamous with one person, but my attractions are fluid or they are bifurcated or whatever the case may be. But this is just the truth of who I am and it doesn't make me less of a person. There is no hierarchy to humanity, there is just human beings. And the only reason that that would not work, the only reason that people would be afraid of that is that we are so awash in homophobia and misogyny in this culture, that anything that is not kind of adhering to the heteronormative ideal of what a man should be, particularly. Women are bisexual, too. But I'm just speaking from the male perspective. Anything that is not adhered to that, is less. You have eluded the gift of being a man, and that is crazy and it's not true. It forces people into living lives that are just not true because they want to adhere. They want to be whole the way that the misogyny suggested only wholeness can be. And for me, it--the moment that I was reading this and thinking, is there--am I--do I have possess some fear even though I've talked to, you know, the people who are closest to me. Is there some sort of fear? And I had to say, maybe there's some, there must be some fear here because why doesn't everyone know this? And the moment that I had to consider that maybe I was afraid of something, that's just not me. I just said no way, I'm not, you know, the way I see myself. I'm not afraid of anything. And so have at it. There's nothing that this changes about me. There's nothing that it changes about my value and my work at all. It's not--life is not about who you lay down with, it's about what you are willing to stand up for. And if you're not willing to stand up for something, and you're so caught up on who you might lay down with, then you're not living.
Story_ID: 669135
Speaker 1: I have my own views of that, because I think even in the proclamation of the rights that have come with those, you know, who call themselves gay, there's a demarcation, you know, that I think, I don't even think--I would disagree that even on the--'cause sometimes people feel that there's been a fear to even come out. And I think, you know, people feel more comfortable with the demarcation.
Speaker 2: What you mean? Gay and straight, and not with bi?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Well, listen, I think they're, they're, they're--if you go onto any of the kind of bisexual discussion groups, people are very clear that they receive discrimination not just from heterosexual people but also from the gay community. And there's a lot of discussion about equality within the LGBTQ community [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer] and whether or not, even in that group, they're not seen as fully--full members. And so, yes, they're catching it from both ways until you see--when you look at kind of negative health outcomes, LGBT people, in general, have more negative health outcomes, mostly kind of from psychological damage of culture beating you down. But bisexual people have--in bisexual people those health effects are even greater, because they're receiving it, not just from one direction, but from two. And we have to, I think, solve that as a whole. Everybody has to do some self-examination and say, you know, am I treating people as fully human because I'm asking to be tre- somebody else to treat me fully human.

Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be? And I know you're forty-four, and I'm asking a legacy question, but, you know--
Speaker 2: James Baldwin said, "I just want to be a honest man and a good writer." And that's what I want my legacy to be (laughter).
Speaker 1: I don't have any more questions. That's good. See? You didn't have a favorite quote but you turn up a good legacy (laughter).
