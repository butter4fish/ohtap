Speaker 2: Actually, not very far.  Because, we haven't done a lot.  I know my grandparents.  And, I know of great grandparents.  But, I, I met grandparents.
Speaker 1: What do you know of your great grandparents?
Speaker 2: My great grandparents were slaves.  They came from Louisiana.  A place called Penhook, Louisiana on my father's side.
Speaker 1: And, on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Arkansas.  That's--farmers.  That's all I know.
Speaker 1: What about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: My grandparents were farmers on both sides.  My father's side came from Louisiana and Lake Village, Arkansas.  My mother's side came from Southwest Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories or legends that, or songs, that have been passed down through your family from your ancestor?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  The legend, only legend I guess, that I can remember my father telling me, is about how his father lived through a terrible storm that actually destroyed like, thousands of, of cattle, and farms in Louisiana back in the early, well, late 1800s.  And, he use to tell us about that.  And, he lost his farm and had to start, start all over again when he moved to Arkansas.
Speaker 1: So, your great grandfather was a farmer also?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, moved to Arkansas about when?
Speaker 2: Late 1800s.
Speaker 1: Late 1800?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Did he farm?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Again?

Speaker 1: Cotton farm.
Speaker 2: Lake Village.  The Lake Village area.  Southeast Arkansas.
Story_ID: 95015
Speaker 1: What are you first or earliest memories?
Speaker 2: My first memory, when I try to remember, it's when I was like five years old.  And, I remember that it was my birthday.  And, I remember getting up on a chair looking in a mirror.  And, looking at myself to see what five years old looked like.  And, I also remember it because my mother [Ethel Curry Kearney] baked me a cake, which was very unusual in my household because there were so many of us.  That was not a usual thing.  We didn't celebrate birthdays like we do now.
Speaker 1: What did a five year old look like to you?
Speaker 2: Just very (laughter)--I had a little round face, big eyes.  I remember that.  And, my mother had a ponytail in my hair.  That's all I can remember really.
Speaker 1: Your mother baked your cake?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 95016
Speaker 1: Describe your mother [Ethel Curry Kearney] to us.
Speaker 2: My mother was beautiful.  She was a, a small woman.  That as she got older, she got a little rounder, but she was still beautiful.  She was very soft spoken.  She was very wise, and very, very intelligent.  And, a great mother.  She did a great job raising her eighteen children.
Speaker 1: And, you father?
Speaker 2: My father [James Kearney] was a slim, handsome man.  Very, very bright, self-taught intellectual.  A leader as far as church and community.  Very wise, and very strict.  And, drilled into us, you know, the importance of education.
Speaker 1: You come from a very large household.  What was your mother like on a daily basis, managing her household and her children?
Speaker 2: Busy.  Very busy (laughter).  Because she was not only a housewife, she also helped my father in the fields, the cotton fields, and our truck patches where we raised fruit and vegetables, and things that we needed to live off.  So, she did both.  So, she was an extremely busy woman, twenty-four hours a day.
Speaker 1: What was farming like for your parent at that time?  Did they, they owned the land, or were they?
Speaker 2: They were sharecroppers.  They did not own the land.  They leased the land from a very rich white landowner.  And, all the time that I lived in Gould, Arkansas, we were sharecroppers.  My father leased forty acres of cotton and grew the cotton, and we were his, his workers.  His children worked in the fields.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like for you?  Or, how do you, do you recall how that was for your, for your siblings as well as your parents?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was different for all of us.  When I remember those days, I, I remember them with fondness, you know.  At the same time, it was very hard work.  And, it was constant.  But, I also remember that was an opportunity for me to be kinda free and to think and dream about what I wanted to do.  That's the way I remember it.
Speaker 1: And, your father was active in the church in what way?
Speaker 2: He was church superintendent for as long as I can remember.  He was also, the Sunday school teacher for adults, so was my mother.  So, he was extremely active.  He, he taught, I think they call it, Men's Missionary classes.  He traveled all over the county, teaching men who were part of the church; deacons and other parts of the church.
Speaker 1: And, that was a, what kind of church?  What denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Story_ID: 95017
Speaker 1: You shared the story about your fifth birthday.  What are some of the sights, or sounds, or smells of your early childhood that you remember?
Speaker 2: Sights was my family on their way to the cotton field.  Walking in the morning.  It's barely light and all of us are half asleep (laughter) walking to the cotton fields.  Smells are sweet potatoes baking.  When we came in from the cotton fields, my mother [Ethel Curry Kearney] was home cooking and we could smell that, and I remember that so well.  And, that was usually in the fall that she'd be baking sweet potatoes.  I mean, there would be other things, but that's what I remember.  Sounds, I loved night.  I loved, especially spring or fall nights.  And, I could hear the sounds of owls, or different things at nighttime.
Speaker 1: You're able to recognize many, are you able to recognize many animal sounds?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that adventurous to you?
Speaker 2: I just liked the sound of, it was a quiet sound, but you could hear like, the, the animals in the wild, the wild beings, you know.  And, I like that.
Story_ID: 95018
Speaker 1: A farm family, a large family, what was a typical day like for you and your family working the field?  What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: We liked to enjoy each other.  I think that made us enjoy the day better because we knew it was gonna be filled with hard work.  So, we would joke and have fun with each other, even when we worked.  We would spend time talking.  We would, we would play games.  We loved games.  So, we'd do a lot of that while we were in the field.  So, that's how, that's how our day was spent during work and then we'd come home and we'd eat.  And, if it was during, during the school year, we would spend time doing our homework.
Speaker 1: So, you were, you worked in the field?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, when you became school age, you were in school?  How did that work?  A field day, and classroom?
Speaker 2: Some of us actually missed school for the first three months of school, because we had to help our father finish up the cotton.  I was not one of those.  I missed some school, but not like a whole season like some of my older siblings did.
Speaker 1: How many of your older siblings weren't able to start school at the beginning of the year?  How many of them were--
Speaker 2: I'd say about a third of my family.
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: Quiet.  Shy.  Very inquisitive.  My mother would say, nosey.  I like to sit around older people and listen.
Speaker 1: I want to go back to something.  You said that when you were working in the fields, which was a long day, but allowed closeness, you played games.  What kind of games could you play, or did you invent them while you're doing such hard work?
Speaker 2: We'd invent games, or we--it was games that we kind of take from television.  Usually, word games.  We'd make up word games, and just test each other's vocabulary or memory, things like that.  We were just, we were really into words and spelling and remembering things, and we got that from our father [James Kearney].
Story_ID: 95019
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit more about your father [James Kearney].  You said that he's, he was a philosopher.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, self-taught.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Was it difficult for him to acquire books and--how did that come about?
Speaker 2: I think he, he told us that his father, by some way or another, owned lots of books.  And, my father started reading very early.  And, and when he became older he would, even when he traveled or would leave home, he would find a place to where he could go and find books.  And, when we came along, he instilled that love of books in us.  And, we just, all of us absolutely loved reading, and loved books.  Not that we had a whole lot of books.  But, whatever we had, we'd like read it over and over.
Speaker 1: Do you remember a favorite of his, and of yours at that time?
Speaker 2: I don't remember a favorite of his.  No, no.  But, mine was "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn."  I loved that.  And, "The Diary of Anne Frank."
Story_ID: 95020
Speaker 1: You're quiet, introspective, inquisitive.  Did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And, at what age were you conscious of your dream and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Very early.  Very early, probably nine, ten.  I originally wanted to be a missionary.  I--my idol at that time was Albert Schweitzer.  So, that's what I decided I wanted to do.  Later on, because I loved writing and reading, I decided I wanted to be a writer.  I, and I didn't have any specific writer I wanted to emulate, I just wanted to write.
Story_ID: 95021
Speaker 1: What else would you like to share with us about your growing up in your hometown?  Or, your community actually, which was a farm community.  What was that like?
Speaker 2: My community was very rural.  Even though I'd say, I'm from Gould, Arkansas, we lived outside Gould.  Wasn't a suburb, it was like the country.  We lived in the country.  And, on the road that we lived on, which was Varner Road, there were about ten different families, white and black families.  And, very close families.  We would visit and my parents, if they needed anything, they would send us to go borrow and cup of coffee, or a cup of sugar or whatever.  So, it was a very close knit community.  I just remember it being very, I was very happy as a child.  Very happy.  Enjoyed my siblings.  My siblings--we all were best friends.  If you ask any of us, who was our best friend, it would be another one of us.
Speaker 1: How large was the community?  How many other families, or farms nearby?
Speaker 2: There were about ten families.
Speaker 1: Were you--you talked about your father [James Kearney] being a deacon in the, in the Baptist church.  What was that experience like for you and your siblings, and your family?
Speaker 2: Well, we knew that there were certain things expected of us, because my father was a leader in church.  So, you know, we had to act a certain way, and portray ourselves as a certain way.  But, my parents, they were very strict, but at the same time, human, you know, so they understood that we were children.  And, they usually, like some families would keep their children in church all day, they never would do that.  They would let us come home and then they'd go back to church before the day was over.
Speaker 1: Was the church experience a catalyst for your interest in missionary work?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  No.  No, I think it was just the kind of person I was and just very, very interested in missionary work.  Because, I think I probably was interested in travelling as well.
Story_ID: 95022
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your school.  What kind of school building?  What kind of school environment were you in, leaving the farm and then to school?
Speaker 2: I think probably, it was a typical, southern, segregated elementary school that I went to, and junior high school.  All black teachers, all black students, great experiences as far as I'm concerned.  But also, it was a place that I learned that we were poor.  I never knew that until I went to school.  But, I have some memorable teachers.  I have teachers that I'll always remember that instilled in me a sense of confidence, a sense that I was important even if I was poor.  So, it was a time of learning.  It was a great experience.
Speaker 1: How far did you travel from home to school?
Speaker 2: It was about eight, eight miles, and we, we always rode the bus.  The bus picked us up.
Speaker 1: So, there's a school bus.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You talked about a number of teachers.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Influencing you and, and are there favorite ones?  Is there a favorite one, or more than one?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) There is definitely one favorite one that I've talked about before, and her name is Ruby Jones.  And, she was my fourth grade teacher.  And, more than anything, she encouraged me as far as my love for reading.  I think it's from her that I learned how important reading was and encouraged me if that's what I was interested in, that I should try to find something that would maybe be a career or whatever in reading.
Speaker 1: You made a very poignant statement, you said that you didn't know that you were poor until you went to school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What was, what, what made you, what was the connection between school and poverty?
Speaker 2: Other students.  Other people other than my family.  Because, none of us, I think, expected the fact that we were any different from anybody else until we went around other people.  And, it was the other students who made me aware of that.
Speaker 1: And, how did they do that?
Speaker 2: They would say things, they would taunt us.  We, very often went to school and we didn't have money for lunch.  Very often we wore clothes that were quite ragged.  So, everybody knew.  I mean, we were considered the poorest family in Gould [Arkansas].  And, the children let us know that.
Speaker 1: How did you feel?
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a terrible feeling.  It was a feeling of conflict.  Because at home we never felt, you know, negative at all about ourselves.  We thought a great deal of ourselves as a matter of fact.  So, it was something that I had to deal with, we all had to deal with.  And, I think we did.  I think our parents, thank goodness, helped us deal with that.
Speaker 1: What about teachers?
Speaker 2: There were some teachers, yes.
Speaker 1: Anybody that stands out in particular for you?
Speaker 2: I think my first grade teacher, and I, I've talked about her before.  She was a very strict teacher who was known for, for you know, corporate punishment for whooping.  But, at the same time, she was a very understanding woman.  And, one of the things that she did was when she found out that I didn't have money for lunch, she would ask me to throw away the boxes of cookies.  The boxes that had held cookies.  In those days, they sold cookies during the day and then there, there would be a box that had, oh, crumbs or whatever.  So, she would ask me to do that.  And, when I took it out to throw it away, there would be cookies left in it.  I mean, you know, plenty of cookies and I knew that she had done it on purpose.  Or, she would say, "Oh, I over ordered milk, so I have an extra milk, does anybody want one?"  And, she would bring it to me.  She'd bring it and put it on my desk.  So, I remember that she was very--and she didn't make a big point of it.  But, she found a way to help me without, you know, without embarrassing me in front of everybody else.
Speaker 1: There're two teachers important to you, your first grade teacher, and your fourth grade teacher.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Would you share their names with us?
Speaker 2: My first grade teacher was, was Jessie Freeman, and my fourth grade teacher was Ruby Jones.
Story_ID: 95023
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school at Gould High School [Gould, Arkansas].  It was an integrated school by that time.
Speaker 1: And, this was in what year?
Speaker 2: That was in--I started in '67 [1967] and graduated in 1971.
Speaker 1: So, you go from a segregated elementary school--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: To an integrated high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But, you also had come from an integrated farming community.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, what was your experience like at Gould?  After all, there had recently been some controversy.  There was a little (unclear), the integration of those schools.  What was your experience like?
Speaker 2: I might say that, in the interim between those two, I went for two year to what I call the white school.  It was called Freedom of choice.  Black parents were given the opportunity to send their children to the white school, if they wanted to.  And, my parents wanted to.  So, my family went to Gould High School and Gould Elementary School before there was full integration.  That experience was not a good experience for me.  I did not enjoy that experience.  I learned a lot about the race relations in Gould, Arkansas during those two years that I never would have known.  So, that probably colored my thoughts about race relations in Gould, Arkansas more than the integrated school, Gould Ark--Gould High School.
Speaker 1: So, before you went to Gould High School, you went to--your parents had a choice at sending you to, and that was before full integration.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, that school again was?  The name of that School.
Speaker 2: It was Gould.  It was named Gould High School, Gould Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gould Elementary.  The black school was Fields, F-I-E-L-D, Fields Elementary, Fields Junior High School, Fields High School.
Speaker 1: Do you know who the, the black school was named after?
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: You don't.
Speaker 2: Share with us what the experience was like, after all it came after, well, your parents chose to send you to school, you said.  But, this was not a good experience for you.  If you could expand on what that experience was really like and, you know, in more specific terms?
Speaker 1: Sure.  First of all, it--we were, like, going to the other side of the track, and we'd never been there before.  So, we--there was a lot of fear.  There was a lot of hesitation.  We were leaving what was comfortable to us, going to something that we knew nothing about.  And, we got there and we learned that they didn't want us there.  And, they didn't mind us knowing that they didn't want us there.  For the full two years, there were very few times that I ever felt like I was, I was welcomed at the school.  By either the students or the teachers.  And, my sister and I, who I was very close to, Jo Ann, talked about it for years afterwards trying to figure out, you know, could it had been any differently.  But, I don't think it, I don't think it could've because Gould was not ready mentally.  Just, was not ready for that change, and we, we experienced the brunt of that.
Speaker 2: Those experiences included what kind of behavior on the part of those teachers who were unwelcoming?
Speaker 1: They made sure that we knew that they didn't expect much of us.  They very often ignored us in classes.  There were actually, you know, some actually said things, negative things said during class.  Those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 95024
Speaker 1: We were talking about your high school experience.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, you're in Gould High School [Gould, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's an unfriendly setting.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What--How are you functioning as a, as a student in a hostile setting with teachers who didn't want you there?
Speaker 2: Not very well, to tell you the truth.  I, I had been an above average student in elementary school, superior student.  And, when I went to the, what I call the white school, my grades suffered.  I didn't have friends, except my sister.  And, I always went home complaining that I thought the teachers were unfair, and the students didn't want us there.  But, my parents were not listening to whine, whining and complaints so they said, "You have to learn to live with whatever people have to say about you.  You don't internalize it.  You're there to learn, and that's what you do."  So, that's what we did.
Speaker 1: What I'm curious about, how you managed to advance academically, to learn in that environment in spite of the teachers?
Speaker 2: Well, we did because we had to.  Because, our parents weren't gonna allow us not to.  Again, I did not do as well those two years as I, I would have done in another environment.  But, I did do well enough.  And, that's because of my parents.  I mean, I never would have, unless they drilled in us that we have to excel no matter what.  So, we had to.
Speaker 1: You're at Gould two years.  And, then where did you go?
Speaker 2: After the two years of Freedom of choice, there was full integration.  So, the schools became one.  It became Gould High School.  Of course, we lost Fields High School, and we took on the name Gould High School.  The amazing thing about most southern schools, when integration took place, was that there became the private schools for the white students.  What they called the academies.  So, there were academies setup up and down the road in Lincoln County, in Desha County, and all the counties in that area.  We had maybe five percent white students at the new Gould High School.  So, the integration was basically integration in name only.
Speaker 1: How (unclear) your student body was it?  You say 5 percent white after that.  How--
Speaker 2: Probably of 5 to 600 students in all.
Speaker 1: What other kind of changes did you see and experience once the schools were integrated and Gould changed to predominately black?
Speaker 2: All the administrators were white.  Most of the instructors were white, and most of the students were black.  That was, you know, kind of a slap in the face, I think, to the black community.  And, there were complaints about that but nothing, you know, nothing happened.  So, other than that, my grades of course, got a lot better.  I was, I was happy to be back in an environment that was somewhat friendly, with my friends.  And so, on that end, I was, I was much more pleased to be back at Gould, at the old Fields High School.
Speaker 1: Were there attitudinal changes or behavioral change in the instructors who remained after the school was integrated?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  I couldn't tell any difference.  And, most of the teacher that I have, I have to say were white teachers.  There were African American teachers there, and I couldn't tell any difference in their attitudes.  And, I think the white teachers who were there, were the ones who felt most comfortable in a black environment, because a lot of the white teachers went to the academies.
Speaker 1: So, did those teachers who remained not treat you differently, see you differently as a student, your potential?
Speaker 2: They treated me basically as the other black teachers did.  I mean, no, they didn't teach--treat me the same as the teachers at the other school did.
Speaker 1: What was different about--
Speaker 2: I think they saw me--their whole school was made of black students.  So, it would have been very difficult for them to treat black students the way that they could treat a few black students in a white school.
Speaker 1: How did your grades change?
Speaker 2: They improved.  They improved greatly.
Story_ID: 95025
Speaker 1: Oh, give me an example, from what to what?  Where had you gone under the other regime?
Speaker 2: I was making C's when I was at the other school.  And, I made A's and B's, because I was an A and B student.  So, I wasn't surprised, I just--even then I knew that I was performing a lot lower than what I should have been performing.  But, I had no encouragement.  I had no--I was unhappy for the whole two years.  So, I think once I went back to Gould High School, the new Gould High School, just the comfort level of being there and feeling, you know, good about myself.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to understand something, you referred to the, the new Gould High School, was there a change in the physical location, once the school was integrated?
Speaker 2: The new Gould High School, was the old Fields High School.  It was the predominately black school before.  So, they took the name of the white school and gave it to the new high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And, that was not unusual.  That happened all over the South.
Speaker 1: So, this was actually a different, physical setting for you, different physical environment?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Were there any dramatic differences in the facilities of the old Gould School, the white Gould School and the new school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, when we went to the Freedom of choice school, which was the white school, the first thing I noticed was the difference in the facilities.  The difference in the school and the difference in the facilities.  And, the new textbooks.  And, the new seats and chairs, and chalk boards.  Everything was different.  I mean, I was amazed that these students went to school in nice rooms and, you know, bathrooms that worked.  And, bathrooms that were inside, I mean, all of that was different.
Speaker 1: You say bathrooms that were inside.
Speaker 2: Well, no.  We had bathrooms that were-there was inside plumbing at the, at the black schools but they very often did not work.
Speaker 1: Most of your teachers remain white in the new Gould School.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What did you observe in terms of teacher relations, administration relations between those white teachers who remained and the black teachers who remained in the new Gould?
Speaker 2: Cordial.  Cordial.  There weren't, there were no great friendships that I can recall.  Maybe one, one or two.  When the day was over, the white teachers went to their side of the community, and the black went to theirs.  There wasn't a lot of intermingling.
Story_ID: 95026
Speaker 1: Who most influenced you in your school at that time?
Speaker 2: Probably, actually in high school there was a teacher by the name of Miss Ferlinden (ph.), and she was a white English teacher.  And, I think that was because, she recognized my love for writing and encouraged it.  And, she just was a great encouragement to me during those times.  And, another instructor who taught biology and chemistry by the name of Pat Fayla (ph.).  Both of those I would say.
Speaker 1: By this time you were in what grade in high school?
Speaker 2: When I went back, when I left the two years, I was in the 9th grade.
Speaker 1: And, you subsequent years, 10th through 12th were like what for you?
Speaker 2: They were actually my favorite years.  I had really a great high school experience.  I, I was very involved.  Very active in school.  Cheerleader, I was a part of every club.  I just became very, very active in high school.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite clubs?
Speaker 2: FHA, Future Homemakers of America.  Library, I was the librarian.  I won the very first librarian award that they gave to anyone.  And, that's only because I love books so much that I stayed in the library as much as I could.  Student Council.  And, I really did like cheerleading, because it gave me an opportunity to get out of the house.  (Laughter) To leave home.
Speaker 1: The award that you were given, what was that in recognition of?  What was the achievement?
Speaker 2: Just my service.  I was the student librarian, and every time I had some time away from my class, I would go into the library and work.  So, at the end of the year, they gave me an award for that, for my service.
Speaker 1: And, cheerleading excited you the most?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because it was a type of freedom for me.  My parents were very strict.  And, if I hadn't been a cheerleader, I wouldn't have gotten to go to games.  Or, I wouldn't have traveled the different cities that we went to.  So, I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: So, cheerleading took you away from home, from Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Not Arkansas, we were still in Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, it took me away from home for that evening, at least.  And, we had practice during the evenings, so I had an excuse.
Speaker 1: Was there anything particular about the travel that appealed to you other than the fact that you were away from home (laughter), and under less restrictive eye?
Speaker 2: No.  I think that was basically it.  I liked being able to do something other than being at home sometimes.
Speaker 1: Student Council days, what was your office, or what was your involvement with your student council?
Speaker 2: I was one of the officers, and I think it was something like, secretary, it wasn't president.  I never ran for president.  But, it was something like secretary, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Did that experience influence you in any particular way?  The governance?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  Not really.
Speaker 1: By the time you graduated what were your grades like?
Speaker 2: By the time I graduated, I was--had an A and B, my grades were A's and B's mostly.
Speaker 1: When did you start thinking about college?
Speaker 2: God, probably ninth or tenth grade, yes.
Speaker 1: And, at that time, what were you thinking about achieving, or academically what appealed to you?
Speaker 2: You know what, I didn't know about journalism at that time at all.  So, I never thought about journalism.  I kind of wanted to teach.  So, that was kind of what I was leaning towards.  It wasn't until I got into college that I decided that journalism was actually what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: What were you planning to teach?
Speaker 2: Probably writing or English.  English or writing.
Speaker 1: And, you chose what university?
Speaker 2: University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.  Razorbacks (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) you say that so strongly.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 95027
Speaker 1: What was that like, the University of Arkansas [Fayetteville], Razorbacks?
Speaker 2: It was a great experience for me.
Speaker 1: In what way was it a great experience?  Your freshman year?
Speaker 2: My freshman year was the first time I had been away from home.  So, I had never left my home before.  So, it was, what, 300 miles away.  Complete freedom.  Except for my brothers.  I had older brothers that were there.  So, it wasn't complete freedom, but I was on my own pretty much.  So, it was great.  I enjoyed it a great deal.  It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to major in though.  Even though I wanted to teach, there were, you know, different things I tried before I ended up with journalism, in journalism.
Speaker 1: What was your campus like?  Life like that first year, and how many, how many of your siblings were there at that time?
Speaker 2: I had two siblings, two brother's there.  And, my younger sister Jo Ann, who was my classmate.  We were both there.
Speaker 1: And, you lived where?
Speaker 2: We lived in a dorm, called Pomfret Hall.  As a matter of fact, it was a co-ed dorm.  So, my brothers lived on one side, and we lived on the other side.
Speaker 1: What was it like being in school at the same time as older brothers?
Speaker 2: It was good.  I like it.  I liked it.  But, they were very protective.  Yes.
Speaker 1: You--when did you decide to major in journalism?
Speaker 2: I think it was my second year in college.  After I had tried about two or three other (laughter) areas and decided that that wasn't really what I wanted to do.  I had taken all kinds of literature and writing courses, and they did not have a creative writing course program.  So, I decided journalism was it about the end of my second year.
Speaker 1: So, you're freshmen year, you took a lot of literature courses, and by the time you ended your sophomore year--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What appealed to you about journalism, or how did that awareness come to you?
Speaker 2: Actually, I had a friend who was a journalism major, who kind of talked me into it.  Who told me that's probably what I needed to do.  So, I went over and starting taking classes and ended up changing my major.
Speaker 1: What was your intent for post-college, and--
Speaker 2: I, I started thinking about newspaper work.  And, I had a mentor in the Journalism Department who steered me toward newspaper work.  He thought I was a great features writer, and actually he was a part of staff on the Arkansas Democrat newspaper.  And, when I graduated, he actually helped me get a job at the Arkansas Democrat.  But, at the last moment, I decided, I didn't wanna go to a newspaper and I didn't take the job.
Speaker 1: I'm interested in the, the end of your sophomore year, and your junior and senior year when you've decided on your major, your journalism classes.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Did you know any black journalists at that time?  What was that environment like?  That university life, that experience for you.  Almost, on a daily basis, what was that?
Speaker 2: University of Arkansas.  It has a history of having very few African Americans.  It was the late '60s [1960s] when it actually integrated.  My brothers were some of the first African Americans.  There were probably less than a thousand, maybe a thousand, African Americans attending school then.  But, it wasn't blatant and--so we didn't, you know, it wasn't something you thought about a lot, actually.  Even though there were very few of us, there was a very close relationship between the African American students there.  And, I, I actually thought it was a great experience for me.
Speaker 1: This is the '60s?
Speaker 2: It was actually the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: The '70s?
Speaker 2: The early '70s.
Speaker 1: Early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 95028
Speaker 1: We're just coming through and experiencing an aggressive Civil Rights Movement.  There are a thousand African Americans on campus.  What was your campus life like?  What was the impact of the movement on you and your brothers and the other African American students on campus at that time?
Speaker 2: I think we knew why we were there.  I think--and, we knew that someone had done a lot of struggling to get us there.  And, we were grateful for that and we stuck together.  And we, you know, we started a group called Black Americans for Democracy.  I think all of us were members of that.  It was pretty, it was pretty active during that time.  And, probably half of the African Americans on campus were members.  We had different activities.  It was just like we always kept in touch, one way or another.  There were all, there was always something to do to keep us together.  To, you know, keep our interest and to know what everybody else was doing.
Speaker 1: You described for us your personal experience in high school.  You're now on campus, its early post-Civil Rights and you've created this organization.  What was your involvement in the student organization?
Speaker 2: My involvement was a member.  I was not an officer.  But, I was a member.  We went to meetings, and I think there were a couple of times that we may have marched about, you know, something that was going on, on campus.  But, there wasn't like a really--we didn't do a whole lot of different activities, you know, active marching or anything like that.  But, we did have meetings and talked about issues.
Speaker 1: What were your meetings like, and what were the issues for you and for the other students at that particular time?
Speaker 2: It was probably, I think, in those early times, in the early '70s, it had something to do with the number of, maybe the number of athletes that were being brought on.  I think when I got there, there may have been one or two African Americans playing on the Razorback Football Team.  So, that was probably an issue.  Maybe the number of teachers that were there, African American teachers that were there.  Those are the issues that I can think of right now.
Speaker 1: How are you feeling on campus in that environment at that particular time?  What were your personal experiences in your discipline and on campus?
Speaker 2: I was--it was an experience for me being away from home for the first time, coming out of Gould [Arkansas].  The very, very, small town.  Coming from a very strict family, it took me awhile to kind of assimilate into that kind of environment, because I've been in such a strict environment.  The students that--the other African American students on campus were a lot, you know, I think a lot of them came from larger towns, or from different backgrounds than I did.  So, it took me probably that first year to feel comfortable.  And, feel, you know, as comfortable on a campus as they did.  So, you know, I think it took me a while to get really, really comfortable with the college environment.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any specific challenges to you other than coming from a small town and to much more freedom than you had before?
Speaker 2: I think just the classrooms situations.  It took me a while for that.  I come from, came from a high school that was not one of the larger high schools.  And, there were plenty of areas that we were not as proficient in as we should have been, even though, you know, we thought we were smart or, smart or whatever.  But, when we got to college, we found out that there were things that we really, really had to study for that we didn't think that we would have to.
Speaker 1: For example, what?
Speaker 2: Like, math.  Math was something that, I mean, we had what we thought were good math teachers.  But, you leave a place like Gould, Arkansas and then you go a university.  And, you find that maybe your school and your teachers were a lot more lacking in areas like math, then, then they should have been, or then we thought they were.
Speaker 1: How did you meet that challenge?  Personally, how did you meet that challenge?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what, there was a, there was a program on campus called Special Services, or I can't remember the name of it.  But, a lot of students from, from backgrounds such as mine, very small schools in areas that we weren't as proficient in, we could take one class and try to catch up with, you know, in the areas that we needed to.
Story_ID: 95029
Speaker 1: Any other particular challenges in that second and third year?
Speaker 2: None that I can think of, except that I started dating a guy in my first year.  And, I ended up getting married in my second year, the end of my second year.
Speaker 1: You started dating in your first year?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, married in your second year?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, how did, how did you integrate marriage and campus life?
Speaker 2: We, lived off campus.  And, it changed.  It changed my college experience quite a bit.
Speaker 1: In what ways for example?
Speaker 2: I was more focused on getting, you know, completing my college degree at that time, than I was early on.
Speaker 1: Marriage helped you to be more focus in completing school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Than you were before?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What was he like?  What attracted you to him?
Speaker 2: Probably, different from me.  Proba--he came from Little Rock, which is in Arkansas' term, a large town.  And, I came from a very small town.  And, I think probably the fact that we were so different.  He came from a different background.  He was an extravert, I was an introvert.  So, I think it was just the differences.
Speaker 1: Why do you think you became more focus on your education, and completing your education, after marriage?
Speaker 2: I think because, I didn't have the distractions that I had as a single person.  It was more like, parties and going out, and hanging with your friends.  Things that people naturally do as single, that I wasn't doing as a married person.
Speaker 1: Any other pivotal moments in school in addition to your marriage, or beside your marriage?
Speaker 2: No.  None that I can think of.
Story_ID: 95030
Speaker 1: You make your decision about journalism.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, you also make a decision not to go to newspaper.  Was that while you were still in university?
Speaker 2: No.  When I graduated and moved to Little Rock [Arkansas], for a summer, I kind of tried to figure out what I wanted to do.  I was gonna go to work for the newspaper that fall.  In the meantime, I decided that I didn't want to go to work for a newspaper.  And, instead I went to work for a county clerk's office.  So, I did that for a few months.  And, after that, I was going to grad school at the same time.  Yeah, I was going to grad school.  And, after I worked at the county clerk's office, one of my classmates asked if I was interested in--there's a program called CETA C-E-T-A, Comprehensive Employment Training Act, which was responsible for hiring, finding jobs for people though out the state.  And, he had started a program and asked if I was interested in working with him, and I, I decided to do that.
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your decision not to go to work at a newspaper.  What influenced that decision?  How did you come to that decision?
Speaker 2: I think when I thought about it, long and hard, I decided even though writing is what I wanted to do, newspaper writing was different.  It wasn't the type of writing that I was interested in at that time.  It was a discipline that I wasn't interested in.  It just was a different kind of writing.  I knew my writing.  It was more of a feature, creative, type writing.  And, I could see myself getting very, very, bored and, and burned out at a newspaper.
Speaker 1: You're in graduate school where?
Speaker 2: University of Arkansas in Little Rock.
Speaker 1: And, your--you decide on what path, academic path since you now, you've completed your journalism, your undergraduate work?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, graduate study is?
Speaker 2: Public administration.  Public administration.  And, that's what I did for nine years, basically.  I worked in, in state government in the area of public administration.
Speaker 1: We'll pick up (unclear).  Your working--your first job is with the CETA program?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Comprehensive Employment Training Act.  Were you particularly attracted to that, or was it just an opportunity?
Speaker 2: I was attracted to it.
Story_ID: 95031
Speaker 1: You're majoring--you're in graduate school and working full-time in the CETA [Comprehensive Employment Training Act] Program.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about--first of all, how are you managing graduate school and full-time employment?  And, by this time you also have--
Speaker 2: I'm married and I have a child, and going to school at night.  And, I was Deputy Director of CETA Program.  And, well, I guess I learned at some point that I'm a multi-tasking person and I feel most comfortable when I'm doing more than one thing at one time.  But, that--it was difficult.  It was not easy.  But, I never felt like it was more than I could do.
Speaker 1: What was the CETA Program?
Speaker 2: It was an employment training program.  It was a federal program that we administered statewide.  What we did was, we put people in different places throughout the state to work for government.  To work for state governments to--usually it was like, manual labor for the most part.  There were some people who did clerical jobs or working for the Transportation Department or something like that.  But, we were responsible for finding those people.  And, allocating those slots to the, the different counties and the different cities throughout the state.  We worked very closely with the govern--not the governors but the mayors and the city, the city managers and the county judges, people like that.
Speaker 1: How large a program was CETA at that time in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Our program, we were just one of the CETA programs, was about two million dollars.
Speaker 1: Two million dollars and its impact in the community.  How many people did that support hiring?
Speaker 2: God, I wish I could remember a number for you, but I can't.  There were probably, and we were all over the state so, I would say we probably--five to ten thousand for the state, statewide.
Speaker 1: What was the training aspect of the CETA Program?  It was an employment program and?
Speaker 2: And, the training; employment training.  The counties and cities, the local entities were responsible for training these employees as well as hiring them.  Training, them so that they could go on at some point to another job that wasn't subsidized by, by the government.
Speaker 1: And, how long were you with, with CETA Program?
Speaker 2: I was with that program for two years.
Speaker 1: Any unusual or extraordinary experiences with that program?  What was the impact in the state?
Speaker 2: It was a great program.  It was a very successful program.  And, unfortunately I came on at a time when CETA was kind of losing all of its firepower.  And, I think, just a few years after that, it completely changed.  But, it was changing the second year that I was there.  Just before I left the program.
Speaker 1: In your estimation, what made it a great program for your community, for your state?
Speaker 2: Because it was giving jobs to people who really, really, needed jobs at that time.  And, it was during the time of when [President] Bill Clinton was governor of the state, and that was important to him.  There were some very poor, very poor area in, in Arkansas, and we were able to touch some of those places with the CETA Program.
Speaker 1: You said, it began to change.  In what ways did it change as you--in that--in the two years that you were there?
Speaker 2: At the end of the two years, I think they were actually going to, either greatly reduce it, or change it so much that it wouldn't have been the same program that I knew.
Story_ID: 95032
Speaker 1: At that time, I was getting ready to leave and go to another job.
Speaker 2: And, where were you going?
Speaker 1: I was going to a program called the Migrant Education Program, which was also a part of Department of Education in Arkansas.  The Migrant Education Program was--actually, Little Rock [Arkansas] was the headquarters for the Migrant Student Data Bank.  We kept records on migrant students all over the country.  We kept health and education records on migrant students.  We were responsible for that.  We got the contract and kept it for years where we would track migrant students all over the country.  We had offices all over the country.  Had directors, Migrant Education Directors in every state that had, you know, a large number of migrants traveling through.  So, that was one of the, one of the most exciting jobs I've ever had.  I actually was Director of Information for that program.
Speaker 2: And, what does a Director of Information do for a program like that?
Speaker 1: I did a newsletter.  I participated in on National Communications effort.  I traveled all over, and trained state offices in communications.  How to do about, you know, making successful and effective communication programs.  And, I actually got a chance to go and visit the different Migrant Programs across the country.
Speaker 2: Ms. Kearney, what, what attract--what made you move from CETA to the Migrant Program?  What attracted you to the Migrant Program?
Speaker 1: I think I went to the Migrant Program because someone told me that it was an exciting program.  And, it just sounded exciting.  I mean, the whole background of migrant students.  And, once I got there, I really, really, enjoyed it.  I--My first introduction, I think, to a different culture for Arkansas, which basically was black and white for all of my childhood for sure.  So, this gave me an opportunity to at least learn about a different culture which I did not know much about before.
Speaker 2: And, which culture was that?
Speaker 1: Mostly, Mexican Americans, or Mexican Immigrants--migrants.
Speaker 2: What was the purpose of the migrant student, student data bank?  What was the purpose of it?
Speaker 1: It was to, to track students' travel when they came to a state and went to school.  Then, we kept track of their records.  How were they doing?  And, when they moved to another state, the next season or whenever it was, then those records, we made sure those records got to them.  There were nurses, migrant nurses in the different school that were a part of our program.  It was a very, very effective program, very successful program.
Speaker 2: And, this was a national program?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Was this a government run program?  You made reference to our getting the contract.
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was a federal program.
Speaker 2: And, administered by?
Speaker 1: Administered by Department of Education, and Arkansas was the headquarters.  But, every state had a Migrant Program.
Speaker 2: And, you were traveling, teaching communications--
Speaker 1: To the, to the offices, the Migrant Education Offices.
Speaker 2: How long were you with that program?
Speaker 1: Six years.
Speaker 2: How did it change?  Or, how did you work change over that six year period?
Speaker 1: My work kind of expanded.  I went in as an information officer/director, responsible for communications, and I ended up becoming a trainer.  And, I ended up also doing some computer programming, learning how to do that.  So, it was an expensive kind of change for me.
Speaker 2: At what point did you move into training during that time?
Speaker 1: It was probably my second or third year that they decided that we needed to train people all over the country how to do a better job at communicating and getting the word out about their programs.
Speaker 2: And, the IT part of it.  Was that something that you were attracted to?
Speaker 1: No, not really.  But, that was a big part of the Migrant Program.  That was a big part of the staff, probably half the staff at MSRTS, that's what we called it, were programmers, computer programmers.  So, it kind of made sense that I should know something about that.
Story_ID: 95033
Speaker 1: And, you moved from that program [Migrant Education Program] after six years to what?
Speaker 2: Amazingly, I moved from that program, I decided that I was gonna go into newspaper.  I learned that Daisy Bates, who was someone I had always admired, needed a managing editor for her newspaper, the Arkansas State Press.  And, I applied for the job and got it.  And, went to work as her managing editor.  So, I went back full circle.  I'd gone back to the newspaper.  But, this was a different slant, because it was a small African American newspaper that I felt pretty strongly about.
Speaker 1: And, this is about when?  What year is this?
Speaker 2: '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: 1987.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What attracted you--you, you admired, you indicate that you admired Daisy Bates.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, that was prompting, or influencing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Decision to go into newspaper.  What else?  What else attracted you though, to doing news when that was something that you didn't want to do originally?
Speaker 2: There was a certain freedom to this that I didn't think I would have had at the larger newspaper, the more mainstream newspaper.  There was a challenge, because I knew it was a small newspaper that needed a lot of work.  She had started it because she had promised her husband that she would start the newspaper back.  And, it was struggling.  It was a struggling small newspaper.  And, I just felt like I could make a difference, and I--that was one of the reasons that I went to work for her.
Speaker 1: What were you envisioning when you embraced this new challenge?  What were you envisioning for the paper and for the community?
Speaker 2: Basically, I was envisioning making it a better paper.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: Quality-wise, stories, outreach.  I thought it, it could be more to the community than it was.  And, that was what was behind my going there, one of my reasons for going there.
Speaker 1: When you say, you envisioned it being more to the community, would you, would you explain that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I know Daisy Bates envisioned the newspaper to be important to Arkansas and it should've been.  But, she--by the time she came back, she was ill.  And, she wasn't able to devote as much to the newspaper as she would have liked.  And, I think that, one of the things that I was--always thought about the newspaper, that it had served such an important role in the whole civil rights struggle for Arkansas that I really wanted to see it kind of, that position, to regain that position again.
Speaker 1: Now, you said, when she came back to the paper.  Where had she been?  And, how had the paper changed during that time?
Speaker 2: She had retired.  She had--she was not operating the newspaper and she had been ill for quite a while.  The newspaper had actually closed in 1959, and that was--that's a whole story within itself.  It was part of the 1957 integration crisis.  Because of her and her husband's position on that, the white businessmen pulled their advertisement from her newspaper.  And, she and her husband had to close her newspaper in 1959.  And, one of the things her husband asked before he passed was, he'd like to see the newspaper reopened.
Speaker 1: And, he passed in what year?
Speaker 2: 1980.
Speaker 1: 1980?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, the paper was reopened?
Speaker 2: The paper was reopened in 1984.
Speaker 1: And, you joined?
Speaker 2: 1987.
Speaker 1: 19--three years later?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the--how large was the staff?  What was the environment like?
Speaker 2: The staff was small.  The staff was small, and that's normal for a small newspaper for an African American owned newspaper in a small town.  I think what I felt like I could offer was my journalism education, my love for writing, my love for interviewing, and what I think a pretty good, I usually did a pretty job of that.  I've done lots of freelance during the time that I was working.  So, I really thought I could offer her something that I, you know, that I thought the newspaper needed.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the paper?
Speaker 2: Arkansas State Press Newspaper.
Speaker 1: The circulation at the time that you joined was?
Speaker 2: Was about 5,000.  Between 5,000 and 10,000.
Speaker 1: And, you were with the paper how long?
Speaker 2: I was actually with the paper five years.
Speaker 1: And, built subscribers or distribution to?
Speaker 2: We say 25,000 and, you know, newspapers that goes up and down over the years.
Speaker 1: How did you change, or did you change the focus of the paper?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure I changed the focus as much as I think I improved the quality.  I think I did a lot of outreach.  I think I improved the paper's standing in the community.  Public relations and outreach was very important to me, and I did a lot of that.  I did a lot of the writing.  I did the editorials, and that was important to me.  And, I increased the, the staff a little bit.  Not a lot, but a little bit.
Story_ID: 95034
Speaker 1: For those of us who may not know Daisy Bates except as a name, an icon if you will, The Civil Rights Movement, would you talk to us about Daisy Bates and her influence and impact on you?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.  She was, she was definitely my mentor.  The first time I met Daily Bates, I was sixteen years old.  And, the way I met her was that I was a junior in high school and I heard that she needed someone to work for her.  And, she didn't have the newspaper at this time.  She was running a self-help program in a little town called Mitchellville.  And, my father drove me down to her office, and I was gonna interview for her help, her clerical help.  And, I went in and I saw this woman who I thought was gorgeous and, you know, little petite woman that had such a presence, wonderful presence.  And, she said, "Okay, can I help you?"  And, I told her I was there to interview for her job that I heard she had.  She said, "Okay."  She had a little typewriter, manual typewriter and she asked me to type.  She gave me a sheet a paper and asked me to type.  And, gave me a book, I don't know, a dictionary or something, it wasn't (laughter)--it was something that she just wanted me to type for a few minutes.  And, I did.  And, then she came back and said, "Okay, it time."  So, I gave her the sheet of paper and it was filled with mistakes.  And, she said, "Well, you don't fit.  You don't fit.  But, you should come back.  You take typing.  You go, go back to school and you take typing, and come back to me next summer."  And, I didn't come back to her next summer, but I never forgot that.  And, my father had always told us, you know, about the role she had played in the, in the 1957 integration crisis [Little Rock Crisis], so I knew what a great woman she was.  So, I never forgot that.  At least, I had that opportunity to meet her.  So, when I find out that she had open--reopened the newspaper, I had kinda kept up with her, what she was doing and all.  But, she was, she's a great woman.  She passed a couple of years ago.  But, she--I think a lot of people considered her our Civil Rights activist; Little Rocks' and Arkansas' Civil Rights activist.  She, she sacrificed a lot to try to make things different for Arkansas.  And, you know, there is no telling what she could have done, or what she could have been if she had giving up on Arkansas, but she didn't.  And, we have, you know, we're all very, very, grateful to her.
Speaker 1: What did your father [James Kearney] tell you specifically?  What do you recall him telling you about Mrs. Bates, and the time in which she was so active?
Speaker 2: Basically, about her, he told us that she was one of the women who, she was a woman--and back in those days my father was definitely a southern Baptist.  So, he thought it was great that this woman had taken such a strong stance, and had played such an important role in the whole integration crisis.  My father was very outspoken when it came to race relations and integration.  So, he, he did talk about the 1957 integration crisis for a long time.  He thought it was great the, you know, that we were able to do that in Arkansas, because he always thought we were backwards when it came to the races.  We just didn't move forward as fast as we should have.  So, he was very proud to have someone like Daisy Bates in Arkansas who made a difference.
Story_ID: 95035
Speaker 1: Well we've just heard something that we hadn't heard earlier, and the context in which your father [James Kearney] was also outspoken.  How did that manifest in your, in your life, or in your household, in your father's activism?
Speaker 2: And, I wouldn't, I'm not sure I would call it activism.  But, he was a person who said exactly what he thought.  And, he was very clear on what he felt about race relations in Arkansas.  And, how he felt that the African American race was, should be equal to any other race.  And, that it took people like Daisy Bates sometimes to change things.  And, he was, he--I don't think I would call him an activist.  Except, that he was a person who always, he would speak to people who he didn't feel were very politically astute, and tell them what he thought the way that we should go as far as politics.  And, he would make sure that people who didn't have a ride to the polls, he would pick them up and take them to the polls.  Because, he felt that people had died for votes and he just couldn't understand anybody that wouldn't use their right to vote.
Speaker 1: His reference to--your reference to your father's sense of Mrs. Bates, or admiration for her, you said, he was a Baptist and--what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Just that she was a woman.  She was a woman, and I think traditionally Baptist males and Baptist feel that women had a certain place and men have a certain place.  But, she was a woman who stood out from it.  She was a woman who took a giant step and she, she sacrificed a lot.
Speaker 1: Your meeting her at sixteen knowing the history, as told by your father, affected you in what way?
Speaker 2: I think I always, in the back of my mind, thought this is a woman I'd like to emulate in some way or another.  I was very inspired by her.  I was in awe of her when I met her.  But, I was inspired by the fact that women can do things, you know, the same thing in many cases that men can.
Story_ID: 95036
Speaker 1: So, we move forward.  It's now--you're now joining her [Daisy Bates]--as managing editor and what was your interaction with her like at that time?
Speaker 2: She was, she was ill at the time and she had had several strokes by that time.  So, she had a speech impediment.  She wasn't able to talk well where you could understand her all the time.  But, we had a very warm and cordial relationship.  I think she felt very good about me.  She was very grateful that I had come.  I was very grateful to her that she had hired me.  She told me at one time, well this was a later time of when she decided she was gonna retire, three month after I went to work for her.  And, which, you know, that was a big deal for me because I was saying, Okay, I've decided I was gonna change my life and then you--I find out that you're gonna retire.  But, God or somebody was watching over me.  And, the next day after she told me she was gonna retire, I went back and said, "I'd like to buy your paper."  And, I did.  She gave, she would've given it to me, I think (laughter).  But, she allowed me to pay partial for it and she allowed me to pay the rest monthly, because she felt good about the fact that I wanted to run the newspaper [Arkansas State Press].  So, that--it was a--one of the greatest things that could have happened to me.
Speaker 1: What was, what was the experience like for you?  You now, you've been running a paper for three months.  You've now purchased the paper, it's yours.  At the same time, you wanna keep up a tradition and then move it to a different level.  What was typically?  What kinds of significant experiences or challenging experiences did you have?
Speaker 2: The challenge was to learn everything there was to know (laughter) about running a newspaper.  Because, as you mentioned before, it was a very small staff.  And, we could not afford a large staff at that time.  So, I really did, I ended up learning things I could not have imagined.  Like, developing pictures.  Taking pictures and then coming back at night and developing them in the dark room.  Traveling all over the state to interview people, then coming back and having to write the stories myself.  Staying up all night with the person who ran the printer to make sure that the newspaper got in.  I was up twenty to twenty-four hours, very often, very often, and that was not unusual.  I don't think for newspapers that size, but certainly it was an eye opener for me.
Speaker 1: What else did you learn besides photograph and, obviously using interviewing skills, paper has to be--
Speaker 2: I learned layout.  I learned, I learned just about everything there is to know.  I learned advertisement.  I ended up a lot of times going out and soliciting ads.  The PR part of it; I learned how to do that as well.  I learned what needed to be done even if I got to the point where I, I could bring somebody in.  I knew their job as well as they did.
Speaker 1: Was there something that stood out as the most challenging for you when you took over the paper and were learning?
Speaker 2: The advertisement, probably.  Because, that was, that was the challenge for any newspaper.  But, certainly for a small, small newspaper the way we were, and in a, in a small southern town, southern city.  So, that was a, that was a challenge ongoing, I would say.  Making sure that you had enough ads to pay for the newspaper.
Story_ID: 95037
Speaker 1: You are now an entrepreneur, a publisher, and you're wearing multiple hats, but you're also a parent at this time, also.  Your son is about what age when you take over the paper [Arkansas State Press]?
Speaker 2: My son was fourteen, I think when I took over the paper.
Speaker 1: Fourteen?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did you balance family life, the care of your child with running an enterprise?
Speaker 2: As I think back, not as well as I would have liked, because my son and I were very, very close.  And, I missed a lot of the time that I wished now that I could have spent with him.  Of course, he tells me he understood.  And, a lot of time, I would bring him to the newspaper to be with me and help out or whatever.  But, that did change the relationship to a certain extent, and at a time when I think it was very important for me to spend time with my son at the age of fourteen.  So, if there's one thing I do regret, if there's anything, it would be that I didn't spend the amount of time I would have liked to with my son during that time.
Speaker 1: You said, "changed the relationship."  In what way?
Speaker 2: Well, he was growing--I mean, at fourteen (laughter) they're changing anyway, I mean, because they feel as if they don't really need you as much.  But, I was kind of a doting mother and very close to him.  And, I would've spent a lot more time with him if I hadn't had to be at the newspaper as much as I did.
Speaker 1: And, you hold on to the paper for how long?
Speaker 2: For five years.
Speaker 1: And, that's now what year?
Speaker 2: That's 1993.
Speaker 1: What's the most significant or outstanding experience for you, or event for you, during that period of newspaper ownership?
Speaker 2: I think I became a much stronger person.  I became more political, not in politics, but in how to deal with people.  And, I learned that I enjoyed people a lot more than I thought I did.
Story_ID: 95038
Speaker 1: What we were discussing is, you now own the paper [Arkansas State Press].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, you had it for five years.  Let's talk about how you changed, not changed the contents so much, but how you built the paper when you took it over.  What was the size?  How many subscribers?  You talked about advertising being a challenge.
Speaker 2: One of the things that we did was we did a full-fledged effort to increase the number of subscribers.  We did advertisement for the newspaper.  We did billboards.  We went on television.  They had cable station back then that we could go on and talk about our newspaper.  We became--we started a, a weekly program where we came on and talked about--it was a news program and we were the presenters, and we did that.  But, we found ways to get ourselves out there and become a part of the community in a much larger way.
Speaker 1: When you purchased the paper, how much did you pay for the paper?
Speaker 2: Forty-seven thousand dollars.  That was the total price.  I paid $10,000, and the rest I was able to pay over a five--three year period.
Speaker 1: Over three?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And your advertising base.  How many advertisers did you have at that time?  Or, what was the advertising dollars at that time?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you exactly how much the advertising dollars were.  I know that it increased a great deal during the five years I was there.  We were probably, I'd say twenty-five percent to thirty percent the first year we had it, and it increased from there.  But, we began to get a different type of advertisement; the more national advertisements.  We went out and, you know, made our self known to people inside the state, and got advertisements from different businesses that we hadn't before.
Speaker 1: You said the demise of the paper previously had to do with content of the time.  Was there a relationship to the changes that you made in the paper in terms of content that spurred the attraction of national advertisers as well as state advertisers?
Speaker 2: I can't say for sure.  I would like to think, and I was told that the quality of the newspaper increased a great deal.  We tried to deliver news, as well as, entertainment and education, things that people, the community would be interested in.  We tried to keep up with what was happening in the state and made sure that we kept people abreast of that.  I think it's that we, we tried very hard to get out in the community and become a part of the community.  I think that helped us more than anything; the outreach to the community.  And, my taking a role as a, I guess basically, as a community leader.  People identified me with the newspaper and I think that helped in a lot of ways.  I became a part of different organizations, and committees, and task forces, and all kinds of different things like that.
Speaker 1: So, this shy person that you were as a younger person, turns out to be more outspoken when you become--
Speaker 2: Out of necessity.  Yes.  (Laughter) yes.
Speaker 1: And, you're at the paper for how long?
Speaker 2: I was there until '93 [1993]; until January '93.
Story_ID: 95039
Speaker 1: And what changed?  What brought about change?
Speaker 2: What changed was that Bill Clinton decided to run for President.  And, I got an opportunity to work in his campaign in 1992.  And, I took a sabbatical from the newspaper.  It was a hard decision, but I decided I was gonna take a sabbatical from the newspaper.  And, I had an editor who I had a lot of faith in who ran it during that time.  And, in '93 [1993] when I was trying to decide, okay, I'm gonna go back to the newspaper, these are the things I've decided we're gonna change at the newspaper, we're gonna do.  I was offered a job at the White House.  I was offered an opportunity to go to the White House with the President.  And, I did.  So, I hired someone to become the publisher of the newspaper.
Speaker 1: So, in 1992, you become involved in the presidential campaign?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: For William Jefferson Clinton?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that like?  What were you doing and what was that like?
Speaker 2: I was working in the Press Office in headquarters.  I worked with Dee Dee Myers, Avis LaVelle [HM], the two press secretaries.  And, I was Minority Media Outreach.  So, I did basically all of the press and media that had to do with the minority community.  I interviewed people.  I brought people in to do radio spots.  I did flyers that went out all over the country.  I did press releases.  If the President made a statement or, you know, did something that we thought was newsworthy, we did press releases and sent them out to the news, news outlets.
Speaker 1: How do you get to work in a presidential campaign?  Did you know Bill Clinton before?
Speaker 2: I did.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And, when did you meet?
Speaker 2: I met Bill Clinton indirectly in the late '70s [1970s].  As I was leaving the University of Arkansas, he was coming to the University of Arkansas [Fayetteville] as a professor, law professor.  I got to know Bill Clinton in the late '70s, early '80s [1980s] when he was Attorney General, then Governor of Arkansas, and I was working in state government.
Speaker 1: You got to know him when he was Attorney General?  In what way did you get to know him?  Then, were you active in the campaign at that time?
Speaker 2: I was not active in the campaign, but I had friends.  I had family who worked for him.  I had a brother who worked in his Attorney General's Office.  I had a number of friends who worked with him.  And, I did indirectly work for the campaigns.  Not on any real job, but I would sometimes come down.  But, I basically got to know him through my family.
Speaker 1: Your brother worked for him?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: In what capacity?
Speaker 2: He was the govern--he was attorney in the Attorney General's Office.  Governor Clinton was the first attorney general to bring in more than one African American into the Attorney General's Office.
Speaker 1: What had your brother been doing before that?
Speaker 2: He was an attorney.
Speaker 1: Practicing in?
Speaker 2: In Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Privately?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, you went into the Attorney General's Office and that's how, that was your first contact with Bill Clinton?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, what followed?
Speaker 2: What followed was that, when he became governor, I was still working for state government.  So, one of the things he would do was to, to visit each state agency.  And, my brother happened to be the liaison.  He was also in the Governor's Office.  He was the liaison to the agency that I worked for.  And, when Governor Clinton came to visit our agency, my brother was with him.  So, again, I met him along with my brother.  And, I think that was the first time that we actually knew each other and from then on, we kind of knew each other.
Speaker 1: It's 1992, and you've joined the campaign as a press officer.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, you're in charge of minority media.  This is national, or is it just regional?
Speaker 2: No.  It's national.  I worked in the headquarters.  Little Rock [Arkansas] was the headquarters for the campaign, and I was minority media for the whole country.
Story_ID: 95040
Speaker 1: What does that involve?  I mean, for those of us that don't know.  What is it like being a press officer with outreach to specific segment of the media?  What's a typical day like?  And, what are the responsibilities really?
Speaker 2: You are like the contact person, or the liaison or whatever, between the headquarters and the minority media press all over the country.  If someone's looking for a story, looking for an interview, wanting to come and do like a video, you know, story, then they come through you.  If it's a minority media outlet.  Also, we were responsible for writing.  We did brochures that were used during the campaign.  We were responsible for bringing people in and interviewing them for stories.  We were responsible for coordinating radio interviews, which we had set up there at the headquarters.  We would bring people in and actually do interviews, radio interviews.
Speaker 1: I guess, what I don't understand is, and if you would help me understand this, is you say "we."  Specifically, what was your day like and your specific responsibility in this organization or environment?
Speaker 2: We is, when I say we, I mean the Press Office.  And, that was Dee Dee Myers.  That was Avis LaVelle [HM].  And, that was myself.  And, that was a few other people that worked with us.  But, it was specifically my responsibility to coordinate minority media outreach.
Speaker 1: What was your day like?
Speaker 2: I came to work very early.  I left very late.  And, all day long, I was either on the phone with someone talking; the media or someone wanting an interview or whatever.  Or, I was calling to bring someone in, because we needed to get a blurb from them to go into a press release or something like that.  So, it was a, it was a long day.  It was, it was as long sometimes as my days were at the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Dee Dee Myers become a personality in and of herself.  What was it like, your working with her?
Speaker 2: I, actually, Dee Dee Myers was very soft-spoken.  The Dee Dee Myers that I knew from the campaign, she wasn't as much of a personality at that time, actually.  I worked with Avis LaVelle probably more than I did with Dee Dee Myers.
Speaker 1: And, who's Avis?
Speaker 2: Avis was the other press secretary from Chicago [Illinois], who is now back in Chicago.  But, she worked very closely with the President as his press secretary.
Speaker 1: Would you described these people to us that we don't know?  Avis is an African American woman, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She is an African American woman.  And, Dee Dee Myers is a white woman.
Speaker 1: You work in the campaign throughout 1992.  The President, well, the President-elect, then you're invited to join the team at the White House.  Do you accept right away?
Speaker 2: I think I accepted the next day.  They offered, or asked one day and I went home and I came back and said, "Yes."
Speaker 1: What was the offer specifically to do?
Speaker 2: Minor--Not minority media, it was Media Affairs.  There's an office called Media Affairs in the White House.  And, they ask if I wanted to be one of the officers.  They had, like, several officers who worked in Media Affairs.  And, I was offered one of those positions.
Speaker 1: When you envisioned your life, and you were thinking about your--what was before you.  Did you anticipate or envisioned having such an opportunity?
Speaker 2: No.  Because I didn't know (laughter) such an opportunity was available.  One of the things I tell people is that my parents taught us to dream.  If there's one thing that I am very proud of, is the fact that my parents told us we could dream to be whatever we wanted to be.  And, we did.  We did.  But, I never envisioned, there are something that you can dre--you don't even envision that are possibilities.  So, no, this would not have been one of the dreams that I would have even known to think about.  There was--
Speaker 1: Did you think about it when you working in the campaign?
Speaker 2: I actually didn't.  And, that's even hard for me to believe.  But, when I was working on the campaign, I was thinking after the campaign I was gonna return to the newspaper [Arkansas State Press].  And, I never, I never thought about going to the White House.
Story_ID: 95041
Speaker 1: I'd like to get a sense of what a political campaign for the presidency looks and feels like on a day-to-day basis for someone like yourself that was working inside that campaign.  What, what was, would you described that for us?
Speaker 2: Lots of people, very loud, lots of phones ringing.  There was a scheduling office.  A huge scheduling office that took care of all of his travel, took care of this--the traveling, the schedulers and communications people worked very closely together, scheduling his [Bill Clinton] interviews, scheduling his presentations.  So, that was--it was a very busy place.  And, it's like you knew what your little role was, but also you--from time to time, you were kind of shuttled off into other people's roles.  It was a very hectic, very hectic environment that somehow worked.
Speaker 1: Did you feel prepared for what you were doing?
Speaker 2: I felt definitely prepared for what I was doing.  I didn't--I had no idea what a presidential campaign was like.  (Laughter) I wasn't prepared for that.  But, it was a great experience.  It was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Can you recount for us, some of, some of your surprises or memorable experiences from the campaign at this point?
Speaker 2: I think the passion (laughter) that came to play from day-to-day.  And, that's for lack of a better word.  Some of the disagreement between people who we were all working toward the same thing.  But, there was all--more than one way to get to that one thing.  So, there were all these people, very bright people who had different ideas about how we go about it.  And, I found that, you know, kind of an eye opener.  Different kinds of people, there were all kinds of different people that were converged there to see that this man become President.
Speaker 1: Describe that for me, if you will, when you say converged there.  Because, you, you would naturally think that this is an Arkansas experience.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  No.  Yes, this was, this was people from all over the country.  And, from the Midwest, from the North, lots of people from New York, people who had worked in campaigns before.  A number of people who had worked for presidential campaigns before.  So, it was a hodgepodge of people.  There were Arkansans but by no means was Arkansas over, you know, overly represented.
Speaker 1: Was it, when you say, well, yes, obviously people worked in other campaigns perhaps it should be obvious that they would be working in this one.  What was the opportunity for--this was your first campaign.  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: It was certain my first presidential campaign.  I had worked for--in gubernatorial campaigns, but not in any official way.  I had just done things like, done mailings or something like that.  But, no, not in any--
Speaker 1: As a volunteer?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 95042
Speaker 1: Is there a particular story that you could recall or an incident?  I understand the environment with an eclectic group of people, but is there something that's particularly memorable for you, you're writing a book so--from that experience, that year of the campaign?
Speaker 2: I'm writing a book, but that doesn't include the campaign.  But, I can just remember, I guess, the most memorable thing would be just the response from these people from all over the country to Bill Clinton.  I think it might have been right before the nomination when he came in and spoke to the, you know, the people who worked there at the campaign headquarters.  And, just their reaction to him.  And, some of these people, and it's my understanding, before they came on, had no idea who he was, had no idea that he could ever come close to winning.  You know, had these really, really archaic thoughts about Arkansas, you know.  Here's this man from this little bitty town (laughter), Arkansas, who's got the gall to run for President.  Some of these people really came all the way to the other side when Bill Clinton spoke.  Or, when he, you know, when he told them what he had in mind, or in his heart for America.  I cou--I just could see visually how people change their mind about him, and about his presidency.  And, this was right before he was nominated.
Speaker 1: So, before the nomination, and so even in a campaign there are doubters, people who aren't sure that the person their working for?
Speaker 2: I--Well, for sure before they came on, there were doubters.  Some of these people that were working there had been doubters, but I think they had decided that he was the best person.
Speaker 1: When did he come in to speak to the group and you saw this change of heart, change of mind?  Do you recall?
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly when.  I just know it was right before the nomination, before that took place.  And, it was just a very eye-opening experience for me that he really--I could see him changing minds when he spoke.
Speaker 1: What did that feel like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was very proud.  And, I think a lot of us from Arkansas always thought he could become President.  We always had a great amount of confidence in his abilities.  We believed in him from the beginning.  I think other people had to be convinced.
Story_ID: 95043
Speaker 1: What was nomination like, that experience?  You're there at the nominating convention.  What are you doing?
Speaker 2: Standing with a bunch of Arkansans, going crazy (laughter) when the nomination is announced.  We--it was a, it was a great night.  It was an awe-inspiring night.  I think we felt like we had worked really hard, and we were seeing it payoff.  And, we were seeing something happen that we knew could happen, but the rest of America was being surprised, I think.
Speaker 1: Who were you with?  And, where were you situated in the hall?
Speaker 2: We were, we had some pretty good seats down near the stage.  But, I was with a lot of the people that had worked in the campaign.  A group of us had come together--there were busses of campaign people, people who had worked for him in the Governor's Office.  People who were called friends of Bill, that just, I mean, paid their way there, volunteers.  There were huge numbers of Arkansans there.
Speaker 1: When you leave the local, which actually was the hub, the National Campaign Office and move to the convention center for the nomination, what role if any, are you playing then still?  He's, he's not yet nominated, so what's happening and what are you doing?
Speaker 2: I'm still in the press mode.  I'm still--there was a Press Office there at the convention.  And, I was a part of the Press Office.  There were still news stories.  There were still interviews, there were--I mean, it went crazy then because people were very interested in interviews.  There were still, you know, news releases that needed to be done.  So, I was a part of the Press Office then.
Speaker 1: How large a contingency, how large is that staff?  And, had you role change from the Arkansas office to this office?
Speaker 2: Basically, my role during the convention was media, period.  I mean, everybody that was there was media.  You just did what needed to be done.  I think everybody was kind of on the same playing field once we got to the convention.  And, the size didn't really change.  I can't remember, probably ten people.  Ten or, your know, were there trying to make things happen with the media and try to take care of the media and their requests and queries and--
Speaker 1: In addition to working hard as you have all along, what new experiences in a familiar role, someone who's moved to that level, are there difference?  And, how are you feeling and how are you managing that?  Are you learning anything that you didn't already know?
Speaker 2: The difference was that I was in a political arena, which I hadn't been in before.  And, it was a larger arena, and it was a national arena.  So, I was dealing with a whole different environment.  And, it was very exciting, I have to tell you.  It was exciting, and I did learn a lot.  I think, mostly though, I used a lot of what I've learned over the years in how to deal with people.  Again, my ability to talk to people a certain way and get the information that I felt I needed.  To give people what they needed without, you know, antagonizing them.  Because a lot of times, that was the thing they worried about with press people.
Speaker 1: Well frankly, I was just gonna ask you, you're moving from a regional press and some, well embedded or assigned reporters to a candidate.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, even if he looks like he's going to get the nomination, the Washington Press Corp alone has a reputation for being beastly, and then the national press and I'm assuming that there's press from--
Speaker 2: International.
Speaker 1: International press.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: It was huge.
Speaker 1: Describe for us, your involve--well, not your involvement as much as, how you were processing that and handling that?
Speaker 2: I think I took it for granted.  I knew that was a part of the job when I, when I got it.  And, I took it one day at a time.  And, when something that I hadn't done before suddenly became something that I had to do, I handled it pretty well.  I mean, I, I--if I needed to research it, if I needed to find out, okay, how is this done?  I've never done it before.  Then I did that.  But, I never, you know, I never, like, stressed over it, or I wasn't a person who would take a lot of time worrying about something because I hadn't done it before.  I would take it, like a bite at a time.  I'd learn it and I'd do it.
Speaker 1: Can you think of anything in particular that you were challenged with that you hadn't done before that you had to?
Speaker 2: Just the volume of press that I had to be involved with, that I had to deal with.  And, I think we mentioned international press; that was part of that.  But, I think I found that as much exhilarating as I did challenging.  But, that was the kind of thing that I did that I'd never done before.

Speaker 1: Campaigns are volatile and demanding environments.  This particular candidate [Bill Clinton]came with a lot of volatility.  You talked earlier, or you mentioned change of hearts of minds, you could see that happening within the campaign staff because he shared his visions.  What were the issues that you recall that were on the table at the time that--and what was your reaction to, not only how he was handling or addressing them, but your role in getting that out to the community?
Speaker 2: I--Education was always a big deal with him as governor and that became--that was an issue during his--the time that he ran for President as well.  There was some personal issues that took up a lot of time during his campaign.  We dealt with that in different ways.  I was not a person who dealt with that on a day-to-day basis.  That was people like Dee Dee Myers and Avis LaVelle [HM] who dealt with that.  But, we were, you know, I think most of us felt like, we have a job to do and we're gonna do it.  And, some of these more sensitive issues, we've got people that deal with that, and we went from day-to-day in that mode.
Speaker 1: We're gonna stop there.  We gonna stop here and then we'll start again.
Story_ID: 95045
Speaker 1: We were discussing the campaign, and your role as a press officer in the campaign.  If you could, paint a picture for us in terms of a day.  But, especially those things that are unplanned that pop up that are perhaps sensitive or controversial.  What is the impact?  How do you manage that process?
Speaker 2: Basically, my job, I was, I was minority outreach person and some of those more controversial issues that popped up, I was not the person that was directly responsible for, for coordinating that.  But, if it did come up in, you know, in my interactions with the minority media, I dealt with it on a one-to-one basis.  I explained it the best way I could without getting into details that would--that had no bearing on his role as a candidate for President.  Hopefully, and I believe I had a good relationship with most of the media that I dealt with.  I think, honesty and just trying to be above board, and giving them the information as straight as I could at most times.
Speaker 1: You're working for two women who've become household names for us, Dee Dee Myers.  She's projected as a tough media person.  What was she like and what was her influence on you on a daily basis or in your capacity as media press officer, ethnic press officer?
Speaker 2: Dee Dee Myers and I did not have a lot of interaction.  She and Avis LaVelle [HM] had more interaction.  They shared the responsibility of serving as press secretary to the President.  My role was more in interacting with Avis LaVelle.  And, I found them to be both; I found them both to be, from my perspective, easy to work with.  They had controversial issues that they had to deal with and sometimes I could see their reaction to that which was, you know, pretty stress related.  But, thank goodness I wasn't responsible for that.
Speaker 1: Who was Avis Lavelle and how did she get to Arkansas, was she an Arkansan?
Speaker 2: No.  Avis actually came from Chicago [Illinois].  And, my understanding is that she was in politics in Chicago.  She worked for Mayor [Richard M.] Daley for some time.  She was a past journalist and brought a great deal of experience to the [Bill] Clinton campaign.  I think, everybody thought that he made a great choice in bringing her there.
Story_ID: 95046
Speaker 1: I'm curious about how one becomes part of a presidential press team.  How did, how, how does that happen for you and for others?
Speaker 2: As you know, they're always looking for people.  When they first start a campaign, you need bodies.  You need people who'll, who'll do just about anything to get the man or woman elected.  So, the media, the Press Office at that time needed at least a couple of people that could, that could coordinate minority media.  And, I knew a number of people who were working on the campaign who told me that, and asked if I was interested in applying for that.  And, I did.  And, I talked with Avis LaVelle [HM], who actually hired me.  We had a great conversation.  I immediately liked her and had great respect for her.  And, she hired me, and that's who I worked for.
Speaker 1: Does everybody start at the level of have, of managing a press corps, a particular segment of the press corps?
Speaker 2: No.  No, there is people at all levels.  There are people who come in just as volunteers.  There are people who are what you call gofers.  There are people who are assistants.  Basically, people who just do whatever is needed for a person who manages.  So, there were, there were all kinds of different levels.  There were lots of young people at the campaign, because you always look for young people because they have the energy.  They have the stamina, and they don't have families to, to worry about.  So, you'll always find lots of young people, young, idealistic people in the campaign.  And, then there were people who had been around and had worked for other campaigns and who knew the ropes, knew the political ropes.  And, you had people who had been with Bill Clinton for a long time and who knew Bill Clinton and believed in him.  So, there were, you know, these different groups of people who made up the campaign.
Story_ID: 95047
Speaker 1: Well, we progress to nomination.  He [Bill Clinton] receives the nomination.  What is the effect on you?  How does your job change, where you continue to work?
Speaker 2: After the nomination, he had what they call the Transition Office.  We actually moved physically to another building.  And, I guess about half the people who had worked in the campaign, maybe a third, maybe, probably a third of the people who had worked in the campaign moved over the Transition Office which was basically preparing to send him to Washington [D.C.], doing the things that needed to be done in the interim.  So, it was a smaller staff.  And, it wasn't so, you know, you didn't work from dawn till midnight as much.  But, you did something every day that would make it easier for him to transition from Arkansas to the White House.
Speaker 1: There're names that have come up and, and we all know about them.  There is Ron Brown who became Secretary of Commerce, Alexis Herman [HM], who became Secretary of Labor.  And, our understanding is that they in fact were campaign officers and actually campaign chair and co-chairs.  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: At the level of functioning that you were, what is your interaction with and how soon do you see them more involved in making that transition?
Speaker 2: I actually saw Alexis and had just very brief interactions with Alexis during the campaign.  She came down and spent some time at the campaign, did meetings with the President and with his campaign managers.  Mr. Brown, I did not see until after the, actually after the nomination, at the nomi--during the convention.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying it's not typically then for press officers in the role that you were in, really interacting with the national campaign staff on a regular basis?
Speaker 2: No.  No, not, not at all.
Speaker 1: And, what's a transition period like for you?  How are you involved?
Speaker 2: I was basically doing some of the same things I was doing at the campaign as far as media.  Taking care of media requests and needs, and there were a lot of request for interviews.  There were requests for packets of information with photos and things like that.  We did press releases, basically the same thing.  We also knew that we were winding up.  It was, you know, very close to the end of the campaign and end of the transition.  And, people would be moving either back to their old jobs, or to Washington, D.C.  So, in the back of everybody's mind, they were kinda deciding.  This time, this was the time for them to decide, what am I gonna do after this?
Speaker 1: Who's on the transition team?  Do you recall any outstanding or personalities that we would recognize?
Speaker 2: Mack McLarty, Eli Segal, I'm trying to think, Rahm Emanuel may have been.  Dee Dee Myers was there.
Speaker 1: What happens--
Speaker 2: Harold [M.] Ickes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What happens to the campaign chair and co-chair as in Ron Brown and Alexis Herman in a transition period?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what usually happens, but in this, in this case, they both got co-opted into the Clinton (laughter) Administration.  They became Clinton cabinet members.
Speaker 1: Well, I meant more or less, like, what was happening or what are they doing during transition.
Speaker 2: I did not see them.  But, I did know they had already been nominated.  They had been chosen to become a part of the cabinet.  Become part of his cabinet.
Speaker 1: You're offered--you're one of those people on the transition team, in the Transition Office that gets an offer.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And it took you?
Speaker 2: A night.
Speaker 1: How long, one night?
Speaker 2: One night.
Speaker 1: Less than 24 hours?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How soon did you move to Washington?
Speaker 2: I moved in January, January 15th, I think.  I was there a few days before his actual inauguration.  I was sent up to do some preliminary.  There were a few people sent up to do some preliminary work before the actual inauguration, and I was one of those people.
Speaker 1: And, where are you now?  Are you at the Inaugural Committee Office, or do you move into the White House?
Speaker 2: Up until January 20th, I was in the Inaugural Committee Office.
Speaker 1: And, that's where?
Speaker 2: You know what? I can't remember where it was.  But, we stayed in a hotel there.
Speaker 1: I think--is that the Naval Base in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think--
Speaker 1: The Inaugural Committee?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, what is that environment like, an Inaugural Committee and your press relations?  Are you still doing minority press at this point?
Speaker 2: I'm still doing, just doing press.  I was doing press relations.
Speaker 1: So, you're no longer doing just minority press, you're doing all press?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 95048
Speaker 1: Who are you meeting at this time in your new capacity, your expanded capacity?
Speaker 2: A lot of the--
Speaker 1: In this new environment?
Speaker 2: A lot of the same people that were, some of the same people that were in the campaign came up and were a part of that shop.  And, then there were other people who had been brought on that were not part of the campaign.  So, I met--and then there were people who were interested, the press people, who were still interested in us giving them information and giving them packets and learning about what's gonna happen with the inauguration.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what that's like.  What--give us an insider view of an inaugural committee, the preparation for inaugurating a new President?
Speaker 2: I can only tell you about the (laughter) press area because that's all I know about.  But, that was exciting.  It was very exciting.  I mean, it was nonstop.  There was so much interest in this man's inauguration.  There was lots of international interest.  So, we got lots and lots of requests from people, from all over the world wanting to come, wanting invitations, wanting, you know, press passes, things like that.  So, it was a very exciting time.
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of how large the Inaugural Committee staff was?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I know it was large.
Speaker 1: And, what kind of divisions there may have been?  That's a massive undertaking when you look at all the events and every one of them has to be covered by the press.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  It was large.  I wish I could tell you exactly how large, but I can't.  I just know there were a lot of people involved in that.
Speaker 1: How do you manage press for, how many days of events, because it starts before?
Speaker 2: It was about a week.  It was about a week, and it was nonstop.  It was very exhausting.  And, as many people as there were involved, we probably needed twice as many, because there really, really were people from all over the world that we had to take care of, as far as media and press.
Speaker 1: Being a media person is really almost a twenty-four hour a day job.  So, in this environment, what was your typical day?  Well, maybe it's not a typical day, but give of a sense of a day in the life of Janis.
Speaker 2: I--We usually had to get to the office around 7:00 in the morning.  And, we would go to work at that time, answering, or responding to requests, getting on the phone.  Sometimes, we'd be on the phone for hours during the day, setting up interviews, sending out stuff to people, sending out, faxing out.  And, we'd be there doing basically the same thing over and over, but to different people all over the world and all over the country, until late at night.
Speaker 1: And, late at night meant?
Speaker 2: Nine, ten, eleven.  And, you went to bed and you'd get back up and you'd (laughter) do the same thing for whatever number of days those were, probably five or six or seven days.
Speaker 1: And, who are you reporting to at this time, the same people?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, that's--
Speaker 2: Basically, I--Dee Dee [Myers] was kind of over that whole process.
Speaker 1: And, where is Avis LaVelle [HM] in this process?
Speaker 2: Avis LaVelle at that point, I think was with the Transition Office in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: And, the Inaugural Committee, of course, is in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: But, separate from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 95049
Speaker 1: So, inauguration day, describe for us, the sights, the sounds, the smells.  I mean, we don't get--we're on the sidewalk and we're watching the parade.  And, maybe we're fortunate enough to have an invitation or a ticket to something, so?
Speaker 2: Well, you're gonna be very disappointed because, I was not a part of that.  Inaugural day was memorable to me because, I got to go to the White House that day.  That was the day that we transferred from the Committee Office to the White House.  That was, that was one of those days you pinch yourself to see if you're still human.  That you're still walking on the ground.  Because to go into that gate and walk into the White House and know that you're one of these people now, you're a part of this, was a once in a million-million lifetimes for me.  As I was walking through that gate, I was thinking about my father [James Kearney], because I knew he was thinking about me.  I knew he was watching television and seeing if he could see his daughter.  I was thinking of my mother [Ethel Curry Kearney], who had died in 1982, and wasn't able to see me.  I was thinking of my sister who had passed in 1987, my friend, my best friend.  I was thinking about all those days I'd spend in Gould, Arkansas, and how so many people had expected so little of my family.  And, it was one of those days that I was so grateful.  So, grateful for a blessing that I never could have dreamed of.  As much as I dreamed, I never could have dreamed of that.
Speaker 1: That's a complex, the White House is a complex and most people don't realize that it's a complex.  Which gate did you use and where did you go?  We're now more familiar with the interior of the White House because of West Wing then before--so, which gate did you use to enter?
Speaker 2: I went through the Northwest Gate and I went into the Press Office, which is in the, it's in the main office.  It's in the main White House.  So, I went into the Press Office and that's where we spent all of that, all of that day, watching the inaugural.  It was like, full of mostly young people.  Mostly young people made up that office.  And, we spent that day, a lot of us crying, a lot of us just very exhausted, but very, very happy to see that day come to pass.  So, that's where, that was the inaugural day.
Story_ID: 95050
Speaker 1: What else were you doing other than watching and feeling all the emotion?
Speaker 2: I think, we were trying to decide where we're gonna end up, because everybody wasn't gonna be in that office.  So, I don't think we did it this day, but the next day we ended up taking our journey to the old Executive Office Building, which is actually, where the Media Affairs Office is.  And, that was an experience in itself, because when you first go into the White House after another President has left, there's nothing there.  I mean, everything is like, bare.  So, we had to find our desk, our chairs, our sofas, our televisions.  We had to kinda decorate our offices.  And, there were furniture placed in the hallways.  So, for probably two or three days or maybe even a week, people were pulling from that stash of furniture and decorating their offices.  Which is something you never think about, this is what you're gonna do when you go to the White House.  But, that was part of it.
Speaker 1: Which Press Office did you physically wind up in, the one in the White House, in which wing of the White House, or the one in the old [Eisenhower] Executive Office Building?
Speaker 2: I was in the Media Affairs Office, which is in the old Executive Office Building.  Yes.
Story_ID: 95051
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, how does that work then?  Who are you reporting to at that time?
Speaker 2: At that point, Dee Dee Myers was the press secretary.  Jeff Eller was head of Media Affairs.  So, Jeff Eller was my supervisor.
Speaker 1: And, how large is this team at this time?
Speaker 2: There were about twelve people.
Speaker 1: Reporting to Jeff Eller?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What are you doing?  What's your assignment and how soon do you start once you find your desk?
Speaker 2: We start immediately (laughter) whether we have a desk or not (laughter).  Because there's all these--already we have all these request.  We have all these responsibilities already, so we start immediately.  And, we do outreach.  The Media Affairs Office does lots of outreach to press.  We don't do the real day-to-day controversial things.  We do the, the long term things.  We forge relationships with the media.  We do a lot of the relationship building with international press, because there's people wanting to forge those.  So, we were a part of the larger, larger vision of press.  Rather than Dee Dee [Myers]'s area which did the day-to-day answering questions; what is the President doing now and, you know.  Ours was a more equ--the equilibrium was more even.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who worked in the office with you and what the racial makeup of the office was?
Speaker 2: There were about twelve people.  There were three African Americans, three women.  I was one.  There was a woman by the name of Maria Teo (ph.), who was from New Orleans [Louisiana].  There was a woman by, by the name--she didn't stay there very long.  Laverne, I think her name was, and she ended up leaving.  But, yeah, there were three people in that office.
Speaker 1: How was your day change?  What is the day like?  We--you shared with us some of the emotion on inaugural day.  Your first day in the office, how are you feeling and what, what are those days like, the first days?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one thing you find very early on, is that there is no cutoff time if you're a White House employee.  It's almost like you're on for twenty-four hours.  We got to work, usually we got to work between 7:30 and 8:00.  And, we usually left the office about 8:00, 8:30.  That was a usual day.  And, we were busy all during that day; responding to queries and doing--setting up interviews, coordinating interviews, coordinating visits from the press lots of times, International press, again.
Speaker 1: So, the tasks really don't change.  It's just that it's more demanding?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  An outstanding time or a particular challenge in those earliest days of moving into your--
Speaker 2: I think in my mind, I was thinking things were gonna slow down and that I'd be able to get a grip on things before, you know, before we really dug in.  But, the fact was, there was no downtime.  You just, you kept going.  And, I guess, we all got used to it.  But, that was like a rude awakening for all of us.  And, the other part of that was that, you really didn't have a personal life.  If you had one, you kinda put it on the back burner, because this was your life, the White House.  Anybody that worked in the White House can tell you that.  People like me who had a husband who worked for the Administration were very lucky that I had someone who understood the amount of time that I had to devote to my job, because he had the same thing.  But, there were people who, you know, it was very difficult for them; their personal lives.
Speaker 1: Let me understand something you just mentioned; having a husband.  But, when you first went into the White House, were you married?
Speaker 2: No.  My husband [Bob Nash] and I married in '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so from '93 [1993] for the first year you were single?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But, a single parent in a demanding--where was your son?
Speaker 2: My son was in college by then.  He went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]. He was in Morehouse and--which made it easier for me to decide to go to the White House.
Story_ID: 95052
Speaker 1: So, we advance from 1993, your first year in the White House.  Hold on a second.  What happens in a typical day, though?  I mean, who is, who was, let me back up.  Who was Jeff Eller, the person that you reported to?  What's his background and how does a day begin in a White House Media Affairs Office or Press Relations?
Speaker 2: Jeff Eller was from Florida.  A media person, he'd been a producer, I think, in Florida for a long time.  And, he came and worked in the, he worked in the Clinton Campaign down in Little Rock [Arkansas] at the headquarters doing media affairs events, and special events.  And, when we went to Washington [D.C.], he was heading up, he headed up the Media Affairs Office.  So, I went to work for him.
Speaker 1: But, how does your day start?  You start at 7:00, 7:30, 8:00 in the morning--
Speaker 2: We start with--
Speaker 1: Paint that picture for us.
Speaker 2: We start with a huge--everybody goes in and meets with Jeff for probably thirty, forty-five minutes, get our, you know, our marching orders, what things are of pressing issues, what kinds of things he'll need from us, reports or whatever by the end of the day.  And, from then, we all go to our respective areas and go to work.  And, the work could, could mean that you have to work with a press group from Israel, or Ireland, or wherever.  And, they're coming in and they're wanting to video tape the President doing his, whatever he's doing, his speech, he doing an event.  So, your role today is to take them around and make sure that they're in the right place at the right time.  And, chaperone them as they, they videotape the President.  Or, you--your day may entail being responsible for a radio interview that the President is doing or that several people are doing and you have to set that up.  And, that might take half your day to do that.  Coordinating with other agencies and, and the President's immediate office.  Those are the kinds of things.
Speaker 1: You're encountering press people from all parts of the world in additional to domestic.  We know that the media is managed differently in other countries.  How do you get prepared for that culture exchange and those differences?
Speaker 2: Basically, I think they get prepared for the way we do business.  That's basically how it is.  There wasn't a lot of problem once they got here.  Most of them spoke fluent English, and they kind of knew the ropes as far as how things were done in the Press Office at the White House.  And, that's kind of how it was, it was basically no problems.
Speaker 1: So, do you, do you not get prepared on your own?   There are specific protocols not--for everyone going into a Presidential Office for the first time, there are protocols.  What kind of preparation do you get, the staff gets?  How do you get prepared to do your job conforming to those standards and protocols?
Speaker 2: Basically, I guess Jeff Eller would have been the person who would have told us, these are the do's and don'ts of going in and out of the President's Office.  Amazingly, there weren't very many.  I mean, no.  We knew when we weren't supposed to go in and if you went in, you made yourself as inconspicuous as possible; especially, if you were chaperoning someone.
Story_ID: 95053
Speaker 1: You're now in the White House.  And, you're in the Media Affairs Office, and how long do you stay in that office?
Speaker 2: I was only in the Media Affairs Office for three months.  And, at the end of three months, I was offered a job at the Small Business Administration, U.S. Small Business Administration, as director of communications.  And, I got an appointment there, and I moved over to SBA.
Speaker 1: And, who's the cabinet officer at that time?
Speaker 2: Erskine Bowles from North Carolina.  Who was not a politician and he liked to tell people that.  But, he was a great director of the U.S. Small Business Administration.
Speaker 1: When you go into a position like that, how does that change, how does your work change or your day change from being on staff as a press officer going as director of a media operation or press operations?
Speaker 2: It changed because I was responsible for the operation, and I had a number of people working for me.  There was a staff of ten people working for me, doing some of the things that I was doing over at the White House.  But, also it was a much calmer atmosphere.  It wasn't as much controversy going on.  There weren't as many people coming in wanting to do interviews or interested in, in the SBA as there was at the White House.  So, it was a completely different environment.  I enjoyed it a great deal.  I was able to use a lot of the things that I learned at the White House.  A lot of the contacts, I still could use those at the SBA.  But, it was also, it was a, just calmer and I didn't have as much of a different arena to work in as I did when I was at the White House.
Speaker 1: The Small Business Administration relates to the economy?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, this is 1993?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, what's happening at that time economically?  One year into, well it's not really a year.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Into--what's happening in those first months of the [Clinton] Administration?
Speaker 2: I think that was the time that the President [Bill Clinton] was trying hardest to turn the economy around and put some things in place to make a difference.  You know, that's when he had to fight with Congress about the bill, you know, the economic bill.  So, my boss, Erskine Bowles was a big part of that.  We had to come up with, you know, statistics and numbers and all of that to, to back up what President Clinton was saying about the economy.  So, we worked very closely with the White House during that time.
Speaker 1: In what other department do you work with in an environment like that?
Speaker 2: I worked with, we worked indirectly with Labor.  We worked indirectly with, well Congress, I mean--and, Commerce, Department of Commerce during that time.  Those were the main, main agencies that we worked with.
Speaker 1: And, how long were you with SBA?
Speaker 2: I was there two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Any dramatic changes during that time?
Speaker 2: I think the biggest dramatic change was that we changed directors.  Phil [Philip Lader] later became our director, six months before I left.  He had worked for the White House.  He had been in the Personnel Office in the White House, and came from there.  And, also in 1994, which was the year that I was at U.S. Small Business Administration was the year that I got married.  So, I got married during the time I was at, at--during the Clinton Administration.
Story_ID: 95054
Speaker 1: Well, I was gonna ask you what significant (laughter) events during your tenure.  So, 1994 you got married?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did you meet your husband [Bob Nash]?
Speaker 2: I met my husband in Arkansas.  We're both Arkansans.  And, we knew each other for years in the political and community involvement arena.  Our children went to the same schools.  So, I met him through that.
Speaker 1: And, when did you start dating?
Speaker 2: Around 1990.
Speaker 1: So, you actually started dating before you were involved in the campaign.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, before your move to Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, so this is not a Washington aff--?
Speaker 2: Not exactly.  (Laughter) no.
Speaker 1: What else do you wanna tell us about that relationship, or the evolution of your relationship?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, the changes that took place between Arkansas and Washington, D.C.  He was actually a part of the Transition Office in Washington, D.C. when I was in Arkansas.  And, then when we came up, we just had to learn how to relate to each other in a completely different way.  Because both of our lives were changing, I mean our lives were completely changing.  But, it was a, it was a great opportunity for us to learn more about each other also.  So, it, it says a lot about the fact that we got married after such a, you know, the stressful period that we, we had at the White House and then, you know, and the Administration.  He was at USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] at the time when I was at [U.S.] Small Business Administration.
Speaker 1: So, when the move to Washington and he left the Arkansas Transition Team, he came into what department?
Speaker 2: USDA.
Speaker 1: USDA?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Agricultural Department as undersecretary.
Speaker 1: As undersecretary?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, so you both found it--was it, when you say stressful, what are you referring to?
Speaker 2: Just the time, the times that you were committed to your job.  Which was twenty-four hour, basically.  And, you, you, you just kind of without saying it, you give over your life to your job, when you become a administration employee; either White House or with an agency.  If you are a presidential appointee, you kind of know that you're on twenty-four hours.
Story_ID: 95055
Speaker 1: Speaking of presidential appointee, did you have to go through the process of congressional confirmation?
Speaker 2: I did not, no.  I didn't.  I had to go through the checks.  The FBI checks and interviews and all of that, yes.
Speaker 1: How long did that take?  There's a lot of discussion about those background checks.  How long does that take?  Do you have to wait until they're over or?
Speaker 2: Well, you can go into a job while they're going on.  But, you know you're on probation.  So, until they're over, you're not for sure whether everything's gonna be okay.  It takes, I, I think up to--from--between three and six months.  So, it takes a while.  And they go--
Speaker 1: Do you know what that process is like?  Have you a sense of what happens during that time?  What are they doing?
Speaker 2: They check everything (laughter) about your background.  They go back and talk to people who knew you very early.  And, you always hope they're talking to people who like you (laughter).  They talk to your ex-spouses.  They talk to your--people who you grew up with.  They talk to a lot of people and just ask them questions about you.
Speaker 1: Do they talk to family?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure they talk to family, except if you were married before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They'll talk to an ex-spouse.
Speaker 1: So, both you and your husband [Bob Nash, HM] had to go through that process?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And, he actually had to go to the-through the congressional hearings.
Speaker 1: Confirmation process, as undersecretary.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 95056
Speaker 1: You're at [U.S.] Small Business Administration [SBA].  This is also the time that Ron Brown is Secretary of Commerce.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are the controversies in the years that you were at SBA in relative to the economy or the administration?
Speaker 2: The biggest fight I remember is between Congress and the White House with the whole economy--the whole effort to get the economy started.  And, then there was the aff--AFTA--NAFTA, the whole NAFTA Bill was a big deal.  And, I think, just about every agency got involved in that.  I know we did, and Ron Brown's agency did.  Labor did.  So, that was one of the biggest controversies.
Speaker 1: So, SBA was not a lead agency on NAFTA?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: On NAFTA issues on that controversy?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Any specific impacts on your function, or the function of your office?
Speaker 2: No.  But, as communications director, we were always pulled in to, to bring in reports, or success stories, or information that we could gather around the country about the impact of trade and export and things like that.
Speaker 1: So, you've left the White House.  You're now in a cabinet agency.  How much do you personally interact with the White House and White House staff now that you're communications director?
Speaker 2: It's, it's pretty ongoing.  I have, I have a consistent, there's what they call a communications director's phone call, conference call that happens every week.  When there's special events that takes place at the White House that has anything to do with, with SBA or jobs or whatever, then I would become involved.  Erskine Bowles, my director, would, would become involved and I would be a person that would go with him for these kinds of events.  So, I stayed involved with the White House even, even then after I'd left.
Speaker 1: White House meetings?
Speaker 2: What House meetings, yes.
Speaker 1: And, how often did those take place?
Speaker 2: Maybe once or twice a month.
Speaker 1: And, you're meeting then with?
Speaker 2: Meeting with other communication directors usually.  Yes.  On issues that would impact the SBA.
Speaker 1: And, you've stayed with SBA until what year?
Speaker 2: 1995.
Speaker 1: And, you then moved to?
Speaker 2: I moved back to the White House.  And, this time as personal diarist to the President [Bill Clinton].
Story_ID: 95057
Speaker 1: What is the difference between a personal diarist to a president and the White House diarist?
Speaker 2: The difference is the White House diarist is a diarist for whoever comes in and everyone that comes in.  And, she's more a diarist for the President, not the President, but the White House rather than a President.  My job was being diarist to President [Bill] Clinton.  To chronicle his presidency.  To document what transpired during his presidency.  I was brought on for that specific role.
Speaker 1: And, had there ever been a presidential diarist before?
Speaker 2: No.  No, this was the first time that a President had hired someone to come on as a personal diarist.
Speaker 1: And, what does a personal diarist do?
Speaker 2: Basically, my job entailed chronicling on a day-to-day basis.  Whatever happened in the presidency?  What were the issues?  What kinds of things were going on?  What kinds of meetings were he having?  How, I mean, who was coming in to meet with him and what were the issues they were discussing.  And, I was also given the leeway to do anecdotal documentation.  Things that nobody else would know except that there were somebody sitting there when he--when Chelsea [Clinton] walked in and they danced around the Oval Office.  Or, he was complaining about his, you know, something had happened and, you know, it has nothing to do with the presidency.  But, this was Bill Clinton saying something that might be of interest to somebody later on.
Speaker 1: Bill Clinton, and then Bill Clinton as the President.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, then does that mean that you--well, how does that work?  Literally, how does it work for a personal presidential diarist?  Do you get to sit in on all the meetings?
Speaker 2: No.  I got to sit in on a great number of meetings.  The only meetings that I didn't, that I did not sit in on, on a regular basis, was the Foreign Affairs meetings.  I could go into those meetings and I was there up until a certain time and then I left.  What they call the top of the meeting.  I was there until the top of the meeting was over and then I left.
Speaker 1: And, what is the top of the meeting, describe that?
Speaker 2: That's the press.  That's the whole piece that goes to the press.  That's when the President is greeting his--the people that are coming in to talk about the, the International issues.  And, the press is there and they ask him questions about, you know, what does he think about this issue, and then they ask the visitor, if it's the king of, you know, Egypt or whoever.  So, I was there for that and then I'd leave.  And, then they really talk about some really top, top secret things that I wouldn't be--
Speaker 1: Cleared for--
Speaker 2: --privy to.
Speaker 1: What about the special events?  The social events at the White House?
Speaker 2: I was able to go to most of those.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And, those are working sessions or were you there--
Speaker 2: Working sessions.  I mean, I was there to observe.  I was there in my role.  But, I could enjoy them as well.  But, I would, when I'd go back either that night or the next day, I would document what happened.
Speaker 1: And, how long were you in that position?
Speaker 2: Until he left.  And, actually until after he left.  I was in his Transition Office for the six months after, after he left Office.
Speaker 1: And, the Transition Office was Washington [D.C.] or New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, for six months?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Being involved as a personal diarist of a President, what does it feel like?  And, something that had never been before, something that this President created?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a very special feeling and, you know, everybody let me know that it was a very special job.  I felt very proud that he had chosen me to be his diarist.  Because it had to be a person that he felt comfortable with.  A person that he felt very confident in.  Yeah so, I felt really good about that, and I took my job very seriously.
Speaker 1: Do you know how he came to that decision?  I mean, was there a short list of one, or a short list of three or five?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I know I was not the only person that was on that list.  But, I don't know how many people was on the list.
Speaker 1: What did your family say?
Speaker 2: They couldn't believe it.  I mean, nobody had heard of the role first of all.  After they asked, what is it?  They were all very proud, very proud.
Story_ID: 95058
Speaker 1: There were so many events, official, social, just fun events.  I can see the President [Bill Clinton] playing his sax.  South Lawn events.  What's outstanding for you--is there an outstanding or maybe three or four events that really touched you and are outstanding for you?
Speaker 2: One of them would have to be when he invited the Little Rock Nine to the White House and gave them the Congressional Medals of Honor.  That was very, very, very, outstanding for me.  I was very touched by that.  They--I've talked to them since then, and I think that's one of the things they'll never forget in their lifetimes.  It made a big difference to them that a President recognized them.
Speaker 1: And, the Little Rock Nine are those?
Speaker 2: Little Rock Nine are those nine, now men and women, who were children then, who participated in the Civil Rights struggle.  The integration of Central High School in 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas, who sacrificed and made a difference, made a huge difference for Arkansas and for the country.  And, the President showed how important that day was, that act was by giving them the Congressional Medal of Honor.
Speaker 1: How many of the nine did you know personally?
Speaker 2: I've met all of them.  I know three personally.
Speaker 1: And, they are?
Speaker 2: I know, Elizabeth Eckford, who's in Little Rock.  I know Minnijean Brown-Trickey, who lived in Canada for most of her adult life, but came back to work in the Clinton Administration, and now lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.  And, of course, I know Ernest Green [HM], who is such an outstanding, was such an outstanding part of the Clinton Administration.  But, also someone that I think most Arkansans really looked up to for the things that he's done since 1957.
Speaker 1: What did Minnijean--what was Minnijean's role in the Administration?
Speaker 2: She worked for the Department of the Interior.  She was head of, I think it was the Indian Affairs Office, and I'm not 100 percent sure of that.  But, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, I know she worked in that.
Story_ID: 95059
Speaker 1: Do you, do you recall how many African Americans that President [Bill] Clinton appointed?  Or, were in his Administration?
Speaker 2: I do not.  I do not.  I know it far surpasses any other President.  As a matter of fact, it's surpasses all of the other presidents put together.  He had over sixty African Americans in the White House.  So, that far surpasses anything anybody could have ever dreamed.  And, of those sixty, there were five assistants to the President which is the highest level that you can go in the White House.
Speaker 1: Do you recall all five of them?  Who they were?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Mignon Moore, who was from Chicago [Illinois].  Ben Johnson [HM], who headed up his one initiative.  Thurgood Marshall, Jr., or the III.  Alexis [Herman, HM] at one time, was there before she went over to head up the Labor Department.
Speaker 1: She headed up the policy or public--
Speaker 2: Public Liaison.
Speaker 1: Public Liaison?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Bob Nash [HM].
Speaker 1: White House Personnel?
Speaker 2: White House Personnel.  And, I--there one more, but I can't--[J]. Terry Edmonds [HM] was Director of Speech Writing, was the President's top speech writer.  And, there was another young man who was headed--who headed up White House Administration that I can't--it'll come to me.
Speaker 1: Well, that's more than five or six.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, at one time, you know, they may have left and--
Story_ID: 95060
Speaker 1: The personal diarist then, if you're chronicling the President's life and do that mean that you also traveled with the President when he [Bill Clinton] left the White House?
Speaker 2: I traveled with him sometimes.  I did not travel with him on a regular basis.  I was privy to notes and documents and anything that happened while he was away.  Because, his personal aide was a part of the Oval Office staff.  I was a person that worked in the Oval Office staff.  He would bring back information for me whenever the President traveled.  Sometimes I traveled with him and I was able to do it myself.  But, when I wasn't, I had access to the documents and notes from his travel.
Speaker 1: So, this means you're return to the Admin--to the White House is that you're no longer in the old Executive Office Building, but you're in the White House.  And, which Wing of the White House are you in?  And, are you in the basement or where, or upstairs?  Where are you?
Speaker 2: I'm in the West Wing.  And, I am three doors down from the President's Office, from the Oval Office.
Speaker 1: You know, of course, there are several controversies or one major controversy and records was subpoenaed, subpoena and asked for.  How did that impact you?  How were you impacted?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, it did impact me a great deal.  I was his diarist.  The media knew I was his diarist, and my diary was one of the things that was subpoenaed.  And, I was also required to testify before the Grand Jury.  So, it impacted me a great deal.
Speaker 1: When you say that, I'm sensing some emotion.  How did you feel at that time?  What was it like for you?
Speaker 2: It was, it wasn't a great feeling, because this was a President that I had great respect for and believed in as a President and as a leader.  And, we spent almost two years on a really, terrible error of judgment that he made.  But, the country and the government almost stood still for two years because of that.  And, there was a little bit of bitterness, you know, about that.  Sure, what happened was wrong, but I don't think the country should have paid for, for that the way that we did.  And, you know, I was in a role that, okay, I should have been, I should have been subpoenaed.  But, there was so many things that stood still that should've stood still during that time.
Speaker 1: Do what to say anything more about that time?
Speaker 2: No.  It was, it was just one of those shadows over the eight years that was the Clinton presidency that we feel really good about, and I feel good about.  I felt I'll never regret going to the White House.  I'll never regret working for Bill Clinton.  I think he's the best President we've had.  I'll always believe that until somebody comes along better.  I wish that hadn't happened.
Speaker 1: What were your family's concerns, you parent's concerns during this time for you?
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: And, your husband's [Bob Nash, HM] concerns?
Speaker 2: I think we were all kind of in the same mode of thinking.  That this was a terrible mistake that was made, but it was the people who were accusing him were going about it the wrong way.  And, that they were really hurting the country by going about it the way that they did.
Story_ID: 95061
Speaker 1: Would you like to share with us any other memorable events from your service to the President as diarist and at any other time during your relationship with him [Bill Clinton]?
Speaker 2: I think, I think one of the highlights of the presidency for me was the travel to Africa.  Our ten day trip to Africa.  Traveling to seven different countries, and the impact, not only that it had on Africa, but the impact that it had on us.  The impact that it had on Bill Clinton.  I don't think he came away from there feeling the same way or thinking the same way that he did going over.  I think it changed all of us.  It was my first trip to Africa, and to go there with the President, who truly went there with an open mind and a genuine heart that I wanna learn from, from Africa and I wanna see how we can help Africa.  It was a wonderful feeling.
Speaker 1: How many countries did you visit?
Speaker 2: Seven countries.  Seven countries, if my memory serves me right.  Yes.  It was--we started out in Ghana.  We went to Uganda.  We went to Soweto [South Africa].  We went to South Africa, Cape Town [South Africa].  We went to Johannesburg.  We went to, I think it was Tanzania.  Rwanda.
Speaker 1: Your first trip to Africa.  What does that feel like?
Speaker 2: Indescribable.  I had never been to Africa before.  I'd always dreamed of--that's something I'd always dreamed of, going to Africa.  But, to go as a part of the presidential party was like unbelievable.  In one sense, it was great, because I was able to see a lot that I wouldn't been able to see.  And, I was able to meet a lot of people that I wasn't able to meet.  But, on the other sense, in the other sense, we were in a bubble.  When you travel with the President, you're kind of in a bubble.  And, there also things that I wasn't able to see or I wasn't able to interact with.  But, if I--my next trip there, I will be able to do.
Speaker 1: And, you're planning to do that when?
Speaker 2: Of course, I don't know.  Probably next year.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Well, people describe various feeling as sort of a knowingness sometimes when they hit African soil.  Can you describe your feeling?  Expand on your feeling actually hitting the soil?  Interacting with the people.
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a wonderful feeling of connectedness.  All these people that look so much like me.  That look so much like people that I grew up with.  And, it was so much different from what I'd, what I'd known, or what I'd been taught.  It was a wonderful education for me.
Story_ID: 95062
Speaker 1: You're ending your career or your tenure as diarist after this debacle.  Now what do you do?
Speaker 2: I do the six months with him [President Bill Clinton] in the Transition Office and then I move to Chicago [Illinois].  And, my husband has moved here to work for ShoreBank, and I follow in June of 2001.
Speaker 1: Your husband is?
Speaker 2: Is, Bob Nash [HM].  And, he's vice chair with ShoreBank here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Coming off an association assignment for someone, the highest position in this country, and the career change, the transition to a different city, climate in every way that you could think of than Washington [D.C.], what is that like for you?
Speaker 2: I fell in love with Chicago immediately.  I, I kind of clicked off Washington, D.C. after my experiences.  I wouldn't exchange those experiences for anything in the world.  It was a great experience and I loved it.  But, when it was over, it was over for me.  And, I was ready for the next phase of my life.  And, I think that's how I've always lived my life.  So, I was ready for Chicago.  I was ready for a change.  I was ready to slow down, and I was ready to write.  And, that's what I do.
Speaker 1: And, so the change is that you are Mrs. Bob Nash, but Janis Kearney.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, a writer.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, you're writing?
Speaker 2: I'm writing two books.  I'm writing a memoir about my life, about my journey.  A memorial to my parents mostly.  And, I'm writing a biography.  Actually, a chronicle of conversations with African Americans about Bill Clinton as a leader, and Bill Clinton as a human being.
Speaker 1: So, this second books is not--would you characterize it as, it's less about Bill Clinton, but--
Speaker 2: It's, it's about Bill Clinton, but it's from other peoples' eyes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  From other people's perspective.
Speaker 2: It's a con--convers--it's called "Conversations."
Speaker 1: And, how far are you along?
Speaker 2: I'm about a third of the way, because it took about a year to do my interviews.  I actually started in 2001, and spent most of that year doing research and interviews.
Speaker 1: How, how do you write two books simultaneously?  What is that like in terms of a day?
Speaker 2: Well, one book was basically done.  The memoir is something I started a long time ago and only worked on part-time.  So, in 2001 and, between 2001, 2002, I finished the memoir so, I'm kind of just completing that.  And, the other time I spent doing mostly interviews for the Clinton book.
Speaker 1: Your memoir begins when?  At what period in your life?
Speaker 2: Childhood.  Very young.
Speaker 1: Very young?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 95063
Speaker 1: You mentioned, while we were in recess from the camera, some very defining alteration and changes in your life, 1982.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Would you share that with us?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-two [1982] was when my mother [Ethel Curry Kearney] passes.  My mother, who at the time was sixty-four years old, was kind of this center piece or the catalyst in our family.  The quiet strength that, you know, we all just kind of were--she was like a magnet for the rest of the family.  So, losing her was a very hard thing for me.  I was in the beginning of my career.  I was in Little Rock, Arkansas then, and it was hard.  It was hard for me to focus on my life then.  To continue the way I know she would've wanted me to.  But, it was a very difficult time.  And, that was def, that definitely would be one of the more defining times in my life for me.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from your mother and from her passing, or since her passing?
Speaker 2: I learned her strength, I mean, my strength that I got from her.  I learned that if I remembered, if I remembered all the things that she instilled in me that, you know, I would be fine.  And, then pass those on.  Because, one of her, you know, biggest things were gifts and giving and sharing.  And so, I think I'm becoming as much like my mom as I can possibly be, in memorial to her.
Speaker 1: So, in this memoir you address that and then there's another time and period that's equally as poignant.
Speaker 2: The death of my sister, Jo Ann, who was also my best friend.  We were very, very close growing up.  So, her death in 1987 was, was very troubling for a number of reasons.  One, was that she took her own life.  And, the other is that she had a mental problem that we learned about when we both went away to college.  And, that's how we disc--we discovered it at that time.  And, when a sibling takes their own life, it always leave guilt, I think, for the rest of the family.  You always wonder if there's more that you could have done, or you should've known.  And, especially for me because I was so close to her.  So, that, that left a, I think, a big vacuum kind of in my life.  And, I've dealt with that.  I devote a lot of my book to our relationship.  I think, I'm really trying to analyze that whole relationship.
Speaker 1: You are how, how many years apart were you, in age?
Speaker 2: She was eighteen months younger.
Speaker 1: A third memoire, part of your memoir is?
Speaker 2: A third part of my memoir probably is, I talk more about my journey and what my childhood--what my parents teaching, how it traveled with me through my journey.  How every step that I took, every decision I made, I could look back and remember something that they had taught me, or drilled into us over the years.  And, how that helped me throughout my journey.  So, I really, I'm memorializing James Kearney and Ethel Curry Kearney in this memoir.
Story_ID: 95064
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to add?  Something that I didn't ask?
Speaker 2: No.  I just, I believe everything that I've done in my life, every juncture has been a blessing and a test, and a challenge, and I'm always looking for the next challenge.  And, the other side of that, is I've always been told and I will always remember that I have to find a way to give back.  To share whatever blessings that I have.  And, for the rest of my life, that's what I'll try to do.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you wanna say about your, about your husband, or about your son, or your parents, or grandparents?
Speaker 2: I'm blessed to have a husband.  Bob Nash, who is a wonderful husband, a wonderful friend.  And, I think, we say that, I think we have a great marriage because we were friends first.  And, blessed to have a son who is a great human being.  And, that's the best, you know, I think mother's feel best about that than they do about anything else.  That I have produced a wonderful human being, no matter what else they are.  But, he's doing good things with life and I'm very proud of that.
Speaker 1: You parented him alone for how many years?
Speaker 2: For five years, about five years.
Speaker 1: What has most influenced you, and why?
Speaker 2: Without equivocation, my parents.  My parents teaching, my parents teaching by example.  I think that's influenced me more than anything.
Speaker 1: What values do you consider most important?
Speaker 2: Honesty and truth, definitely are important.  But, also that whole giving back thing.  To he who much is given, much is expected.  I believe that wholeheartedly and my parents believed it.  I remember my father [James Kearney] used to say, you know, "having gifts and sitting them up on the shelf to gather dust is not worth anything."  I mean, others have to appreciate it too.  Share it with other people.  That's how you really, that's how you really are worth your blessings.  That's what shows you're worth your blessing.
Speaker 1: How are you doing that, Janis, everyday, how are you doing that?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm--hopefully my writing will be a part of that.  My writing I feel is a mission.  I feel like I'm doing something, almost like a missionary.  Sharing stories, truths that will hopefully help others.  The childhood that I went through, that when some children experience certain things and say, I can't go on.  Or, I can't do this because it's too hard.  Hopefully, some people can read this book and say, look, what she did is not as hard as you think.  Because, I was always told, "look at somebody else, before you complain."  And, that's what I'm hoping I'll do.  But, also I'm volunteering and I believe so much in literacy and reading.  And, that's one of the things that I do volunteer regularly with.
Speaker 1: Any other volunteer work that's close to your heart?
Speaker 2: Not right now that I have time to do, unfortunately.
Story_ID: 95065
Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I think, if truth be told, hopefully, I'll be remembered for my writing.  For--I expect before I leave this place, to do a lot of writing.  To get a lot of books out of me.  But, also I wanna be remembered for just being a good human being.  For helping change somebody's life in some small way.
Story_ID: 95066
Speaker 1: Well, remembrance and then there're legacies, and what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I'd like for my legacy to be, she was a woman who had many blessings.  Her life was filled with blessings.  But, she also shared and she gave, and she, she blessed others based on things that she had learned, or things that she had gathered.  I affected others' lives by sharing my own life with them.
Story_ID: 95067
Speaker 1: Is there something you haven't done that you would still like to do?
Speaker 2: Probably, traveling to other parts of the country.  I'm a, I'm so interested in other people and other cultures and learning about people that I expect I'll do a lot of traveling.
Speaker 1: And, you're anxious or strongly interested in returning to Africa.  Do you know which part of the continent you'd visit in your next trip?
Speaker 2: I'd love to go to Ghana.  But, I'd also like to go to South Africa.  I have a brother who lives in Johannesburg.  So, I expect my next trip would be Johannesburg.
Speaker 1: And, what's your brother doing in Johannesburg?
Speaker 2: He's an attorney.  He's a managing partner in a law firm there.
Speaker 1: And, which brother is this?
Speaker 2: This is Jude.  He's one of my younger brothers.
Speaker 1: And, he's number?
Speaker 2: He's probably number nine.
Speaker 1: Nine?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Is there something that you have not done, well, we've done that.  Is there something, anything that you've done already that you would like to do differently, that you would do different than you've?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything.  There's things that I've done that, I guess the only thing in that, I mentioned before, the time that I spent with the newspaper that I wished I'd spent more time with my son.  But, also when I look back on it, I'm not sure there was any way that I could have done that and been effective in what I was trying to do with the newspaper.
Speaker 1: No regrets?  Regrets?
Speaker 2: None that I, you know, none that are big enough for me to talk about.

Speaker 1: As a southerner coming from Arkansas, African American woman, mother, what are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I think, our children are my biggest concern.  That some kind of way we instill in them our past.  I think, some of 'em, too many of 'em aren't aware of our past; aren't aware of the struggles, the challenges that we've overcome.  The people who've died to make sure that we live comfortable today.  And, I think it's, it's our responsibility to make sure that they understand and that they realize that what they have didn't come easy.  And, I think, unfortunately some of us have let them believe that.  And, now it's our responsibility to change that.
Speaker 1: So, am I understanding your saying that history is important?
Speaker 2: History is extremely important.
Speaker 1: And, why do you feel that way?
Speaker 2: Because, I believe that a people or a community without a strong sense of history are left kind of wavering.  You can't move forward, I don't think, not in the long run without a strong sense of history.
Speaker 1: Well, you're a history maker.  Can you share with us your thoughts about The HistoryMakers project?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's unbelievable.  I am amazed that this has been done in such a short time.  I mean, when I read about how many people have--you've contacted and interviewed and documented.  It's so needed.  So very needed.  And, I'm just happy that someone had the vision to, to do it.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you.  I've enjoyed this interview with you.

Speaker 1: Okay.  This is our follow-up session.  We had done Ms. Kearney's interview earlier, and we're now shooting the photographs to go with that.  So, if you want to go ahead and start with this photo.  Just let me know who's in the photo.  The convention we use, if there's more than one person, is to go from viewer's left to right--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In terms of naming people.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Viewer's left, is that, me?
Speaker 1: That's--we're starting there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: The same way you'd read.
Speaker 2: Okay.  In this picture is Janis F. Kearney, myself, and Rosa Parks.  The, the great Rosa Parks.  She joined us on a train ride.  This was during the 1996 Presidential Campaign.  And, many of the staff rode from Washington, D.C. to Chicago on a train and made stops all the way between Chicago and Washington, D.C.  And, one stop was in Detroit, in the Detroit, Michigan area, and Mrs. Parks came to the train and rode with us.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I'll make it shorter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The--just--yeah.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is James Kearney and Ethel Kearney, my parents.  And, it was probably during the '70s [1970s].  They were being interviewed for a story about their family.  Our story was pretty popular during that time, and they were being interviewed during this photo.
Speaker 1: We put it sideways so we get the most pixels, so that matches the, the format of video and then we flip them in photoshop.  So, if you see 'em sideways that's--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is Ethel Virginia Curry Kearney, who is my mother.  And, this is an early picture of her.  She was about twenty-five years old during that time.  And, it was taken in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

Speaker 1: This is a postcard of "Cotton Fields of Dream" which is a memoir I've completed and hope will be published in 2004.
Speaker 2: So, you're actually gonna have two books probably come out pretty closely (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: I hope so.  That's what I'm hoping because I'm convinced that the two books parallel each other a lot.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of Curry brothers who were all born in the Magnolia, McNeil area of Arkansas.  My mother's uncles, and this was a family reunion, a Curry family reunion in 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a photo of Daisy Bates, my mentor and a Civil Rights activist, and myself.  We took that picture probably in 1988.  It was actually for a book that a guy by the name of Brian Lanker was doing of photos of great people.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my family, who were invited to the White House by President Bill Clinton, shortly before the end of his term in 2001.  And, we were there for a photo op, and to meet him and talk with him, spent the morning there at the White House.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, this is James Kearney, my father, and he at this time is speaking to a group in church.  My father is a great orator, and this is one of the times that he's speaking.  And, that's likely in the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a family reunion photo that we took and it probably was in the late '90s [1990s].  Many, many summers we would go to a resort area in South Arkansas and that's at a cabin there.  And, that's part of my family.

Speaker 1: Alright, and then for this one.
Speaker 2: This is, I think, about fourteen or fifteen of my siblings that are surrounding my father.  My father was inducted into the Black Hall of Fame in Arkansas, and my mother posthumously.  And, a number of my siblings traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas to attend that and be with my father.  And, that's me, right there.  And, that's my father right in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: This is a photo taken during the 1998 Africa trip that the President took.  And, a number of people from the White House, as well as, congressional leaders and business leaders attended that trip.
Speaker 2: And, that's another photo from African.  Actually, that was a safari that I and my husband, Bob Nash, joined a group on, and just a photo from that   (laughter).

Speaker 2: Okay.  So, these are all from that same trip?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: So, the date would be the same?

Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell us about this one.

She'd never been, and the President wanted to bring her.  And, she had worked for Mrs. [Bess] Truman, when she was younger as her seamstress.  So, this was a great honor for us to have Mrs. Fillmore there.  And, this was in January of 2000, January 15, 2000.
