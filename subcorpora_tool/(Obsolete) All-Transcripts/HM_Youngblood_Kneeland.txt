Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is December 28th, (laughter) you know seventy-two years ago (laughter) I forgot, you know she's seventy, she'll be seventy-three this year, I haven't thought of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father has passed.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: His name was Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, how much do you know about your mother's side of the family, how, about the ancestors on that side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: A fair amount.  My mom was, was born in, in Waco, Texas, her father was a physician, Dr. Beadie B-E-A-D-I-E, B, Eugene Conner.  And who was from Texarkana, Texas and his wife [Willie Raul Conner] was a housekeeper, a homemaker, I should say.  And they you know lived in Houston [Texas], Waco after he finished medical school and then moved to Austin, Texas.  And he was probably the first, among the first African Americans to practice medicine in Austin, Texas, and certainly the first to have privileges at Beck, Breckenridge Hospital [sic. Brackenridge Hospital; Central Health Brackenridge Campus, Austin, Texas] in operate there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is a big hospital in Austin.
Speaker 1: Now we're talking about quite some time ago, if--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: He graduated from medical school in 1930, and--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Okay, her father did?
Speaker 2: Her father did.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And he went to medical school because his uncle, his father's brother was a physician.
Speaker 1: So it's a tradition that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Goes back to the turn of the century at least if not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: If not beyond.
Speaker 2: Yes, no question about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in fact he and his uncle practiced medicine forbit--in Waco and eventually he decided to go out on his own in Austin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stores from that side of the family about slavery or Reconstruction or?
Speaker 2: Well the, the one story and there lots of stores but the one story that I found amusing was when my grandfather first got to Austin, he--there was an accident right out front of his home.  And a car had hit a horse, you know a car hit a horse and so my grandfather you know being a freshly med doctor ran out and saw what had happened, you know the car was fine, the passenger was fine.  But the horse was really injured badly, his leg, and so my grandfather ran in the house got on all of his doctor's gear you know scrub gear, got his splints and all this you know instruments.  Came out you know sweated like mad, working on this horse, you know to try to resuscitate it and, and fix its injured leg, it's broken leg.  And you know he splint on it and all types of other things and then of course the owner was eventually identified who came out.  Saw the horse, saw my granddad and then took out a gun and just shot the horse (laughter).  He said you can't fix a broken leg on a horse (laughter) so my granddad was out there looking crazy.  But anyway that was his last attempt at veterinary medicine; he let it go from there. But, but anyway that's, that was one of the more entertaining stories of, of his time.
Speaker 1: I just wonder if that's really true you really can't fix a broken leg on a horse or people just don't do it?
Speaker 2: Perhaps now, perhaps now they can you know with modern technology, but, but clearly back then they couldn't.  And so the owner looked at it and looked at my grandfather boom (laughter) and my granddad was like you know here he is sweating all kinds of stuff, blood everywhere fixing this horse and, and he was real proud of his work you know.  The guy showed up well you know, hey look.  Get out of here, (laughter) so much for that effort.
Speaker 1: And what did your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Beadie, B-E-A-D-I-E, Conner.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's Beadie Conner.
Speaker 2: Beadie Eugene Conner, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you said you had an uncle who was a physician as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he was a physician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well it was his uncle, my grandfather's uncle, it was my you know great uncle [sic, great-great uncle].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And yeah so.  And then my mother's, mother's family was from Waco, they were all you know from, there were three girls.  The father in which I mentioned Emanuel Vanderbilt Kneeland [ph.] was you know successful you know businessman, a teacher there in Waco.  And found a church, you know Baptist church there in Waco and again they were all very educated, everyone went to college, they finished, everyone finished college including my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Where did they go to school?
Speaker 2: I want to say that she went to school at in I think Bishop College [Marshall, Texas], it may have been Bishop College or this school in Marshall, Texas, I can't think of the name.  But a historical black college [HBCU], you know she played the harp, everyone played instruments.  And then my grandfather's family were all from Texas, originally Texarkana, Texas.  And you know there were several in addition to his dad, I mean his dad had several brothers and one was minister, and became a bishop, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  One was a teacher you know his dad, and one was again a, a physician, there was a fairly broad cross section of, of talent within the family.
Story_ID: 237798
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Georgia Conner Youngblood] talk about growing up and some of her experiences growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, you know a number of, again we've been very fortunate, I've been very fortunate to have come to a very stable family situation, on both sides of parents.  In fact, no one I know of has been divorced; I know which is pretty remarkable in any community.
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: But my father [Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.], I mean my, my grandfather [Beadie Eugene Conner] as I mentioned was a physician, but also was a jazz musician, so he played you know drums and had his own bank.  Which is how he paid his way through college and through medical school.  And you know he had a number of different relationships, friends Duke Ellington, Count Basie and other folks usually aware of certainly during that time when you couldn't--many of these guys couldn't check into hotels.  You know spend the night over different black families homes and so Duke Ellington was in Austin, Texas one weekend doing a party, doing, I'm sorry concert and after the concert, he and Billy Strayhorn came by the house.  They composed 'Satin Doll' at, at his home with his piano with everyone there, and it just you know great, great occasion.  But that was not unique, you know often times when jazz musicians would come down, they would come by and see my grandfather.
Speaker 1: So 'Satin Doll' was composed in your grandfather's house?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now that is historic, that's something.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Well, so your mother was surrounded by all these talented people, accomplished people strong families (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no question about it.  There was a, I mean very, a woman who was a child prodigy by the name of I think it was Schuyler
Speaker 1: Yeah, Philippa Duke Schuyler.
Speaker 2: Yeah Schuyler, again, they brought her by the house, my, my mom said that they of course would, would play together, except that my mom was kind of rough and so they didn't want--my mom playing with this child prodigy would do these, you know these precious hands, 'cause my mom was out on you know bicycle and doing all these other things that normal kids would do.  And when my mom brought Philippa Schuyler back you know she was all dirty and, and you know falling off the bike and doing all these things.  They're like okay, we're don't, you don't get to play with this kid anymore (laughter) but.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of allure about Philippa Schuyler, in fact there's been a book written about her about five or six years ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Somebody wrote a biography of her.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And her mother [Josephine Cogdell Schuyler] was white and she was well off and from Texas.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And did you know her moth--I mean did your, your mother know her mother and, and that family?
Speaker 2: My grandparents.
Speaker 1: Knew that family?
Speaker 2: Knew that family and that's how she came to, to be at my grandparents' home, and to, to play on occasion.  But again, she was you know quite a prodigy but in, in many ways very tragic.
Speaker 1: Yeah, very strange kind of situation to have a rich white southern mother you know from Texas and she married George Schuyler up in New York, a very, very dark black man, who was involved in radical politics on the left and the right.  Became a member of the John Birch Society (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Before he died, her estr--and she died in a, over in Vietnam and some have speculated about her being like in addition to being a prodigy being some sort of a, a agent for U.S. and interest over there, I, you know I don't know.    It's all, a lot of speculation about Philippa Schuyler and, and so okay.  Yeah, any other stories, these are some pretty good connections here.
Speaker 2: Well you know again my grandfather's band in college had a, you know very popular band in college that you know played you know jazz all over the country.  Actually particularly in the summertime they would go traveling and one time they were going to Asbury Park in New Jersey, but the car broke down in Princeton, New Jersey, this was when my dad was in, my grandfather was in college.  The car broke down right in front of the university and they were trying to get it fixed and my grandfather first got out of the car while they were getting it fixed.  And went across the street looking to the, looking into the gates of Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey] and looking to go in to the, to the university, to the university and was stopped of course by the police.  And they wouldn't let him go in 'cause you're not a student, you know who are you and what have you, explained about the car, you can't, you can't go in the university.  We you know we won't allow that, but my grandfather saw this beautiful campus, this extraordinary center of education, my grandfather was always very interested in education, which is why he went to college, and you know went to medical school.  And he vowed one day he would be back to that, to that campus and of course he did--this was in, this was in the 1920s when this incident occurred.  But in 1978 he came back to Princeton for the first time since that incident and it was for my graduation from Princeton.  So he got to walk through those gates.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 237799
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Georgia Conner Youngblood] go on to college too?
Speaker 2: Yes my mother went to college, at Nazareth College in [Rochester] New York and actually finished high school at fifteen, graduated from college at nineteen, as did my father [Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did she do after she finished Nazareth?
Speaker 2: She was a medical technologist. She became a medical technologist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She did graduate work in medical technology and actually worked you know with Charles [R.] Drew in [Washington] D.C. during the, you know in terms of you know blood banking and what have you.
Story_ID: 237800
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Georgia Conner Youngblood and Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.] met, your mother and father?
Speaker 2: They were both from Austin, Texas so they knew each other not well, but they knew each other 'cause they were part of the same community.  You know Austin and after my father finished graduate school and became an optometrist. They were put together by friends.  And my father was unfortunately drafted, but, but you know they became engaged and were married after he got of the [U.S.] military.
Story_ID: 237801
Speaker 1: Okay, well you said your father's name was Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what, what can you tell us about the ancestors on his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Very tough folks, again my grandfather [Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Sr.], my father's dad was--finished college at Stephen F. Austin College [sic. Samuel Huston College; Huston-Tillotson University] I believe in Austin [Texas].  Stephen F. Austin College is where he went to school, I believe, finished in I think in 19 you know 1924 [sic, 1927] you know and couldn't really find much of a job.  Was teaching and you know eventually got a job waiting on tables, which actually paid much, much more in Austin.  And became a maitre d' and his whole career was you know tell you know in the, at the Driskill Hotel [Austin, Texas] in Austin for the most part.   Where he did very, very well financially, he knew all the political folks from LBJ [Lyndon Baines Johnson] then John Connally then pretty much everyone.  In fact when LBJ was elected to the White House [Washington, D.C.], he asked my grandfather would he come to the White House and, and head up the services there.  You know in terms of  the wait, you know waiting tables and whatever, but my grandfather passed on that 'cause he just he was used to being in Austin, liked what he was doing and stayed there so.  He came from a very a big family, my, my grandfather did, he had you know nine brothers and sisters.  And a very, very strong disciplined was my great grandfather [James  Youngblood], he was a very, very tough man.  There, they lived on a farm in McNair, Texas, there're actually two sets of families, I'm sorry.  Nine brothers and sisters on one, and then nine brothers and sisters on the other, he actually had eighteen kids from two different wives, one died and.  But very strong people, and thinking he was an extraordinary disciplinarian.  My grandfather was quite the conservative person, I mean he was you know the right of [President] Ronald Reagan.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now for those days, what does that really mean in terms of those politics in, in those days?
Speaker 2: The, the story let me give you an example of my grandfather.  My mother [Georgia Conner Youngblood] and father had seven kids; they were not doing well financially in Galena Park, Texas.  We were about to be evicted from our house, Galena Park, Texas.  My grandfather had done very well financially, lots of money, and so my father took a bus ride to go see him in Austin to plead the case because he needed $100 to make sure that we didn't get evicted from our house.  He gets to Austin, my grandfather takes him out to this beautiful steak dinner, he had a wonderful time.  My father tells him this is the situation, here are your beautiful grandkids, you know I really, I need this hundred dollars to make sure we don't get evicted.   Then my grandfather looked at him and says "Son, if the difference between your success and failure is $100, you don't deserve to succeed.  I gave you, you know a great education, you got not one degree, two degrees, if I give you $100 now, you'll be back a month from now, two months from now, three months from now, so I think you can make it son."  So he put him back on the bus, did not give him the $100, and sent him on his merry way, and you know we made it.  I mean we didn't get put out you know, I'm not sure wh-, I'm sure how my father did make it, but I'd rather not say, but anyway he ended torching our car, getting the insurance money (laughter) and paying the house note.  But, but from then on, he also knew he had no safety net, so he had to make it, so that's really an example of my, my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he believed everybody stand on their own two feet.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you got it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well now your father went on, 'cause he had two degrees you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)Yes.
Speaker 1: He went to--
Speaker 2: He had undergraduate degree, again finished, he went to college at fifteen, finished at nineteen, graduate school, he went to school of optometry [Chicago College of Optometry; Illinois College of Optometry] in Chicago [Illinois], and practiced optometry.  But also waited tables 'cause he had seven kids, so he would work from nine to five, practicing optometry and then six to 11, waiting tables, six days a week.
Speaker 1: That's a rough, seem like a rough schedule.
Speaker 2: Very tough.
Speaker 1: But being an optometrist you would think a black optometrist would probably would get most of the black business, but these are people that had the least amount of money I guess.  And it's a specialty you know kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) True I mean and glasses aren't like your teeth, your teeth hurt you, so you, you know people would really be quite compelled to go to the dentist.  Where's your vision you, you know it's necessary but it's not often times as, as much as an emergency, perceived to be as much as an emergency, so.
Speaker 1: Okay so
Speaker 2: Again he also had lots of obligations, lots of things cost between kids and, but after so he also need to make it.
Speaker 1: So your mother was working at the same time, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  And they--
Speaker 2: My, my parents really taught me hard work, education and a strong spiritual base, that, that, those are things they really instilled in me and I think all of us.  And were really quite, were great examples to all of us.
Story_ID: 237802
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have an earliest childhood memory, something that you would say is your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Not especially, not especially, I remember being a, a young kid just running the streets of my community.  But not anything especially, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what was your neighborhood like; can you describe that for us?
Speaker 2: Segregated neighborhood, small community called Galena Manor, within the City of Galena Park, [Texas] which was a suburb of Houston [Texas].  One high school, one elementary school, one junior high school, all black, it was a great community.  Middle class, African American families who were, who were employed by the post office or you know worked for the sanitation department or had government jobs but all, everyone trying to make it.  And do the best they could do for themselves and for their kids, but they also took care of all the other kids.  You know it's, anyone in the neighborhood had the, had carte blanche ability to spank me or any of my siblings, if we ever got out of line.  From anyone in the neighborhood, and everyone watched out for everyone else, and trust me they did.
Speaker 1: What, what did house look like?
Speaker 2: House was three-bedroom home, seven kids, so five boys in one room, two girls in one room and my parents [Georgia Conner Youngblood and Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.] in the other room.  So a couple bunk beds, it was, but we all jammed in there, living room, dining room, kitchen and, eventually we expanded it.  As my, you know, my parents got more successful, and eventually moved from this small community of Galena Park actually to Dallas, Texas in 1972.
Story_ID: 237803
Speaker 1: What was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds were really of course just the--it was, it was a great community of kids, who all growing up together at the same time.  And there was always athletic events, we had football, basketball, baseball, there was always swimming in the summertime.  Everyone having a good time, you could walk, pretty much anywhere you need to get to, school, to the store, to all these different places.  And it really created you know a great community to be able to grow up in, it's, it was something I really enjoyed.  The, it was the ice cream man that came down the street, there was, one thing that was quite disturbing now when I look back on it.  They used to always spray for mosquitoes and they had this mosquito truck, which would spray insecticide and this is white smoke, we used to always run after this truck.  All of us behind this on bicycle running 'cause it was so much fun.  I'm sure sometime probably sooner rather than later, I will come down with some illness associated with all of the pesticide that I inhaled during that time.
Speaker 1: That's in the time that was before Rachel Carson's book ['Silent Spring'] got out there you know I guess about DDT and all that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: People just didn't know, I guess.
Speaker 2: Clearly not, all of them.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your church, now you said church was a big factor in growing up.
Speaker 2: I actually grew up Catholic and we had a small Catholic church there in Galena Park [Texas] by the name of Our Lady Star of the Sea [Catholic] Church.  And it was a typical Catholic church, very conservative, not a lot of rocking and rolling, but again a good community of folks which provided a strong moral foundation to succeed.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so were you an altar boy and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I started out as an altar boy but, but eventually you know didn't, didn't quite, quite make it all the way up the ladder.
Story_ID: 237804
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little boy what did you like to do and who were your friends and?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was a very focused young man from the time I could ever remember, always was ambitious, always wanted to be the best.  Particularly academically, but also in sports, and I knew that there was a bigger world beyond Galena Park, Texas.  And really my first experience of understanding that was at the age of fourteen I had an opportunity to be a Page in the Texas Legislature.  So I got to skip half a year of school and go down to Austin [Texas], work with the legislature.  Had opportunity to work with people like Barbara Jordan and other folks who really exposed me to the world of politics.  But also big political figures of the time and that experience was, was important and it continues to be important as I in, continue to be very interested in politics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again that was at age fourteen, however, the age of sixteen, I got invited to be an exchange student to Greece, having never really been out of Texas.  I took a summer, went over to Greece and that as much as anything changed my life, I had the good fortune of going over to Greece.  Greece at the time was under military dictatorship, my friends were communist, anarchist, communist, you know left, right.  But for the most part were universal in their hatred of the United States.  And I thought America land of the free, home of the brave, which I still do, but I understood much better how other people perceive the United States.  In the case of Greece, Greece was under military dictatorship, they didn't-dictator [Georgios Papadopoulos] had been installed by the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], and they hated the United States.  And that I, I was not aware of US politics being quite being like that, so it really help me to broaden my horizons to international affairs.  And the role of the good US both good and bad.  Having had that experience internationally it you know at 16 it's continued to be a part of my life ever since then.  So when my family moved to Dallas [Texas] in 1972, I was sixteen, I finished at a Jesuit high school [Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Dallas, Texas], had gone to public schools all my life.  But enrolled me in a Jesuit high school, I finished there in 1974, and went to Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey], and was there from 1974 to 1978.
Story_ID: 237805
Speaker 1: Tell us about grade school; now what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Went to Fidelity Elementary School [Galena Park, Texas], Fidelity Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Is that a Catholic elementary school?
Speaker 2: No, it was just a public elementary school.
Speaker 1: Fidelity, sounds like a savings and loan (laughter)
Speaker 2: Fidelity, F-I-D-E-L-I-T-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, again it was an all-black elementary school, great community high school with wonderful kids, great teachers who really emphasized to me and to all of us to do our best.  And be the best and that we were fortunate to have this opportunity of education and we need to take advantage of it.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this was before integration--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And, and--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Absolutely it was before integration.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're talking about 1960 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a great time because it was, it was such a community, it was such a community of students.  All the kids were kids for the most part they were in the neighborhood that we all lived in, we were at school together, we played together we had fun together.  We shared sad things together as well, but it was a great community to grow in, insulated.  You know in, in that, it really wasn't a problem with drugs or alcohol or substance abuse.  It, it really was a, a wonderful community.
Speaker 1: Okay now were there any special teachers or mentors there in the community that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were there were several teachers that I remember; there was Miss [Gladys] Washington who was my second grade teacher, Mrs. Wilson [ph.], who was my third grade teacher, Mrs. Mayfield [ph.], there was my fifth grade teacher, a number of them took, I think a special interest in me and my education and encouraging me to do better, and to be the best that I can be.  Principally because I was so focused on achievement that they continued to encourage me, and my success, not just my success, but my peers as well all did, did very well academically.  Well we were competitive, we challenged each other.
Speaker 1: Now why were you so serious about academics do you think?
Speaker 2: I, I saw my parents [Georgia Conner Youngblood and Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.] and their sacrifice; I could see first-hand the importance of education, not only my parents, but in my grandparents and their success.  And so I had living breathing examples of people who are educated and also people who had sacrificed, and people who worked hard but who achieved.  And so I, I had the, I had the formula for success right there before me, and I decided to, to take the mantle and do it myself.
Story_ID: 237806
Speaker 1: Now what, what were your favorite books when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Books you know, again in elementary school [Fidelity Elementary School, Galena Park, Texas], I really don't remember much about those particular books.  One of the most important books I read was certainly 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley] when I was a bit older.  But also there were other, you know 'The Grapes of Wrath' [John Steinbeck] you know 'To Kill a Mockingbird' [Harper Lee] those types of books that I read that really help me to enjoy the beauty of reading which continues to be, continues to this day.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did you really enjoy the most when you were a little kid growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I was a little k-, the things I enjoyed, music, I loved music, this was again Motown was you know in full bloom, so [The] Temptations, [The] Supremes, Four Tops, the whole Motown, James Brown, Aretha Franklin really I was passionate about music.  I really enjoyed music as much as anything, and enjoyed sports, played football since the beginning of fourth grade which is you know typically when they start in Texas.  And you know it was football all throughout high school [Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Now did you play organized football or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, no it was organized football in fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it)
Speaker 2: We were bad.
Speaker 1: With helmets and pads?
Speaker 2: With helmets and pads.
Speaker 1: Okay this is Texas.
Speaker 2: This is Texas, this is serious, Friday night lights, no we were serious.  Fourth grade we had the team, the pad everything, the colors you name it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't---now were you aware at the time that this isn't done in most places?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause that's, that was the only life I knew, and it was just understood.  We were out there banging each other in the head you know banging each other up, seriously.  At the games every night, not just to practice, but the games, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you played football all through, did you play through high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Formal football, what, what did play what position?
Speaker 2: I played linebacker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was the captain of the team, linebacker you know I was, I was thought to be very good.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you know of or know Mike Singletary by any chance?
Speaker 2: No, not at that time.
Speaker 1: He was a Texan I think.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we played there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but no I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: By the time I graduated you know high school, again I, by that time, I was in a Catholic high school Jesuit.  And while we were very good, which is state championship, I knew once I finished that last game that would be the last time I'd play football.
Speaker 1: Yeah you have to; I mean to be a linebacker on a higher level I mean you have to be a bigger, I would guess.
Speaker 2: Not necessarily at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] is where I went, but I recognized that I was never gonna have a future in football.  So why take the time away from my academics and, so I concluded that was it, it was much more important that I do well academically than continue to play sports.
Speaker 1: Okay so football was the primary sport though?
Speaker 2: That was my primary sport, not baseball not basketball, not anything else.
Story_ID: 237807
Speaker 1: Now in high school [Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Dallas, Texas], now you said that these two events in high school seem to really shape your life, the internship in the Texas state legislature and the trip to Greece?
Speaker 2: Yes, again, you know in junior high school, you have in seventh grade I had a choice to continue in my old school Fidelity [Fidelity Manor Junior-Senior High School, Galena Park, Texas] which was all black school, or they gave black students an option of going to the all-white school.  I chose to go to the all-white school because I thought I would get a better educ, a better education.  And indeed it was very challenging but also it was a very interesting experience being one of the few black students in this all white environment.  What I found was that I was able to make good friends, but also I was very competitive academically, and I really enjoy being able to be competitive in the academic sense as well as the athletic sense.  So in enjoyed that experience and then the following year, they actually closed the black schools and made everyone go to the white schools, it was forced integration.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were about a year ahead of
Speaker 2: I was a year ahead.
Speaker 1: Of the other black students.
Speaker 2: I was a year ahead, but one of the more challenging I think you know for a kid in seventh grade, I played football, was very good in football and then my school, Galena Park [Middle School, Galena Park, Texas] played the all white school, played the all black school.  And of course I ended up playing my friends which was a very tough, tough thing.
Speaker 1: So they, they didn't close (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Galena Park, not in seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in eighth grade, they closed it down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I keep thinking you, you know when you say, a game, I'm thinking high school, but it's not, it's really
Speaker 2: Junior high school.
Speaker 1: Junior high school.
Speaker 2: Junior high school football, junior high school football yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was difficult, playing against my best friends, and you know knocking each other out, but they won the game (laughter) and so I was, I was happy, but I was sad 'cause I wanted to win 'cause I'm competitive.   Again eighth grade, they made, they forced everyone, they shut down all black schools, forced everyone to the all white school and it was a very difficult time.  You know there were riots in the school, fights you know people not getting along, and so we formed a bi-racial committee that studied issues, of, of race.  I was chosen to be on that committee and we came up with some concrete suggestions to help the school to better integrate itself.
Speaker 1: So this was like 1967, '68 [1968] maybe?
Speaker 2: Yes in that timeframe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: So but all of those life experiences have helped me to continue to be able to live in different types of environments.  All black environment, all white environment, black and white environment, you have to be able to relate to different types of people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --different times.
Story_ID: 237808
Speaker 1: So well when you were a page, let's go back to when you're fourteen, you're a page, now what, what was your--Barbara Jordan was in the state legislature [Texas Legislature]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was, and a very commanding person.  She was extremely articulate but again quite, quite demanding but there were a number of, of very significant political figures at the time there in addition to her.  There's a woman by the name of Sissy Farenthold [Frances Farenthold] who was a pioneer in the women's political movement here in Texas and internationally.  She was there in the Texas Legislature, a guy named Ben Barnes who became you know somewhat of a legend in Texas politics.  So I had the experience of being around these people inner acting, interacting with them.  And also being away from home and in a responsible position that really help me mature, mature that much more.
Speaker 1: Okay any stories from the Texas state legislature you can tell us, anything particular that happen that was, where you learned something you didn't know or, or something happened that shook you up a little bit or?
Speaker 2: Well the one thing I, I would say is that as a consequence of my success as a, as a page, I would occasionally come home to visit my parents [Georgia Conner Youngblood and Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.] and my siblings.  And of course I had my nice suit, my nice clothes and I would come home and we weren't in the best shape here at home.  And so I would be a little bit standoffish with my parents and with my siblings given my elevated stature in, in Austin [Texas].  But my mom had a very frank conversation with me reminding me this is your family you know and you, no matter where you go, no matter what you might become, no matter how much money you make or this is where it all starts.  And so don't stick your nose up and try to deny who you are, and that was a very grounding experience for me to, to never forget.  And I never have forgotten.
Story_ID: 237809
Speaker 1: Now you get one type of a political education as a page in the Texas state legislature [Texas Legislature], but how, I don't know what they, you got to tell me what that is vis-a-vis the political education you got in Greece, 'cause you said you were around a lot of communist, socialist, people really had a, had a bone to pick with the United States.  They didn't like US foreign policy and, and I guess they talked to you about it 'cause you said that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No question about it, no question about it that was a much more global perspective on the world as compared to you know being Austin [Texas] at fourteen with more local and state wide issues.  The, the experience in Greece was a tremendous experience, much more so than the experience in Austin that allowed me to think outside a traditional box of just a U.S. perspective.  And I've continued to this date to spend a great deal of time overseas in different parts of the world, both for business and as well for pleasure.  And expose my kids and everyone else and it really all emanates from, transfers in Greece.
Speaker 1: Okay now this is 1971
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972] okay, all right.  So you're in Greece in '72 [1972] and so you were there for the sum, was it the summer or the whole school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Summer.
Speaker 1: Summer, okay all right.  So had you really thought much about communism or socialism before you went to Greece?
Speaker 2: Not at all, I had no idea what it really was or wasn't but and, and it wasn't as important the definition at the time, it was more the strong difference of opinion many of my friends had with regard to US foreign policies.  And I never heard that kind of criticism before.
Speaker 1: Now were there any black people in Greece?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Any black Greeks?
Speaker 2: People were often times stop me in the street, particularly if I went to villages and would just rub my skin or you know, you know rub my hair, and just figure try to out what's going on.  They were they were quite taken aback.
Speaker 1: Now had they really, did they know there were black Americans?
Speaker 2: From sporting events, they were familiar, but, but that was really the only context.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So anything else about Greece you want to tell us?
Speaker 2: What I would say is that people despite their criticism of US foreign policy, they really welcomed me as an American, particularly as a black American.  And were open and, and honest and, and very giving and caring about who I was and helped me to learn so, so  much that it was a very positive welcoming experience for me.
Story_ID: 237810
Speaker 1: Okay, now in, in high school [Galena Park High School, Galena Park, Texas], now you're at, what's the name your high school again?  It's--
Speaker 2: Well, again I was at Galena Park (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Okay.
Speaker 2: --High School but then after I returned from Greece at sixteen, I was, my family moved from Galena Park [Texas] to Jesuit, to Dallas, Texas and I went to Jesuit High School [Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, Jesuit High School.  Now this is generally, now this is Jesuit High School I supposed is all male, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Private, Catholic all male school, I'd never been to a private school before.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did you adjust to that?
Speaker 2: It, it wasn't easy, but I, I adjusted they do have a, a school by the name of Ursuline [Academy of Dallas, Dallas, Texas] which is an all girls school which is in relatively close proximity.  But again it was a very different experience, I'd never been to a private school before, and it was a very academically challenging school, so it made it that much tougher on me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did that affect your social life, you know, when you know usually people aren't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I didn't have a social life really.  It, you know there were very few black women, young ladies, I should say in school in school at, at Ursuline, the sister school.  And moreover, I was new to the Dallas community, so I, I just didn't have a lot of friends male or female.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did things get better as you were there or
Speaker 2: Yes, things got better, but I truthfully I was looking to get out, I was, I came in as a junior, and once you get to senior year, I, I really was focused on college and, and making my way out of high school.
Story_ID: 237811
Speaker 1: Now what did you think--did you--your name, your first name is, you're named for a, a doctor basically [Dr. Charles Kneeland].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And with all the doctors in the family did you really see yourself at that time as a future doctor or somebody who was gonna become a, a doctor?
Speaker 2: I knew I could do it. And having people in my family who were physicians gave me that kind of confidence, but I always thought I'd always be a lawyer.  The only things I knew in college were be a doctor, lawyer, teacher or preacher; I didn't know anything about finance, Wall Street, entrepreneurship, any of these other things.  And but I did know that it's in the law and so I actually majored in political science of the Department of Politics is what we describe it at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  But also took the pre-medical studies while I was there.
Speaker 1: So you, when you graduated from high school [Jesuit College Preparatory School of Dallas, Dallas Texas], I take you graduated with a high (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: In your class.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're a National Merit Scholar or something?
Speaker 2: I actually I wasn't a National Merit Scholar, I didn't take the exams very well, I had great grades and I distinguished myself a little to my peers not only 'cause of great academic grades, but I'd been an exchange student to Greece, which is quite different you know in 1972 for most kids.  So had distinguished myself on the football field, was quite good there, and you know on the National Honor Society and other types of leadership, where as if they be competitive for a school like Princeton.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well why, how did you chose was it because of your grandfather's [Beadie Eugene Conner] experience outside the gates of Princeton that (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really, I wasn't even aware of it, I was not even aware of it.  I chose Princeton because I thought it was the best undergraduate institution.  I looked at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] all those schools that I thought were top schools.  But Princeton was the only school that didn't have a law school, didn't have a medical school or business school.  It really was principally foe, focused on the undergraduate and that's really what I was going to be there for.  So that's the reason why I chose it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well what was it like for you, what was Princeton like?
Speaker 2: Princeton was very tough, I was not prepared well academically, even though I'd gone to Jesuit my last couple of years, had gone to public schools all my life.  And so I didn't have the foundation necessary really compete as well as I would've liked so.  It required me to work; it required me to work much, much, much high, harder than many of my peers.  However, having said that, I came out ahead and did very well.
Speaker 1: So this is '74 [1974] when you start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974] okay, all right.  So were there any teachers at Princeton that really stand out as mentors or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I had a French teaser, teacher by the name of Holtsburg [ph.] who was quite good.  I had a politics professor by the name of H. H. Wilson [Harper Hubert Wilson] who was my advisor, became my advisor at Princeton both my junior paper as well as my thesis, my senior year thesis.
Speaker 1: Now is this a black professor?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He was not.  He was a gentleman who was focused, principally on civil liberties litigation.
Story_ID: 237812
Speaker 1: Now you focused on political science, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir as I mentioned political science, Department of Politics that's what I majored in, but also I took the pre-medical studies as well.
Speaker 1: Well then were you influenced at all by the, did they have a black studies department, African American studies?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did, and it was very much a part of who I was and what I was about being at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] certainly, socially but also from a political perspective, we had a number of different events at at the Third World Center [Carl A. Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] which is where people of color the most part congregated and we discussed different issues.  Whether it was situation in Iraq, I mean Iran, whether it was you know politics of the United States, whether it was issue of apartheid in South Africa all those things were very much a part of the dynamic at the university campus at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who was the director then of the Third World Center?
Speaker 2: The director of the Third World Center, I'm actually not quite sure.
Speaker 1: Or who, who were the prominent teachers and figures from that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well the guy who really, we, we developed an organization called Peoples Front for the Liberation of South Africa.  And that vehicle really became the protest vehicle for pressing the South Africa government to releasing Nelson Mandela and to do away with apartheid.  And our focus was really on the university's investment to corporations that do business in South Africa, so we had sixty plus days of protest.  And eventually did a sit-in to take over the administration building to, to protest our theorist position.
Speaker 1: Now this sit-in involved, I read it involved about two hundred people--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, over two hundred people.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Over two hundred people and it was quite successful.
Speaker 1: Now and but also read, I read a little piece you wrote about it in "Reflection" and you know you were really, this was really a serious deal for you.  I mean some students; in fact I read a story once about [HistoryMaker Reverend] Eugene Rivers being at, at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Involved in student protest, they found out that he actually wasn't a student he was like in charge of the student thing, but he wasn't a student (laughing) but you had something at stake, 'cause you were, you were trying to go to medical school at some point, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you were, I mean its (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had some, some
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Some exposure.
Speaker 1: So you had, I read you said you called home.
Speaker 2: Yeah I talked to my folks [Georgia Conner Youngblood and Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.].
Speaker 1: And had a talk
Speaker 2: And while they didn't necessarily agree, they were supportive of my efforts because they knew I generally showed good judgment about the things I'm involved in.  And I told them this was something that was important to me and they were supportive.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did it take you, take a lot of people have seen 'School Daze,' where there's a dramatic kind of demonstration about South Africa, I think in School Daze when Spike Lee's movie from '95 [sic. 1998] about this black school investing in you know in South Africa through and people you know and students find these things out they're usually outranged and shocked but.  Did you, did it take much to convince you that Princeton was actually doing that at that time or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No it didn't, I mean once I kind of read the literature and did some research on it, it was quite compelling.  I even had an opportunity to take a course in political science at Princeton dealing with South African history so I was quite familiar and educated on it.  And as a young person you really do want to make a difference in the world, and here was a perfect opportunity to stand up and we did.
Story_ID: 237813
Speaker 1: Okay, so you took over, what was it the administration building or what was it?
Speaker 2: Yes, Nassau Hall [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right and what was their [People's Front for the Liberation of South Africa], what was your goal, how long did you plan on being there?
Speaker 2: We were there I wanna say around twenty-three hours, twenty-three hours, and then we all got arrested (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So you make the paper and everything, will that make (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it did, and it was very much part of what was going on at Princeton 'cause The Daily Princetonian is actually published by you know students themselves you know, it, it was, it was quite a big, it was a quite a (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah it's a man; one of the students I guess by the last name of [Adhimu] Chunga was like a leader?
Speaker 2: Yes, a leader named Chunga, who was quite an articulate spokesperson for us.  And was actually the first time a university that I had experienced really into integration because Princeton was a very segregated place you know black were on one side whites were on the other side.  But this was really the most consolidated effort to bring two things together, and it worked.
Speaker 1: Okay so what, what did the university end up doing?
Speaker 2: Well they didn't change their policy but we pushed them, we pushed them hard, we did what we could.
Speaker 1: So they were agitated at least by all of this?
Speaker 2: No question about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No question about it, and eventually they did change, eventually they did change.
Speaker 1: All right and there's, there's like a follow-up to this story 'cause you actually go to South Africa at some point and after you graduated and you're in your career and everything and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I had the good fortune to go on a presidential trade mission led by [HistoryMaker] Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary got a chance to meet with Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk and talk to them about the protest particularly with Mandela.  And he said there's no question that you all efforts made a big difference in terms of my release number one and number two, the white government abandoning apartheid.  And so for me it was reassuring to know that the risk that I had taken were such that it made a difference.  And I was I was very moved by it.
Speaker 1: Now were you afraid, I mean did, did it seem like a, seem likely that you would be kicked out of school, expelled?
Speaker 2: Yes, it seemed like it could, it could be that way, but I was prepared, I was prepared for that.
Speaker 1: So tell everybody did they meet with you, and was there a follow-up after the, you all were arrested, what happened?
Speaker 2: No, there really, there really wasn't in terms of, of significant follow-up, the university simply made us pledge that you know we wouldn't engage in this again.  And so we didn't leave with an arrest record or anything like that, but it was, it was a very positive experience, very positive experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Taking responsibility, doing what you believe in.
Story_ID: 237814
Speaker 1: All right, so at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], you were saying off camera that [Dr.] Cornel West was at Princeton at the time that you were there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Cornel was at Princeton and again provocative guy both then as well as now, always in the thick of a conversation challenging people to think differently about things and, and was, was a, a great person to be around at that time as he is now.
Speaker 1: Okay and you were you were pursuing political science primarily right now, but you.
Speaker 2: Yes, what, what happened was I always had a facility and an interest in politics from fourteen being in the [Texas] Legislature you know working as a page, and Greece heightened even more my interest in politics.  The challenge for me though was when I looked at examples of leadership in my community at least and in, in the black community of, of leadership, I didn't see lawyers as representing the degree of independence and security and, and credibility as much as, as I would've liked.  And again, I just happened to have examples in my own personal family, my grandfather [Beadie Eugene Conner], you know people in medicine and my dad [Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.] who were independent businessmen and women.  And I wanted to make sure first and foremost that I had that, and then the skills to be able to kind to be involved in politics.  And so I took an interest in political science, I majored in political science, but I also took all the pre-medical studies while I was at Princeton.  So that at the end of the day I could decide which way to go.
Speaker 1: And that's a heavy load, I would think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a heavy load and what happened was during my junior year, I still had not decided what to do, medical school or law school.  And so I spent my junior year overseas in Europe.  I made a commitment my first two years in college that I would work like nobody's business.  And I dare say, I don't think anyone at Princeton worked as hard as I did. No one.  I made a commitment myself that I would work you know however many hours, how long it took to do the best that I can do.  And you know I was not that gifted a student, but I knew no one could work harder than I did.  So and also I realized most people screwed up their first year, first or second year then they got better over time.  And I wanted to, to change that, I came and wanted to make sure I did my absolute very best my first two years.  So I, I did that, but again at the end of my sophomore year, I couldn't decide medical school, law school, so I had applied, got accepted to go to the University of Stockholm [sic. Stockholm University] in [Stockholm] Sweden and also a small college Warnborough College in Oxford, England.  And the idea was I'll go over there, I'll study international systems of healthcare which combine political science as well as kind of healthcare policy and interest.  And during that year try to figure out what I wanted to be when I grow up, and so during the course of that year, I travelled a great deal. You know, in, back to Greece but you know France, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe.  And during the course of that year, made a decision to go to medical school as opposed to law school.  And my reasoning was as follows. I thought medicine provided me more credibility, more independence, more security.  It allowed me to travel anywhere in the world 'cause the human body was the same.  And while I didn't expect to practice medicine long-term, I knew that if everything else failed, I could always practice medicine.  And, you know, have a life and career fulfilling, so that was the reason why I chose to go to medical school.  Recognizing when I applied that I probably wouldn't do it long-term, but I was prepared to make that sacrifice.
Story_ID: 237815
Speaker 1: After your senior year [at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], you applied to medical school?
Speaker 2: Yes, during my senior year I came back to Princeton you know after my junior year, in my senior year I applied to medical school.  And had the good fortune of, of getting in medical school but of course during that time I was also very involved politically protesting university investments in corporations that do business in South Africa.  Ended up doing the sit-in, you know took over the administration building [Nassau Hall, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], but it was you know a great experience.  Both doing that as well as having the opportunity, I got accepted to the University of Texas [Health Science Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas] among other medical schools.  University Texas Southwestern here in Dallas [Texas] was home for me and it was an opportunity to come home, go to medical school.  And you know pursue my, my career in medicine, and so I came back to medical school.
Speaker 1: So what about year is this when you?
Speaker 2: This is 1980, this is 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So 1978 to 1982.
Speaker 1: So '78 [1978] you're, you're back here at the University of Texas at Dallas?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And in medical school.
Speaker 2: And when I applied to medical school, again I, I was, I had the good fortune of contacting one of the Princeton alumni who I had met here and he introduced me to a guy named John [C.] Norman who was a cardiothoracic surgeon in, in Houston, Texas.  African American, very, very prominent in academic research, and I had the opportunity to talk with him about medical school and opportunities and the challenges of being African American.  And he really encouraged me and I really looked up to him and I do to this day.  'Cause he's been a great pioneer in this space.  So after talking with him, he convinced me to go to medical school and I you know I, I was successful in getting in.  Of course John Norman being who he was said well you should go to medical school and law school (laughter) 'cause he's that kind of guy, I mean he's a very challenging guy--
Story_ID: 237816
Speaker 1: But I came back you know the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School [Texas Health Science Center, Dallas, Texas], and enjoyed my four years of medical school.  I really did, I thought I'd be a thoracic surgeon or neurosurgeon, but the more I did it, I recognized as much as I enjoyed it, if I did thoracic surgeon or surgery or neurosurgery, I could never leave medicine.  And so during the course of my senior year, I, as I often times do, wrote a proposal, got funding and went to Egypt for a few months to do my electives.  I was originally going to Beirut, Lebanon, but things got kind of dicey in, in Beirut and so I ended up going to Cairo, Egypt.  Of course even Cairo was a bit dicey 'cause [President Anwar] Sadat got assassinated just before I got there.
Speaker 2: Now this is 19- what is this?
Speaker 1: This is 1981.
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981], okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-one [1981].  But I still, I spent a few months in Cairo it was an extraordinary time for me, I had an apartment on the Nile [River], pyramids in the background.  And it was an opportunity to reflect on my life, what I wanted to be when I grew up.  Looking at the, looking at history, looking at the Sphinx, looking at the pyramids, having all of these, these extraordinary monuments of, of history right there before me, and it, it certainly made me feel much, much smaller.  But it, it allowed me to challenge myself about my thinking, my career and what I wanted to do and I decided that I would consider doing thoracic surgery, or neurosurgery would do emergency medicine.  Because it was fun, it was intense, it was immediate gratification, but again it also allowed me to explore some other avenues.  In emergency medicine, we generally didn't work more than fifteen days out of the month, usually not more than three days in a row.  So it gave me a chance to actually explore some other areas and I also if I ever left medicine would simply walk out the door.  And not have to worry about an office practice or any of that, so that's, that's what going over there to Egypt allowed me to think about. And again, I had a chance to you know visit Jordan where I was the -- Queen Noor of Jordan was a graduate of Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  I didn't know her but I wrote her a note, just saying I'd love to visit Jordan, and she called me back.  Said hey, look just come on over, and I had an opportunity to be the guest of Queen Noor and King Hussein [bin Talal] of Jordan during you know my stay in Jordan for a few days, it was great.  And then, you know, got chance to go to the palace, visit some of the historical sites and in Jordan.  And really get an appreciation for you know Jordan and the great things it had to offer.
Story_ID: 237817
Speaker 1: I also had the opportunity of course to go to Israel and particularly spend the Christmas holidays in Israel.  And specifically to attend Midnight Mass at the site of you know in Jerusalem at the site of the, the manger, I guess.
Speaker 2: The Church of Holy Sepulchre [sic. Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem, Palestine]?
Speaker 1: Sepulchre, yes, and it was, it was quite an extraordinary, you know evening and on lots of different levels.  You know Jerusalem is a, an intense place, you have the Muslims, the Jews, the Christians, and everyone's you know battling for, for different parts of this very small territory.  But even at the church it was amazing, it was packed and there was almost a fight that broke out in the church.  Because of people just being that intense, so it, it was quite a, I thought it was quite instructive.  That here at this place of the birth of Christ that a fight's about to break out in church over something that I'm sure is inconsequential, so such is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they been fighting about it for, for a couple thousand years now.
Speaker 1: Since the beginning of time, so.
Speaker 2: So a couple thousand years now for really (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 237818
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of effect did Egypt have on you in terms of your own identity and, and going there and I know African Americans going to Egypt you know they see so many different kinds of people that are African, of African descent.  A lot of people that look like you in Egypt--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Lot of people darker, some lighter you know I mean what, did, did people ask you was there, who you were?
Speaker 2: Well first most people assumed I was Egyptian, I mean no one, as long as I didn't say anything; most people assumed I was Egyptian.  So perhaps (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) [President Anwar] Sadat, you, you could be Sadat's son.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: No question about it so.  Most people assumed I was Egyptian; of course of course I opened my mouth they knew otherwise.  But I was opened again with welcome arms and it really being in the Middle East gave me an appreciation for the Palestinian Israeli conflict, as well as the global conflict within the Middle East.  And that problem is is one that we have dealt with for centuries and continue to deal with of course until this day.  But quite interesting place I, in fact the name of my company is Pharos [Capital Group, LLC] which is the lighthouse in ancient Egypt during the time of Alexander the Great, and one of the Seven Wonders of the World.  So it continues to, my experience it continues to be part of my, my everyday life.
Speaker 1: Okay now did you meet David Graham [Du Bois] or Shirley Graham Du Bois there, I think David Graham, Shirley Graham Du Bois' son lived in Ci- still living in Cairo [Egypt], I think.
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't, again, this was a few years ago, 1981 when I was over there, but I really didn't meet, I don't know if I met any African Americans while I was in Egypt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But of course I was also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not even the tours, you ever like check any of the tours out Dr. Ben [HistoryMaker Yosef Ben-Jochannan] at that time was bringing tours over and--
Speaker 2: Because I was also, I was actually studying, so I was going to Cairo University Medical Center [Al Ainy Medical School, Cairo, Egypt], I was doing this, doing that.  And so I wasn't just doing the normal tourist things.  I did you know have on occasion weekend I go to the Valley of the Kings or spend some, you know really touring the country.  And then that's since I you know I met some tourist and things, but.
Speaker 1: Well was that, was that a shock to go to Southern Egypt and see all the black people in Southern, I mean they're really, you know?
Speaker 2: No, it was, it's remarkable country with a remarkable history, and again the ruins and particularly the tombs in the Valley of the King are just, are just extraordinary.
Story_ID: 237819
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll get you out of Egypt now; I just had (laughter) to ask a couple questions.  But now so when you came back you were, I guess that was your senior year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was my senior [year at Texas Health Science Center; University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas], so when I came back, I knew exactly what I just, I'll do emergency medicine, again for the reason I articulated, it was fun, it was intense, I enjoyed it, it's immediate gratification.  But also from a lifestyle perspective, it would allow me to exit medicine, if and when I chose to, to leave medicine.  Not having to worry about an office practice or anything like that.  Moreover, having off around fifteen days out of the month, I could explore some other things, so you know that, that was very compelling.
Speaker 1: Okay so that, those of us who are not in medicine don't know that pattern but you work so many hours and then you're off for fifteen day in a row?
Speaker 2: Yeah we off, you know, generally you don't work but about fifteen days, I mean usually you don't work more than three days in a row.  So I might right Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I'd be off Thursday, Friday, work Saturday, Sunday, be off you know, Monday, you know Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Usually not more than fifteen days out of a month, so if I wanted to work seven days straight, great, and be off seven days, great, and you know.  Any kind of pattern you would like to construct, you generally can construct.  I can work fifteen days straight in a row and be off fifteen days straight in a row.  But it's a very intense profession, so you really want to give yourself time to recuperate because of the stress associated with making and life and death decisions.
Speaker 1: So when you do emergency medicine, do you really, I mean I you, you see like residents then staying up like all you know twenty hours in a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I certainly did my internship and my residency, my internship and surgery my residency emergency medicine and I actually came back to Dallas [Texas] in 1986, to practice medicine emergency medicine and I worked out of an emergency room.  Usually twelve hour shifts, you know seven in the morning to seven in the evening or seven in the evening till seven in the morning.  I actually ended up working seven years just straight nights, seven pm to seven am, just, just nights.  'Cause that's where really the action was at, that's when the knife and gun club comes out, all the car accidents, the overdoses, the, the real trauma comes out, and so I enjoy.
Speaker 1: Now Dr. [John C.] Norman, we were discussing off camera his book 'Medicine in the Ghetto.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and well why do you find that book so compelling and you just mentioned the knife and gun thing going on at night and stuff you know, what?
Speaker 2: Well what was interesting about the book was that he really articulated the traumatic situation within the African American community in terms of their health.  And there are many factors associated with the high blood pressure, the diabetes, the heart disease, stroke, but a lot of it gets to the environment in which they live in.  And lack of jobs, lack of education, you know lack of, of appropriate housing those you know, you know cleanliness those kinds of things that have a devastating impact on, on people's health.  And that book was a seminal book in terms of defining the issues.
Speaker 1: If you had to write a book about your experiences in the emergency room, I mean what would it be like?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, I did write a chapter in the book about it, the book was edited by Henry Cisneros, former secretary of housing and urban development.
Speaker 1: And mayor of San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 2: And former mayor of San Antonio, yes.  And it was a chapter on some of my experiences in the emergency room in looking at certain patients and how they reflected the problems of any inner-city America.  And the title of Henry's book was 'Interwoven Destinies[: Cities and the Nation,' Henry G. Cisneros] and it's, it really is about just the challenges of urban America and you know the other America.  Urban America and the rest of America and, and so I looked at from the perspective of an emergency department physician taking care of patients who come in with certain types of illnesses or trauma, and how it reflects on both urban as well as suburban America.
Story_ID: 237820
Speaker 1: So you were an emergency physician through nineteen what?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-six [1986] to around 1996.
Speaker 1: Okay all right so that's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Approximately ten years.
Speaker 1: All right, but you didn't stay, you didn't plan to stay in medicine and you didn't.
Speaker 2: Well I was actually pretty happy you know I was you know married, I have six kids and was on way to you know the big house, the mortgage the you know all the things that, that most professionals get into.  But again I got involved in politics 'cause I wanted to give back to the community and I found that very few people of color had been involved in the financial side of politics.  And I wanted to make a difference politically and so I focused on the finance part of it.  Started with a guy named Bill Bradley who was then a senator out of New Jersey was running for re-election, got to know them, him through a Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] alumni, organization and said look, I'd like to raise money for you.  And if you tell that any politician they're like please sign me up, and so I had the good fortune of hosting for him a fund raiser here in Texas around 1986 and '87 [1987], which was enormously successful and--
Speaker 1: Now Bill Bradley he was a basketball star at Princeton, star in the NBA [National Basketball Association] with the [New York] Knicks and also I mean as a senator from New Jersey, he seemed like a, a pretty strong candidate for the presidency at one point, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, and that was in part precisely the reason why I supported him and, and my colleagues supported him, in that it was an investment in the future.  One wanted to get involved and number two wanted to be involved with people who were sensitive.  And he was in the middle of the road guy, very thoughtful guy, we knew he had a sensitivity for some of the issues, we had, sort of within the African American community, but, but in the broader American community, and someone who was respected having been a Rhodes Scholar, having been captain of the [1964 Summer] Olympic[s] [Tokyo, Japan] team, won a gold medal, NBA, All-Star, won World Championship twice, again United States senator.  This is a guy who had you know broad network of lots of accomplishments and still was very progressive in terms of his thinking.  So myself, group of friends we starting raising money for him here originally in Texas, that was very successful.  Then you know others raised money for him in Chicago [Illinois], [HistoryMaker] John Rogers [Jr.] having come down, come down to the event we did in, in Dallas [Texas], he then did for him in Chicago.  Friends we did for him in New York and again, he became very good friends, he's godfather for one of my kids.  But along the way then Ann Richards called said look you're raising all this money for some guy for New Jersey, I wanna run for governor of Texas, will you help me?  And Ann Richards is a very charming woman, and, and very savvy, I sat down, met with her and how could I say no.  So, you, know I signed up to help her and began to raise money for her to run for governor.
Story_ID: 237821
Speaker 1: How did you come to be a talented fundraiser, I mean what, what did you, this something that you?
Speaker 2: Well the truth is no, I hadn't--what happened to me was, I got back to Texas and I really wanted to get involved in politics, and I had a, a good friend who was involved politically and I kept asking him and different folks look I really want to get involved, I really want to get involved, really want to get involved.  And no one would ever invite me to anything and you know if they did, it was after the fact or what have you, and, Bill Bradley was coming to Texas to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] alumni event and I invited my good friend along with others to this event.  And they came enjoyed it, it was wonderful and then I got a call late in the afternoon saying, oh by the way, this was from one of the Princeton guys.  There is an event tonight that Bill's gonna be at, would you like to go to the fund raiser?  And I said sure, that's great, I tried to call my, my good friend and he wasn't in but I left message with him and I went to the event and of course I saw my good friend sitting on the podium and he hadn't asked, he hadn't told me about this event.  So I was I was not too happy.  Sometimes we want to be the only, the first with these, these efforts and so as I looked on what was going on that evening I decided, you know what, I can't get invited, I'll just do my own.  And had an opportunity you know while Bill Bradley was walking around to talk with him and say hey, look I'd like to--actually what happened was there was a restroom, he came in the restroom, we started talking.  I said "Look I'd like to do fundraiser for you." He said "You bet. Let's, let's do it a year from now."  And he introduced me to his people and so I did the event a year from then.  And it was a blockbuster success, blockbuster success, even though at the time it was, it was very interesting.  He was completely in favor, all onboard, but once people in the Dallas [Texas] community recognized that we're gonna do this event, they wanted to do their own event.  The traditional Democratic establishment folks and so I was gonna do this event Saturday and they were like what don't you just fold into our event, we'll do something on Friday, we just do it together.  I said well no, you can  maybe fold into my event, but why, would I you know I set this up, I did all of that and so they said no, we're you know we're the big guys we're the big honchos, who are you, you don't know anything.  And so they decided to do the event Friday night, and I kept my guns and said well we're gonna do ours Saturday.  And Bill Bradley's office to their credit, they said no, we still gonna come to your event, but they couldn't, while I would've liked for them to turn down the other event, you know a politician can't kern, turn down an event.  And these were the established folks in the Democratic Party in this town; they were all putting this together.  And so they, they had their event Friday night and then I had my event Saturday, I had breakfast, had lunch, I then had a discussion group on you know issues particularly in the African American community and you know progressive issues.  And you know we had a little reception for him, and we raised maybe three, four times more money than the other group did.  So it was quite, quite a, it was quite a success, and it really put us on the map in terms of people who could execute when it came to raising money.  And the key to it was first off, it wasn't just black folks, we engaged everyone in the, in the broader community but also younger people and we targeted new dollars.  People who had historically given to the political process, so lots of doctors, lots of people who we had relationships, and so people of political community just were astounded. You know that we were able to raise you know this kind of money and it was new money, it was new money and that's the thing that was so compelling.
Story_ID: 237822
Speaker 1: So from there Ann Richards had heard about this and said, "Look I'm running for governor [of Texas], will you help me," and I said, "Sure."  But again, it was the same thing all over again, we agreed to do a deal with Ann Richards, we're gonna raise money for her and the big boys in the Democratic Party here locally said look I do your event, why don't we just fold it in together, you come to our event.  I said I'm not, what, what is this deal here, you know, we, we plan this big event, you know you plan this event and, and they tried every way possible to not get us to do this deal.  And we just, and it was very difficult because these were powerful people, these were powerful people, businessmen and women in the, in the Democratic Party and who was I.  But we stuck to our guns, raised more money than they did (laughter) and then you know we just, we had a momentum of our own and she became governor.  And from that you know [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun I did an event for Carol here in Dallas [Texas].  With Barbara Jordan, had Barbara Jordan and Carol Mosley Braun raised a whole bunch of money for her.  Because again we were able to get Barbara here which was, you have these two great you know women in politics. And she was very happy to come down from Austin [Texas], we, we flew her down here to participate, but you know Harvey Gantt, North Carolina, raised money for him and Ron Brown raised money for Ron the DNC [Democratic National Committee].  And all of these things gave me tremendous access and I was doing it 'cause I really wanted to give back, participate.  I had no idea the impact of raising those dollars would have on my subsequent career change, but that's indeed what, what happened.  You know politics introduced me to business; heretofore I really hadn't been exposed in to the business community.  I didn't know entrepreneurs growing up, I just didn't, wasn't aware of it.  But when Ann Richards became governor, I said, "Well Governor what do you wanna do?" And I said, "Don't put me on the board of medical examiners for the health department or all these other things, put me with some interesting people."  And so she put me on a tax policy committee to study whether Texas should have an income tax or not, I said taxes, I said don't anything about taxes, just trust me just do it.   Well on it and it was headed by Henry Cisneros, but also former Governor John Connally and a number of CEOs, 'cause they were very interested in tax policy issues.  And one of the guys here in Dallas by the name of [J. McDonald] Don Williams who was chairman, CEO of Trammell Crow Company called me one day.  I think I was in the emergency room, said, "Hey, look, you know we're on this committee together, first meeting's in Austin, we both live in Dallas, you wanna just go down together?"  And I said, "Sure what, you know Southwest Airlines flight you on, so we can coordinate."  He said, "No, no, no, no you be at the hangar, we're going in my corporate jet."  I had no idea, people rolled like that.  So I, I got on this guy's jet, I said it's time to quit medicine, that was it, I'm out, I'm done.
Story_ID: 237823
Speaker 1: All right, so here you are as doctor, young doctor, you know, able to have successful fundraisers and Democratic, Texas Democratic organizations all shook up.  And --
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you're on a jet, on your way you know to this meeting so.
Speaker 2: Right.  It really, that experience, experience allowed me to, first get exposed, to just to a different world of how successful people lived.  And it was number one and number two; it allowed me to measure myself against some very talented people in area of expertise -- taxes -- that I hadn't really hadn't been trained in.  But was able to contribute in a positive way, gained people's respect who were community leaders be it Henry Cisneros who continues to be a friend to this day.  Who then asked me to subsequently to contribute to a book ['Interwoven Destinies: Cities and the Nation,' Henry G. Cisneros] he was editing or [J. McDonald] Don Williams, who's chairman, CEO of Trammell Crow Company who then subsequently became an investor in my fund, you know in my business [Pharos Capital Group, LLC].  And a number of people that again it gave me the confidence that I could do more than simply practice medicine.  And you know my generation, particularly of African Americans had the opportunity to just go to the best schools in the country to, to have, again much broader experience than, than generations before it.  So I thought it was incumbent upon me not to simply rest on the success that I had as a physician, but to really do more and be more.
Speaker 1: Now that's you know for a lot of people being a physician is, is pretty big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Big deal.
Speaker 1: It's a big deal, you know I mean you know people, that's the dream of every immigrant mother and their fa--their son would be a doctor you know.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And I mean that seems like a noble professional life saving profession it's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And in, in some ways it is but remember not for me, again I had the great fortune, I mean my grand--you know my grandfather [Beadie Eugene Conner] was a physician in 1930, and then he, that was a big deal.  Or his uncle before him, that was a big deal, for me being a physician it, it was just it was nice, it was good, but I hadn't actually moved the ball forward.  And so part of that was I hadn't been exposed, but once I got exposed, I knew that I had to, to really challenge myself to, to do more.   Again I enjoyed medicine it is a great profession I, I loved it, but, but having been exposed to the business community, I wanted to get my, try myself, try to see if I could do something in the business community.  And, and what I concluded was let me get next to money and I can figure it out from there.  And so I asked the governor [Ann Richards] to appoint me to the Teachers Retirement System of Texas [sic. Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Austin, Texas] and most people don't know what it is.  But it, if the pension fund dollars of the retired teachers of the State of Texas, so it was $30 billion in 1993 when I was appointed to the board, it's about $90 billion today.   And I was there from 1993 to 1999 and again we're looking at public equities, you know fixed income, real estate and then an area called private equity.  Which when I became more familiar with it recognized that really is where wealth is created, that really is where entrepreneurship is encouraged and fostered.
Story_ID: 237824
Speaker 1: And what private equity is, really is providing capital to entrepreneurs, and their businesses, in the most simplistic of ways.  There are different types of private equity, it's kind of an umbrella term, but there's early stage, you know venture capital, there's mid stage, there's later stage, there mezzanine and then there's called leverage buyouts.  The point is this is an area where firms provide access to entrepreneurs, who want to grow businesses, and the biggest challenge I found within the black community, one of the biggest challenges is access to capital. Access to capital.  The first place we go to is a bank and that's the worst place to try to get money, the worst place to try to bet money.  And so as I've studied (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now why would you say that's the worst place, I'm speaking for probably a lot people that'll listen to this.  Well they say well if you want money, you go to a bank, right?
Speaker 1: No, not at all.  First of all the bank is going to lend you money, the bank is going to lend you money.  And in order for them to lend you money, typically what happens is you have to have the money, you, you have to have some type of asset to pledge against those dollars.   And you know if you got the money, why do you need their money, again and so what people don't realize is there are large pools of capital available to entrepreneurs with a good business plan or good business that is not lending money but actually investing as part owners with you in businesses.  And that's the business of private equity.  And historically we just haven't had access to, to capital in order to grow our businesses and be successful.  The biggest challenge for most minority businesses is lack of capitalization, or not enough capitalization.
Story_ID: 237825
Speaker 1: I'd been very successful in fundraising politically and I knew that if I set my mind to it, I also could raise money for myself and for businesses that I was interested in terms of private equity.  So I knew you know a couple things I needed to do, I needed to do improve my own personal expertise in business and number two put together a good team of people.  On the personal side, again I've been involved in politics and so the president, the United States president, [President William Jefferson] Bill Clinton and the U.S. Senate confirmed me to go on the board of directors of a company we formed in 1993 to supply low-level uranium to utilities around the world, called the United States Enrichment Corporation [Bethesda, Maryland].  Why I wanted to do that was for the experience of being involved in corporate boards and you know being engaged in a very important transaction.  We formed this company in 1993 supplied low-level uranium, to utilities around the world.  We put together 80 percent of the domestic market, 40 percent of the world market; negotiated to purchase the nuclear weapons grade uranium from the former Soviet Union [Russia] to de-enrich it, sell it to utilities.  And then we took it public, we've had $2 billion (unclear) offer so that experience that capital marks experience was very important to my own maturity in terms of business.  And yet there are only five people on the board of directors, the original board was a guy named [William] Bill Rainer who was chairman of the board, founded a company by the name of Greenwich Capital [Markets, Inc.], Margaret [H.] Greene was the highest ranking woman at BellSouth [Corporation], Greta [Joy] Dicus who became chairman of [U.S.] Nuclear Regulatory Commission, myself and a guy by the name of Frank Zarb who was former energy secretary [sic.], but also former CEO of Smith Barney, and also former CEO of NASDAQ, so some very important people.
Story_ID: 237826
Speaker 1: I knew that for me corporate boards, I did an analysis and said I need to decrease my dependency on my income from medicine.  You know doctors make a good living and spend more, because they can always make it up, and I was just like every other physician.  So I needed income to replace the hours that I was putting into medicine, so I said corporate boards would, would be a way to do that.  And I said if I can build one board, one corporate board, what would be the best board I could be on?  I said airlines for one reason and one reason only, they let you travel for free, which would then open up other opportunities.  I didn't know anyone in the airline business, but I lived in Dallas [Texas], American Airlines is headquartered in Dallas.  And I said well you know great, I wanna be on the board of American, but why would American want me to be on the board?  So I sat down and I wrote out a thesis about why I should be on the board of American Airlines.  Not knowing anybody at American, and one day I happened to be a football game, Dallas Cowboys football game, and I'm sitting up in a friend's box and there's an old man down there and I sit down and I sit down next to him and we start talking as often as that happens.  You know I'm reasonably articulate young man and this older white man is looking at me and saying wow, you seem like such a nice guy and you know tell me about yourself.  And so I tell him who I am and what I'm about and he says, great I'd love to get you on the board of this not for-profit or that not for-profit. Well I said nah, time out, I already concluded I wasn't gonna get involved in anymore not for-profits, in fact, I resigned from every not for-profit that I was on.
Speaker 2: So you were on quite few (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was on, yeah, I was on the this and the that and the other you know the symphony and th--but I said well tell me who you are.  He said well you know I was former chairman, CEO of the RTC [Resolution Trust Corporation], former chairman CEO of Time Warner [Inc.], former U.S. postmaster [general], former chairman, CEO of American Airlines.  American Airlines, well if you think I'm so good, you should put me on the board of American Airlines, and I wanted to do this thing I had constructed, that I had memorized.  And he was like well maybe you have a point.  I can be out at American tomorrow you know, give me a call, and we'll talk about it.  So he called me the next day, he said look, I'm out at American--you know American actually has three boards.  They have AMR [Corporation, Fort Worth, Texas] the parent company, they have Sabre [Holdings Corporation; Sabre Corporation, Southlake, Texas]] which is the information technology company and you have investments who manages you know several billion dollars and that kind of thing.  And I you would be perfect on that board, I said great, well you know what's the, what's the perk?  He said well its, its four meetings a year, but I get to, you and your wife have free first-class travel anywhere in the world American Airlines flies.  I said that works, sign me up for that perk.  So I went on that board, in fact I'll be chairing that board come January this year.  And it opened up tremendous other opportunities for me.
Speaker 2: Now, now what year is this when you're on American Airlines board?
Speaker 1: That was about, this is nineteen, this is 2004, so it's about seven years ago, I mean it's like 1996 I think.
Story_ID: 237827
Speaker 1: And then the other board that I said would be great to be on would be a hotel board, 'cause I needed a place to stay.  Didn't know anybody in the hotel business, but again I'm on the board of Texas Teachers [sic. Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Austin, Texas], I chair the real estate committee at Texas Teachers.  I asked them to do some analysis on hotels, tell me about hotels, who's doing what, when, where, how and why.  And there's this small company called Starwood Hotels [and Resorts] that is you know really catching people's attention.  Its young but its led by you know a CEO who's really dynamic and, I then had the opportunity or figured out through a friend to meet the, the Chairman CEO of Starwood Hotels.  Speak to him and tell him about my desire to be on the board of directors of Starwood Hotels, and he says, "Okay, yeah.  You know, probably can't do it right now but we'll, we'll put you on one of our other boards first and then we'll, we'll move you over."  And, and so that gets done and again income from the boards allows me to decrease practicing medicine.  You know and in addition I also got a great education continue to have a great education and it also gave me creditability outside of medicine.  Was not a doctor on these boards, I was just Mr. Chairman, but it was a businessman.  And along the way I then tried to identify people who could, I could partner with, who had complimentary skills to my expertise.  And I had the good fortune of meeting a couple of guys, Michael Devlin and Bob Crants [Robert Crants] who recently left, left Goldman Sachs.  They left Goldman Sachs and they wanted to do their own asset management firm.  Bob had gone to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], finished number one in his class at Princeton.  Then went to Goldman Sachs, the investment banking firm was--finished Princeton in 1990, went to Goldman and was there from '90 [1990] '96 [1996] doing alternative investments.  Had developed a great track record of success there in terms of alternative investments, then Michael Devlin had gone to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], was a Fulbright scholar, studied at [The] Chinese University of Hong Kong [Sha Tin District, Hong Kong], went to Duke law school [Duke University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina].  And practice law in New York [New York] at Davis Polk [& Wardwell], joined Goldman Sachs in the early '90s [1990s] with Bob, they worked together doing alternative investments.  And they were leaving in '96 [1996], to do their own access management firm.  We hooked up in 1997 and decided we wanted to do some things together, and there was a small amount of money raised initially.  They had raised like $30 million, with that money goes a great track record that had been developed in alternative investments.  And then once we hooked up, I went out, we went out and raised $155 million to do deals, which are growth and expansion capital.  You know providing dollars to entrepreneurs, growth and expansion capital for companies in healthcare, business services and technology.  Principally underserved market, so it may be an African American entrepreneur, it may be somebody in an underserved market in Jackson, Mississippi.  So it be people, places enterprises that have been underdeveloped or under decapitalizing, unexploit ethnic regional and national market.  And so this $155 million we raised in 2000, we had raised, again the $30 million had been raised around 1998.  And then we were also joined by another colleague and partner Dale LeFebvre who was from Beaumont, Texas, went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], undergrad electrical engineering, was a Bell Lab[s] scholar there.  Spent three years doing consulting at McKinsey [& Company], has law degree, M.B.A. from Harvard [Business School, Boston, Massachusetts].  He joined us and again those two funds have done very well and now we're raising $300 million to continue to do exactly what we done before.  And we've raised to date $183 million so far.  And we will raised the rest of over the course of the next three to six months.  And continue to do what we did.
Speaker 2: Okay, well that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's, and again what do we do, we, we typically at a minimal we put in $5 million, but generally $10 to $15 million in companies that we like, that we think can grow and generate good returns for our investors.  So among our investors, count Chicago Transit Authority [CTA], but Cisco Systems, Nokia, Boeing, [The] Walt Disney [Company], Verizon, [The] Raytheon [Company], Archer Daniels Midland [Company], City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], State of New Mexico.  Again Louisiana State Teachers [sic. Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] host a public funds, corporate funds, some Taft-Hartley [Trust] Funds as well as highly work individuals invested with us.  That's what we do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 237828
Speaker 1: I wish I knew enough significant questions to ask 'cause I'm almost overwhelmed by just this information but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a beautiful business.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Now didn't--
Speaker 2: This is a business that again people of color by and large aren't in, and it is when you hear people, when you hear people buy these big companies--again a dear friend, a very good friend of mine bought Burger King, bought all Burger King, not the, not one Burger King, he bought all of the Burger Kings in the country, in the world.  How does he do that, how does that get done?  How that gets done is pension fund dollars of working class people, city employees, state employees, teachers, you know those folks are the people whose retirement dollars are accessed to buy these companies.  And even though many of us, people of color, women have a tremendous amount of money in those funds, we haven't had access to those funds.  And so what I've done is to begin to tap into those resources, that's, that's what I do.
Speaker 1: Well this is groundbreaking stuff because yeah, being involved in business is a lot more complicated than just being an entrepreneur, it's what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is, and again as I said before, access to capital is critical, again I'm on the board of Starwood Hotels [and Resorts] and the CEO is a very dynamic guy.  But again smart, bright guy, went to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], did real estate in Chicago [Illinois] at a firm called J & B Realty [sic. J B Realty, Inc.].  But the story is he did a deal invested $400 million and ended up losing all of the investor's money, went to zero.  So what did he do, he decided to go into business for himself, he got some friends to back him and they wrote him a check for you know $15, $30 million.  Start buying apartments you know he did well with those, flipped those to someone and so they wrote him another check for $60 million you know.  And again it ended up that he eventually, he eventually created Starwood Hotels which is one of the largest hotel companies in the world.  Owns the Sheraton, Westin, St. Regis, W Hotels, but he could do that 'cause he had access to capital.  And women, people of color it isn't about smarts, it isn't about drive, not about ambition, we have all of those things.  It's about having the capital in order to take the risk.
Speaker 1: So this what you just told me if I understand correctly, here is a guy that actually lost $4 million.
Speaker 2: Four hundred.
Speaker 1: Four hundred million?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he wasn't out of business, actually they said oh, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, go back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they felt like he made his mistakes, let's, let's go he'll learn from that, let's go for it.  And the, the challenge is particularly for people of color, they couldn't lose $400, let alone $400 million, in, in being in a position to succeed, but again he also didn't go to a bank.  He went to people who are in the business of risk based capital that is if he los- when he lost that $400 million or when his other friend wrote him a check for 15, $30 million, if he had lost that money, he didn't owe anything.  They lost their money, we all get to go on and on you know, I'm sorry it didn't work.  It's not a loan, it's okay, I'm gonna give you this money, we're gonna be partners you know I'll own 90 percent you'll own 10 percent, 'cause I put up all the money.  But you know it's much better to be a big par- I mean a small part of something big than a big part of something small, so yeah.  We own pieces of companies, parts of companies, businesses, big parts and small parts.
Speaker 1: And these, even now this is even sinking into me (laughter) if I listening I'm sure a lot of people will watch this will probably know a lot more than I do about this.  But this even, is starting to make sense to me, so and it's profound you know.  And it talks and it just speaks to the, I guess the depth of what you have to know to be really be successful in business as a series of relationships to go beyond just being, as you say bright and on the ball and pulling yourself up by your own (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)Your bootstraps.
Speaker 1: Yeah all that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: But access to capital is a tremendous part of, of the success of certain communities, but it historically not, has not been a part of our community as much as it needs to be or should be.  And without that, we really won't, we won't--we'll only have limited success in business, if we don't have access to capital.
Story_ID: 237829
Speaker 1: It is a different, it's a different mindset, and the business I'm in I understand when I go in that not every deal I'm gonna be in is gonna be successful, you know.  We put a company, we put $12 million in a company in I think it was June of, I wanna say 2002, within six months, they declared bankruptcy.  You know put $12 million of invested money and you know there was an allegation of fraud, this that and the other, they're still in bankruptcy now.  You know, that's devastating, that's terrible but you know you go to the next deal, some deals gonna work, some deals are not gonna work.  And we still haven't given up on that deal, we think we think we'll get our money back but, you know it's all kind of litigation.  But you know other deals you do you know turn out tremendous successful, and it's the average, you know but what you want to make sure you have more winners than losers and that the winners are you know generating great return.  For example, I'm gonna give you the most extreme case and again it doesn't, it's not our firm [Pharos Capital Group, LLC] unfortunately.  But there's a company that everybody knows about now, Google you know fun little part of the Internet. Well two firms put in two, two of the firms that invested put in $12 point million each into a small idea called Google by two graduate students at Stanford University [Stanford, California].  They put in $25 million, $12 point million, Kleiner Perkins [Caufield Byers], $12 point million Sequoia [Capital], Google just went public earlier this year.  Do you how much money they're looking to get back? Three billion.
Speaker 2: It's worth the risk.
Speaker 1: Worth the risk, now again they, there are a lot of companies that blew up along the way, da, da, da, da, da, but you know it's the business of risk capital, risk based capital.  Being in the mix there, we have to be in that mix, we aren't in that mix, we won't succeed as a people.  'Cause, 'cause business, even business you know the business of Amer- you know America is, is about business, that's what it's about.
Speaker 2: So what we're talking about now is being on the brink of some business success because we never have succeeded in this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 2: I mean not, not really, so now what, you, you represent you and Johnathan Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] and [HistoryMaker] Quintin Primo [III] and some other people represent a cutting edge of this, of a new you know you're going you're in a new frontier.
Speaker 1: New direction, no question about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're on a new frontier.
Speaker 1: And, and Quintin is great 'cause he's in real estate which is fundamentally important, John is in asset management of staking, picking stocks of public companies which is great.  Mine is interestingly enough in the private companies, I invest in private companies that looking to go public.  I invest in you know a guy who has, for example, I maybe it's a great barber shop concept; I'm not saying its barber, but maybe it's that, but it's rolling it nationally.  Giving him the money and say let's take this model you have here and we think it will work.  It's the McDonald's case, from the Ray Kroc saw McDonald's and said wow these guys are lining up, they doing this, they doing that, they doing that.  And he said you know what, let me I, I can I, I want to take this over, I'm gonna give you some money, I'm doing, you know I, that's what we're in the business to do.  We're in the business of recognizing great ideas, with great managers and then giving them the fuel, money to help them to execute on that.  And in exchange we take part ownership, we take part ownership, but our idea is not just to provide capital, but to be a value added investor.  We not only put money in, but we'll introduce you to a Disney or Boeing or a Nokia, people who are our investors, that can perhaps help you to grow your business.
Speaker 2: Okay, to, to get the money to do this you got to convince people like Chicago Transit Authority [CTA] and others to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To give back.
Speaker 2: Let them have your--
Speaker 1: To give me their money.  And so we have to--that's why I travel so much, that's why I'm on the road begging people to do it.  And again the majority of people will say no, but you just need enough people to say yes to be in the game.
Story_ID: 237830
Speaker 1: Now can you tell me a story of--is there a success story you can tell me about how some of the money you raise in this manner has been able to really make a big difference in, in the black community.  And something that everyday peop- people come in contact with and use?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Or need.
Speaker 2: You know one of the companies that in fact I had a board meeting today, this is a company that we think is, can be very powerful.  And I say next generation cholesterol screening company.  You know cardiovascular disease is, is devastating, you know in this country, but particularly in the African American community.  But this is a company that the technology was actually involved out The University of Alabama at Birmingham [Birmingham, Alabama].  And we saw this technology, there's a way to be able to identify high risk people who come in, or even don't come in, but may have heart problems.  Fifty percent of people who come in with a heart attack; have a normal cholesterol, normal cholesterol, completely normal.  So just having you know high cholesterol or no, that doesn't necessarily mean anything, so this test is a next generation.  It doesn't just measure total cholesterol, HDL or LDL, what it tells you is what type of cholesterol do you have.  Is it a soft cholesterol, is it a hard cholesterol, are you at risk for sudden death as a consequence of your cholesterol makeup?  The legion called, you know there's a, a test called LP(a) [lipoprotein(a)] which suggests that, that what within the heart you have, you may have a blockage of the left anterior descending artery.  Again (unclear) you die, sudden death.  And so it, again this test we're very optimistic of its impact you know nationally.  But particularly within African American community with has such high incidents of cardiovascular disease of it being able to really to save people's lives.  And so we're excited about the product and it's doing very well.  It's you know it's being rolled out across the country and it's a company that's growing very successfully.
Story_ID: 237831
Speaker 1: Yes, you're gonna, all right, off camera we discussed explaining the process.
Speaker 2: Yeah, business of private equity is, the economics I think are quite interesting.  To give you a sense of what the business is about, and let's take an example.  We raise let's say $100 million, you generally get 2 percent of whatever you raise for ten years.  These contracts are for ten years typically, so you get 2 percent of $100 million, $2 million a year for ten years.  But in addition, you know you put in 1 percent of the money that you raise.  So you put in a million, the investors put in $99 million, so you have $100 million, you get 2 percent of whatever you raise, every year for ten years.  But if you're able to, which, double that money, let's say you're able to double the money from $100 million to $200 million the economics are as follows.  The investors get 80 percent of the money back, because they put in 99 percent of it, but you get to keep 20 percent of it.  So they get $80 million, you get $20 million, that's how this business works.  Again, if you take $100 million, make $200 million, give everybody their money back $100 million boom, but then the $100 million in profit they take $80 million, you get $20 million.  And again that's with that fund and then you raise another fund in three years or four years, you do the same and another fund in three or four years you do the same.  And so it can really have an exponential impact on your income, both the fees that you get every year because the, the $2 million in fees keep going.  And then you know the next fund if you raise $100 at that time, maybe you raise $300 the next time, then you get $6 million in fees.  And then you raise $500 million, you know you get $10 million in fees, all of that for ten years, all stacked on top of it, so.  But again if you're able to take the $500 million double that you know you're able to give the investors 80 percent of $500 million, but you get to keep the 20 percent of the $500 million.  So it can be quite compelling from a financial standpoint.
Story_ID: 237832
Speaker 1: Yes, sir I can see that.  Let me ask you this though, now this, I'm thinking about this as you're, this might be a question other people might have.  But what you said, now you are a doctor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: --and you're a very bright man you know and you, you're humble enough to say you're not the, you know there are some there brighter than you are probably.
Speaker 2: Oh a lot are brighter.
Speaker 1: But, but you're a very bright man, and you're very accomplished man, Johnathan Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] and some of the other people that are involved in this are very bright people.  So what, but what essentially ingredient does someone have to have to be able to do this without you know buying a gold plated linear jet or something and you know, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: I, I think it is very simple, I think in order to do this, you need to first educate yourself about who you are as a person.  What are your strengths, what are your weaknesses, number one, number two and understanding that you need to complement yourself with skills that will allow you to take advantage of the opportunities in this place.  So people with experience in investing in entrepreneurs people with experience in understanding the capital markets, you know Wall Street.  People with experience can understand how to structure deals, people with experience in understanding how to raise capital, all of those kinds of things.  And that's really what any, but it's not rocket science, this is not nearly as hard as going to medical school, practicing medicine and all the rest.  It really is not, it's much more, much, much, I'm afraid to say easier but it is.  And quite frankly its much less stress, compared to anything I'd ever done.
Speaker 1: It would seem to me that there has to be a certain level of maturity and balance to be able to handle this though.  'Cause I said I mean some people at the, at the mere hint of any, or--[HistoryMaker] Comer [Joseph] Cottrell was telling us last night (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --that many people that he loaned money to, once they got the money that was the end of the rainbow for them.  And they (laughter) they spun off to [Las] Vegas [Nevada] or wherever--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The big rings, and clothes and, that's why they--
Speaker 2: Flashy.
Speaker 1: Yes, they just, weren't used to it and once they got a certain level of money they whatever their goal was, evaporated into.
Speaker 2: I think that and you're right, it does require a level of maturity but also, long-term perspective with regard to things.  And you know part of my perspective or, or philosophy in life is, is recognizing history, progress and destiny.  Those, those kinds of things, it's, it's understanding you know history of what's happened in the past to why and how, its making progress along the way.  But really focusing on the future, what happens in the present is, is not as important and its making sure that the decisions you make now have the right type of long-term impact.  And that's you know whether it was for me making the decision to go to medical school and training as a physician knowing I might not practice medicine long-term.  I've always been about you know delayed gratification and focusing on the long-term, that's, that's what you have to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you need to surround yourself with people who actually share those kinds of values and so it's--I understand Comer's frustrations sometimes with lending money to people who in fact then don't pay the money back. But many of those people unfortunately don't have that long-term perspective and, therefore, you just, you can't help everybody, you can't help everybody.
Story_ID: 237833
Speaker 1: What does it look like from your vantage point now in terms of young black men and women who want to get involved in this level of business activity.  Are they, are they there or are you trying to find them and train them or?
Speaker 2: No question about it, I mean we are always looking for bright talent, you know good smart people.  Again they exist, there's no question about it, we this thing called Trico Foundation [ph.] that we're looking to have some of the intern, you know interns from that program to participate in our offices [Pharos Capital Group, LLC] to work with us.  We've had you know students from Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] also be interns you know different folks, we, we wanna be in this business long-term.  And again what we can--for us it's not just about our success, it's about teaching others about this business and helping them to take it to another level.
Speaker 1: Now what is Trico Foundation?
Speaker 2: Trico Foundation is a foundation set-up to sponsor African Americans, people of color, women but particularly African Americans to the elite business schools around the country.  So Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] you know, Yale business school [Yale School of Management, New Haven, Connecticut], the, the prominent business schools around the country and to get them into financial services industry.
Story_ID: 237834
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yeah my, my hopes and concerns for the African American community are (pause) my hope and concern is education. Because without education you can't, you're, we aren't gonna succeed as a people. So education number one, number two respect for the law, respect for the law.  Respect for one another, respect for others, number three is a strong spiritual base that will get you through the tough times.  Again as well as the good times, but again strong moral base that kind of allows you to make the right decisions for the right reasons.  Number four it's really focusing on the future as well as the past and not so much the present.  Not living just for the here and now but really making decisions, understanding the past, but with a focus on the future and the impact that it will have.  'Cause that type of perspective, I think will go a long way towards helping us to avoid the, you know the mistakes that we hear now.  But the kind of immediate gratification type of mistakes.  You know it gives me hope that given the challenges that the black community has gone through--you know slavery and all the other challenges--that we're still around today.  Not every society you know can, can say that I mean I look at the American Indian [Native American] community, and really it's you know I'm very, very concerned that's it's a culture and people we're dying.  I you know it's tragic as that might be, we aren't there and you know we're in a much better position to really succeed as a people but I think we have to be focused on those types of things, in order to really continue to prosper.
Story_ID: 237835
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look back on your career thus far, now you've--you're fairly young, you know by the standards that we hold here at [The] HistoryMakers.  Is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of, I've, I've been very blessed and very fortunate, I've got great kids, I have a great wife [Dr. Sharon Youngblood].
Speaker 1: Now when, when did, tell us about meeting your wife now, you, we didn't talk about that during the course but.
Speaker 2: My wife, I went to her graduate school she'd gone, she went to Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] undergrad and then got her Ph.D. from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in biology and microgenetics was in a post doctorate at the medical school [University of Texas Southwestern Medical School] here [Dallas, Texas].  I met her, you know just you know going to school functions there, and we hit it off and she's been very, very supportive of me.  When I was a poor med student trying to make it and beyond so I've been very fortunate.
Speaker 1: Okay and you have like how many children now?
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: Six?
Speaker 2: Eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, twenty-two, twenty-three years old so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 237836
Speaker 1: All right, now did your parents [Georgia Conner Youngblood and Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.] get a chance to see you become, well first a doctor I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, and then, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes, both my parents did, my father died you know in 1990 and so I completed, I hadn't made the transition to exit medicine.  But you know he got a chance to see me be you know successful, relatively successful.  And my mom's still living, so she's, she's you know, she's in the mix.
Speaker 1: Did she experience some trepidation when you decided to quit medicine?
Speaker 2: A little bit, but, but again, I've always had pretty good judgment and my parents have always trusted my judgment, with regard to things.   And you know I've as I've said before I've been very fortunate to have great parents, great grandparents, and while they haven't had much of a way of financial resources were very worldly in terms of, of their life.  So my mom is probably one of the most well-read people I know, she reads you name it. You know if it's nonfiction she reads it.  So particularly history, biography, things like that.  I have stacks of books every, every couple weeks, my mom will ask me about any new biography of Alexander Hamilton, I need this biography.  So my mom is actually my, my book reviewer, I send her the books I wanna read, she reads them, and tells me okay you should read this one.  No, don't worry about that one, and so we do that and her dad [Beadie Eugene Conner] did that for her.  I mean you know, you know she, you know she would do the same thing for her dad, I should say, so.
Story_ID: 237837
Speaker 1: Now do you have political aspirations yourself at all?
Speaker 2: None, zero.
Speaker 1: None?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: None at all?
Speaker 2: I have no interest in elective politics, I like to support candidates and so whether it's you know [HistoryMaker] Ron Kirk who ran for the U.S. Senate or the mayor of Dallas [Texas] or [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun or, or different folks that's, I'm in the business of supporting candidates around the country to this day, I do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, but none for you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) None, no.
Speaker 1: No one, okay.  Now likewise in terms of looking back--
Speaker 2: Barack, [HistoryMaker President] Barack Obama, you know supported him early on in his, his campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think he'll be successful, it looks like it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm excited for him.
Story_ID: 237838
Speaker 1: Yeah, likewise when you look over your career to this point once again you're still really young by our standards.  But you've had like numerous successes.  What would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy would be my kids; I mean my legacy is hopefully instilling in my children the principals that were instilled in me, hard work, education you know strong spiritual base.  But also a desire to do more, be more to, to take risk, to be challenged, don't be confined to you know to just what's expected.
Story_ID: 237839
Speaker 1: Now for someone, a young man or woman who wants to get involved in, in finance the way you are, at this point I mean with a--what would you advise them to do?  Could they, could they start out of high school to do this or could, do they?
Speaker 2: Well again they can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or would they--
Speaker 2: You know I think you, you start with attitude, I mean that, that's pre-high school I mean its attitude it really is, it's down to that.  And many of us were not born as smart as many of us are not born with all the right physical attributes.  Many of us aren't born with, with you know great gifts of this, but, but we can all control our attitude.  And with you know positive attitude and with you know a competitive attitude and with a, you know a, a you know an ethical attitude, I mean we can do great things, no matter what.
Speaker 1: Okay and the last--
Speaker 2: We can control that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 237840
Speaker 1: Well our last question is similar to legacy on a level but different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered as, I would like to be remembered as the, a person who tried to do his best during his time on earth.  That he did the best he could for his family, for his friends, for his people, for his countrymen and, and for his, this, this earth.  And also that you know I made my parents [Georgia Conner Youngblood and Theodore Roosevelt Youngblood, Jr.], my grandparents, my wife [Dr. Sharon Youngblood] and kids proud.
Story_ID: 237841
