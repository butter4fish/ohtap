Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  library. Today is Thursday, March 26, 2009. I   m in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma interviewing Betty Price. This interview is being conducted as  part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral  History Project. Betty Price was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame in 1985. Thank you for joining us today.  It   s a pleasure to be here.  Well, let   s begin by learning more about you. Could you start with  where you grew up and give us a little background into your early life?  I was born in Booneville, Arkansas and lived with my family in  Shawnee, Oklahoma and El Paso, Texas. Then we moved to Muskogee.  I was ready for first grade and so I started school in Muskogee and that   s  where our home was after that.  So tell me a little bit about the school you attended growing up as a  young girl in Muskogee.  Well, I attended Longfellow, what we called grade school in those days,  and West Junior High School and Central High School in Muskogee. I  loved school, and of course, we thought Longfellow was the best of all  schools.  Now was Longfellow quite large or very small?  It was a large school. At that time we didn   t have kindergarten, so we  started first grade and that   s where we made a lot of our lifetime  friendships.  What were some of your favorite subjects growing up?  5  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Well, I loved art and music, and I liked spelling. In high school, I liked  Spanish   that was a lot of fun. I also was involved in journalism. I have  a story about this; my father had so wanted me to be a teacher that when  I decided I was going to take typing in high school, he tried to stand in  the way of that because he didn   t want me to become a secretary. As  things happened in my life, it was the ability to be the co-editor of the  high school newspaper in Muskogee and then going to Northeastern  State University, I received a scholarship the second year to be the editor  of the college newspaper even though I was a music major. It just  worked out great.  Wow, did you think you had a career in journalism budding?  Well, I didn   t think so, because my father wanted me to be a teacher as I  said. And he and Mother both had convinced me that I should be a music  teacher, and so that   s what I planned to do for my career.  So growing up, did you play any instruments  or have  music classes?  We had a rule in our house that we couldn   t touch the piano keys until  we were in the second grade. Mother would play for us, but we didn   t  get to touch the piano. Then, in second grade we could take piano  lessons. I had a tyrant for a teacher, Miss Mary de Graffenreid, she  taught violin and piano. She was a very tough teacher. I used to play, I  remember, just thinking I   m doing this so well, I wish Miss de  Graffenreid would come up on the porch and hear me playing. She  always made me a little nervous, I think. But we had recitals and they  were a lot of fun.  I had fun doing a lot of different things, in the pep squad, and being the  co-editor of the newspaper for our high school in Muskogee really took  me away from my music somewhat. We had chorus, as well, so I was  always participating in that. But it was fun to be involved with the  school newspaper and then fun again to be involved with it at college,  although it was hard work.  You mentioned your parents did not want you to become a secretary.  They wanted you to become a teacher. Growing up back then, what were  career options for women outside of teaching?  Career options were being a nurse, a secretary, or a teacher. That was  basically what you could choose from. With all of my emphasis on  music, it just seemed like a good idea that I teach. I taught my first year  at Norman and I was a music teacher for two schools every day. I had all  of the students in those two schools. But it was a great time at OU   University of Oklahoma  and I enjoyed that and Norris finished his  6  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  degree there. The second year I taught second grade and that was in Del  City. We settled in and Norris went into real estate at that time. But this  business of typing, I got my scholarship with my ability to be the editor  of the newspaper, the Northeastern. And that way I stayed in school and  got my music degree and I was the Outstanding Senior Woman, of  which my parents were very proud.  Well, that   s great you had that funding to go to school, because I   m sure  at that time it was hard in Oklahoma.  It was. It really was. I had a brother and a sister and we all had to be  educated. My father worked for the post office and that was why we had  moved to Shawnee, El Paso, and then Muskogee. My brother became a  doctor and my sister lives here in Oklahoma City and is my dearest  friend.  And are you the oldest, middle, or youngest?  I am the oldest.  As you were growing up, did you envision yourself becoming anything  else other than a teacher? Or was it set?  No, I didn   t envision myself being anything else other than a teacher.  After I taught two years, I became pregnant with our first child, Lisa. So  I started teaching piano lessons while we had three children. Our family  was always interested in politics. The dinner conversation would usually  be political at my house and I loved this and I loved to be involved in  elections. But one of the things that I think evolved was that we lived in  a neighborhood where a friend of ours decided to run for the state  Senate. His name was John  L.  Garrett and we had all of the family out  working hard to get him elected.  When he was elected to the state Senate  in 1964; 43rd District , he  needed a secretary. And guess what, I was the only one in the  neighborhood who could type, so I went to work for him and that  changed the whole career path because I went to the State Capitol. I  loved the building. I started bringing art into our office and pretty soon  other senators were asking for art for their offices. That led to a  friendship with George Nigh, who was Lieutenant Governor at that time,  and I started working part-time for George Nigh, as well. So I was a  music teacher no longer and never to be again. But the most exciting  change in my life happened.  Boy, what a difference going from teaching kids to the State Capitol.  7  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Yes, and I emjoyed working with legislators. Now, that   s not always  easy and as I got into my work with the Arts Council, one of the things  that helped I think was that I had become acquainted with a lot of the  legislators, both senators and house members, and the governors. In my  career I have worked with eight different governors, and some of those  were two-term governors. So it was something that started because of a  political campaign and changed my whole career path.  Thanks to typing.  (Laughter) Thanks to typing.  So with then Lieutenant Governor Nigh and then Governor Nigh, what  work did you do for him?  Well, I worked as a secretary for him, but also I am an artist. As an  artist, he decided that he would like me to paint all of the state emblems  and so I researched the state emblems and I did a large plaque that had  all of these state emblems on it. When the tour guides would start on the  first floor of the Capitol, they eventually would come up to the 5th floor,  which is where the Lieutenant Governor   s office was at that time, and  they would use that to inform their students or the people who were  visiting about our state. It was very educational. I found out that the state  colors were green and white. Nobody knew what the state colors were  and used various things. There have been a lot that have been added to  the state emblems since then, but this gave us a chance to visit with the  young people who came there. Then I painted a painting of the Capitol  and an oil derrick for George   s office; and he still has that painting.  (Laughs)  Now back then, was there a lot of art in the Capitol?  No. When we were in high school, I came to the Capitol with the  Student Council and we had a day at the Capitol. That was the largest  building that I had ever been in, and I loved it. The only thing was, there  was very little art in the building. There was the World War I memorial  that had been there since 1928 on the south side of the Capitol. Then,  after I started working in the legislature there were four portraits that  were in the fourth floor painted by Charles Banks Wilson of Oklahoma   s  famous Senator Kerr, Jim Thorpe, Sequoyah and Will Rogers. But other  than that, there were just bare walls every place else.  So after you worked for Governor Nigh, what did you go on to do?  I would take a week off during the legislative session and go participate  in the  Festival of the Arts in downtown Oklahoma City . I met the  8  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  director of the Oklahoma Arts and Humanities Council, which is what it  was called at that time. He asked me to go to work for the Arts Council.  I didn   t think I wanted to work full-time. My husband thought it was a  good idea because I had been on committees. I had helped establish a  mental health clinic and had some other things I was doing. He decided  that our children were growing up, they were going to need to go to  college, and that I should take this full-time job. Little did he know or  did I know that it would be full-time-plus position because of all the  activities across the state in the arts.  Wonderful. So you joined the Oklahoma Arts Council starting back in  1974?  That   s right.  What was one of your first jobs with them?  Well, the reason that they wanted me to go to work for them was  because they knew that I had been advocating at the Capitol for arts  funding and I didn   t hesitate to talk to these senators and house members  about funding. So their idea was that I would do work with people in the  Capitol, and then be the public information director (which again typing  made possible) for the Arts Council. So it opened a whole new world to  me. I loved the building, but I kept thinking about art for the building. I  was asked to be the co-chair of a ceremony to dedicate the four historic  murals by Charles Banks Wilson, and that was in 1976. This gave me a  new relationship with the Governor   s Office. Of course, George Nigh  was not Governor yet; he had been Lieutenant Governor. And it was  almost like I was the art person in that building and painters would ask  me to help them decide what color to paint a wall in the building. Now  we have the Capitol Preservation Commission and everything   s set up  where you don   t have random questions like that.  But I started spending part of my time at the Capitol visiting with  legislators and it occurred to me one day that it might be nice if we had  art available to put in legislative offices. So we contacted artists and had  them bring their paintings to the Capitol. We had one day when they  would come from all over the state and put paintings out in the rotunda  on the fourth floor and then legislators would come out and choose a  work of art for their offices. Well, it was amazing. It gave us access to  every office because they all wanted a piece of art, and then you   d have  to come in and check on it and talk about it. So it gave me a chance to  really get to know legislators. Then, of course, we were trying to get  funding for the Arts Council and I worked hard on that for many years.  What a great advocacy piece, having that beautiful piece of art in their  9  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  office and you have to stop by and check on it and    Oh, by the way        (Laughter) Now you became the Executive Director in 1983. How did  this come about?  Well, it came about because the director was leaving and there were five  men who had been directors of the Arts Council before I became the  director. The National Endowment for the Arts and the National  Endowment for the Humanities were created in 1965. Henry Bellmon  was Governor and you had to have state legislation to get the funding  from the National Endowment. So this was when the Oklahoma Arts and  Humanities Council was created. Of course it   s now the Oklahoma Arts  Council, but that was the name of it at the time. It was created to enrich  the lives of Oklahomans with the arts. I worked to help get that funding  matching the federal funding in order to make it possible for us to deal  with non-profit organizations in the state that were doing arts projects.  The five men that were directors before me were gone and I was acting  director. There were some legislators who decided I should be the  director, so they went to the Governor and asked him to make me the  Director of the Arts Council. The Council is a 15 member board, and it   s  their responsibility to hire the executive director.  And who was the sitting Governor at that time?  George Nigh was Governor then. But I befriended all the governors.  You know, I liked working in politics and in government and I liked all  these governors. And there was something about the Governor   s  Mansion, for example, if they needed art in the Governor   s Mansion,  they would call me. When David Boren came in as Governor, I was in  the Arts Council at that time and David had been a house member. My  senator was the Mental Health  committee  chair. David Boren would  come over and sit in the office and we would visit while he was waiting  for Senator Garrett. Well, we just talked about the arts, because David  loved the arts so much. So when he was elected Governor, I was invited  to be on his inaugural committee. I was on that committee because he  wanted an inauguration that was focused on the arts. We had a  wonderful, wonderful time. And David Boren has continued to be a very  close friend.  What were some of the things that were included in his inauguration?  Well, we had Stage Center downtown. We had organizations from all of  the state come in: trios, dance companies, orchestras, and we had a  marvelous event where you   d go from one to another in order to hear or  see a different performance. He had a cousin named Hoyt Axton, and  Hoyt Axton and Arlo Guthrie came and performed at his inaugural ball.  10  Nykolaiszyn  Price  That was a lot of fun   Oh, I bet. My goodness. So as Executive Director of the Arts Council,  you continuously try to work for increasing awareness and funding.  What were some of the other key roles that you were involved with?  Well, we were involved with the non-profit organizations across the  state. I liked to be out with the people who are having performances and  meeting the people in these towns. Another thing about working with the  legislature, you need to know some people in their towns, their arts  people need to get acquainted with their legislators and a lot of times  they weren   t. It was part of what I saw my job as being was to be aware  of what was happening in towns all over the state and wonderful things  were happening. I feel that the arts enrich a community more than  anything else. So it was fun to go out and get acquainted with people  across the state and visit with their legislators while I was in that town.  The Arts Council does so much and I probably expanded the position by  being so interested in the visual arts and the Capitol. And getting the  legislation written to establish a Capitol Preservation Commission and  that then was a way that the Capitol had an overseer with the  Preservation Commission being responsible for the building and the  grounds around the Capitol. I would be asked to do the commissioning  of works of art as we started looking at those bare spaces on the walls.  And then some wonderful things happened as a result of that.  For example, we had a state senator who would march me out to the  center of the rotunda and show me that space where the Indian ballerina  mural  Flight of Spirit  is now and he would say,    That needs to be a  mural of the Indian ballerinas.    Then he would go back into  the  chamber  and vote against the arts appropriation. (Laughs) This was  kind of hard for me to understand. But it started a whole new way of  working with the public art in the Capitol. We commissioned Mike  Larsen to do the mural. And one of the most wonderful moments of my  life was when we had a Sunday opening for the new mural in the  rotunda, there were a thousand people there. It was jammed with adults  and children. We had an orchestra and we had all five of the Indian  ballerinas together. It was the first time they   ve all been in each other   s  presence; people thought they danced together all over the world, but  they didn   t.  We had Maria and Marjorie Tallchief, Yvonne Chouteau, Rosella  Hightower, and Moscelyne Larkin.  During the program  each one of  these women was brought up separately on stage and we had little  ballerinas with bouquets of roses for each one of them. Then they  received a medallion. David Walters was Governor at that time, and he  11  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  presided with great enthusiasm. It was so wonderful to have these  women there. Then five years later we brought them back and made  them Cultural Treasures. Cultural Treasures is something that we  developed during my time as Director of the Arts Council. These are  people like John Hope Franklin, a very very wonderful historian and  friend. And we have others like Scott Momaday and Charles Banks  Wilson and all of the ballerinas. The first one was Te Ata, the Indian  storyteller. We celebrated Te Ata and she was still living at the time, so  we had her as our first cultural treasure.  Now that we   re talking about the Capitol, can you take me through some  of the work that was commissioned in the building?  Yes, Oklahoma Black Gold and We Belong to the Land were the lunette  murals and they were painted by an artist named Jeff Dodd. Jeff is a  fabulous artist, but just (laughs) to kind of clarify something about  getting these murals up into those spaces, we had engineers who helped  us with installation. You needed to examine the molding before the  mural went up. Jeff had a fear of heights, and so I was the one on the  cherry picker that went up and examined the moldings. And I loved it, I  didn   t mind those heights at all. In fact, when the dome was put on the  Capitol, that was when I went up on the scaffolding (laughs) to inspect  the murals. I enjoyed going to these heights to inspect the Capitol art.  It   s good you weren   t afraid of heights.  Right. (Laughs) My husband doesn   t like them very well, but I wasn   t  afraid of them at all. We have Wilson Hurley murals on the second floor  and those are mural-sized paintings that Wilson finally agreed to do.  Wilson Hurley was born in Tulsa, but he ended up living in  Albuquerque, New Mexico and we became good friends. And I tried and  tried to persuade him to paint these paintings. He at one point said that  artist that did the ballerina mural meant for his to be the most important  work of art in the Capitol. (Laughs) So, with the help of one of my  Council members, Ann Alspaugh, he was persuaded to do those four  paintings. And  they represent the four corners of the state .  We created galleries in the Capitol, too. There is a gallery on the first  floor for changing exhibits, there   s a gallery for photography, and then  we have our State Art Collection gallery. In 2008 the legislature named  that gallery for me and that   s been so exciting. So the Betty Price gallery  is where the State Art Collection  is a permanent installation . We also  have a gallery next to the Blue Room. George Nigh called me one day  after he had gone in as governor and he said,    Come over here, I want to  ask you about something.    He had this space that was between the  Governor   s office and the blue room. The Blue Room, of course, is the  12  Nykolaiszyn  ceremonial room that the governors use frequently. So I asked him what  he was planning and he said,    I think this should be an art gallery.    So I  got busy and visited some museums and found out how you   d  create a  gallery that became  the Governor   s Gallery. The Arts Council keeps all  of these exhibits, these changing exhibits, going and it   s quite a job. It  truly is. But people love it. And I even love to see a legislator or maybe  a maintenance person in the building looking at the new exhibits, they  seem to really like it.  Two major works of art that are important to our building are the two  sculptures outside. I was on the Centennial Commission and The  Guardian by Senator Kelly Haney is atop the building and it was my job  to, number one, decide what this was going to be, who was it going to  be, and then who the artist was going to be. I had a wonderful committee  and we determined that there should be an Indian on top of the building.  Then we ran a competition for the artist and Senator Haney won the  competition and it was really great. The sculpture in front of the Capitol  is by Allan Houser. I became acquainted with Allan Houser shortly after  I had started, while I was working as the Interim Director for the Arts  Council. I got acquainted with him and started working with him. His  studio in Santa Fe was fascinating and I loved to be there when it was  the right timing in the process.  This was a sculpture that he and David Boren talked about. David liked  Allan   s work as well and he called me one night from Allan   s studio and  he said,    I have just seen this wonderful figure that Allan wants to do.    I  said,    Well what about the one he and I were talking about?    and he  said,    No, this is a different one.    So I got outvoted and I   m really glad I  did. This is an outstanding sculpture and we   re so proud of it. At the  time, Henry Bellmon was Governor and we needed  150,000 to pay for  that sculpture. As it turned out, Henry Bellmon vetoed some of his own  legislation but he left the money in for this sculpture. He had David  Boren on the phone and Senator Penny Williams and they persuaded  him that he should leave the funding in there. That sculpture is valued at  over a million dollars now if you were to purchase it. It was a great time  for us. We had a ceremony inside the building for the sculpture and then  came outside and we had this gigantic red parachute that covered the  sculpture. It started raining a little bit and so the parachute got pulled off  the sculpture before we were quite ready. It quit raining and they had an  Indian dance on the plaza  and smoking ceremony . So that was one of  our events that was so memorable.  I was telling you before we started today, I   ve been to several state  Capitols and Oklahoma   s is by far   it just blows you away when you  walk in. The art everywhere is just amazing.  13  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Working with the major murals, sculptures, portraits has been a  privilege.  Now, you of course have been in the Capitol pre- and post-dome. You  are a domer.  That   s right. (Laughter) And I was able to climb up to the heights when  the dome was being constructed with a hard hat, and it   s pretty exciting  when you   re involved somewhat in the process. The dome had been a  wish of some people that I was associated with for a long time. It was  just nice to see that finally happen. I was asked to be on the Centennial  Commission so that opened a lot of doors for the arts, because how  better to celebrate than with the arts? And we   re so proud of the towns  across the state that had their centennial projects. But the dome was  major for us. I worked with Blake Wade who was the Director of the  Centennial Commission. And I think Oklahoma had a great celebration,  absolutely wonderful.  I haven   t talked very much about the Council. I   ve talked a lot about the  Capitol and working with visual arts, which I love to do. But the Arts  Council, as a state agency, has matching funding for non-profit  organizations and this has to be for art projects. We have a granting  process. Part of our funding comes from the National Endowment for  the Arts, still. But we were able to get our funding up quite high over  what we were getting from the Endowment. It   s still such a small part of  the state budget; one tenth of one percent of the state budget is for the  arts. And the arts are so important.  One of my passions has been to get art and music teachers back in our  elementary schools. My role models were the art teacher and the music  teacher. We started in first grade doing art. My friend, Helen Sue Bebb,  my closest friend, was an artist, too. As children, we painted together  and did all kinds of arts projects and have stayed as friends all our lives.  We even met in Taos, New Mexico and painted together.  But the thing that I feel we must have is the enrichment that the arts give  the people across this state. And, yes, it   s good to have your governors  involved and your legislators involved. But there are thousands of  people in this state who serve on these non-profit boards just to make  something cultural happen in their towns. We have a wonderful artist-in-residence  program where artists go in and work with children. The  things that our organizations do are so well-planned and well-executed.  And as I said, I have tried to be out across the state working, seeing  these events and talking to these teachers and parents and art advocates  about what they are doing for their hometown.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  So you   ve probably been to every county in Oklahoma?  Yes. I   ve been to every county in Oklahoma and of course we have to  have a non-profit to come to us for grants. We   ve been in at least 70  counties across the state with some kind of art project. We also had a  culture coalition for about ten years, and that was working with the  Museums Association, the Visual Arts, and other associations to kind of  look at the big picture. We had  a  great Congress on the Arts and  Humanities when David Boren was Governor and continued this sort of  thing where we   re sitting with others who are running the statewide  organizations, and I think that that is more efficient. Also the creativity  that you have when you are there with other people who have such a  vision for their particular mission, whether it be a museum or a music  organization, or other non-profits.  You   re very well connected in the Oklahoma arts community. Who are  some of your favorite Oklahoma artists?  Well, I   ve enjoyed working with Mike Larsen with the Indian ballerina  painting and the relationship with Allan Houser, who died in 1984. Allan  Houser was nationally and internationally known. We were very good  friends. I would try to be out in New Mexico as frequently as possible  and always would meet Allan in his studio and with his wonderful wife,  Ann, who is now 96 years old. She   s quite a spritely little lady. She likes  to go to the casinos and she wins a lot of money. (Laughs) But it just  gives me a wonderful friend that I have there even though Allan is gone.  I travelled to Washington with him when he got the National Medal of  Arts  from the President , I travelled to New York when a sculpture of  his was dedicated at the United Nations. So it was like here   s a chance  for Oklahoma to celebrate Allan Houser, who was born in Oklahoma,  celebrate Allan and show how much culture we have in our state.  Allan   s work is on the OU campus now; it   s at the Tribal Headquarters  at Apache  and Gilcrease Museum . It   s interesting, Allan was the first  baby born after Geronimo   s band was released from Fort Sill. He was  very proud of that. And he worked on getting a letter from an older tribal  member to document the fact that he was the first baby born out of  captivity. It just is part of that wonderful mystique that we have with our  artists.  Other artists that I admire include Charles Banks Wilson. The historic  murals are wonderful works of art. And when I was up on the  scaffolding examining those, I just appreciated him more than I ever  had. We went to the Smithsonian with him when he was going to mount  those murals. The murals were spread out on the fourth floor rotunda  and glued on to plexiglass forms before they were raised and installed in  the building. Charles Banks Wilson is one of my favorites. He is 90  15  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  years old. I saw him a couple of weeks ago when he was honored at the  History Center. Dr. John Hope Franklin just died yesterday and John  Hope was a dear friend and a cultural treasure. He enjoyed coming back  to Oklahoma and was also speaking some place and we became fast  friends. And it will be a great loss to Oklahoma. We also have an artist-poet  Scott Momaday, and he is a great artist and writer. Those are some  of the artists that I admire.  And you could probably go on forever and ever     I could. (Laughs)     because Oklahoma has such   we   re a young state but it has such a  rich tradition, especially with Native American art, some of the  immigrant populations, I mean it   s such a great tradition.  There are some other things that the Council does. We have a touring art  program where orchestras and ballet companies and other performing  groups can go into the smaller towns and we pay half of the fee for them  to come in to the towns. For example, Guymon will have the Oklahoma  Symphony Orchestra come out to Guymon for a concert, and that gives  the people in that town a chance to have their own event. So many of  them would never be in Oklahoma City and have the opportunity to  enjoy and be enriched with symphony music.  It   s those little things that help inspire communities. And you never  know, you could have a young child there who says,    I want to do that      Yes, you know that   s why it   s so important that children be exposed to  the arts as early as possible. The enrichment that the arts give children  helps them with their other subjects. I taught second grade as I  mentioned, and it didn   t occur to me that you wouldn   t use the arts to  teach your children. For any subject you can use the arts   art and music.  And when we know that there are children who are not getting art and  music in their elementary schools, by third grade their creativity is just  pretty much shut down. It   s so important to start as babies being exposed  to the arts, and then in school to have art and music teachers. I can   t  emphasize that enough. It   s something that changes how they feel about  themselves. We even have an alternative art program where there are  alternative schools in which children or teenagers can come into an  environment where they are able to learn to play the guitar, or to write,  or to paint. It gives them a new self-esteem and they can become better  students as a result of getting engaged and wanting to be there the day  they   re involved in the arts. And then some of them have gone on to be  substantial providers to the communities. They really were lost and the  arts have enriched them and brought them to success.  16  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Well, one other thing the council is involved with is the Governor   s Arts  Awards.  That   s correct.  Can you tell me a little bit about that?  Yes. The Director of the Arts Council called me into his office one day  when I was Public Information Director and he said,    I have found that  another state has a Governor   s Arts Award. I want you to find out about  it.    So he handed the project to me and it was very exciting. I contacted  that state, which was South Carolina, and found out what they were  doing. Then we started this during David Boren   s administration. This  Governor   s Arts Awards  GAA  is a favorite of mine, because people  nominate from all over the state. And then we have various awards: the  Governor   s Award, we have an Art Education Award, and Community  Service Awards. There are many ways that people can be recognized.  We always do the ceremony at the State Capitol with the Governor  presiding. We have people come from all over the state to celebrate  these wonderful advocates for the arts.  The Governor   s Arts Awards is one of the oldest programs in the nation  and it   s so beautiful in the Capitol building that probably it will always  be held there. Although it celebrates some artists, this is more about  businessmen and women who have contributed to the arts and helped in,  let   s say a ballet company, giving substantial support for dance. The  philanthropists are very important to the arts and the future of the arts.  So we like to thank them with a medallion. It   s called the Allan Houser  Medallion. I designed this medallion to not only honor Allan Houser, but  also to be something that was associated with the State Capitol and that  winners would have that memory.  From your early days with the emblems with Governor Nigh and  designing the medallion, have you designed other pieces that are  currently in use?  No, I really haven   t. (Laughs)  Okay, just checking. Now you recently retired from the Arts Council,  and I know you continue to remain very busy. One of the groups you   re  involved with is the Red Earth Advisory Board. Can you tell me a little  bit about that?  Red Earth was an idea that came from Supreme Court Justice Yvonne  Kauger. She thought that Oklahoma needed an Indian festival to  celebrate all of our wonderful, talented Indian artists, so a small group  17  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  came together. One of the things that I want on my tombstone is    Red  Earth.    Because Red Earth is the name that came to me just out of the  blue when we were meeting to decide on whether we were going to call  this the Indian Exposition of 19so-and-so or other long names. It just  kept beating in my heart that we needed something that was short and to  the point and so Red Earth was selected as the name. We have had great  success with Red Earth. The thing that we didn   t realize was how  spectacular the dancing would be. We were so anxious to help Indian  artists that we didn   t realize that we were going to be helping Indian  dancers, too. It   s a great festival. One of the things that Oklahoma needs  is to celebrate its Indian population and the artists especially. Indians  have the arts as part of their lives; in many of their ceremonials and  tribal affairs.  Now, we learned the background we need for our careers in many  different places. Sometimes it   s from real world experience, sometimes  it   s in school. Where have you learned the background you needed for  your career?  Well, I think that I had wonderful teachers, teachers who took time with  me. That is one thing that happened at Northeastern. The classes were  small in most cases and so you had some individual attention from your  teachers. The fact that we were interested in politics at our house and  spent time on that gave me an appreciation of government and I think  helped in molding me for what my future would be. There was a time  when I earned a salary when I was playing  piano or organ  for a church.  So from the time I was in junior high school I was working in Methodist  churches outside of the Baptist church, which is where our family  belonged. (Laughs) I thoroughly enjoyed the choir practice on  Wednesday night and then playing for the Sunday services.  And it all comes back around.  Mm-hmm. It does.  Did you face any stumbling blocks or adversity along the way?  Well, I think it   s always difficult to get funding for the arts. It   s difficult  to get funding for anything, but getting funding for the arts is difficult.  And I wouldn   t call it a stumbling block, it was a challenge. A challenge  to see what we could do to help fund the arts, because the legislature has  a mandate that we are to have quality arts experiences for every man,  woman, and child in this state. So as a result there   s a lot of work to be  done with not all that much money. I do think that having that as a  challenge was something that kept me energized.  18  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  ------- End of March 26, 2009 interview -------  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Wednesday, June 10, 2009. I   m in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma interviewing Betty Price. This is interview number two. This  interview is being conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame Oral History Project. Betty was inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in 1985. Thanks again for joining us.  Oh it   s my pleasure.  We spoke a lot last time about your involvement in the Arts Council. I  just want to touch base on a few things that we talked about and maybe  go a little deeper. The focus of the Arts Council I   m sure has changed  from when you first started to when you left. Tell me a little bit about the  evolution.  Well when we first started, the national endowment had been formed  and the carrots which went out to the states, if they would make an effort  to get an Arts Council established in state government then there would  be funding that would come and that funding could be used for grants.  What happened was when we first started we had money but we didn   t  have very many non-profit organizations, so it was really important that  the non-profits be established in the state so that we could be a  cooperative agency with them. And so it never happens now, but at first,  there was a reason to need someone to fund when we started the Arts  Council. I remember that the director during one period of time decided  that we needed a State Art Collection so he developed a program and we  were able to buy art with federal money and started the State Art  Collection which was really a marvelous addition to the state.  It seems that the Arts Council from promoting education in schools to  art in the communities has been a very big focus through the years. How  important was that while you served throughout your tenure?  It was very important and one of the things that was very close to my  heart was in getting artists-in-residence into schools where children  would have a musician, an artist or teachers of other arts disciplines  coming to their school where that might be the only time that they were  exposed to the arts because so many of our schools didn   t have art or  music teachers. So that is one thing that I think changes lives. I   m  convinced that we wouldn   t have to build so many prisons if we had art  and music teachers in elementary schools.  And it   s still a problem today.  19  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  It really is. And it just seems that the people who can make the  difference simply haven   t realized yet how important it is to start the  children with art and music.  Well also during your tenure with the Arts Council, you saw a lot of  technology changes as well. Can you talk about how your online  presence developed? It was pretty early.  Well I had a brilliant staff and we were the first state agency to go online  with grant applications and we   re very proud of that because it helps  people don   t understand a lot about what the Arts Council does. And so  much of what happens with the Arts Council is that the grants that go  out there cause the arts to happen all over the state. This was a really  wonderful thing for our agency.  On average how many grants are awarded a year?  Well there are about 800 organizations that really qualify to come in for  grants and there are about 1500 grants a year.  Wow.  Yes.  That   s really good.  It really is good.  Well regarding to the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, when you were  notified that you were going to be inducted, what was going on in your  mind?  Well of course I was just overwhelmed and thinking that this is one of  the greatest things that can ever happen to me. And my family and  friends were so thrilled. It was just something that had so much meaning  to it and to be included with the women who were already in the  Women   s Hall of Fame was a great honor for me.  Can you describe a little bit about the ceremony and what it was like  back in 1985?  Well that   s a long time ago. But I recall there was a really fine group of  women that was honored that night, but one that I was particularly  thrilled about because I was a friend of David Boren and that his aunt,  Mae Boren Axton was installed in the Hall of Fame that night, too. It  was a fun evening. I remember my dress was purple and that I had more  20  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  eye makeup on than I usually do.  It was the eighties.  Yes, that   s right   It was okay.  It was. And I think that this was just   it was fresh, it was fairly new. I  had family from Muskogee come. It was a wonderful dinner that  evening. It was in a hotel here in Oklahoma City.  Did you have to get up and say a few words?  I did have to say a few words, and that was very few. I was pleased and  honored to accept.  Well could you tell me what this type of honor means to you?  Well it means that somehow I have accomplished something as a woman  that is worthy of recording in our state   s history. And for so long there  was a glass ceiling where women weren   t directors of most state  agencies and in positions where men had been primarily in those places  of leadership. And I think that you have to have a great deal of  enthusiasm and love for what you   re doing in order to get to that  position. I was very fortunate as I worked with the different governors  and the different members of the Council to have the art   s agency  recognized nationally for the work that it did. The meaning to me and  my family is one that has been something that we   ve shared with our  friends and family over the years. And it   s a very nice honor.  Well how do you feel that now people look at you as a role model?  Well it   s hard to think of myself as a role model. But I recall a few years  ago I was asked to give the address at the University of Oklahoma Fine  Arts Commencement. I gave that address that day to a full house. I later  met a young woman who had been in the graduating class and she told  me that she had gone to work for a museum because she had heard me  speak. She realized that that was what she wanted to do, that she wanted  to be in arts education. She became the arts education director for a  major museum.  Those are good stories.  Yes.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Looking back both in your professional and personal life, can you share  some moments that you consider some of your biggest highlights?  I can. I think that one was the unveiling of the Allan Houser sculpture in  front of the State Capitol. That had been a very hard project for us,  difficult as these public art projects can be. It was a great day. A lot of  my work has been with Indian people and I enjoy that very much. I think  that because we took the land from the Indians that this sculpture is one  that memorializes the Indians and gives them the credit for having been  on this land first. This was their land and the Indian woman, As Long as  the Waters Flow, is the name of it.  It was named by the artist and refers  to all the U.S. government treaties that were broken.   Are there any more highlights you   d like to share?  I think a highlight would be becoming the executive director of the  Oklahoma Arts Council. I really loved my job. After I became the  executive director, it was just something that I always would want to be.  And highlights always included the Governor   s Arts Awards.  Does the Governor have a say in who wins?  No. He has his opportunity to present medallion to them, congratulate  them and make a speech for  a standing room only audience .  Well you made mention of some early teachers and some family  members throughout the interview, but would you like to say anything  special about the people who helped play an important role in your life?  Well at the time that I was in high school, I think that my role models  were my teachers and I also feel that in my job I still had role models. I  assume I was a role model, but I had role models that I really felt helped  me along the way. The idea of role models   what comes to mind is  when you   re so involved in the arts and you love the arts and you are  trying desperately to give the arts more to the state, to the boys and girls  and the adults in this state, the way that you do that is you look at other  people and see how they are managing something that is rather difficult  and that somehow happens and evolves in terms of leadership. I feel that  leadership in the arts has been tremendous in this state. Having the  opportunity to be a leader has given me the most satisfaction and  knowing that there are young people out there who will someday be  filling the positions that people like me are in, then I think we feel  fortunate.  Tell me how you met your husband.  22  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Well I met my husband at Northeastern. He was from Eufaula and I was  in Tri Sigma sorority. And that   s another honor that I   ve had as a  member of my sorority. I   ve had national honors there and it   s very,  very important to me. But I was in Tri Sigma and he was in a fraternity  and so they kind of liked one another. The first time I ever talked to him  I recall asking him (because he has a ruddy complexion) if he was  Indian. And actually he was part Indian. His grandmother was Indian.  But he likes to tell people,    That funny looking thing asked me if I was  part-Indian.    And that   s how our romance started. We dated in our  freshman year and sophomore year and then he went with the National  Guard to Japan where he served in the Army there. He was there a year.  When he came back, he went to school at OU and finished at the  University of Oklahoma and we got married. I got a job teaching school  in Norman, which was my first job, and he was finishing school. So I  had a year of teaching and enjoying the campus life as well. It was a lot  of fun. And he   s wonderful. He is so helpful to me and so supportive.  We have a lot of fun together.  And you have the trains?  Yes.  Tell me about the trains.  Well he loves trains and collects model trains. He built a NorrisTown  USA station in our backyard. And every year at Christmas time we have  a party for boys and girls to come in and run the trains. He loves to do  that for the kids. And the adults are really as interested as the kids.  That   s a lot of fun.  Yes.  Could you give some words of wisdom to people who are looking to  follow in your footsteps?  Well I think that one of the things that was helpful to me as Director of  the Arts Council was having a good staff and having wonderful council  members who were willing to serve, fifteen at one time working hard on  making the decisions on the grants, and helping out in many ways. But I  feel that those are what have meant so much to me. What   s important is  working with the legislature and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not always  easy, but I think that state agency employees, whoever they are, need to  appreciate the legislature. That is a hard job. Early on in my career, I had  been asked to run for the House of Representatives and I made the  decision that I could do more  for the state  if I worked in the Arts  23  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Council and kept working hard there than if I went to the legislature.  And of course my life would be a totally different life if I had chosen  to   and of course I would have had to be elected. My family decided  that they had been in enough political campaigns that they would just as  soon I didn   t run for the office.  Well there   s time now.  Well there have been some people talking to me.  If Betty Boyd could come back from retirement, then you could do it too.  I love Betty Boyd.  If you could give any piece of advice to Oklahomans, what would you  tell them?  Well I would tell them that they need to be sure that they have arts in the  lives of their children and their grandchildren, and that   s starting from  the time they   re born or even before. That the arts are so important to  their development as a person and what the arts can do for their brains in  terms of music and drawing and all the things that you can do with the  arts. It   s sad that sometimes children don   t have art teachers until fifth  grade. I think that the creativity level has gone down from the time they  started kindergarten or pre-kindergarten. You lose so much by waiting  that they need to be exposed to the arts all the time. And we have such  great examples of young people who really did not look as if they were  going to make it in terms of school. Many of them were headed to  prison. And if they were given a musical instrument and given a chance,  or given clay to start doing sculpture and start working in the arts they  found that in the alternative sites that the days that they had the arts, they  would always be there when they were in those alternative schools and  they couldn   t stay in the regular classroom sessions. I think that this is  what is going to make our state great if we have more children exposed  to the arts when they first start school. It needs to be a priority. It doesn   t  cost all that much money and in the long run it pays off because they  achieve academically higher when they   ve had the arts.  What   s next on the agenda for you? What are you busy with now?  Well I am enjoying more time with Norris and our children and  grandchildren. I also have stayed on the Indian Museum and Cultural  Center Board as an emeritus member. And this is a wonderful project  that is actually a  150 million project to have an outstanding Indian  Culture Center for Oklahoma City   actually the state of Oklahoma. And  it   s located on the river. There   s already one building there and I just sat  24  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  in on a panel for a public art project for that information center. It is  going to be a sculpture and it will be done by Bill and Demos Glass from  Locust Grove. They   re well known artists and they won the competition.  Right now we   re raising money for the Cultural Center. It   s difficult  times to try to raise this money but we have a wonderful staff and the  chairman for the board is Governor Bill Anoatubby. He   s the Governor  of the Chickasaw Nation. We have extraordinary leadership both in staff  and board members.  And are you still creating art in your spare time?  I haven   t started painting again but I plan to. I   ve been invited by a  gallery to display my work there so I   m getting ready to take that on.  I  remain close to Norman Wilks who started my art career in his gallery.   What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oklahoma is precious to me. I think it is a marvelous place to live and I  like the people in Oklahoma. People are so friendly and I always kind of  wore a tourism hat, too, with the arts and how we want them to see the  best of what we have when they come to our state. The arts certainly  work into that very well. I just think this state has a spirit about it. We  saw that with the Murrah bombing and we will see it with the hard times  that we   re in right now, that people are strong. They love the state, they  support the state. And by the way, I was very thrilled that the new  license tag has an Allan Houser sculpture on it. I was with his family  over the weekend at the Red Earth Festival.  Well that   s a good position to be in. You mentioned your tombstone.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  I would like  them  to know that during the time I worked for the Arts  Council that it made a positive difference in the lives of children and  adults across the state of Oklahoma, exposing them to the arts and giving  enjoyment and knowledge to them.  Well before we close our interview, is there anything else you   d like to  add that I have not asked about?  Well I would like to talk just a moment about the other women that are  in the Women   s Hall of Fame. So many of these are friends or they are  people that I have known of during my life and I think that Oklahoma  has extraordinary women. I   m so glad that you   re doing what you   re  doing to help bring this to history as well as the public in letting people  know that there are women in every phase of careers that have done a  remarkable job for the state of Oklahoma. And as I love our state and  25  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  love Oklahoma, love that George Nigh got Oklahoma as the state song, I  must think about the women that I know and admire and even though  my role models were teachers, I feel that there are role models as judges  and lawyers and women in all kinds of jobs that are role models. I think  that   s what makes us a great state. In summarizing, my interests in  legislature and the fact that there is a body that comes to the Capitol that  works for the people of Oklahoma. They should be held in high esteem.  They do a good job for us. And those men who have been governor, we  may end up with a woman as governor and I know that there will be a  very hot campaign this time around. So we have people like that who  love their families and yet they will give of themselves for the  betterment of the state in their jobs.  There are many great women in the Hall of Fame. There really are.  There are a lot of great women in the Hall of Fame. And I think that the  chance to talk about it is good as is the opportunity to have it included in  the history of our state.  I appreciate your time sharing your life with us, your stories from your  long career and your passion for the arts in Oklahoma. We appreciate it  very much.  Thank you so much. It   s my pleasure.  ------- End of June 10, 2009 interview -------
