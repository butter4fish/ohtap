After  her father completed his service as Deputy Adjutant General for the Army in Europe during  World War II, he accepted a position with the Oppenheim Company in Oklahoma City  forging Kathy   s link to Oklahoma. A few years into her college education, she visited her  family in Oklahoma and her father died there of a heart attack. She stayed on to help with  family matters and volunteered to help with the Charity Horse Show Ball in Oklahoma City.  While assisting with this event someone suggested she go to work for the Henry Bellmon  1962 campaign for governor, which she did. Kathy helped in the campaign office and went  on campaign tours as a Bellmon Belle. After his successful election, she continued to work  as Shirley Bellmon   s assistant. While in this position Kathy attended Central State  University (now the University of Central Oklahoma) and earned a degree. By the end of  Governor Bellman   s term, she had accepted a position as a junior staff member in the  Washington bureau for the Daily Oklahoman. After three or four years, she went to work for  Edelman International Public Relations Firm and as a vice-president when she accepted a  federal government job as press officer for the National Endowment for the Arts.  Kathy retired from the National Endowment for the Arts with twenty years of service. She  however, did not retire from work. She and a friend founded Global Communicators, an  international public relations firm and remained there until 2008 when she retired for a  second time. Kathy enjoys life on her farm on the outskirts of Washington, DC.  4  Spotlighting Oklahoma  Oral History Project  Katherine Christie  Oral History Interview  Interviewed by Tanya Finchum  June 25, 2010  Washington, D. C.  Finchum  Christie  Today is June 25, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum, and I   m a librarian  with Oklahoma State University. We are doing an oral history project  centered around Henry Bellmon, who was the Governor of Oklahoma  for two terms and a US Senator for two terms. Today we   re with Kathy  Christie, who was the social secretary for Shirley Bellmon and then later  became the assistant press secretary for Henry Bellmon. Thank you for  coming today. Let   s start with having you tell a little bit about your  youth and how you came to be in Oklahoma.  I was born in Binghamton, New York, in the midst of one of the worst  winters in the century for that town, and moved not long after with my  family back to Westchester County in New York. Then Dad was an  Army officer, got called up in WWII, fought in North Africa. A young  man who fought with him, who was considerably younger but became  one of his best friends, was Edgar Oppenheim of Oklahoma City. Edgar  was a young Lieutenant while Dad was a Colonel, fighting in North  Africa, during the days of Rommel and the great fight of WWII in that  part of the world.  Our family traveled to and lived in many different spots. When I was in  my early twenties, we were living in Heidelberg, Germany. I had  completed two years of college, was going to the University of  Heidelberg studying German, and at night  to  the University of  Maryland. My father was the Deputy Adjutant General for the U.S.  Army in Europe, but sadly the dear man had a heart attack, and the  Army said,    That   s the end of your career.    Incredibly, Edgar  Oppenheim called all the way to Germany from Oklahoma City and  said,    Robert Christie, you have a job with me.    It took a number of  months for us to move from Germany back to the US and for Dad to get  up on bond buying and stock market and all, needed to work with the  Oppenheim Company in Oklahoma City. He did that, and I came out to  visit. I went skiing, and sadly my father died of a sudden heart attack  5  when I was up in Colorado. I came back down,  and signed up  for Kelly  Girls  Kelly Services, Inc , part-time work and later had gotten a job  volunteering and helping with the Charity Horse Show Ball in  Oklahoma City. We were working in John Kilpatrick   s office, the oil  man (this was in early 1962, Dad had died in February) and somebody  there said,    Why don   t you go work for Henry Bellmon?    And I said,     Well, what does he do?    And they said,    He   s a candidate for governor,  republican candidate for governor.     Well, it didn   t take too long for me to find out that no republican had  ever won in the history of the state of Oklahoma. Then when I was going  to different parties and having dinner around with a few friends when I  did take the job with his campaign and people would ask,    What do you  do?    I said,    I work for Henry Bellmon.    And they, too, weren   t sure  who he was, so it didn   t look like a really great campaign in the  beginning. That was combined with the first impression of seeing the  campaign office, which was located at two-hundred-and-something  street, whatever, in Oklahoma City. It was Hubert Gragg   s oil company  office, a cinderblock building with an oil well pumping in the side yard,  and it was quite small. As Henry   s secretary, Jeanette Baxter was there,  and I didn   t meet him immediately, but I was put to work doing clerical  chores. Then when I did meet him, my first impression was very  favorable. I later met Shirley, Pat, Gail, and Ann, and liked the whole  family. However, I immediately thought, great guy, but he probably  doesn   t have much of a chance here becoming governor. We kept going  though, and Jeanette and I worked alone. We were the key campaign  staffers, and then the republican party staff and others would come and  go. It was a small office, and they were located elsewhere, I think  probably down around Kilpatrick   s oil company office or something.  Anyway, we had a small campaign. Helen Lawson came, and she and I  were doing a lot of mailings and that type of work, and the campaign  was short of money at that point. Money was coming in, but it wasn   t  coming in in volumes. And one day a young man arrived on the doorstep  of this remote campaign office looking for brochures for all of his  buddies at OU   I think he was in his senior year. It was Max  Weitzenhoffer, and Max had on, I think, a paisley shirt and Bermuda  shorts   very casual   and he wanted brochures to take back to OU.  Well, we told them that we just didn   t have all that money to spare and  he just said,    Well, this campaign   s not going to go anywhere if you  don   t have bundles of brochures and handout material.    We had been  rather inundated with people coming in looking for jobs that wore  business suits and looked sharp and here was this young kid who said,    I  think you need some money.     He sat down, and he wrote out a check for a good number of thousands  6  of dollars, and said,    I also think you need a better location for the  campaign, and I own       I don   t know whether he said    I own    or    the  family owns,    or something.    I can make a building available to you.     And it was a former Sears Roebuck, right in the middle of downtown  Oklahoma City, not far from the Skirvin  Hotel . It was across, I think,  from the Sheraton  Hotel , at which later was blown up/demolished, but  anyway, it was a two or three story building. Because we had such a  small staff, Henry said,    Well, could you go down and open it up.    We  put some bits of office furniture in it and we had a little reception area  but little else. Well,  the large building  was pretty isolated. In being  there all by myself, I got really worried and called up and said,    Can we  get some more people down here? Being alone in this office, in a  building which is empty and big, is a little daunting to say the least.     So all of a sudden, all of the Oklahoma  republican  party people and  candidates came down and took over the first floor, which was the main  floor for welcoming visitors. Then the Bellmon campaign took over  another section of the building, and I was put to work with Wayne  Mackey, who had come from Oklahoma Publishing Company and been  a very well-known and regarded political reporter, to be Campaign  Manager/Press Secretary. I think he was more Press Secretary than  anything, so I was working with him. Then as I recollect, more people  came, and Amber Cooper Robinson was wife of Oklahoma City attorney  Bill Robinson, who was a partner of Mayor Shirk, came on as  receptionist and volunteer, and she was just a great, wonderful person.  Wayne Mackey was responsible for media. The campaign went on,  republicans were coming and going, there were back-room discussions  with blue dog democrats in smoke-filled rooms, and they were working  very hard because the overall campaign thinking was that unless Henry  was able to win by more than a margin of 20,000 votes, because no  republican had ever been elected governor, he wouldn   t make it. So we  had to go for a major chunk of votes over and above a simple win.  And then, not only did I work in the office and with media, doing  everything that you needed to do, but I made my Bellmon Belle outfit  and went on tour with Shirley and the girls and Henry. One campaign  tool I thought was dynamite was the Bellmon Belles, you know, going  on these tours with the red, white, and blue outfits and hats and just  looking sharp. A whole great crowd of enthusiastic supporters traveled  frequently with the candidate, and made appearances around. Henry also  used a country band, and a great group of musicians. Gail and Pat and  Ann may know which band it was. The band of folk musicians would  precede Henry and Shirley and drum up a crowd on a campaign tour.  They   d go to a town, set up, stir up a lot of music. The crowd would  come to hear the music, and then the candidate would show up, and  there was a little show and tell while the band group went on to the next  7  Finchum  Christie  town. Anyway, it was a great thing, and it was a marvelous campaign  tour activity.  The more that I got to know Henry Bellmon, and Shirley too, the more I  realized that he was a man to be treasured. His Marine buddies, one in  particular who I mentioned to you, it might   ve been Joe Dever, who was  a New York journalist, noted how amazing he was, that he didn   t smoke  or drink, but he had saved the lives of numerous fellow Marines,  dragging them from burning tanks and raging battles on the remote  islands in the Pacific during WWII. That he was widely hailed and  regarded for heroism, and he didn   t drink, smoke, or curse a word.  Integrity and being fair-minded were key elements of his personality  along with a grand sense of humor that was very engaging, and I could  not agree more. And I never found that there was a political decision that  he made with which I had a problem, and I wasn   t a republican. I   m still  an independent. During that period, I did become a republican when he  went into the Governor   s office, but I   ve been an independent all along.  And then also, during the campaign, I was dating Ted Davis, and  incredibly he was a lawyer for the opposing gubernatorial candidate.  Davis was best friends with Amber and Bill Robinson and we used to  hang out together. We would have a congenial bi-partisan discussion all  around. Henry and Shirley knew Ted and Amber and Bill and, you  know, it was generally a congenial group. I mean, we didn   t socialize  with them because they were a bit older and all, but we did on occasion.  So, anyway, it was hard in the dead heat of campaign to see how he  could win, and we thought he had to win by over 20,000. But he won,  and that was one of the most incredible days     What was election night like?  Absolutely incredible. But prior to that, we   d had a few other glitches  along the way. Remember the October day when President Kennedy  announced the U.S. blockade of Cuba, and you   re sitting there thinking,     Gee, I was really concerned about a great campaign, but, you know, the  whole country may end up going to war.    Which, thank God, we didn   t.  But anyway,  election day  was a marvelous, exciting, fabulous, superb  day, and that evening, in the Sheraton Hotel, across the way, it just was  boisterous and exciting and we knew we were topping the 20,000  votes    Bellmon needed to win . And then, as I think I mentioned earlier, Henry  came over, took time out from his great win and said,    Look, I   d like  you to stay on and work with me in the Governor   s office and help  Shirley.    By then, my family had moved back east, and I wanted to  finish up my college and was going back to Washington. I said,    I don   t  have any place to live.    I was living in a little borrowed apartment. He  said,    Don   t worry about that, you can move into the mansion with us.  8  Finchum  Christie  You have a job here.    And he said,    Besides that, you can finish your  college far cheaper. It   s less per credit hour here in Oklahoma than it  ever would be back east.    So how do you say no? And I said,    Thank  you very much,    and I accepted his very extraordinary offer.  And I did live in the garage apartment at the mansion and I intermingled  happily with the Bellmons at work, at play, and I ended up graduating  from Central State College (it was, but University it became). One day  in the office,  the governor  knew I didn   t want to graduate from Central  State College with that name. I said,    It could be anywhere in the world.  It needs a solid Oklahoma name. We can do better than that.    And this is  an aside, but much to my amazement, one day he came in and he said,     Well, by God, I did it.    He said,    We   ve changed the name of your  school.    I said,    You what?    and he said,    Yes, we changed it.    I said,     What did you change it to?    Thinking it would be a wonderful Indian  name or something, and he said,    Central State University.    And I said,     Central State University?    (Laughs) And he basically said,    Don   t  complain.    He said,    You   re now graduating from a university instead  of a college, so just be happy about it.    Which I was, and I did achieve,  going to night school,  I earned my  graduation certificate from Central  State University.  So during the campaign, I had learned so much traveling all over about  Oklahoma, and too, I must say that the Oppenheims, who had  encouraged my father and had brought him into their bond buying  business, were Oklahoma touters from the get-go. I mean,    Oklahoma  was the greatest,       Oklahoma was the best,    and all of that. I was made  to feel, thanks to them, too, most welcome. I ended up with a lot of  wonderful, wonderful friends in Oklahoma, around the city and  throughout the state.  Where was your office?  I would walk or stupidly drive over from the mansion to the Capitol.  And for most of the time, my office was right behind the receptionist   s  desk. So I was right near the lobby entrance of the office, in the  gubernatorial wing. Liz Morgan was the receptionist for a good period  of time after Amber Robinson, who had first come in and was doing  volunteer work. So you were in the center of action because you knew  what was coming and going in and out the front door, but you also were  contacting, a lot of times, the administrative staff members in the back,  and particularly, first Bob Haught, the press secretary who took over  from Wayne Mackey, and then Don Ferrell later on was Press Secretary  and all the others.  So I worked with Shirley in the beginning. We started doing basic things  9  like spiffing up the Governor   s Mansion and arranging parties. We had, I  think, monthly tours of the Governor   s Mansion, if I recall properly,  opening the house to visitors from different  regions  of the state one  section after another, so that people could just come through and call the  Governor   s Mansion theirs, too. And then more and more, I worked with  the press secretary, first as an aide whenever I was needed, and, later  with more support in media work as needed.  So that was my basic job back then, and it was in the early 1960s. It was  very interesting to work with Henry. He was not confrontational or  radical on any political issues. He was reasoned. All of his decisions  made a lot of sense to me, and apparently to an awful lot of voters. I  would work with the press operation when we had the news conferences  in the Blue Room, and so I was pretty much on top of what he was doing  in the decision-making process. He thought logically, syllogistically, and  he reached conclusions that generally produced good results, and  legislations that seemed to work quite well, and were considered good  government by people on both sides of the political slate. There were  tiffs here and there, but it was generally an overall good impression. At  the Mansion, as I said, we were planning the events and all like that, and  I lived there too, so I had a very strong interaction on a daily basis with  Henry and Shirley and those great girls, and the guard, such as Lee  Paden and Skip  Stewart  Beasley, who were mainly young college  students. We all had a basically good interaction, and back and forth.  And then Shirley and I were really good friends, and I watched the girls  grow, and it was quite exciting. And the girls were friends. I went to the  farm a few times, but I kind of knew them on a daily basis more from  just that compound. We toured everything there including where the  swimming pool is now, exploring what had been a fallout shelter in case  of an atomic bomb, which was pretty run down, and probably wouldn   t  have worked if we   d had to use it. And then there were funny times like  when Tandem, the dachshund puppy, arrived. The girls had gone with  their parents for a TV taping, and their dad had chastised them for being  silly in the car, and they clammed up during the interview, and he, to get  them to say something, said,    Well, what would you like for  Christmas?    And Ann, I think it was, popped up and said,    I   d like a  puppy.     Well, immediately, there was a puppy on the doorstep, and it was a  dachshund puppy at the Governor   s Mansion. It was almost the next day  and we went,    Oh my God, we   re going to be inundated with dogs.     And so some way or other, I came up with this wild idea. I went to the  press secretary, and I said,    We   d better put out a press release saying  we got the dog, and there   s a state-wide contest to name the dog,    which  we did, and lots of names came in.    Tandem    was the name picked. I  10  don   t know whose recommendation it was, but it won because the dog  was long and narrow, and it worked. Then I got to help train him  because I had had a dog before, but that was the home life story.  And then in the office, there were loads of memorable occasions. A lot  of them blur over time, but one that will go down in history was the day  that President Kennedy was shot and killed. It was an odd day because  Henry was speaking to a major conference across the street in the  auditorium between the Will Rogers and Jim Thorpe building, I think it  was, in a big auditorium over there. And I think it was Liz Morgan  Reece   s birthday. You had a split camp, you know,  office staff  were  going one direction or another, either doing their duty with the governor  or going out for a little social occasion/birthday, and I volunteered to  hold the fort. And so I was sitting at the front desk when this phone to  the far right that never rang, rang. It was a civil defense warning phone. I  picked it up and they checked to find out if it was the right place, and  they said,    We need to alert your governor to the fact that President  Kennedy has been shot today in Dallas.     It was just right around one o   clock, I think. Not far after. And I thought,     Oh my God, what do you do now?    There was no one there. I mean,  the corridors were empty. You tried the Capitol police, and there was  only one man, and he was out to lunch, and incredibly as Bob Haught,  who   ll be interviewed in a little bit, will tell you, I found a man who  frequently stopped by. He had been injured in the Korean War, I think,  and was a little mentally addled, and he kept looking for support of some  kind. I remember his name was Jerry, I just can   t remember his last  name, and I still to this day don   t know how I convinced that poor man  to go out of the Capitol, across Twenty-third Street, down to the  basement between the two buildings to the auditorium, down the aisle,  climb the steps where he was apprehended, and he was saying,    She told  me to tell you to tell the governor   .    And Bob Haught, I think it was,  called me and said basically,    What in the heck is going on?    and I said,     I hate to confirm it, but the President of the United States has been  shot.    And  Kennedy  was at that point headed to the hospital and died  shortly thereafter.  And then Henry, and I think Shirley too, went up to Washington for the  funeral, and I went with them, because my mother was living here   Washington, D.C. , and the governor said,    Just come with us.    And  Mom and I stood just down on the next corner here, since we   re in  Washington right now, over by the U.S. Treasury building, when the  funeral procession came by on Pennsylvania Avenue. Then she and I,  which you couldn   t do today, went back and, because Dad had been a  military officer, we knew Fort Myer well, and we went in the back gate  at Arlington and went into the cemetery and stood on the hill for the  11  whole funeral. Yes. So other than that, it was just a long, sad blur, which  it was for most Americans.  But in the office, there were other memories. One of them, not quite so  bad, but pretty gripping was the Governor   s decision not to stay the  execution of a convicted wife beater and killer, and we had a big press  conference to that point in the Blue Room, and media came from all  over. At that press conference, Henry Bellmon announced that he would  not stay the execution. There had been loads of discussion, pro and con,  but the case involved a man, who after numerous attacks, killed his wife  in a drunken stupor by beating her with a flaming log outside in the  snow after stripping her naked, and his poor young children were trying  to stop him. It was just very, very brutal. But the execution was in the  evening, a good while later, and I volunteered, because I lived at the  Mansion, to just man the switchboard over in the Governor   s office  while the others were at the Mansion, in case there was any last minute  call to stay the execution. And that was a long, long night to ten p.m.  They   d given me a TV, and I knew that when ten p.m. rolled around that  that was it, and phoned over, and they said,    Yes, the execution was  over    and so  I could return home .  And then going back to the Kennedy assassination, do ask Bob Haught  about that because, I think  Texas  Governor  John  Connally would  have been there, the meeting apparently involved a number of  governors, and he probably wouldn   t have been shot if he had come  rather than deciding to accompany the President in Dallas.  Another memorable time was during Bellmon   s first tenure, there was a  state-wide teachers    strike  over pay most likely . It brought hundreds  and hundreds of teachers from throughout the state to protest at the  Capitol, and they all converged on the Governor   s office, and he wasn   t  there. And we were standing there, the receptionist and a few of us, you  know, looking at this great crowd of people, and we had had staff  officers go out and say,    The Governor   s not here    but it just didn   t  seem to do any good. The governor   s office doors were glass, heavy  plate glass, but with the massive push of the crowd, it was obvious we  might have a problem. So we devised this solution of setting out a  number of pads, and with the date and a space for them to protest, and   provide  their name and address. So we opened the doors, invited the  teachers to come in, sign the protest pages, walk through the back, and  out a back door, so that they could definitely see the Governor wasn   t  there. Maybe all we did was save the plate glass, but I think we also  eased the pressure, the turmoil and everything. Anyway, it was the type  of thing that the Governor would appreciate, and it worked on that  particular day.  12  And then there were fun times, like the press conference where Henry  Bellmon announced that he was challenging Calaveras County,  California, made famous in Mark Twain   s book for the Calaveras  County jumping frog contest. The Governor contended that Oklahoma   s  jumping frogs were mightier, and could win the California frog contest.  Well, he held a press conference, complete with massive Oklahoma  slimy frogs in cages, which made national news. Obviously I won   t  forget, because one NBC affiliate reporter offered me three minutes on  nation-wide TV if I would kiss one of the slimy, horrible, bug-infested  frogs to see if it would turn into a prince. And that was an offer that was  easy to decline. But at least one frog did get loose in the Blue Room, and  overall it was a great fun story. It made great news and it was lots of fun.  Oklahoma then knew definitely that we had frogs that were better than  California.  And then as I noted too, there was a pickle incident. His sense of humor  was just wonderful, and not only in serious occasions, but  Henry  Bellmon  would find ways to promote the state, like with the Pickle  Packers    Association  which wrote requesting a state proclamation for     Pickle Day.     I think you can cite that, I could read from it, but you   ve  got it right here, the news clipping. Henry recommended that the pickle  packers, because he had saved Oklahoma from a sales tax and  Oklahomans had more money to spend on pickles and other things,  should instead honor Oklahoma  with a proclamation . So he was  serious when he needed to be serious, and he injected humor for good  result when humor would serve him well.  And then, I can say that the Governor   s staff, many of whom came from  the campaign, but there were a great number of new folk, too, were very  congenial. They were very intelligent, a cooperative group of talented  people to the man. We all worked well together and played well  together, and a good many of us became best friends. Social events were  encouraged by the Governor, who did not serve any liquor, and made  that public at the Mansion. He and Shirley didn   t drink, and on one  occasion he wrote little notes saying,    Milk only at social hour, will  smell each individual   s breath upon arrival.    But luckily that didn   t  happen, and it wasn   t at the Mansion, and I think there were a few little  glasses of cheer that were imbibed.  It was four memorable years and I hated leaving. While working with  the press, I had gotten very close to a lot of the media, and I got to know  the managing editor of the paper. I knew all the Gaylords. Edith  Gaylord, who was considerably older than I, was a good friend. I went  down there one day to get a cartoon as a souvenir and Charlie Bennett  called me into his office and said,    I hear you   re going to Washington.  We need a junior staff member in the Washington bureau. We   d like to  13  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  hire you.    I said,    But I have never really written a news story in my  life.    And he said,    We think you can do this job.     I had such good friends in the media. One of them was Ed Turner, who  was an anchor and one of the top news chaps at, I think it was, KWTV,  the CBS affiliate. Ed said,    Look Kath, I   ll lend you my journalism book  from OU. Read the damn thing.     So I came to Washington and Henry and the rest of the crowd proceeded  to go onward during the next two years toward the senatorial campaign.  I had graduated from college  Central State University in Edmond , had  a new job in Washington  bureau of the Daily Oklahoman and  Oklahoma City Times , and watched from afar as he succeeded to  become a US senator.  And while he served in that capacity, you were writing about him?  Yes.  Or, occasionally, anyway?  Not too much, because the Washington Bureau of The Oklahoman really  focused on all of the members of Congress    with particular focus on  those representing the State   and what was happening here in  Washington  that was of interest to Oklahomans , because we were right  here. The local news stories from Oklahoma, you know, obviously I had  a chance to read about it every day  in the news bureau  and send a sort  of cheer back there from afar  to friends in the campaign . I was up here   in Washington  covering Senator Monroney and the rest of the  delegation, so I was looking at the other side of the campaign too, with  the democrats. Page Belcher was a republican congressman and the only  member of the delegation, I think at that point, that was republican.  Were you surprised when he decided to run for governor again?  No, and I cheered him on after that. I had stayed, I think, with The  Oklahoman about four years, so I covered a bit of Henry Bellmon   s  senatorial campaign  and early career in the Senate . Another  Oklahoman, incredibly, John Martin Meek who had worked with  Senator Kerr and with Senator Monroney, headed the Edelman  International PR Firm. It   s one of the top largest firms in the country, top  five in the country, and he had said,    Hey, if you   re not married to your  job, you want more money?    And I said,    Well, sure.    So then after  working in The Oklahoman three or four years, I joined Meek at  Edelman, and loved it. Absolutely loved it and was a vice-president, but  they didn   t have any retirement program that was meaningful, so I put an  14  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  application in to the federal government and ended up as press officer  for the National Endowment for the Arts afterward.  So I got segued away from the political, but I did stay in touch with the  Bellmons and Ann and Gail and Shirley. I   d meet with them  occasionally, and Pat in particular, and Dick Copeland, her husband at  the time, go out and have dinner with them on the Hill. So I did stay in  touch, but it was not as regular because we had just sort of gone off in  different directions. And then I did stay in touch over the years with  everybody in Oklahoma, and really have to say that it   s sort of a second  home to me, a second home because of the Bellmon family, and too  because of the Oppenheims    friendship with me and family. I still stay in  touch with a lot of people back there.  Years later, the most incredible thing is that I ended up after living so  many years here in Washington, and  finding  a little farm out in the  Blue Ridge  Mountains . I ended up buying it and making hay in my  field. Down the road, almost more incredibly, only fifteen minutes from  there is Bob Haught, Henry   s first press secretary. Bob and his wife  Mary have a farm and he makes hay in his fields, so we both sit and  laugh and say,    The  Bellmon Oklahoma  hay seed stuck with us.     And all of this because you volunteered with his campaign.  Yes, and in a way, if he hadn   t opened that door to me, I mean, and then  I found another door through into the media. I had such good liaison  with the media, as I did the press secretaries  in the Bellmon governor   s  office . I would run up there  in the Oklahoma Capital  and kind of hang  out in the press office, and I could  sleuth out information . On one  occasion, I found something that was quite useful, and Henry gave a  speech and corrected what had been seen as a problem of the republicans  being very radical. In those days it was John Birch Society  that was the  uber conservative arm of the party , and he was a moderate. He also  was a thinker, and he was a moderate, educated, intelligent, well-rounded  politician. He didn   t make decisions on theoretical or whatever  causes. He thought it all through and reached decisions that he thought  were right for the people that elected him.  I think in his second term as governor, he appointed a democrat to a  post, too, an African-American woman.  Well, and he had a  staff  member, Belva, I can   t think of her last name,  but she was a staff member. She was a black staff member, Belva and  Lonnie, and I just can   t think of the last name now, but it was a long  time ago.  15  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Hannah Atkins is who I was referring to.  Oh, yes. They   re all writing about it. I can   t remember her.  That would   ve been in the early    80s, I think, so after you were already  here.  Right. I was very, very close to  all the staff  in the beginning, in a  personal way and also in everyday office work. But then later, we just  sort of segued in a different direction. But one of the highlights was  being invited back to the inauguration for his second term, which I  attended with great gusto. Ann and I   I remember in particular, the girls  were there. We went through the Mansion, and then back over to see  what was going on in the garage apartment. And it was fun to think that  the light fixtures I had put in and the different touches were still there.  You could still see decor.  Next, when Dewey Bartlett was elected, Joan Warren came in and she  was in my post with the Bartlett   s, sort of, and served as press aid as  well as helper for Mrs. Bartlett. And she lived in that garage apartment,  too. When recently, when I was back not long ago, it was Chip  Oppenheim   s fiftieth birthday, which was sort of like,    Oh my God, he  was a baby. Joan Yoakum and I went back  to see the Mansion and  grounds . And  the garage apartment  is now used for guards and there   s  a big gate with a big lock, which there wasn   t so much in those days.  There was a gate, but it was only closed at night. And there's now a  guard gate and all the rest of it. And the  former  fallout shelter  at the  Mansion  is now the swimming pool.  Do you remember your last conversation with Mr. Bellmon?  Well, the last conversation was wishing him well for his eightieth  birthday. And I   m sure I must   ve said something like    God Bless You  and Godspeed.    And I hope I said,    It   s been a joy and an honor and a  pleasure knowing you all these years,    because he was one outstanding  human being.  He was a distinguished statesman.  He was a distinguished person in every sense of the word. Right.  Can you think of one or two things that the average person doesn   t  know, or that   s not been written much about him, something that   s not  commonly known?  Well, he took naps.  16  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Power naps?  Power naps, and there was one trip that he took and Clent Dedek, the  guard, the highway patrolman. Clent was driving, and Shirley was with  him, and Henry was taking a nap. Some bozo had a truck full of cattle in  front of them, and the cattle spilled out all over the highway. So Clent  called for help, and there was the great roundup of cattle, and I think  Henry napped through most of it. But Clent could tell you that story. He  could just take little naps when he needed them, which I thought was a  great thing. I   ve never been able to do that.  Any favorite quotes or sayings?  Too long ago. I   m sure if had you interviewed me forty years ago I  could   ve come up with some.  I came across one that his father had said,    You ain   t learning nothing  if you   re talking.     He did. Henry Bellmon learned and he listened well. Yes, one thing, too,  was that he used to say,    Forgive and remember.    People would say or  do things to him that made you think,    I can   t believe they did that.     This could be someone who was an enemy or a    friend,    and he would  work his way around that and just say,    Okay, you did that, whatever  happened, happened,    and he   d keep going, but he wouldn   t give them  the opportunity to do it again. So    forgive and remember    was one  saying that I recall well and now practice.  What happened to Tandem?  He went to the farm, and I think one day he ran off and kind of didn   t  come back.  Is that the only family pet they had?  Yes. Then that was the time, too, Shirley was over at my apartment. We  were visiting and two of the girls, I think it was Gail and Ann, were over  in the house. It was a windy day, and the windows were open in the  Mansion, and they called over on the house phone and incredibly    I  just happened to be talking to, Edith Gaylord had called and said,    Oh,  Kathy, blah, blah, blah,    you know, we were just visiting on the phone,  and Shirley was sitting on the sofa. The house phone rang, and she  answered the house phone, and it was the girls saying,    Mom, we think  someone   s in the house.    Because the guard at the time had taken the  other girl off to a basketball game or something, and Henry was out  17  making a speech that evening. So Shirley   s going,  whispers      Somebody   s in the house.    So I put my hand over the telephone with  Edith and I said,    Tell them to get over here.     So they came over and I said,    Well, Edith, I   ve got to go right now, I   ll  call you back later,    and I thought,    Of all things, the publisher   s  daughter.    But anyway, we had to handle this problem. I came out  of  the kitchen  and all three of them were looking at the Mansion, the  stairway to my apartment went up and it was a window at the top of the  stairway. Well, the light was on behind them. I said,    If somebody   s in  the Mansion, you   ve got to step back here  so they can   t see you .    We  couldn   t figure out what to do, so I called the police and I said,    Look,  it   s no big deal, but if you could send somebody around, we   d appreciate  it, and please don   t make a fuss. I mean, all likelihood there is probably  there   s no one here, but we just would like to have a policeman handy,  and just one car will do. Please.     Well, all hell broke loose because it was about six police cars, and the  canine corps arrived. The dachshund Tandem ran down the stairs and  confronted the canine corps, which was German Shepherds that kind of  rose up and went,    Ruff.    And the poor dachshund dog fainted. And  Ann   s going,    Oh, my dog     And in the entry drive, Skip Beasley was  the guard that night. Skip came back and hadn   t changed into a guard  uniform. He had on just regular civilian student clothes, but he  did not  stop and change into guard uniform but  went and got the gun. There  was a gun in the closet, the front hall closet. And he got it and loaded the  gun, this was before the police got there, and he climbed the grand  staircase. We could see him, because from my place you could see  through great arched window on the  Mansion  staircase, as he climbed  up the stairs. He went into Henry and Shirley   s bedroom. Shirley had  left the closet door open, which had a full length mirror on it, and Skip  flipped on the light and nearly blew the door off the hinges. (Laughs) I  mean, he scared himself to death, as you can well imagine. Luckily he  didn   t fire the gun, but then the police came, and puppy dog sort of had a  seizure, and we   re reviving him.  In the meantime, Skip kept going  on his investigation , as I recall, and  he had managed to get to some point where the police cornered him,   spotted the gun  and said,    Drop it,    and he replied,    But I   m the  guard,    but of course he didn   t look like it  in civilian attire . So he  threw the gun down the laundry chute, into the basement. I mean, it fell  all the way down, and anyway, it was quite an evening. More so, when  Neal Schull from Channel Five, the ABC-TV affiliate arrived. He was  kind of a weird TV news reporter who had a knack of popping out of  closets and things to get a story that nobody else had. He was a strange  young man, and I said,    You can   t do this. You cannot film this, there  18  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  is/was no story, nothing happened, it was probably just wind.    And he  said,    But it   s a great story, and the police were all here and everything,     And I   m going,    Oh, balderdash.    And even though I was only probably  twenty-three  years old, I decided to call  Ben King, who owned the  television station, at home. I said,    Here   s the problem, and if you run  that story on TV, there   s going to be, everybody and his brother   s going  to play little pranks, and it will be just Pandora   s box  with escapades .  Too, there was nothing, nobody was found, it was probably the wind,  and what can you do to help?    And the story didn   t run on TV. Later  that night, the one girl that was missing, I think it was Pat, came back  from the basketball game, and we were all sitting at the Mansion  watching TV. It was something on TV like an Ed Sullivan-type show or  something, and Henry finally  arrived home . He said,    I go out, and I  work hard, and I give speeches, and I do all this, and I do that, and you  all just sit around and watch TV.    And we all said,    Wait a minute. You  won   t believe what happened.     Well, this wasn   t typical, you always had to be prepared to handle     Oh no, no, no, no, no. But it was just something that in a million years  wouldn   t have happened, and couldn   t happen again, and you asked  about the dog, so that was one memorable time with the dog.  Didn   t make it to press.  And all the rest of us were kind of sitting around chuckling about it, and  if you talk to Skip Beasley, even now, I think he   ll say,    That was  certainly a memorable time in my life.    I think there are lots of other  little  incidents that occurred , but it   s just too bad it   s a little fuzzy.  What about the day that you actually left the position, working with  them? Did they give you a going away party or something like that? Any  memories from it?  Well, that was pretty amazing. There was a going away party for me,  and probably because of the Oppenheims, and they were best friends  with George Shirk. I knew George and his sister, Lucille, Lucy we used  to call her. When I left, the mayor of Oklahoma City and his sister and  Henry and Shirley hosted a party. All of the governor   s office crowd  came, and a lot of other good friends, all of the Capitol press corps, and  we just had a blast. And I got my Volkswagen with all my stuff, as much  gear as I could put into the car, and Henry helped me get some of it  back, and I just drove east across the country with tears in my eyes  thinking,    How could I possibly have left these wonderful people?    So  that, yeah.  19  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  They played a major role.  Yes, they played a major role in my life. I don   t know as I did in theirs,  but they were a big part of mine, that   s for sure, and made a big  difference in a career that went many different directions thereafter. I  never forgot them and never will.  Do you want to give us just a quick run-down on your career?  Well, then I went from The Daily Oklahoman to Daniel J. Edelman  Public Relations Firm, and was part of a campaign which led to buckle-up  seatbelt laws. We had gotten Richard Basehart, the English actor, and  went to Australia and had a film made of how successful buckle-up laws  were in saving people from terminal injury in automobile accidents. If  you had your belt on, you were less likely to be killed. We took that film  around to the different states, and this campaign, to the state legislators.  New York was the first, so we got the seat-belt law passed.  And the other big memorable campaign was working with the French  and helping the Concorde airplane, supersonic plane, land here legally in  the United States. The US had offered guarantees to the British and  French governments that if they were able to create this plane that we  would allow it to land, and it took them almost twenty years to do it, and  they did it. And then there were tests, and some of them were in  Oklahoma, for sonic booms. I remember being out there and being in the  governor   s office when they did the sonic boom test. People were  saying,    It cracked my walls,    and so there I was, working. The British  had their own team, it was British Aircraft Corporation.  So at  Edelman,  we worked with Aerospatiale France. Their campaign  for  landing rights to the U.S. for the Concorde  was very active. The plane  was to not go supersonically over the United States so it would slow  down before it hit our shores. Then when it took off, it wasn   t going to  fly across the United States. So that was the PR campaign, per se, but it  was on the legal front that the case was settled. A great highlight was the  fabulous party at Dulles Airport when the French and British  Concorde   planes  landed and then arrived  nose to nose in front of the terminal.  The champagne came out, and it was just great.  But by that time, I had left Edelman. I was doing very, very well  financially, but there was no retirement program. I had applied for a job  in the press office at the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)  but  months went by and nothing happened . All of a sudden they said,     You   ve got the job,    and so I went to the Arts Endowment, I had to  take a couple of days off to go, like, to the celebrations with the British  and French  on the Concorde landing . Then I kept going in the press  office at the National Endowment for the Arts, and worked there from.  20  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Roger Stevens and Nancy Hanks were the early chairmen. Nancy was a  very, very good friend, and she, sadly, died of cancer, but she really set  the course for the NEA. Then after that I worked through every  chairman up through the actress Jane Alexander during Bush I. We had  some pretty memorable times, and most of it was good news, but then  there was the bad news of what people thought was objectionable.  During Bush I, I guess Jane Alexander was NEA Chairman after that,  but during Bush I, John Frohnmayer, a republican appointee was fired  by Bush I. John called me and he said,    I   ve been fired by the President  of the United States this morning.     I thought he had done the best he  could and tried to be reassuring as  all hell broke loose. That was a day  you wouldn   t forget. What do you say? Hundreds of people were calling,  and sadly, it later was shown that some of that was questionable, if they  did the right thing. I think the Endowment is on a good track at the  moment, with the top person in the arts at its helm. He   s got loads and  loads of professional arts experience, so I think it   s going in the right  direction.  Then what?  Well, and then after the Arts Endowment, I retired. There was a federal  buyout  to encourage retirements . I had fulfilled my twenty years and I  had my retirement program. After leaving, I went back and worked part  time in PR and hooked up with a friend who said,    Say, let   s start our  own firm.    We were working with Ruder Finn, and Jim Harff had been  vice-president for international clients there. He and I broke off and  started a new international public relations firm, called Global  Communicators. It   s still right up the street here, and I retired two years  ago. Jim asked,    Why are you retiring?    and I said,    Because I   ve  reached an age where it seems like a good idea, and I want to have a  little fun.    So that   s it.  And what are you doing in your retirement?  Well, still writing some for the newspaper down in county, and helping  occasionally with clients. I went with Jim in November to Berlin  on a  project for the firm involving  the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the  Berlin Wall. We were there to do press work with Mikhail Gorbachev,  and a number of other Nobel Laureates who were hosting a meeting  to  promote world peace , in conjunction with that great celebration. So  we   re in Berlin to promote the Nobel Laureates    meeting, and we helped  to host a press conference for Mr. Gorbachev. We arranged interviews  for him and Lech Walesa and Muhammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank  of Bangladesh, who had been my last client right before he won the  Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, for the work he   s doing with people, mini-loans  that are lifting the poor out of poverty. So here are all these  21  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Christie  wonderful Nobel Laureates, and they meet to see how they can further  extend peace and goodwill among men through many different  programs. It was breaking down the wall in Berlin, which certainly  opened the East and West to democracy in Germany. That was a very  memorable five days in Berlin.  And a fascinating one.  It was absolutely fascinating. I   m going to the National Council on the  Arts meeting, I think, tomorrow. I have done work with the National  Endowment for the Humanities. You still maintain a few old ties, and  you   re not all at the farm, if you know what I mean.  What do you do on the farm besides raise hay? No critters, no cattle?  Oh, three dogs, and no, it   s only eleven acres, and right now I   m  struggling with the US Army Corps of Engineers because I   ve got a  river that flows by the house that   s flooding and oddly, the Corps of  Engineers wants to know what you   re doing and what you   re not. I   ve  got a fifty-page little packet that we have to work our way through to get  a permit to stabilize the banks. I miss the city, though, and I   m thinking,  how long can you hang out down there, but we   ll see.  Do you still have your journalism book from OU?  I think I do. God bless him, Ed Turner   s in heaven now, I hope, and his  wife too, and so many of my good, good friends.  So many old news  chums came here to Washington from Oklahoma including  Mike  Buchanan from Channel Nine days, a bunch of them came up to Metro  Media here, which is now Fox News. Then Ed went on to CBS Morning  News in New York, CBS Network in New York, and then remarkably  went down to Atlanta with Ted Turner and Reese Schonfeld, and some  of the other media notables who created Cable News Network. That was  an incredible crowd of good people. Mike Buchannan is still a newsman  here in Washington, from Oklahoma. He married Cathy Snider  from  Bellmon   s first gubernatorial office and later the the Senate office . Liz  Morgan-Reece and Cathy Snider Buchanan were, and are, good friends.  Cathy, unfortunately, died just a year or two ago.  The campaign starts a lot of good friendships, evidently.  They do, they do, yeah. And you saw a lot of them at Henry   s eightieth  birthday. It was like the last time I saw    Doc    Jordan, who was so vital  to Bellmon   s first campaign success and later, too. There were so many  people there including Clent Dedek, the patrolman, and people that you  just really cherish, but your lives had taken you in different directions.  22  Finchum  Christie  Finchum  Well, thank you for taking time to talk with us today. It   s been a real  pleasure.  Thank you for giving rebirth to so many great old memories.  It   s been fun.  -------  -------
