 Nykolaiszyn  All right, today is Thursday, October 16, 2014. My name is Juliana  Nykolaiszyn. Also with me is Tanya Finchum. We   re with the Oklahoma  Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library, and today we   re  interviewing Evelyn Coyle in Tonkawa, Oklahoma. We   re here to learn  more about her husband   s family   s centennial farm in Kay County, the  Aden O. Coyle Farm. Evelyn, thank you so much for joining us today.  Let   s begin by learning a little bit more how the family came to  Oklahoma.  Wasn   t really the family. It was my husband   s father who came in 1893  from Minnesota where the family did live. I do not know how he came  to Oklahoma, whether he rode a horse, but when he got here he was in  the Cherokee Strip 1893 Run to stake a claim, homestead.  Okay, and is there any idea of how he chose that particular piece of  land?  I have no idea about that, no.  Okay, and when Aden Orlando came to Oklahoma and settled on the  land, is there any idea of some of the things he started to do, structures  he started to build?  Yes, he built fences. He built a barn. He built a small house, which I  think they were called claim shacks because the land was claimed and  they were shacks. As far as I know, that   s all he built to begin with.  Okay, and was he married when he came to Oklahoma?  No.  Okay.  5  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  No.  And do you know how he met his wife?  No, I really do not know how they met.  Okay, and together with his wife, how many children did they have?  Two sons.  Two sons, okay, and one of which was your husband.  Right.  Aden O., and what was the other son   s name?  Mark Albert.  Tell me a little bit about your husband.  Well, I met him when I was in college. He had just returned from being  discharged from the Air Force in World War II, and he and his brother  came back to farm this quarter of land. Actually there were two quarters  because the land across the road from the land that was staked to claim,  Mr. Coyle had bought that land, that quarter of land. At that time there  was a house on it, and that   s where the two brothers lived.  And can you describe that house for me?  It was just a little two-bedroom, bungalow-style house that originally  was not modern, but when the boys came back they made a bathroom  and fixed the kitchen up a little.  And so together they farmed the land?  Yes, both quarters.  Okay. What were some of the activities going on? What were they  growing, or their livestock? Any idea?  No, they did not have livestock. They just merely grew wheat.  Okay.  Yeah.  6  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  You said you met at college. Was your husband enrolled at Oklahoma  A M at that time?  No, he was not in college. I was in college here at Tonkawa.  Okay.  Well, actually, I guess when I met him I was in college here, but I did go  on to finish college at Stillwater.  What was their mother   s name?  Esther. Her maiden name was West.  And I   m assuming that he graduated from Tonkawa High?  No. No, the boys grew up in Oklahoma City, graduated from Classen  High School, and went to OU and majored in   I think he majored in  petroleum engineering.  So what was the connection to the land? What drew him to want to farm  the land after the war?  Well, I just think   I don   t know, really. I suppose that they just didn   t  have jobs, I guess, and thought that that would be the thing to do.  And did they also have work outside of the farm?  No, not to begin with.  Okay.  Later on, I think, well, I know my husband had another job. In time,  about, well, in  1964  the farm was hit with a tornado. Tore up the  granaries, did a little damage to the house, and they had just decided     the price of wheat was down. By that time, of course, Aden and I were  married, had two children. Just decided that maybe farming was kind of  not the thing they wanted to continue to do.  Well, when you married Aden, did you live on the farm?  To begin with we didn   t, but then soon we did, and we lived there for  probably two or three years.  And you lived in the house across     7  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Yes.  Okay.  We lived in that house.  Was it modern by that time?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. (Laughter)  And by    modern    we mean indoor plumbing.  Right. (Laughter)  And electricity?  Yes.  Would you have things you did on the farm to help out?  Well, we had several hired hands, and I did all the cooking for them, fed  them. No, I did not work in the field. We had two small children then. I  thought,    If I don   t learn to drive the tractor, then I won   t have to.     (Laughs)  That   s pretty good thinking. (Laughter) Well, you mentioned you cooked  for the farm hands and everybody working. How early would you get  started?  Early in the morning. Five o   clock, probably.  And what types of things would you prepare?  For lunch?  Yes.  Well, we usually had a roast or meatloaf, fried chicken. I really tried to  cook good meals for the boys. A lot of the help in the summer were  teenage boys. He usually had one or two adult men that were helping.  Back then, the equipment was not nearly as modern as it is today. The  combine, it took almost two weeks to combine the one quarter of land  because they only had, like, a nine-foot header on the combine. Now  they   re, what, twenty-two feet? It made a lot of difference, and  fortunately they were mechanically enough to repair the equipment  8  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  when they had a breakdown. I always was the one that ran to wherever  they could get parts when something broke down. I got to go get the  parts and hoped I   d get the right ones. (Laughs)  How far would you have to travel to get parts?  Well, Blackwell, which is about twelve miles, Ponca City, sometimes  Perry. I think even Enid.  Where would they take the wheat to market?  Here in Tonkawa. We had granaries. Sometimes they would store the  wheat if the price was depressed, which it usually is right at harvest  time.  Well, over time did the brothers start to make improvements to the land,  add new structures?  They did build a very large workshop and a garage, big garage, to put  trucks in. They did, yes. They did a lot of bulldozing work on the land to  build waterways, whatever needed to be done to protect the land.  Did that include terracing?  Terracing, yes, some terracing. The land is fairly flat and didn   t need a  lot of terracing. However, in time they were able to lease some land, and  on that land they did do some of the terracing work.  So in     64  your husband decided, or the two of you decided to get out of  the farming business.  Yes.  Did the brother stay in it?  No. No, they both made a decision together to   had a farm sale, or  planned to sell all of the equipment. Unfortunately, the tornado that  came through came through about three or four days before the sale was  to be, the auction, but the equipment was not damaged. The granaries  were spread all over the county. Part of the roof of the house was spread  out.  How did your husband come to have his section? Did he buy it from his  father, or was it passed down?  The father had died when the boys were quite young, I think maybe four  9  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  and six, or two and four. I   m not sure. The mother had divided the     gave one boy one quarter and the other one a quarter. Already had the  name transfer on it.  When you were living there, did you belong to a homemaker club?  No, I didn   t.  Didn   t have time     Right.     with two young ones.  Did your young ones help out on the farm or get into mischief or     No, they were too little. They were preschool. They were good kids. No,  they didn   t get into a lot of trouble. (Laughs)  Well, once you decided to get out of the business, you still kept the land?  Oh, yes.  Did he lease it to other farmers or just let it stay idle or what?  Yes, it was leased out. His brother Mark is now deceased. Of course,  they   re both deceased. When my husband died, the land was deeded to  me, and Mark still had his land. He died five years ago, I believe. He did  not have a family. He had, I believe, had a will that transferred almost all  of his land and holdings to the Dean McGee Eye  Institute  in Oklahoma  City. They were not farmers, so in turn there was an auction, and all the  land was sold.  Did they, through the years continue, even after they started leasing out  the land, feel a deep connection to that land? They kept it in the family  for     It   s always been in the family.  Yes.  Yeah, I know my husband really felt a deep connection to the land.  Many years back, the government had a plan that you could only plant  so many acres in wheat. Then when it got ready for harvest, there would  be someone that would come out from the agricultural office to measure  the land and make sure you weren   t over-planted. One year he was over-  1 0  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  planted a few acres, and the wheat was just beautiful. He had to go out  and destroy that wheat, and I remember him getting started. He made  one round, and he came back up to the house, and he said,    This is one  of the hardest things I   ve ever had to do is to destroy perfectly good  crop.    So, yeah, I think he felt very tied to the land.  Would you ever have family events on the old farm property, reunions or  holidays or     Well, when we were living there and the children were little, sure, we  had all the holidays over there.  Did you raise chickens?  No. (Laughter)  That   s a farm question. We have to ask.  We just   neither one of the fellows were interested in any kind of  livestock. They just did not.  Big garden?  No, we did not garden. We just really were always busy with equipment  or something on the land, whatever, and they just did not do that.  Were there any, especially in the early days, drilling of oil or gas on the  land?  Yes, I do remember one time there was an oil company that came in and  leased. It was Aden   s quarter, but it was a dry hole. You know, we   re  south of Tonkawa and pretty close bordering the area that used to be the  Three Sands oilfield, and now there are several oil petroleum companies  that have been drilling out there now for several years. They   ve gone in,  of course, with new equipment, new technology. They are finding oil  where they used to say,    There   s no production here.    Now there is.  So you all have retained the minerals rights?  Yes.  Have you noticed, through the years, changes with your neighbors and  the surrounding properties?  Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. At one time, there probably was several houses on  every quarter of land, or every section. Now most of those structures are  1 1  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  gone. There are some out there that are still existing or newer homes, but  very, very few of the homes that used to be there are no longer there.  You stated that the two boys grew up in Oklahoma City. How did they  come to be there? How did they   when his father passed away, his  mother moved them or what?  Well, I believe that they had lived in several places, and I do not know  why. I know they lived in Wichita, Kansas, for a brief period of time.  They lived in Ponca City, but they did go to high school in Oklahoma  City, and Aden went to OU for college...  So I   m assuming        but I do not know why Mrs. Coyle moved the children around a lot.  But she kept the land during that time. Do you know if it was leased  during the time they were     Oh, yes, it was leased.  So some income producing for her.  Yes.  So once your husband and you decided not to farm, what did he do?  He and a friend of his went into an equipment business and did quite  well with it.  Some of the things he learned on the farm, then, he transferred over to  other things?  Well, I suppose so. He was very mechanical, so working with equipment  was kind of natural with him.  And he served in the   what branch of the military was he in?  The Air Force. At the time he was in World War II, it was the Army Air  Force. Now today   I don   t know when, but the Air Force became a  separate division of the military.  And his mother did not remarry?  Not that I   m aware of.  1 2  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Roughly when they passed away? She?  She passed away in 1962, and my husband passed away in 1999. Mark  passed away  in 2009 .  And then the father would have been earlier?  Well, the boys were   let   s see. My husband was born in 1919, and I  think he was, maybe, four years older. I   m a little vague on that because  I   m not quite positive.  Early   20s.  Yes. I believe he died in 1922 or   23.  So when your husband died, the property passed to you.  Right.  And so tell me what   s been happening on the farm since then?  Well, I have it leased to one of the area farmers. I believe in 2006, it was  either 2006 or   07, when many oil companies were coming and leasing  land, and I did lease the land. There is production on the land now.  And so as we look into the future, what do you hope happens to the  land?  Well, I just hope that it will be taken care of properly. The land will go  to my older son who was always very interested in the land. When he  was in high school, in the summer times he always worked on the farm  or with a farmer, and he always enjoyed driving the tractor, helping with  combining. However, he   s a petroleum engineer now in Houston, and he  probably won   t be active in it, but I think he   s aware of good farming  practices and will make sure that it   s taken care of.  Tell me a little bit about your children.  We have a daughter. I have a daughter now and two sons. The daughter  and her husband live in Dallas, and my son who   s next in line is in  Houston. My younger son is in Dallas, also.  A lot of Texas.  Yes. (Laughter)  1 3  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Did you get to name the oil wells on the property?  Yes, I named it the Aden Wells.  Okay, good to know. Do you envision any of the three children coming  back and actually living on the place?  No, no, they   re all definitely converted to metropolitan life now.  Have they at least walked the property or been on the property?  You mean recently?  In recent years.  Not recently, no, but they know where it is. They   re very well aware of  the land.  Is it still 160 acres?  Yes.  Do you   how often do you drive by and just peek on it?  About twice a week.  Really?  I do.  When you   re making your visits, is there anything you   re looking for in  particular, or you   re just going out to say hi? (Laughter)  Well, if the crop is growing, I like to go and see how much has  happened. Right now I   m waiting for the land to be planted back into  wheat, so it   s just kind of interesting to   I really appreciate the person I  have it rented to, leased to. He does work very closely with the  Stillwater agricultural department. I just like what he   s doing by rotating  crops. The recent crop that was harvested was milo. I ask him if maybe  he was going to harvest the stalk because I know it can be ground and  used for cattle feed. He said no. He thought it would be better     apparently Stillwater has released a product that can be sprayed on the  stalks that is safe and not toxic and will cause it to, I don   t know whether  it will disintegrate, but whatever. It will fall into the ground and help  fertilize and be humus for the soil, be good for the soil. Then when it  does that, he   ll work that into the ground. I appreciate what he does for  1 4  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  me.  It   s great that you still have this interest in the land and you go out and  you say hi. (Laughter)  Well, and I also go out to make sure the wells are pumping. (Laughter)  Well, that too  That   s important. That is definitely important.  Yes, that   s important.  A lot of farmers we   ve spoken to lately that have had increased oil  production, oil and gas on their land, they   ve noticed impacts within  their community in terms of crime. Have you noticed anything out of the  ordinary?  Because of the oil?  Yes.  I don   t believe   I don   t know. I can   t speak with authority on that. I  don   t think that there   s that much crime involvement with what   s been  going on around Tonkawa.  Okay.  Number one, very little of it is close to town. I just don   t know. Police  Department could probably answer that better. (Laughs)  Was there ever a time where your husband thought he may lose the  farm?  Not that I   m aware of, certainly not as long as we were married.  He didn   t mortgage it to get more equipment or that sort of thing?  No.  And how do you keep up with, or do you keep up with, the farm  programs?  Yes, I get emails and letters about it, and I usually read it. Like I say, the  man that is leasing it is a big corporate farming. He has a lady working  for him that used to work in the county agricultural office, and she   s  very knowledgeable. Usually when I get something that I don   t really  quite understand, I take it to them, and they take care of it.  1 5  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  How involved are you in deciding what   s planted and what   s not?  Usually I will be asked. Right now he   s on a rotation crops, and I know  that it   s going to be wheat or corn or soy beans, or if we double plant  then it might be, like, milo.  Do each one of those have a unique smell? We   ve heard people talk  about the smell of wheat when it   s harvested. Do you have any memories  of that sort of thing?  The smell? No. Not anything that stays with me.  In 1993 when they applied for designation for the centennial farm status,  was that your husband   s idea to do that?  Actually, I think I read about it in the Daily Oklahoman. I think there  was a number to call, and I believe I remember calling and giving them  information that the farm was still in the family.  Did you attend the ceremony they have?  Yes, it was banquet in Enid.  And who all from your family was present?  Just my husband and I.  Did they give you the big metal sign, and where is it today?  It   s in the garage. (Laughs) Aden did not want to put it on a stand in the  field. He was afraid that it would either be taken or maybe used for  target practice     A lot of them have been.     so I have it intact.  How long has your family lived in Tonkawa?  Are you asking how long have I lived here?  Yes, how long have you lived in Tonkawa?  My father was a Santa Fe depot agent, and we moved here in 1945, so I  have lived here since then.  1 6  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Coyle  Finchum  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  So you grew up in Tonkawa.  Pretty much, yeah.  Okay.  And they came here from where?  We came from southwestern Oklahoma, a little town called Sentinel.  You   re Oklahoman.  Yes. In fact, I was the only one in my family that was born in Oklahoma.  The rest of them were from Kansas. I   m just a third-generation  American. My dad   s family came from Sweden, and his mother was     well, it   d have been his grandparents that came. His mother was   they  just barely had arrived to the United States when she was born.  What did your father do on the Santa Fe?  He was a depot agent.  Was there a depot in Tonkawa?  Yes     Okay.     and it still exists. The local historical society has   about five or six  years ago, it was deeded to the historical society. We have renovated it  and repaired it, taken care of it, and we rent it out for people that want to  have events there.  Well, as we wind on down, is there anything else you   d like to share  about your farm or family that we may have missed?  I think you   ve covered it quite well     All right.     with your questions. I don   t think of anything. Probably won   t until  after you leave. (Laughs)  We hear that.  1 7  Coyle  Nykolaiszyn  Coyle  Yes.  Well, Evelyn, thank you so much for joining us today. We appreciate it.  Well, thank you for caring.  -------  -------
