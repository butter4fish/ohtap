Story_ID: 483137
Speaker 1: So we will start.  If you can please tell me about your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Lucille [Lucille Silliman Ashford].  Her last name was Ashford, that was my stepfather, A-S-H-F-O-R-D.  And they were married some years ago when I, when I was a little boy, 'cause she and my real father [Henry Smith], biological father, divorced some years ago, and she remarried and she married this fellow whose name is Chris Ashford [ph.].  And what was it, the rest of it?
Speaker 1: What was your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: I think it was April 12th--
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  May, May.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  May.
Speaker 2: May 12th, May 12th, 1897, I think.
Speaker 1: And her place of birth?
Speaker 2: Clinton, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: So what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a domestic, she used to cook and, and she cleaned house.
Speaker 1: And this was in, in Clinton, Louisiana?
Speaker 2: In Clinton.
Speaker 1: Do you remember did, when you were, did she, has she ever shared, did she ever share anything with you about her childhood in Clinton?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of any, anything that she, that she shared with me about her young life, teenage life.  Is that what you mean?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: No, no, she didn't talk about that too much.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about--did you know your grandparents, your mother's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --parents?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Robert Silliman, S-I-L-L-I-M-A-N; that was my grandfather.  My grandmother was Ada, A-D-A, Silliman [Ada Silliman].  And they lived in Clinton, Clinton, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: So do you know anything about them?  Do you remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were, they were sharecroppers.  And they just worked the farm with the, for the white man, and that was about it.
Story_ID: 483138
Speaker 1: So do you remember, do you, did you have the opportunity--I know your mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] remarried, but did you know your father [Henry Smith]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew my father.  My father lived in New Orleans [Louisiana], when I knew him.  And he worked for Southern Pacific Railroad.  And I think he retired from the railroad oh, after it, after having worked for them for many years.  And he, he was, think he was a hundred and--not, not hundred, but ninety-five years old when he, when he died and lived in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Now did you know your father's parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name on, on my father's side was Walter Smith.  And Walter Smith was a contractor.  He built all the, not all, but most of the houses, and churches, and schoolhouses in, in Clinton [Louisiana].  And he, he had five, I think he had five or six boys, and all of them knew a trade.  And when, when he was called on to build a house or a church or a school, he'd bring his boys and it, they'd get through with that job in quick time 'cause all of them knew how to do something.  That was a long time ago.  And he lived to be a long--lived to be a very successful businessman, worked in his community all of his years.  As a matter of fact, I had an uncle who was killed by a white man in Clinton because both of them bid on a school that was being built.  And my grandfather was bidding on it, and this white fellow was bidding on it too.  And so my grandfather--I mean my uncle--had the low bid, and so he killed my, killed my uncle because he was disappointed in the fact that he didn't get the, get the job.  But all of them were good with their hands and, and knew how to do things.  In those days, you know, you didn't have all the modern techniques, and if you knew how to lay brick--well, not too much brick was being used back in those days.  It was all frame, you know, because it wasn't like Denver [Colorado].  When I came to Denver, he said you couldn't build a house with anything but brick, that's all.  I think there was some of kind of a city, some kind of city ruling on it that you had to use brick.  And brick--frame construction, construction wasn't popular until in the late '20s [1920s] and early '30s [1930s] here in Denver.  It just wasn't used as it is today.
Speaker 1: So when your uncle was killed, did your family leave town or they just stayed there?  Or, do you know what happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, see, this was in Clinton, West--Clinton, Louisiana.  And I left Clinton at an early age, and I don't know too much about what happened after I left.  I left Clinton and went with my mother to New Orleans and from New Orleans to Denver.  And I was a very young fellow, and so I didn't keep up with what happened.  My mother wasn't writing to my, all the relatives down there too frequent, frequently and neither was I 'cause I was real young.  So I didn't, I don't know too much about my family history in Clinton because I, I didn't live there very long.  And I went down there, went down there summer months.  In the summer, my mother, when I lived in New Orleans, my mother would, when I'd get out of school, she'd send me down to Clinton to live with, to stay with my [maternal] grandmother [Ada Silliman] for a couple of months when school was out.  And that's, that's what I knew about my family, in those few months when I was down there during the summer, summertime.  I didn't, I didn't live there very long at all.  And I got a bunch of cousins that I've never known, I've never seen, and so I'm not a good historian insofar as the family's concerned, see.
Story_ID: 483139
Speaker 1: But let me ask you, when you were, when you were a little boy going back to Clinton [Louisiana] for those summers, what sorts of things did you do over the summer in Clinton?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I prevailed upon my mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] to buy me a BB gun.  So she brought me a BB gun, and I went out in the woods and didn't, didn't, couldn't kill any rabbits 'cause the gun wasn't strong enough.  But I was shooting at the chickens, and my [maternal] grandmother [Ada Silliman] beat my butt for killing, trying to kill her chickens.  So, there, there was a, a river close by, I think it was Amite River and go out there and fish, salmon, ride the horses, and help on the, in the garden.  She had a great big garden.  You didn't buy anything in those days, you know, except what was not, what was not available on the farm that you could, that you could utilize, that you needed.  So, that's what I did.  I went down there and then worked and helped to pick cotton.  And I couldn't--they got disgusted with me because I couldn't pick the cotton the way they were picking it.  And there, and she never could teach me how to pick any more cotton than I was picking, and it was very small amount.  And when school started in September, I went back to New Orleans [Louisiana] and went to school there.  And I must have done that, I, I did that many years, until I finished high school [Manual High School], which was in 1933 here in Denver [Colorado].  No, that was in New Orleans--until we moved to Denver.  And then when we moved to Denver, of course, I didn't go back anymore to New Orleans, see.
Story_ID: 483140
Speaker 1: What do you remember of New Orleans [Louisiana] as far as your school years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, well--
Speaker 1: Let's start with first grade.
Speaker 2: I was just thinking.  Every spring, like they had the, what they call it, the flood they had down in New Orleans recently?
Speaker 1: Katrina [Hurricane Katrina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The hurr--
Speaker 2: Well, the streets in New Orleans were just flooded every, every, every spring.  And, and we used to, we used, we used to play in the, in the streets.  And some of the streets were paved, and some of them weren't back in those days.  And so as I observed Katrina, I was reminded the fact that when I was a boy I used to play in the flooded streets every spring because everything would, was flooded.  Well, it seems as though in recent years back down there, they made some improvements on the flooding in the streets, but apparently they didn't solve the whole job because it--they thought they'd built a wall to prit- protect the, the city from flooding, but apparently they didn't do a good job.  So I remember that and how much I enjoyed that as a, as a small kid.  I went to a little private school down there called Gilbert Academy [New Orleans, Louisiana].  And Gilbert Academy was a school, which was utilized for Methodist ministers.  And she [Smith's mother, Lucille Silliman Ashford] had, she had sent me to public schools for a short period of time, but I was in fights all the time and raising hell, and so she took me out and put me in Gilbert Academy.  And it was, seems to me like the tuition was four or five dollars a month, something like that.  And so--
Speaker 1: Do you remember the Storyville section of New Orleans when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: The section I was growing up in?
Speaker 1: That, the Storyville section of New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Storyville?
Speaker 1: There's a section of New Orleans called Storyville.  Did you know that section of town?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, you were, your, your--was your father [Henry Smith] in New Orleans?  Were, were any part of your family Creole?
Speaker 2: Not, not deep Creole, you know.  I mean that, we had some Creole people would talk that, that Creole language, you know, but we weren't that type of Creole, no.
Speaker 1: Well, when you were growing up in your, what, your mother was domest- did domestic work when she was in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And she made enough money to send you to a cat- to send you to a private school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, send me to this private school, and they, she was, she was a hound on, in, environment.  She always looked to me to, to, to have good friends and to have friends who were not in and out of trouble all the time.  So she was very cautious about who I played with, and who came to my house, and whose house I went to.  So maybe that accounts for the fact (laughter) that it's, I wasn't, wasn't in trouble too often, see.
Speaker 1: So when you were in that private school, were there specific teachers there that had any sort of impact on your life?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: A professor whose name was Jones [ph.], Mr. Jones, and he was always hard on you for studying.  And he made certain that you understood the stuff that he was being teach- that he was teaching.  And there, I made some good friends there.  As a matter of fact, one of my friends just recently died who, who went to school down there same time I did.  He ended up being a lawyer and, and had a good practice in, I think a little town he was practicing in, in, in Louisiana.  But anyway, I had, I had lots of friends there and, and many of them were very successful people.
Speaker 1: So when you were in elementary school and in New Orleans at the private school and then you moved to, you know, the sort of the fourth grade, secondary school, did you have any teachers during that time that made any impression on your life?
Speaker 2: When I was in, in New Orleans?
Speaker 1: In New Orleans, like in the fourth, fifth, sixth grade?
Speaker 2: None other than Mr. Jones that I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, now at that time did you have any idea what you wanted to become when you grew up?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I, I used to tell my mother I was gonna be a doctor, but, and I had a course in biology down there that I used to think--'cause we had to dissect the frog and various other little small creatures, and I used to think that I wanted to be a doctor.  But then, it was about that time that I discovered that I didn't like blood and no need of me trying to be a doctor if I didn't like blood, see, that, that created new problems for me.  So I gave that up altogether.
Story_ID: 483141
Speaker 1: And then you--which high school did you go to in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Gilbert Academy [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: So you went there from, all the way through school, Gilbert (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, I went there until we moved to Denver [Colorado].  And I think I must have been in the ninth grade when I came to Denver.  I came here and my mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] made friends with various other people who were in the same kind of work that she was in.  And so there were people who, whom she met here in Denver said that they were going to demote me when I came, when I came to Denver because the school system in New Orleans was not up to the school system here in Denver.  But they didn't.  They gave me a test, and they didn't, did, they didn't demote me, and I graduated [from Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] right in time with, with my class, see, in 1933, long time ago, 1933.
Speaker 1: Now do you know why your mother left New Orleans to come to Denver?
Speaker 2: I don't really know except for the fact that she was uncomfortable with the, with the discrimination in New Orleans, and she had a friend who had come through, had come through Denver from Cal- California that was going back down to New Orleans.  And they told her about how well domestic people were treated here in Denver and how much more money they were making.  So she decided, decided--and she wasn't happy with her, with her husband [Chris Ashford (ph.)], who was my stepfather, and so she decided to give it all up and try it here in Denver.
Story_ID: 483142
Speaker 1: So when you were in New Orleans [Louisiana], do you remember the name of the street you lived on?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I lived on Valence [Street], V-A-L-E-N-C-E--V--I think that's the way you spell it--lived on that street, and I lived on, I lived on two or three streets, Valence, Upperline [Street], U-P-P-E-R-L-I-N-E, lived on that street, and then I think we lived on Cadiz [Street], C-A-D-I-Z.  So we lived on two or three streets when I was in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: So can you describe one of those neighborhoods for me?
Speaker 2: Well, they were shotgun houses.  You know, you go in the front, front room and you can see all the way to the end of the house, you see, and then one bathroom is all there was.  I don't know what the rent was.  It must have been minimal.  Because I wasn't paying any rent in those days, but I know the landlord used to come by every month to pick up the rent.  And she [Smith's mother, Lucille Silliman Ashford] worked for a fellow, a man who I think he started the, the, he was in the banking business.  And he, these trucks that go around and the banks to pick up cash and take it--I think he was in on that.  And so she worked for him for a number of years, until we got ready to leave there and come to Denver [Colorado].  He had a little boy whose name was Bruce [Bruce Barrett (ph.)], and Bruce was a year or two younger than I was, and we used to play together.  And recently--and strange thing, I've been to New Orleans a number of times since then.  I went to all the Super Bowl games in New Orleans, and, and I would call Mrs. Barrett [ph.].  That was the lady she worked for.  And I'd have a nice chat with her, and I'd say, "How can I reach Bruce?"  She'd tell me, and she gave me his phone number.  I'd call.  He never would return my calls, never would accept my calls.  And I found out that when I was in the [U.S. military] service at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], I went down to New Orleans on a few occasions, and I went by to see Ms. Barrett.  My mother always told me to go by and see Ms. Barrett.  Went by to see Ms. Barrett and in my uniform of course, and she would marvel at the fact that I was in the, in the service, and I was an officer and all that sort of thing.  And she told Bruce about it.  Well, Bruce hadn't done too well in school, and he was envious and jealous of the fact that, fact that I had done better than he had done.  So anyway, I never did get a call from him, and I used to, used to--that's where I learned how to, how to, how to play golf a little bit, not as well as I ended up playing.  But anyway, Bruce's daddy was a golfer, and I used to go out and caddy for him in, in the morning.  And, but Bruce never did, he never did want to see me too well, too much after I had left and moved to Denver.
Story_ID: 483143
Speaker 1: When you look back over the time you spent in New Orleans [Louisiana], what, what sights, sounds or smells remind you of New Orleans in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, there was park there called Audubon, Audubon Park [New Orleans, Louisiana], and it was--I read about it occasionally right now.  And it was a sight that I remember because it was, it was out of the black neighborhood, and it was well kept.  In those days you see, black neighborhoods were not kept at all.  As a matter of fact, they weren't paved, streets weren't paved.  See, the streets in the white neighborhoods were all paved, you know.  But in the black neighborhoods you could have a great big rain, great big rain, and, and the streets were just as muddy and, and cars were getting stuck in the mud and all that sort of thing.  So I, I can remember Audubon Park, and then I remember a park or two.  See, back in those days, things were much more segregated than they are now.  And New Orleans was a famous sch- a school for black education.  It had three black colleges [HBCUs] there.  It had Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], which was the Catholic school.  It had New Orleans University [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], which was the Methodist school, and New Orleans, and, and Straights College [Straight College; Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] they call it, S-T-R-A-I-G-H-T-S [sic.].  And I don't know what kind of school it was because we used to play them in football and basketball.  But in those days we didn't have gyms, see.  I mean, you, if you played basketball, you had to play it on dirt, see, back out behind the school.  So, I, I played there, played basketball when I came to Denver [Colorado].  But anyway, it was, it was a different kind of society altogether, New Orleans was.  And I didn't, I didn't like the experiences I had down there that much.
Story_ID: 483144
Speaker 1: When you were in New Orleans [Louisiana] were you told how to behave around white people or things you could and couldn't do around white people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Strange thing about that, black people were often very cautious about you getting hurt as a young kid, see.  And they did more of enforcing the, the black segregation than the whites did, see.  In other words, they didn't want the whites taking, hollering at you and threatening to whip your butt and that sort of thing.  So they, they made you, made you help them with the, the practice of segregation, see, because, not because they wanted you to be segregated, because, but they didn't want anybody to hurt them.  And that's the way it was back in those days.  And I can recall when I was in the service, I was, I went down to see my wife [Vivian Robinson Smith] in West, West Virginia, had to change trains in, in Cincinnati [Ohio], and then that Pullman porters, you know, telling you what seat you're supposed to go to.  And I changed planes [sic. trains] in Cincinnati once, and I was walking through the, through the cars trying to get to my seat.  And this black Pullman porter said to me, "Oh, you can't sit here, you can't sit here."  And I said, "What did you say?"  And I, I was mad at him, see.  He said, "Listen, son, don't get mad at me.  I don't want anybody hurting your feelings, you in the service, and I don't want anybody taking advantage of you, and so don't think that I'm trying to hurt you."  And he said to me, "Our day is coming, our day is coming."  I said I, I, I appreciated that, see.  And, but anyway, it, segregation was, that was the game back in those days, and I just hated it.
Speaker 1: And can you--we'll move on, but can you tell me why, what you hate?  You said you just hated it.  What, you hated it because?
Speaker 2: Because of segregation and because they thought that they were better than I was.  And, and I, I didn't, I didn't agree with that at all.  And I'd been tested and I found out that I was a little above average and nothing, not too much.  And I was in my [U.S.] military uniform in Cincinnati when this guy was (unclear), but anyway, I learned in the later years that when they start testing--see, they didn't do too much testing when I was a little boy.  And they didn't start, didn't start the testing programs until, 'til I was a bit more mature.  And I sort of got to finding out that I was testing pretty well, you know, a little above, above average.  And then I don't know why people thinking, you know, you know, that I couldn't do as well as anybody else could do.  So that kind of made an impression on me.  And I said well, I, I don't want to, anybody, anybody thinking because I'm, I'm just so dumb I can't do this, that, or the other, 'cause I think I'm little, little (laughter) above average, see.  And so it, that was the time that I thought that I, I could manage whatever my aspirations were.
Story_ID: 483145
Speaker 1: But, oh you asked me about their, asked me about the--what I wanted to be when I grew up when I was a kid.  I always thought that I wanted to, I always wanted to live well, and I didn't care, you know, as long as it was an honest living.  I didn't care anything other than whether or not it was professional or otherwise.  But anyway, then when I could see role models, I didn't have any role models in my family.  They kept my grandfather [Walter Smith], my, my daddy's father, who was a contractor, he was the only role model that I knew of in my family.  And--
Speaker 2: What about your mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford]?
Speaker 1: My mother was domestic and then all I can say about her is that she was very honest, hard worker.  But she, she could hardly read or write, so she really wasn't a rose model--role, role model to that extent.  And she always preached to me to be honest, which I did, and went--my, my grandfather on my father's side was the only man that made any money in the family.  He had his own farm.  They had the only garage in this town [Clinton, Louisiana].  He had a car and had all these boys who worked for him, you know.  So it, and that was the only role model that I had in those days.
Story_ID: 483151
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You want to speak about your mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] a little bit (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother was a very diligent person, very hardworking and very loyal.  As a matter of fact, when, when she retired, she would say before she retired, the people she worked for passed, they died.  I think the, think the mother died first, left my mother a few thousand dollars.  Mr. Adams [ph.] died later on, two or three years later.  He left her a few thousand dollars.  And they, they were always mindful of the fact that she was such a loyal person and trustworthy that they felt obligated to do something for her, which is what they did.  And aside, aside from that, when I was going to college [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], whenever funds were short, Mr. Adams would lend her money to give to me to pay tuition, see.  So, she, she was a real fine person, my mother was.
Speaker 1: So your mother worked as a domestic for the Adams family--
Speaker 2: Right.  He was the president of the bank downtown.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the bank?
Speaker 2: International, International Trust [International Trust Company, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Now did you ever go to their home?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, I went to their home on many occasions.  They, they had a car they provided for their help.  They had a butler and a, and a, and a maid.  And my mother had a house over here.  And I'll tell you about that too.  Remind me to tell you about it.
Speaker 1: Why don't you tell us now?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that house she had, she had over here, she had bought from a lady, white lady, who had later moved to Phoenix [Arizona].  And she wanted to sell the house.  My mother was renting the house at the time.  And my mother told her she'd like to buy the house, but she didn't have much money, see.  And they weren't making loans then to black people out in this area, see, no place really.  So my mother said, "Well, if you can carry the loan, I'll buy it and I'll give you what money I have to pay down on it."  So she did, and I sent the payments every month to her in Phoenix.  And finally we got the house paid off, and she started buying two or three other houses at the time.  As a matter fact, when she died, she had six pieces of property.  And they accumulated, you know, over the years.  And she, she was very grateful that the people trusted her.  And she did well, and handled that trust very well.
Speaker 1: So your mother at, by her own right, was buying real estate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, she was.
Speaker 1: --and was accumulating property.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So she--where do you think she got that foresight from, that awareness that owning property was, was good to do?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say.  She had friends who didn't do as well as she was do, doing, from the standpoint of buying houses.  So, I can't tell you whether or not how she got that, how she got that phase of her, her life going as well as she did.
Speaker 1: Well, did you have to own property to vote in Colorado at that time, in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was there a poll tax?
Speaker 2: I read about poll taxes, but I don't think we had one in, in Denver.  No, we didn't have it in Colorado I should say.
Story_ID: 483153
Speaker 1: So when you moved to Colorado, go ahead take a--you were in the ninth grade when your mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] decided that you should leave New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Was there a particular incident that moved her away from New Orleans to Denver [Colorado], specific incident?
Speaker 2: I can't think of any, and if so, she didn't tell me what it was, see.
Speaker 1: So do you know why she--I mean you said it before.  Was there any other reason you can think of?  I mean why wouldn't she go to Chicago [Illinois] or Detroit [Michigan] where a lot of black people were going at the time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that amazed me--
Speaker 1: Why did she come to Denver?
Speaker 2: --because of the, the influx--well, the, the, as you pointed out, most black, black people from the South moved to Chicago.  And that, and according to geography, you know, they tend to migrate straight north, you see.  And so most of the blacks who left New Orleans did go to Chicago.  And the only reason why she came here was because she had this friend who had come through here and told her how well blacks were doing in Chicago, and there were a few blacks here.  We, we, all the blacks in Denver knew each other, there were so few.  And she thought this was a good community to live I suppose and decided she'd want to live here, and that's how we, how we came to Denver.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like when you arrived in Denver to go to school here in the ninth grade?
Speaker 2: I was, I was very surprised.  I'd been reading all these books about Zane Grey and Buffalo Bill, and I was surprised I didn't see buffalos running up and down the streets, see (laughter).  Anyway, I enjoyed that.  And I blended in real well with the neighbors.  You know, I don't whether or not you may have noticed this (unclear) one community to the other, you, you have to have a fight or two and beat your opponent to be (unclear) see (laughter).  So I was accepted by my friends in those days, and then we went to the same school.  So--
Speaker 1: What school did you go to here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Manual High School [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Emmanuel High School?
Speaker 2: Manual, M-A-N-U-E-L--U-E-L or A-L?  Anyway, went that high school, and I didn't, I did, didn't play basketball there to any great extent, but when I went to college [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] I did, see.  But it was, it was a good move.  She made some good decisions.  She didn't, too well in school, didn't, didn't have too much of a scholastic background, but she, a wonderful person.

Speaker 1: Well, I was gonna tell you about in Clinton [Louisiana], I, as I told you, I went, during the summer months I went from New Orleans [Louisiana] back down to Clinton where my [maternal] grandmother lived and messed around on the farm.  And they could see that I wasn't, that I wasn't gonna be a good hand at the farm.  And, but my uncle, uncle there always took me with him when he left the farm and went, went out anyplace.  And so when, when the cotton, when the vat, when the wagon was full--I don't know whether it's five hundred pounds to a bale or cotton or not.  But anyway, when, when my uncle knew when, when the bag and--when the wagon was full that, that it was time to take it to the gin, see, to get it, get it baled up.  And so, once we went to the gin and I was playing with this little white boy, he called me a nigger.  I took the whip off the wagon, and I whipped him.  And I want you to know that that night two or three white guys came out to my grandmother's house, "Ada [Ada Silliman], where's the nigger from the city?"  And she said, "Well, he's not here.  He's, he's, he's gone back to New Orleans."  And if they looked, they didn't find me, see, 'cause I was gone (laughter).  And I was wondering what they would have done if the, with the, if, you know, if I had been there.  But that was one inc- incidents that I'm familiar, I'm familiar with.
Speaker 2: Well, you kind of know what they would have done because, you know, it was pretty common (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in the South--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at the time.  And your uncle had been killed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, this was another uncle, but this was the uncle on my father's [Henry Smith] side.  And I think this, this uncle was on my mother's [Lucille Silliman Ashford] side.  But in those days, you know, you, you had to work hard, and you had to overcome all kinds of handicaps, and black people learned how to do it.  I mean they--I don't think my grandmother had more than fifty dollars a year.  The man who owned the farm where she worked had a store right, right down the, right down the street.  All the roads were dirt back in those days.  And so whenever we had, had to buy anything in the store that we didn't raise--we raised everything, you know, she'd send me down the street to this store to get it, see, and walked, of course, didn't have a bicycle or anything like that.  And so, and he'd put, mark it down on the book or something, whatever it was that I bought.  And at the end of the year, when they got to totaling up everything, they could say, you know, they didn't say that you could do the math--you can figure, said that--when they figured up everything, he'd say, "Well Ada, you didn't do too well this year.  You, you didn't quite make enough to pay me what, what, what you owed, but we'll go ahead and extend it on for the next year."  So that, that's the way things were back in those days.  And my grandfather [Robert Silliman] on my--who was married to Grandma Ada, had arthritis so bad he couldn't get, he couldn't maneuver at all.  And I'm awfully afraid that I'm gonna be in that same position, 'cause I know I have arthritis myself.  Anyway, and, and you, yeah, you didn't dare dispute whatever the white man said.  So if he said that you, you didn't do quite as well this year, you still owed a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars, whatever it was, you didn't, you didn't dispute, see, because if you did, you know, it was the wrong thing to do.  So I, it wasn't many years later that I learned that I didn't want to live like that.  And--
Speaker 2: Had you seen black people living in a different way, a way that you wanted to aspire to live like?
Speaker 1: Well, my, my grandfather [Walter Smith] on my daddy's side who was a contractor, he lived different than Grandma Maggie [Maggie Smith].  That was his wife.  She lived a different way and had a better life than Grandma Ada had 'cause she had this husband who had a skill.  And so, and, and she a nice family, you know, with boys around the house.  That, you know, have you ever seen wells, where they pump the water out of wells?  And she always, always kept a nice, a nice bucket for the well, for the well water and, and everything so clean and neat.  And I enjoyed that, so that inspired me to an extent.
Story_ID: 483155
Speaker 1: To move back to when you were in, in high school [Manual High School] in, in Denver here, Denver, Colorado, the, when you were going to school here, what were the nei- where did you live?  What street did you live on here in Denver (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I lived, when we first got here, this is a strange story.  You're talking about courageous women, my mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] was very courageous.  She was on the train, she and I were, coming to Denver.  She didn't know where she was gonna stay when she got here.  And so she talked to the porter on the train and asked him whether or not when we get to Denver did she, did he knew any place that she could rent.  So, so he told her about his mother who had some, some rental properties.  So he said he, he had, the porter gave her, my mother, the address and everything.  And that's, she had a vacancy.  So we, we moved in her place, and we stayed here.  That was on Ogden Street.  We must have stayed in her place, we moved from there to, we moved from there to another place, and I can't remember the name of the street.  Anyway, and then, then we, she, she got to buying these properties, and she, we lived in two or three of her places.  As a matter of fact, when I came out of the service in World War II [WWII], I moved in one of her places, Vivian [Vivian Robinson Smith] and I did.  And it, it was nice.  It was the kind of places available to blacks in those days.  The black--in those days they had restrictive covenants.  You know what they are?
Speaker 1: No, sir.
Speaker 2: Restrictive coven-, covenants was you sign a covenant and agreement when you buy a house that you will not sell it when you sell to black people.  And so they had all kinds of restrictive covenants here in Colorado, in Denver.  And you could--you couldn't live any place, you know, where they didn't have restrictive covenants, so that created problems.  The [U.S.] Supreme Court declared restrictive covenants un, un, unenforceable, and so they finally went, went out the window [after Shelley v. Kraemer, 1948].
Story_ID: 483156
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-three [1933].
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) high school of '33 [1933].  And then--
Speaker 1: You decided--how did you, how did college come about for you?  Was it something you've always (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, down in the Gilbert Academy [New Orleans, Louisiana] I think I told you that they'd had all kinds of black colleges [HBCUs] in new, in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Anyway, down in Gilbert, when I was down there, I met some people who I read, later read about in the paper called Chicago Defender.  That was a famous black newspaper.  And I had been reading about them, and they had come to Denver [Colorado] and had done well, and, and found out that they had gone to school in Arkansas.  So I said well, I, maybe I'll try to go to school down there if I go to college, see.  And that's how I happened to go to Arkansas State [sic. Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  And didn't--
Speaker 1: So let me get this straight.  You went to Arkansas State because you read about people having gone there in the Chicago Defender?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What was the story in the Chicago--what did the story say about the--
Speaker 2: Well, any kind of newscast and any kind of sports story, and it was always written up in Chicago Defender.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, had you talked with your mom [Lucille Silliman Ashford] about you going, your mother about you going to college?  Did she know that--
Speaker 2: Well, she hadn't, we hadn't spoke too much about. She, she just knew that if I wanted to go, that she was gonna try to help me, see.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, why did you want to go?  Who had you seen go that made you desire to go?
Speaker 2: I wanted to go because I said I always wanted to live well.  I wanted to live well.  I, I wanted to provide well for my family.  And if I had kids, I wanted, I wanted them to grow up and do well, and that's, that was my motivation.
Speaker 1: So you go out--go ahead, take a drink.
Speaker 2: I, I was gonna say I had, I had seen a lot of poverty, and I wanted to avoid as much poverty as I possibly could.  And I thought that if anybody else could do well, I could do well too, and that inspired me.  And, and I had tend to have friends who had the same kind of opinion about life, and things seemed to fall in line, see.
Story_ID: 483157
Speaker 1: So what year did you actually start Arkansas State [sic. Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Thirty-three [1933].  I finished high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] in '33 [1933], and I, I, I finished in June of '33 [1933] here in Denver [Colorado], high school.  And seems to me like in September it was I started going down to Arkansas State College.  And I can recall--I only went down there two years, when I first went down there, I got down there early 'cause I was gonna go for football.  But I didn't play football in high school, see--got down there early and I had worked at the hotel, Brown Palace Hotel [Brown Palace Hotel and Spa] here in Denver.  And I had my own registration money and got to gambling before school started and lost all my money, see (laughter), lost all my money.  I didn't know what to do.  I was desperate, so I was gonna go, I was gonna go--come back home.  And instead I, I had a friend whose name was Punky Smith [ph.], and he gave me a start and borrowed me some money.  And finally I got on my feet and got enough to register, see.  And he just recently died.  He's a famous athlete, very, very famous.  His name was Adolphus, Adolphus Smith [ph.], but we all called him Punky Smith.  And I'll tell you, if he'd lived in these current, in this current time, you're talking about super athlete, he would have been one, very fine fellow.  He ran--you ever--I'm sure you wouldn't know anything about [HistoryMaker] Gale Sayers.  Gale (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I knew Gale Sayers.
Speaker 2: You know the name?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Gale Sayers, Sayers went to school at Kansas [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas], black guy and a super All-American running back and this guy, Smith, who was my roommate at Arkansas, was just the way Punky Smith was.  And, and down through life you'll see that multiply so many times.  So many real good black athletes who didn't get a chance to, to perform because, you know, things were segregated then, see.  And I think about Punky quite often.  His son came through.  His son is a lawyer in Cleveland [Ohio], and they came through here.  I think the son was getting or had gotten married and was going on a honeymoon or something.  And Punky told him to be sure to stop at my friend's house, Dave Smith [HistoryMaker David A. Smith], and so he did.  We had a nice little chat.  Vivian [Vivian Robinson Smith] and I were on our way to Las Vegas [Nevada], and, but then he came in.  We, we went out to lunch together.  Very fine young man, and he died recently, maybe a couple of years ago, the son did--I mean the, Punky did.  And Punky's wife was Verna Mae, Verna Mae Smith [ph.], and she just loved Punky (laughter).  And they used to say, when we played teams like, we played teams like Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] and New Orleans [sic. Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and various other black colleges [HBCUs]--in those days you didn't have much of a grandstand for black colleges playing football.  And they tell the story that, that if we were behind and needed the touchdown, we get Verna, place her behind the goal post (laughter), tell Punky, "Come to me, baby," (laughter) and she would--and he'd make a touchdown, see.  So we used to laugh about that.  But he was a, he was a super athlete, and I often envied him, you know, what, what a, what, what a good athlete he was.  And as I said, I got a call, I got a call a couple years ago, maybe not quite that long, from his son telling me that Punky was dead.  Punky was a very fine individual and--
Speaker 1: Well, when you guys were at Arkansas together, in Arkansas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's where, that's where we were.
Speaker 1: --where, where, where is, what city is Arkansas--
Speaker 2: Pine Bluff.
Speaker 1: Pine Bluff.
Speaker 2: Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  That's, that's where this town, that's where the city is.
Speaker 1: And did you--and, and what did you major in when you were--
Speaker 2: I majored in economics and sociology.
Speaker 1: Why those two things?
Speaker 2: Why what?
Speaker 1: Why, why did you major in those two things?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I liked figures, and, and I, I thought I could handle it better than I could anything else, see.  I, I thought that, I figured, handle money (laughter), some of it, (unclear) some would stick to my hand, see.
Story_ID: 483158
Speaker 1: Well what did your mother think about what you were doing?  Because you were probably the first person in the family to go to college, correct?
Speaker 2: She wasn't in a position to give me much advice, except the fact she wanted me to, wanted me to be honest and be able to make a good living.  And that's about all, 'cause she didn't know, she didn't know much about anything else, except that she wanted to own some, some, some income herself.  And so she just wanted me to be able to do well and live well.  Yeah, she was a wonderful person.  She lived to be a 100--not 100 but 97 years old, I think.  I think she lived to be 97, 97, 98 years old, and she--
Speaker 1: So--go ahead.
Speaker 2: She lived in, in the house that, house that she bought, bought when I was going to high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado].  I was gonna tell you about this, this lady who liked my mother so well, and she owned this house that we were rented.  And she said, "Lucille [Lucille Silliman Ashford], I like you, and you seem honest.  I, if you want to buy this house and got any kind of a down payment, I'll, I'll trust you.  And you make a payment every month, and we can, we'll see what we can work out," so she did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it all worked out.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 483159
Speaker 1: At Arkansas [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], you, you, you were at Arkansas for two years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened after you left Arkansas State College [sic.]?
Speaker 2: I took a job down in Brown Palace Hotel [Brown Palace Hotel and Spa, Denver, Colorado] as a shoeshine boy.
Speaker 1: Where was that hotel?
Speaker 2: Brown Palace is downtown.  It was one of the elite hot- hotels for many years here in Denver [Colorado].  And I took a job down there and worked in the barbershop and cleaned the barbershop, cleaned the spittoons, and mopped the floor, washed the window, did all those menial tasks, and did that for a year.  Then I got, see, enough money to go with my mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford], what my mother provided for me to go to West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  So I went there, and as I said, I liked that better than, better than Arkansas State because it was a little higher scale than Arkansas State was.  At West Virginia State they had a menial, a program at, very menial, and it, it, it, it was mostly that where you could, you could learn how to do menial tasks.  They had, they had courses in agriculture at Arkansas State, and they didn't have it West Virginia State, see, and nothing I wanted to do in agriculture, see.  Anyway, and it had fraternities and sororities.  And they had, it had a better curriculum than they had at Arkansas State.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you major in, in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Economics, economics (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Economics.  And what was the name of it, West Virginia State?
Speaker 2: Which is, it is now West Virginia University [sic. West Virginia State University].  See, that's another thing.  That's a movement that Arkansas State is now called Arkansas University, and, and that conversion was made a couple of years ago.  And I got all kinds of literature from people who had gone to school out in Arkansas and also West Virginia that our college's new name is West Virginia University, and our college new name is Arkansas University at Pine Bluff, and West Virginia University, West, West Virginia University at the Institute of West Virginia.  So they took great pride in that, and I guess maybe they, the, the white folks learned a lesson that, that you don't have to have all the separation anymore.  We can just get together and see what we can work out.
Story_ID: 483160
Speaker 1: So when you graduated West Virginia--
Speaker 2: Graduated from West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year?
Speaker 2: --and came back to Denver [Colorado], and--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1938, 1938.  So I got friends who had, all of us had left Denver and go on down to West Virginia State College, and we're graduating.  And we tried all over the country, and this was during the Depression [Great Depression], to get a job, and we couldn't get any jobs.  So two, two or three of us said well, let's go get a master's degree (laughter).  So we went back to school, University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], and, and got master's degrees and then tried to get jobs.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: What did you get your master's degree in?
Speaker 2: Economics.  And so we did that and, and came back, and got out of school at University of Denver and still couldn't get any jobs.  Depression was just terrific.  And so I took a job as a, as a dining car waiter at Union Pacific Railroad, and I waited tables on the dining car that summer as long as I could.  But back in those day, in those days, they had railroad business and passenger business wasn't as good much longer than the summer.  So, I didn't have any seniority.  They started laying off people that didn't have any seniority, and of course, I was one of the first to go.  And I was laid off, and I took a job around down at hotels and motel, and finally, finally got a job, I got a job, let me see, what did I do when I got through with that now?  It seems to me like I took, took a job in Arkansas, Vivian [Vivian Robinson Smith].  That's where it was.
Speaker 1: So we'll pause (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not Arkansas, I took a job at West Virginia.
Story_ID: 483161
Speaker 1: We came back to Denver [Colorado]--I mean I was in Denver.
Speaker 2: So this is 1940 you completed your master's [degree].
Speaker 1: That's right, and I wrote letters to a number of black schools [HBCUs] down south and wasn't able to get a job.  So this other friend of mine, whose name is Hooks Jones [Hubert L. Jones], was dating a girl, and she was a West Virginia girl, as my wife [Vivian Robinson Smith] was.  And so they said, "Well, let's go to, to West Virginia and maybe get a job down there," see.  Hooks' parents had, had given him a car for graduation at the side, so we piled in his car and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who all piled into the car?
Speaker 1: Hooks Jones and Jane [ph.] his wife.  Vivian was, she, she already had a roundtrip ticket.  She had come to my graduation from the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado], so she had a roundtrip ticket, so she didn't go in the car with us from here back to West Virginia.  Got down there, and this was the, one of the first terms of Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], who was the president of the United States, see.  And so I got down there, and I didn't have a job.  So I ran into one of my professors [from West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, Virginia].  I had been his assistant.  And he asked what was I doing, and I told him what I was doing.  I wasn't doing anything, doing anything.  I was working at Elk's Rest [ph.] serving two meals a day and of course getting two meals a day for myself, and, and that's about all I was doing. He said, "Well, come on down to the headquarters and I can see what we work out for you."  So we, I got down to headquarters.  It's a black headquarters, see.  And he said, "Tell you what you do, if you can write a couple of articles for this black newspaper, if our candidate is elected, I'll see that you get a job," see.  So I did, and, and, and that, this candidate was both, it was a national election and, and also Neely [Matthew M. Neely] was running for election here in, in--I mean in West Virginia.  So I wrote these articles, and, and Neely was elected the senator, governor of West Virginia, and that's how I got started down there.
Story_ID: 483162
Speaker 1: But anyway, let me tell you this very unique feature.  Neely [Matthew M. Neely] was the, Neely was a, a United States senator from West Virginia.  He resigned from his senate to run as the governor of, of, of West Virginia, which was very unusual, to, to resign a senate seat, U.S. Senate seat to run for the governorship.  Anyway, that's just what he did.  And so he was elected governor of, of West Virginia at that time, and it still is I think.  West Virginia was a strong union state.  I mean John L. Lewis, who was the head of the United, United Mine Workers [United Mine Workers of America], always was dictated what, what it, what the governor did, and that's what that happened then 'cause he told the governor he had a program that he wanted to work out for the State of West Virginia.  And he couldn't do it unless he got the, unless, unless, unless the governor was, was in his hands, you see.  And so, anyway, Neely was elected president, I mean senator, I mean governor.  He was elected governor of West Virginia.  And when he was elected governor, Ms. Hewitt [ph.], who was his, who was his sit- main employee in the office, he, she, she told, he told, he told her to, he had to hire, he had to have a messenger in the office when he was, when he was seated as, as governor.  And so they took me over to the governor's office to talk to see whether or not they would give me this job as a messenger.  Now I had finished school down there [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia].  I had finished the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 2: You had your master's [degree] at this time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.  So as his administrative assistant, was Ms. Hewitt, a very fine lady.  As a matter of fact, I think was a Quaker.  She was from Pennsylvania.  Quakers had the reputation of being very liberal people.  And anyway, so I was taken over to see the governor.  I didn't see the governor.  I saw Ms., Ms. Hewitt, and she interviewed me and found out what I could do and what I was capable of doing and everything.  Then I [sic.] said, "Now I'll tell you what you do," said, "We're gonna hire you and here's what these things you have to do in the office," see.
Speaker 2: But they were interviewing you to possibly do like a janitorial job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, yeah.  That's when she told me, says, "We'll, we'll inter- we'll give you this job, but these is what your duties are," and was, one was the janitorial work, see.  And so I said, "Well, Ms. Hewitt, I'm now working at the Elks Rest [ph.].  I'm getting two meals a day, and I know this is Great Depression and so forth, but I think I can do better than, than cleaning up the office."  And I said, "I want to get started on something in line with, with, with my, with my degree."  So she said, "Okay," says, "I'll talk to the governor."  So she talked to the governor, and the governor said, "Well, go ahead, give him, let him work in the office."  So, she gave me a job in the office.
Story_ID: 483163
Speaker 1: And I was going down to the institute [West Virginia State College; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] campus every weekend.  And I found out that fellow named Mr. James [ph.] was retiring, an old gentleman, and there was gonna be a vacancy down at the high school.  The high school was right across the street from the college in West Virginia, see.  And so I found out that he was retiring.  So I talked to Ms. Hewitt [ph.], and I told her that Mr. James was retiring down at the institute, and I think I could do that job, and I'd like to, like to get it.  And she said, "Okay," says, "I'll see that you, see that you get it.  We hate to lose you here in the office."  But I'd only been there for a year.  "But if that's what if you want, that's what you'll get it."  So anyway, I got a letter, the president, Ms. Hewitt got a letter off to--Ms. Hewitt said to him that she had a young man working the office, office, and he had informed her that it was a--now you see the president was--I mean the, the governor--the president of this college was also an appointee of, of, of Neely [Matthew M. Neely]--I mean of the ga- Neely, who just, just got elected and whose office I was working in.  So I didn't have much trouble getting that, getting that job because the governor appointed, appointed the man that he was asking to give me a job, see.  So anyway, he gave me the job, and I worked one year there.
Speaker 2: Doing what?
Speaker 1: In the office, running--see, they used to have what they called (unclear) machines and lithographs and all that sort of stuff.  They didn't have that kind of copy work that they have now, copy machines, you see.  And I was doing that and doing a little typing, filing.  And I didn't keep that job for more than a year 'cause that's the, I had that job when I married Vivian [Vivian Robinson Smith], see.  And so they all wished me well when, when I told her I was getting married.  And so I worked at that, worked at that one year.  I came to Denver [Colorado], Vivian and I did.  I had bought a car then.  And I was here, and I heard about this job teaching school, teaching to soldiers out at Lowry Field [Colorado].
Speaker 2: And what year was this then, 1940?
Speaker 1: When was what?
Speaker 2: What year was, what year were you now, 19--
Speaker 1: Nineteen, nineteen forty [1940] is the way, the year I got out of college.  And I, and I--no, I worked around in, in West Virginia for two, couple of years I guess.  And then I, I came home one summer for vacation, Vivian and I did.  This must have been in, this must have been in 1941 or '42 [1942], and came on vacation and found out that they were hiring.  They wanted, looking for some black instructors out at Lowry Field.  And so I applied and got involved in militarily and that sort of thing, and had to go to school when I got, when I got interviewed for this job as instructor at the Lowry Field.  But I finally worked that out and got the job at Lowry Field as instructor, and it wasn't too long after that that I went in the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 2: How long after that?  I mean I know you--was it--in 1943 you had your first daughter.  Your daughter was born.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: No, now, Sharon [Sharon Smith Daniels] was born when I was in the service.  Sharon was born.  Vivian was pregnant.  Sharon was born two or three months after I was in the service.
Story_ID: 483164
Speaker 1: So were you drafted or you knew that they would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, let me say I, I was working at the military base [Lowry Field, Colorado] as a civilian, and I, I had an exemption.  I could have stayed on that job and not go in the service at that time.  But I was, I was afraid of taking orders the way I was given orders.  And I knew that I was gonna be drafted eventually.  All my friends were going in the service, and I said well, I just might as well go ahead now as to rather than wait 'til later.  And that's, I went down to the draft board.  I told them to cancel my exemption and then draft me whenever, whenever they wanted to get around to it, and that's just what happened.  So we went to--this fellow, my friend of mine and I went down there and got our, our exemptions, lift it, and, and they called us in the service.
Speaker 1: And then when did you, when did you go down to Alabama to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, I went down to--when I was called in the service, I went to Jefferson, Jefferson field [Jefferson Barracks Military Post, Lemay, Missouri], and then you--St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, for my basic training.  That's where they run you through all the, all the things that you should know about schools and that sort of--how to salute and how to do all these various things.  I was, I was sent to Jefferson Field for that.  And from there I, from there I went to OCS [Officer Candidate School].  I was in, I was in, I was in St. Louis at Jefferson Field, and I was, I had, I was doing basic training.  And I was in a, in, in the--I forgot what they call that room.  Anyway, and I got a call from, from my headquarters stating that you, you, "It's been requested that you go to OCS, Officer Candidate School."  And oh, I said, "Oh, is that right?"  I hadn't applied, hadn't applied, see.  So they said, "Yes, we have checked the school, checked the, the, the records, you have to, you've qualified."  In those days, you have to make, make 110 on the AGCT, an Army General Classification Test.  You had to make at least 110 or above to be qualified to go to Officer Candidate School.  So I had done that, and so they, they said, "So you apply and, and next class opens down there, we'll, we'll send you down there."  So I applied.  I went down there.  I'll tell you this, I went down there, and it was in, it was in Miami Beach, Cal- Florida [Miami Beach Training Center, Miami Beach, Florida].  And so first time the class was ready for, accept new students down there at that time, I was selected and this friend of mine whose name was James Gasgon [ph.].  He's also from Denver [Colorado], and he and I both were selected.  It was seven of us who were selected to go to this class, this school, two blacks and white, and five whites.  And so one of the whites was a corporal, and so he was placed in charge of this detail 'cause I was a, I was a PFC [private first class], and Jim was PFC also.  So we got on a train and we changed planes [sic. trains] in Jacksonville, Florida.  And the guy who was in charge was dead drunk, and we had to throw him on the, on, on the luggage carrier.  And, and he said that--I mean he, he wasn't able to talk or anything.  We had to, we had to protect him, you know.  We had to be in charge of ourselves.  So anyway, we got down to Florida and reported to the TAC officer [training, advising and counseling officer], who was, who was a TAC officer for the squad and the group we were gonna be assigned to.  And he said, "Where are you from?"  I don't know whether he said can- I don't know whether he said soldier, or officer candidate, or whatever he said.  I told him I was from Denver.  "One thing I want you to know right now is this is a white man's school.  And you do, do what you're told to do, and abide, abide by all his rules," and says, "You--we'll put this bar on your soldier and, on your sold- on your shoulder, and you'll get your bars and to be a second lieutenant."  So I, I gave him a salute, did an about face, and Gas, Gasgon was be right behind me.  So I went out and I told Gasgon, I said, "Listen, when you get in there," I said, "don't blow your top.  This guy is gonna tell you this is a white man's school and, and, and there's nothing for you to do here but try to follow orders, see."  So (laughter), so anyway, anyway, we went, we got through all of that.
Speaker 1: Did he say the same thing to him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, said the same thing to him.
Story_ID: 483165
Speaker 1: So we went through all of that, and that's when we were assigned to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  There had, there had been lots of political pressure put on the politicians to what of our, what of our, what do you do with our black soldiers and our black boys, churches and, and schools and so forth, and pressure had been put on, on politicians.  So I didn't know this at the time.  They had decided that, that the 99th Pursuit Squadron, which was a black flying outfit, had done so well that they ought to have a bomber squadron, see, which is what I was placed in.  And so the, they, the word went out that we, we had, needed to find enough troops to man a black squadron--I mean a black group.  So they called it the 477th bomber group [477th Bombardment Group; 477th Fighter Group].  And so we were, got in the serve, we got in the service just in time for them to start manning that outfit.  And that's the reason why we were sent to Tuskegee.  We were sent Tuskegee to get the help, man that outfit.  And we stayed at Tuskegee for a period of time, until we were assigned to a school called Godman, Godman field [Godman Army Airfield, Kentucky] or base, Godman Field, Kentucky and until they got that, got that all lined up.  And that's where we all went there to Godman Field, Kentucky and to try to form a, a bomber group, 477th Bomber Group.  And, and we, we worked on that until such time as we had all the racial problems down there.
Speaker 2: What racial problems did you have?
Speaker 1: Well, Godman Field was right across the street from Fort Knox [Kentucky].  Fort Knox was a famous base for tanks and so forth.  And we had white officers at the Fort Knox, supposed to be training officers training us.  And, and we had, and we had black officers there, and we had mostly black enlisted men.  So when we went, when we were at Godman Field, the white officers went to Fort Knox to, for relax, relaxation, see.  And they had a little officers' club there for blacks.  So the, the brass in Washington [D.C.] decided that Fort--I mean that Godman Field was inadequate, you know, the, for the kind of training we needed.  And so they decided that they should move us to another base so we could get better training.  So the other base was Freeman Field, Indiana [Freeman Army Airfield, Jackson County, Indiana].  They moved us from Godman Field, Kentucky, to Freeman Field, Indiana, and that's where we're gonna get all this additional training.  Well, at Godman Field, as I said, it was manned all by, by black officers mainly; had white training officers there who were supposed to be training us.  We found out that they had not gone to all these different school, schools that we'd been going to.  They didn't know what to do with us.  They didn't want to send us to white, white, white schools 'cause there was no integration in the service then, see.  And, and they sent us to these white schools, military schools, and they didn't want us, they didn't want any blacks going to those schools.  So they didn't know what to do with us, military see, so they kept sending us from one school to the other.  And--
Speaker 2: How many people were in this group at the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, there must have been two hundred--
Speaker 2: Wow, okay.
Speaker 1: --two hundred blacks.  And a bunch of them were black pilots, you know, and black, black people who were, had been to all these different schools, quartermaster and intelligence schools.  We'd been, we'd been sent to adjutant, adjutant training schools, and we just got from one school to the other.
Story_ID: 483166
Speaker 1: And so the order came down to go, that, that Godman [Godman Army Airfield, Kentucky]--I mean that Freeman Field, Indiana [Freeman Army Airfield, Jackson County, Indiana] was a school, was a school where, was adequate for the kind of training we needed.  So we packed up and gonna ship off to Freeman Field, Indiana.  We found out that the, that the, the white personnel at Godman Field had gone to Freeman Field before we got there and put signs on the buildings various buildings, you know, that we didn't know about, officers' club number one, officers' club number two.  And (laughter), they didn't want, they didn't, they didn't want to ming- mingle with us, you see, on the time we were relaxing.  So we got up there and the enlisted men were teed off because they had taken the, the, the enlisted men sign off the regular enlisted men and made, called that, and called that officers' club number two, that was black officers, see.  And so, but we got up there, and my commanding officer was a Texan from, he was the major, white fellow.  He said--no, what happen was one night we went to the officers' club.  And the black, the black enlisted personnel wouldn't serve me, and I wanted to know why.  He said, "Well, Major So and So and So said we can't serve any black officers in, in here at all."  I said, "Well, the hell with that.  I'm here to give my life like he's here to give his life, and I'm, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna have it any other way."  So anyway, next night, I, I went in, so next, next night--
Speaker 2: How did the first night end?
Speaker 1: First, first night end that I went in.  I went in after he tried to stop me, see.  So the next night, I went back again, and the MP [military police] was there at the, at the, at the door.  And he said, "I can't let you in here."  I said, "Why not," and so he told me.
Speaker 2: And what was his reason?
Speaker 1: His, his commanding officer told him not to let us in, see.  So anyway, I went back to the, my out, to my outfit.  That next day, there was a, a great big meeting at one of the squadron's offices.  And everybody on the base was requested to go except the white personnel were not impressed to go.  And it's, at this meeting, there was a letter had been written by, by the commanding officer of the, of the base who said that, that certain buildings on this campus, I mean on this base, that, that are not available to all personnel on this base, and one of them is such and such, one of them, that was the officers' club, see.  And one of them is not available to all candidate--all of personnel on this base.  It didn't say blacks here and couldn't go, or whites, you know, had to go or did anything. So anyway, I read it, and there was paragraph that says I've read the above, fully understand and will comply.  And then you, you, you're supposed to sign that, see.  So my off- my commanding officer was a major.  He went over there and said, "Okay, if you understand, says you have to sign right here."  So I didn't sign.  I said, "No, I'm not gonna sign it."  He wanted to know why, and I told him.  And--
Speaker 2: What did you tell him?  You didn't, you're not signing this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I told them that I didn't, I didn't think that it was a proper order and that I wasn't gonna sign it, see.  So it turned out that 101 of those black officers had refused it.  I didn't know it.  I, I didn't know, you know, that they would all stand the way I stood.  But anyway, I said, "No, I'm not gonna sign it."  And so he says, "Lieutenant Smith [HistoryMaker David A. Smith], I'm giving you a direct order.  You sign this communication, and that's an order."  So I said, "Major, I'm not gonna sign it."  I was fully aware of the fact that I was gonna be arrested, you know, and put in--and so I was arrest, arrested for--arrested in quarters.  I refused a direct order, and that's the reason why that was a charge against me.
Story_ID: 483167
Speaker 1: So anyway, I was placed under arrest in quarters.  My wife [Vivian Robinson Smith] was calling every night to Washington, D.C.  We had a friend who was, we had a fellow who was at West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] who was an instructor.  He was all--by that time, he was an assistant.  Mr. Evans [ph.] was--what was Mr. Evans, Sharon [Sharon Smith Daniels]--I mean Sylvia [Sylvia Smith Jackson]--I mean Vivian?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Secretary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was secre- he was work--secretary of defense office, Mr. Evans was, and he was, he was, he's been a teacher, teacher at West Virginia State College when we were students there.  So, Vivian was calling him at night, and, and she was upset and thinking that I was gonna be sent to Leavenworth penitentiary [United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Leavenworth, Kansas] for refusing this direct order.  And so finally he told Vivian that there's gonna be some officers, three officers coming down from Washington to interview all of, all of us who had refused to sign these orders, see.
Speaker 2: Now let me just--were you the only one arrested or all hundred were arrested?
Speaker 1: No, all hundred, a hundred and one of us were arrested.  But I didn't know that there was gonna be any kind unanimity at the time, see.  And so I thought that I, that, that, I thought that, you know, they're gonna, gonna hang me (unclear) see.  But anyway, I--
Speaker 2: So there were three officers coming down.
Speaker 1: Well no, from my base [Freeman Army Airfield, Jackson County, Indiana], from my, from my outfit, there were twenty some of us.
Speaker 2: I know, but you said that, that, that you were, you were waiting.  You, you--Vivian had called, had been making these calls to Washington that night.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they said hold on.  Somebody's coming down.  Is that what was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He said, that, that, "We're gonna send some people down there from Washington, and we gonna--," you, you--said, "David's [HistoryMaker David A. Smith] gonna be interviewed."  So, that's what they did.  They sent these three officers down there, one full colonel and two lieutenant colonels.  You know the difference, don't you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A lieutenant colonel is, is, is, is, is one rank less than a full colonel, and he has, the lieutenant colonel has the bar, bars on his--I mean a colonel has bars on his shoulder, and a lieutenant colonel has a little different kind of signature on his shoulder.  So they came down and went up, went up to be interviewed.  And we had to go up in formation.  We, there were twenty-seven some odd of us, more, more than that than, 'cause we were, we were a hundred of--a hundred and one of us refused to sign that order.  So when it was my time to go to be interviewed, the--I, I, I should have gone to one of the lieutenant colonels to be interviewed, but the sergeant in charge of detail says, "What's your name?"  I told him I was Lieutenant Smith.  He says oh, says, "You wait, says the full colonel wants, want to interview you."  So I said, "Oh, Lord, they're gonna try to hang this whole rap on me," see.  So anyway, I was go--I went in to be interviewed and to be interviewed by the full colonel.  And he asked me a bunch of questions.  And he says, "What is your rank?" "Lieutenant," I told him.  He says, "How many men you have under you?"  I said, "I have one up, one officer and, and, and five enlisted men."  "What would you do," he said, "if you gave a direct order to these men, and, that, that was in your outfit, gave them a direct order, and they failed to comply?"  I told him that I would be very upset and that I would try to take political act- I mean to, military action against them.  "Well, that's what these people did."  I says, "Well, I, I, I, I didn't think that order was given to me was a legal order."  "Why didn't you think it was legal?"  I said, "Well, because it was based on race, politics, religion, and I think those kind of things are illegal orders."  "Race, politics, religion, religion," he said.  I said, "Yes, sir."  And he says--asked me a few more other questions and I was released to go back to my squadron.  And so they interviewed all of us, and they went back to Washington.  And within a day or two when they got back to Washington we were all released from arrest in quarters and returned to duty.  But he said that they were going to, they were going to get my record.  There was a record then called 66-2, it was a personnel record.  Everything in your file goes into that personnel record.  And so they went back to Washington and we, we returned to duty, and--
Speaker 2: They got your record.
Speaker 1: That's right, so.
Story_ID: 483168
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were just wrapping up what, what, what happened to you at the court mar- I mean not the court-martial but--
Speaker 2: Well, anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The officers went back.  You got a call three days later saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, what happened was they went back to Washington [D.C.], and I was supposed to talk to the even higher headquarters, secretary of war.  Think his name was Stimson [Henry L. Stimson] then, I think.  Anyway, and, and I guess they reviewed all the information, and the secretary of war must of told that they did, that, drop all the charges and, and, and release us, see, so that's what they did.  And I went ahead and served out my full term.  When Japan dropped the bomb [sic.], we were all given the option of whet- whether or not we want retain and ser- re, re, re, remain in [U.S. military] service or get out.  So I, I, I elected to, to get out of the service.  I'd already served.  And the war [World War II, WWII] is over.  They dropped the bomb.  And, and so we were free to get out of the service if we wanted to or to, to wait until they wanted to discharge us, you see.
Story_ID: 483169
Speaker 1: What did you do after you left the service?
Speaker 2: So let me tell you, so, I left the service.  I told you that I was a instructor at Lowry Field [Colorado].  And that's, that's the service that I was performing when I went in the service.  So I had reemployment rights.  In those days, if, when you go in the service for [U.S.] military, go to the military service from a civilian job, they had to reemploy you.  So I went back to Lowry Field, and they reemployed me.  Meantime, it was politics going on here in Denver [Colorado].  Quigg Newton [J. Quigg Newton] was a fellow that was running for mayor of the City and County of Denver.  He was a liberal.  I enjoyed working for him.  And he, they were, he was running for mayor, and everybody thought he had a good chance of winning, and so I got right in on his campaign, see.
Speaker 1: Doing what?
Speaker 2: On his campaign I was attending meetings at night, you know, political meetings and boosted his candidacy.  And finally he was elected.  And I didn't talk to him personally, but I talked to his campaign manager.  And I told the campaign manager that, what, what, what I had in mind, told him I wanted a liquor license.  And I said that if he could prevail upon the people--the mayor to give me a liquor license that I would appreciate that.  So anyway, he did.  He gave me a liquor license, and I opened a liquor store.  And that was very unusual because they had denied liquor stores for years and years.  They had so many already in the black neighborhoods that, that, that they, they didn't want to bother with it anymore.  So they gave me a liquor license.  I found a store the, the, the mayor--I mean the, the, the, his campaign manager told me, he said, "Now, David [HistoryMaker David A. Smith], I may not be able to help you if you drive at Five Point [Five Points, Denver, Colorado].  We got you a liquor license already on Five Points."  And, and so--
Speaker 1: And Five Points was the black area and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the neighborhood, see.  They had all kinds of liquor license down there.  He said, "So I, if you, if you apply for a liquor license at some other address, I can give you more help than I can otherwise."  So I looked around the neighborhood, and I found a store, a storefront.  And it wasn't the--we didn't have any liquor in it.  And so I talked to the man, the landlord and, and asked him if I got a liquor license would he, would he rent me this, rent me this store, and he says yeah.  So he did, and then I got the les- liquor license, and operated a liquor store there for seven years.  Seven and half years I operated this liquor store.
Story_ID: 483170
Speaker 1: I had a heart attack.
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty [1940] what?  Nineteen forty-seven [1947] or '48 [1948].  I, I think I had--
Speaker 2: Now your daughter, your second daughter [Sylvia Smith Jackson] was born in 1949.  Was this before (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she was, she was born when I had, when I had the liquor store.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you had a heart attack.
Speaker 1: I had a, had a heart attack, and so I decided to sell the store.  So I sold the store, and I started working with my mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] who had two or three rental properties, and decided I, I wanted to try at real estate, see.  So I took some real estate courses and started acquiring real estate myself.
Speaker 2: Buying properties?
Speaker 1: Yeah, buying properties then renting them.  And so that went on 'til a period of time, and I decided--
Speaker 2: How many properties did you end up owning, owning (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did I?  Well, I guess I had twenty-one when I retired.  I must have had, must have had about twelve or fourteen at a time.  And so anyway, I went into real estate, and I decided I wanted to be an appraiser, real estate appraiser.  So I took several courses in real estate appraising.  I took a job as a real estate appraiser for the City and County of Denver [Colorado].  And an added bit of information that I could pick up on, on real estate, real estate appraising.  I, I acquired it and tried to put it into effect.  So finally, I was, I was down at city hall one day, and I saw it on the board, that they were giving examinations for real estate appraisers.  So I said I think I'll try that.  So I went and applied to take the examination, and so I did, and I took the examination.  And there were--I think I was the only black in the class that, that took the examination.  Anyway, I had thought I'd done pretty well in the examination, and, but I didn't hear anything about my score.  And so I finally learned that there were forty something people who had taken the examination and seven, seven was gonna be hired.  And I didn't know whether or not I had scored in the first seven or what, but I, I thought that I had done well on the examination so.  I never did get a call from city hall, see.  And so finally I was down at city hall one day, and I saw, ran into a white fellow who had taken the examination the same time I did.  And I, he and I had a little chat, and I says, I asked him, "How did you do?"  He says, "Oh," says I, says, "I passed it," says, "I'm being examined for the oral examination at such and such a time."  At that time, you take the, you passed the writ- the written, then you take an oral.  And I said okay.  So I, I says, well, something's going on here.  So there was a black politician out here in the Five Points [Denver, Colorado] had pretty, he had pretty good inroads with the city pa- with the city political people, see.  So I went to him and I said--his name was Lawson, Sonny Lawson, black guy.  He have a, had a drugstore [Radio Pharmacy, Denver, Colorado] down on Five Points.  So I said, say, I said, "Sonny," I said, "Now something's going on," said, "I, I, I took the examination for a job as a real estate appraiser, and I haven't heard anything about it.  I wish, won't you check into for me," see.  So, so apparently he checked into it because I got a call at the office, see, and told me to report such and such a time for an oral interview.  So I reported, and they hired me as a real estate appraiser and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For the city?
Speaker 1: For the city, yeah.  And so anyway, I took the job.
Story_ID: 483171
Speaker 1: I worked that job for a year or so.  And I quit the job and went into business for myself [in Denver, Colorado], real estate business, and that, been in business ever since. I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So just--go ahead. I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I start doing fee appraise, appraisal, appraisals.  You see, the VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] and the Federal Housing Administration had to use appraisers to, if you were gonna buy a house under those terms.  And so, anyway, I went down, went down to see them and told them that I was available for fee appraisals and that, and if they want to assign me some work, you know, that I could do, together with running my office (unclear) see.  So I did as much of that I wanted.  And, but I, when I started doing those fee appraisals I was getting twenty-five dollars for each appraisal.  And when I stopped doing them I was getting two hundred dollars for each appraisal, see.  And so I got so--place I was doing so many until it was interfering with my, with my brokerage business, you see.  So, and I was just all kinds of dough rolling in, you know, so I enjoyed that.  And finally when I got to doing so well, I stopped doing those appraisals and, and, and doing (unclear) my brokerage business, see.  So that brings me up to date, and I re- I did that and I retired a couple of years ago.  And, and that's the end of my--I gave the business to Sharon [Sharon Smith Daniels].  And Sharon is doing a good job.  And she, she needs more money than I need so, and she, and she does a good job of giving people good service.
Story_ID: 483172
Speaker 1: So let me just talk about the political climate here in Denver [Colorado] at the time when you were working as a real estate broker, or a, it, it seems like it was very tough for black people to buy property, that they couldn't get loans through the banks.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: How were you doing it?
Speaker 2: Well, they had, I told you they had these restrictions about making loans to black people, letting in authorities in order to control the real estate business, had what they called restrictive covenants.  And they would not lend to any blacks in new areas nor would they encourage any black people from trying to buy real estate in these areas, you see.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: They, they tried to control the real estate business by making loans to black people to buy houses.  And so finally, it got to be such a problem the [U.S.] Supreme Court declared restrictive covenants unenforceable.  So, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that opened the door for--
Speaker 2: That opened the doors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That opened the doors.
Speaker 1: And when did the Supreme Court rule that, make that ruling [Shelley v. Kraemer, 1948]?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: And they must have made that ruling in, that must have been in the early '50s [sic. 1948] perhaps.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I'm gonna just throw out some dates, some historical dates, and, and you can tell me if they affected you or not, what was going on with your personal life at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Like for example, in 1954, Brown v. the Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when the [U.S.] Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal to, for children to--that desegregation should happen.  It should happen now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was happening with, with you here in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Well, Denver was always a bit more liberal than other parts of the country with respect to job opportunities.  And I think we had already, Colorado had already declared restrictive covenants unenforceable.  So, and anyway we had taken care of that problem locally be, be, before the national government did anything about it.  They had already, that, that fight, de-decided that the, decided that they were not gonna try to enforce those restrictions.  So the, and so that was already done here in Colorado.
Speaker 1: Well, in 1955, when Emmett Till was, was, was, was killed in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I didn't hear that.
Speaker 1: When Emmett Till was killed in Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In 1955, and Ebony and Jet magazines ran those stories about it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where were you?
Speaker 2: I was here in Denver.
Speaker 1: How did that, did that, did that have any effect on your life in your--the way--
Speaker 2: Except that I was, I was very humiliated, and very disappointed, and very disgusted, and I was reaffirmed that, that, that something had to be done, and it wasn't gonna be done by just sitting and talking about it.
Speaker 1: What did you think needed to be done?
Speaker 2: I thought that they should have more, the federal govern- federal government should, to play a bigger role and that local governments weren't gonna do as, as much as they should have done until such time as the federal government did more on it.  That's when that, that's when I decided that, that something had to be done a bigger scale than the local government.
Speaker 1: Now were you more in the school of, of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] or Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King.  No, I wasn't, I wasn't as far out as Malcolm X, as Malcolm X was.  I, I, I thought that you had to have, you had to have, you had to have some allies in order to be, have a la- effective legislation.  And I thought that Martin, that Martin Luther, Martin Luther King, his program, we could attract more support from the white community than what we could, could attract from, from the black community--from Malcolm, Malcolm X, even though I approved with what he was doing, and but I thought that, I thought that I would line, I align myself with Martin Luther King.
Speaker 1: Well, who were your allies in the, in the white community when it came to you doing real estate business.
Speaker 2: Well, the, the white politicians were--
Speaker 1: Who were some of the--what were some of their names (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Quigg Newton [J. Quigg Newton], Quigg Newton was the mayor when I, when I was in liquor business.
Speaker 1: Now did you know him personally?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew him personally.  I had done, and, and--I had been on, on parties with him, his, his wife [Virginia Shafroth Newton] and my wife [Vivian Robinson Smith].  And I, I knew him well enough, well enough to ask him a favor, see.  So I thought that I could get him to support Martin Luther King's program better than I could get him to support Malcolm X.
Story_ID: 483174
Speaker 1: When Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in 1968, where were you in Denver [Colorado] and what was happening in your life?
Speaker 2: A very unique experience.  I told you that I was on, I don't think I did tell you this.  I, but, what I want to say is I, I took a job, yes, I did, took a job as real estate appraiser.  I had served that job, and I was in the real estate business at the time.  And I was on the Real Estate Commission [Colorado Real Estate Commission].  See, there's a commission in every state that handles real estate problems, and that's a big job, big job here in Denver and, and also in the state.  So the governor [Richard Lamm] appointed me as real estate commissioner for the whole state of Colorado.  And we met once a month, and at one of these meetings Martin Luther King was assassinated.  So there were five of us on this commission.  The, and the man that we hired to, to run the, the real estate businesses for the State of Colorado came back to me and, and we were--interrupted the meeting, and he said, "Dave [HistoryMaker David A. Smith]," he says, "I've got sad news for you."  He says, "Martin Luther King has been assassinated."  And I was downtrodden.  I just couldn't, couldn't restrain myself, and, and I dropped my head, and I, and I--he was afraid that there'd be some riots.  He, and he thought that anything he could do for me at that time, at that time he was very happy to do it, see.  So anyway, I came home that night and it was, of course, all over TVs and all the radio, radios and things.  And you know what happened after that.  Anyway--
Speaker 1: Did you think there were going to be riots in Denver (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was.  And as a matter of fact, there were riots.
Speaker 1: In Denver?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Denver and in also--
Speaker 1: I know across the country.
Speaker 2: --and, and Washington [D.C.].  See, and, and places were being burned, you know, businesses being burned.
Speaker 1: What was happening here in Denver?
Speaker 2: Same thing, burning--
Speaker 1: In black neighborhoods or--
Speaker 2: In black neighborhoods.  See, and that's the thing that (laughter), that, that, that, that I question.  Anyway, they were burning in black neighborhoods.  And finally I guess the, the main political structure decided that they had to do something about what Martin Luther King was standing for.  Anyway, they, you know the rest of that.  They passed all these bills, legislation.  And when I was, I was right in the middle of it until, but let me tell you about things like that.  The only progress made at that particular time was made by young people.  They, they, they, they were the ones taking all the risks.  Black people my age, you know, they couldn't take the risk.  They had a family to take care of.  They had a house payment to make.  They had a car payment to make.  So they had to determine whether or not they do--want to sacrifice all of that and, and, and, and, and to start burning places themselves or just, or just, you know, just let it go.  So, as I've often said, the more you have and the more you, you have at risk, the more conservative you are, see, because you've got all this stuff that you can lose, you know.  And these young people got nothing to lose, barely had a job they could hold on to, and so they could take all this risk.  And that's what they did, and that, that's, that's the reason why we made as much progress as we made, 'cause the young people took all the risk.
Story_ID: 483175
Speaker 1: Were you encouraging your daughters [Sharon Smith Daniels and Sylvia Smith Jackson] to participate (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, they, they participated, and seems to me like in recent years that they were marching and carrying on, you know, for various issues that may have come up.  But they, they were--they understood that their daddy and their mother [Vivian Robinson Smith] had a hard time doing what they were, what they had done, and, and they needed the kind of support that they could give, see.  It's been a tough struggle, tough struggle, and we--you, you, you, you just had to, had to manifest yourself.  You know, you couldn't sit back at home and feel comfortable with all the, all the, all the things going on and not do anything about it, you see.  I wouldn't, I couldn't have sat in your house and--at my house and, and, and have these young people do all these various things and, and couldn't do anything but contribute money, you see, which is what I did.  And, but eventually it got to the point where I felt that I could live, you know, with what little discriminate, discrimination that I faced, see.  And then, so I, I'm not exactly as I used to be, but I did all that I could during my, during my era, period of time, period that, that I, I had the energy to do it, see.  When you got, when you get in your seventies, you know, you don't, you don't have much energy, see.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, can we ask them just to quiet down?  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: But you see, you're really in a dilemma.  I was considered to be a successful businessman.  But yet, I wanted people to know I was not so successful that, that I'd forgotten about all my other black people, see.  And so I tried to do everything I possibly could, and make contributions, and, and join the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and the Urban League, and various other organizations that had a, had a, a vigorous program on integration, see.  And I've done that, cause I, as I said, I, I, I had come from New Orleans [Louisiana] where I've seen all kinds of terrible things and where people had come to lynch me (unclear) you know, I had, I would, I had escaped you see, so it was, it, it was a terrible thing.  In, in my ninety years I have seen all kinds of discrimination and able to survive, and I thought that I- my mother [Lucille Silliman Ashford] did a, a real wonderful thing when she decided to leave Louisiana.
Story_ID: 483176
Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for in this community [in Denver, Colorado] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanna be remembered the fact that I'm a successful businessman, that I had a successful family, that I was honest and, and trustworthy, and that I ways, always willing to, to help the underdog.
Speaker 1: How do you think you became the first black, or African American, real estate broker in Denver [Colorado] to have a business?
Speaker 2: How did I become successful?
Speaker 1: How do, how do you feel you became the first black to do so?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was the first black because I guess time had come when, when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was, black, black, black people were asserting themselves more than what they were before.  And it didn't cost much money to take the examination.  I think some had taken it and had failed it, and that explains all of it.  You know, I had taken it and passed it.
Story_ID: 483177
Speaker 1: Do you think we still have a long way to go as a, as the black community?  What are your hopes for the black community?
Speaker 2: I'd like the hopes of the black communities to integrate, to integrate.  I know there are black communities that, that think that they could exist, you know, where they don't need the, the white community, but I, I think that's a mistake.
Speaker 1: Why do you feel integration is important?
Speaker 2: Because I think that people are going to assert themselves in such a way that the white community is always gonna the best community, if you separate.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: Why?  Because we don't demand as much as the white community demands, see.  The people who clean my streets, this wasn't done before the white people started moving out here [in Denver, Colorado].  It was done because the, the, the black people started putting pressure on the, on, on the white politicians that you got to do such and such for this street.  And, and we tax, we're pax-taxpayers, and we, you know, we're not gonna stand for you to take, ignore the black community.  So for that reason, I, I, I blank--I think that when you start demanding the same things that the white community demands, you, you'll have a neighbor, good neighborhood, and the whites will move back into it.  And this is what's happening.  I got three white families live in this block, see.  Next door is an, an integrated family, a white woman and a black man.  And next to her, next to her I think there, there's a white family entirely.  And then across the street there's an integrated family.  So, so, and I start, I think when you start integrating like that, there's no reason that, that the white politician can give you for not, not maintaining that community the way they would in any, any other community, see.  And that's--and, and when I built this house, there were, there were three white families, the three building sites, one of which I bought to build this place.  And, and there, there it was a good neighborhood, and I wasn't gonna stand to see it go down, see, and so that's what happened.  And, and I think it's a way of putting enough pressure on neighborhoods that they listen to us.  But, but it's got to be done by politicians, you know, and they'll listen to them.  They want to get elected and re-elected.  And if you don't do it, they don't hear from you, you don't hear from them.  And that, that was the way I looked at it at that time.
Story_ID: 483178
Speaker 1: Well when you look back over your entire ninety years, your, your business career, your career with Tuskegee [Tuskegee Airmen] and [U.S.] military career, your real estate career, and your family life, what stands out most for you?
Speaker 2: What stands out as far as that's concerned in my life?
Speaker 1: In your life what stands out most for you?
Speaker 2: I think what stands out is my family.  I, I do adore my wife [Vivian Robinson Smith] and kids [Sharon Smith Daniels and Sylvia Smith Jackson].  I have a real good family.  And they, they're not perfect, and neither and I, and nobody is.  And we have tried to live up to what is demanded of us.  And we have tried to even excel, you know, what is demanded of us.  And I'm satisfied and pleased with the success I've made and all the things that I've undertaken to do.  And I think I, I'm an exceptional individual 'cause I'm, as far as some of my friends are concerned.  Some of them hadn't, haven't done as well, and I try not to forget them because I know that I've got some relatives too that haven't done well, see.  So I, I'm grateful for the fact that I, that I have done as well as I've done down through the years and I have the kind of family that I have, see.  I haven't been, haven't been too pleased with some of my son-in-laws.  I got these daughters, you know, and they're divorced.  And I have, I haven't, I've had a problem, a few problems with my son-in-laws, but other than that, everything all right, see.
Story_ID: 483179
Speaker 1: You know, it's hard for me identify this photo.  I, I can identify most of the men on it, but I don't know the exact reason why the picture was taken.  But anyway, squatting down in front is a fellow named Brown [ph.].  He married a girl from Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 2: Wait a minute.  Let me just point him out.  Is this Brown (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's Brown, yeah.  He married a guy--a girl from Denver.  And I think here, I think she just passed a year or two ago, and I'm not sure whether he lives, lives or, lives not.  I've, I've forgotten.  He got out of the [U.S. military] service and did some other educational work and got some other degrees and was teaching at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] I think.  Brown was his name.
Speaker 2: Now, was this the Tuskegee Airmen?  Was this taken at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were all in the Tuskegee Airmen.  You see, Tuskegee Airmen was a base where most of the black people assigned to the [U.S. Army] Air Force at that time had to come through Tuskegee, see.  And from there they get disbursed to various other units, like I was disbursed to Godman Field [Godman Army Airfield, Kentucky], from Tuskegee to Godman Field.  And most of the black people in the Air Force at that time came through Tuskegee.  We did some kind of little training at, at that time, at Tuskegee, and that's the re- that's the reason why we known as Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 2: So, can you identify anyone else in that photograph before we change it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, George Lima [George S. Lima, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Which one is he?
Speaker 1: It's George Lima here.  He is Portuguese.
Speaker 2: Here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right there.  He's from Rhode Island.
Speaker 2: Can you spell his name for me?
Speaker 1: L-I-M-A, Lima, George Lima.  Okay, this fellow here is dead now, Hooks Jones [Hubert L. Jones].  He was a full colonel in the Air Force (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's right up top.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, with, yeah.  He's dead now, and he's--
Speaker 2: Hooks Jones?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's from Denver, and we went to high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] together.
Speaker 2: And you told the story about him--
Speaker 1: Yeah, went, we went to school together and, and went to college together.  And I can't identify the rest of them.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you identify the year it was taken in?
Speaker 1: Was it--identify who?
Speaker 2: The, the, the year this photograph was taken?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that was done, that was in, let's see, let's see, four- '44 [1944].  That must have been in '45 [1945], '45 [1945], 1945.
Speaker 2: All right. We'll go on to the second program.
Speaker 1: This program, this here was--
Speaker 2: One second.  Let's just make sure--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me just fix that.  Okay, I'm ready.  Sir, we're ready.  Go ahead, sir.
Speaker 1: This photograph was take, taken graduating class of intelligence school in New York City [New York, New York].  This is naval intelligence school.  This, as I was telling you, we sent, we were sent to all kinds of military schools 'cause they didn't, they didn't know what to do with us.  The commanders of these and various units didn't want, didn't want any blacks, you see.  So they--we'd go from one school to the other.  As a matter of fact, I told you that we had these white officer, white officers at Tuskegee who was supposed to be teaching us.  And most of them had not gone to the schools we'd gone to.  So anyway, this is one of the schools I went to.  It's the naval intelligence school in Washington--I mean in New York City.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: I can't identify anybody other than Grant [ph.].  This is Grant right here.  And an announcement was made by the, one of the superiors there that, that--
Speaker 2: That is the gentleman--I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Then they, they, they were soliciting people, people who, to go to another intelligence school, intelligence school.  And it was intelligence school that was not combat intelligence.  See, the intelligence is both combat and noncombat, and I was in combat.  The, the the, we were supposed to actually, if we were attacked, know, know, defend the base.  And noncombat is the gathering of information.  That's all they do is gather information.  But combat intelligence officer are soldiers as well.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This was the base personnel at Godman Field.  You see, every, every base has their, every, every base has somebody in charge of the whole base.  That's the base--that's the commanding officer of the base.  And the people who man that base are, are these people.  They man Godman Field.  In other words, units may come and go, but these people stay at the base all the time, see.  And so these are the people there to maintain that base at Godman Field was assigned to them.
Speaker 2: Are you on this photograph?
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't on that.  I was over, I was in a unit.  I wasn't a base personnel.  Base personnel is in charge of the base.
Speaker 2: Well, I kind of recognize this gentleman.
Speaker 1: That's in the days of my youth.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: When was this taken?  What was the occasion?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was taken when I was at Godman Field.  See, my, my roommate at Godman Field was the photo, photographic officer of the whole base.  And, and whenever he was out, out taking pictures, he'd take a picture of me or somebody else, you know.  And I don't know that it was any special occasion of why he took that picture.
Speaker 1: This was in my, my squadron one day when we were, when we were going to go to mess.  And somebody came in with a newspaper, in which we didn't see too much of in those days.  And I was reading the paper and before we went to mess.
Speaker 2: Okay. Ready for the next?
Speaker 1: That was here in Denver, and I don't remember the occasion.
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I don't think so--
Speaker 1: Huh?  Huh?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I think that was on the ship, honey, on the ship.
Speaker 1: Was that on the ship?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I think we were go--maybe we used to go on these cruises, mostly in the Caribbean.  We, we went to Africa and various other places.  But, I think that picture was taken when--be, before we took off down in Miami [Florida] going on a cruise.
Speaker 2: So, can you name all of these people from left to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was, of course, I'm sitting down, Grace Hale was to the left; that's Vivian [Vivian Robinson Smith] in the middle; and that's, is that Marian Larsen [ph.]?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Marian Larsen on the, on the right.
Speaker 2: When was that?
Speaker 1: You remember when that was, Vivian?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I don't know, but it, it was the fiftieth anniverse- class anniversary.  Is that what you say?  From--
Speaker 1: (SYLVIA SMITH JACKSON):  Reunion.
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Huh?
Speaker 1: Reunion.
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Reunion, thanks, Sylvia [Sylvia Smith Jackson], reunion from the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado].  And those were the--
Speaker 1: This lady in the yellow is, is dead now.  Grace is, is, Grace is still living, isn't she?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Yes.
Speaker 1: And of course, me and Vivian.
Speaker 2: That's the jacket we, Tuskegee Airmen, all of us have one of those jackets.  And that was taken at one of the conventions, I guess.
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  The convention (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the names on the photograph?
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  The convention--
Speaker 2: Me and Vivian and, and I don't know that other guy.
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  The con- the convention was here in Denver.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was a few years ago.
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: Well, do you know the gentleman in the middle?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I do--I, I don't think I know.
Speaker 1: I don't know the guy.
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I've forgotten him.
Speaker 1: And of course, there's me there, and there you are, Vivian.
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I think he was from somebody, somewhere in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know him.  See, we must have, we must have had three or four hundred Tuskegee Airmen through, over the course of all the years, you know.  And, and one of them, one, one group concentrated on fighter pilots and other on bomber pilots.  And so, as, as being in the, in the bomber group, I didn't know too many of the fighters, and, and too many fighters didn't know us.  So that's the reason why I can't name a bunch of these guys.
Story_ID: 483180
Speaker 1: That's Dave Hull [ph.] I think.  Isn't that Dave Hull, Vivian [Vivian Robinson Smith]?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Yeah, this, well, that was just a picture of Dave [HistoryMaker David A. Smith] to show how he aged or didn't age.  Yeah, and that was, that was a birthday party, but I don't know which one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  But I've got the eightieth birthday party.
Speaker 1: Can we have that picture?
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  And I guess I'm right about that.
Speaker 1: It was at Sharon's [Sharon Smith Daniels] house I think, birthday party at Sharon's house.
Speaker 2: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I guess we don't have a cake there.  You might see something.
Speaker 1: Eightieth birthday party?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and it's at Sharon's house, and this was about three or four years ago I think, wasn't it Vivian?
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  Unh-uh, no, (laughter) you're ninety now, honey.
Speaker 2: So that was ten years ago, huh?
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  That's right, but, and now, those were his closest friends that were there, those that were still living.
Speaker 2: And two or three of them are dead now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know that, in all these bases during World War II [WWII]--
Speaker 1: Hold on please.
Speaker 2: They had, they had what they called special--what do they call (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --that?  Huh, no--
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  That wouldn't be right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  He's talking about when people--Joe Louis--
Speaker 2: When Joe Louis was there.  This was at, this was at Godman Field, Kentucky [Godman Army Airfield, Kentucky].  Or was it?  See, was, was it there?
Speaker 1: (VIVIAN ROBINSON SMITH):  I don't know, honey.
Speaker 2: Anyway, Joe Louis came, the, back in those days, special, special people who were in the service didn't actually go to combat and didn't, didn't do too much military training, but they went around to each base, you know, and, and put on exhibitions or did whatever they, they were famous for.  And Joe Louis came to our base and, and fought a round or two with one or two of the officers.  And this, this guy here was my roommate.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: This is Duke Ellington's son--
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: --on the end here is Duke Ellington's son.
Speaker 1: Can you sit back, and I'll point to them?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just sit back so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's, this is Duke Ellington's son?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And which one is your roommate?
Speaker 2: What, the, one with the towel--
Speaker 1: Duke Ellington's--
Speaker 2: --with the--no, one with the towel around his shoulder there.
Speaker 1: That's your roommate?
Speaker 2: That was my roommate.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: George Lima [George S. Lima, Jr.].  He's a Portuguese.  And further down the line there you'll see Joe Louis.
Speaker 1: Right, there's Joe Louis.
Speaker 2: Right there, yeah.  But I can't, I, I can't identify the rest of them.  I don't know who they are.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I don't know what the occasion was for that photograph--
