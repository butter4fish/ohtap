Speaker 1: And is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Nothing I'm aware of.  The closest I can come to the 'Marlene' is that I was born in 1936 and there was Marlene Dietrich, (laughter) and I think that might have been an incentive.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Rochester, New York on November 22, 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: My occupation now is retired journalist.  I've had several occupations.  I started off as a secretary and then I became--well, then I was employed as a journalist.  And yeah, that's how I retired, as a journalist.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if you call this a food, but I love ice cream.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: It's a food.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not anymore.  I used to love red.  I think it's more in the lavender arena, lavender.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not really.  A favorite phrase or saying--no.
Story_ID: 39871
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Alright, now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately, and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Louetta--well, it's Louetta, but its spelled L-O-R-E-T-T-A, Loretta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's pronounced 'Lou'-etta.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Cordelia, C-O-R-D-E-L-I-A, Johnson.  And her married name was Shumake, S-H-U-M-A-K-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  She's deceased, but I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have, I mean an estimation or something?  Do you have any idea how old she was when you were born?
Speaker 2: She was--I think she was 24 when I was born.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: Rochester, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: I can go back as far as my grandmother.  And what were they doing in history?
Speaker 1: Well, what was your grandmother's name, first of all?
Speaker 2: Her name was Cordelia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Johnson.  I think her middle name was Irene.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What I mean by that, is what were they--what kind of occupation did they have?  What was their history, what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Well, my, I know my grandmother ran a boarding house for awhile.  And she was big in the Elks.  And that's about all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she ran a boarding house in Rochester?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you ever meet your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I used to visit her when I was younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I know her.  I was in a foster care situation, but I would go to her house and visit occasionally and stay, like a couple of days.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother grow up in Rochester, too?
Speaker 2: I think she's from Culpeper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We've interviewed a lot of people from Culpeper, Virginia for some reason.  I remember that name keeps coming up.  But, okay.
Speaker 2: And she married a man named Augustus Johnson, and I'm trying to find out more about him now.  He was deceased by the time they moved, I think, to Rochester.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, he had passed before then.
Speaker 2: I think so.  I'm just catching up on the history.
Story_ID: 39872
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories from your mother's side of the family that you learned from your grandmother or any of the other relatives?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter), not a one.   That's why I said it's unusual.  Because I was raised in a foster family since I was five when I went out to Avon.  But even before that, I was in foster care.  Because I remember moving, the day they moved me and three other people, three other kids.  One was my cousin and then there was a brother and sister.  And they moved us from Rochester out to Avon.  And so, that's all I know about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's as far back as I can go.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So, any story are stories from the foster family.  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean, okay.  So, your mother was raised in Rochester?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And her sister--her sister.  There were two of them.  Her sister was named Thelma.  I don't know her middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were raised in Rochester.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, obviously, there's some kind of dis-connect here somewhere.  But did your--I guess you'll explain this.  But did your mother ever talk about growing up, and what it was like for her in Rochester?
Speaker 2: No, she wouldn't even tell me who my dad was.  So, she didn't share much with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your mother.  What was...?
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing I can tell you is that after I graduated from the University of Buffalo, I moved to Detroit where she was living, to live with her, because I thought it was time that we lived together.  And she was working with a woman who had a cooking show on TV.  And that was interesting.  Her name was Edith Fern Melrose.  So, I lived with her in Detroit until she passed.  She had cancer.  But she never shared like stories with me and stuff.
Speaker 1: What did she do with the woman who had the cooking show?
Speaker 2: She assisted.  She was like a domestic.  I guess helped her on the show, moving things around.  I don't know.  I didn't watch the show, I didn't have a TV.  But she helped her when she was on the show.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, do you remember the title of the show?
Speaker 2: No, I just know the lady's name.  I've got the book out here that--
Speaker 1: Edith Fern Melrose.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is this a white woman?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Maybe she was a domestic in the lady's house, I'm not sure.  But I know that's who she worked for.  I don't know she was on the air.  I doubt if she was on the air.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, did your mother finish school in Rochester?
Speaker 2: What I'm just learning is that both she and my aunt went to school in Rochester.  But they went like to the eighth grade or whatever, and that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, did she do domestic work basically for a living?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 39873
Speaker 1: So, I know you don't know who your father is.  But, so, what is the story as far as you know about your--you know...?  If you don't know, who might know what the circumstances were, or--?
Speaker 2: I think that there's--my daughter says they're trying to hide something.  I don't know what the circumstance was.  Just in looking--I told you I was looking at--trying to do some research.  And I found out that my mother, my aunt and my grandmother all lived together in this house.  And her mother, my grandmother's mother, my great-grandmother, they all lived together.  I found that out from the census.  And I would have been... the 1940 Census...  I would have been four or five.  So, that means I was in foster care the whole time.  The first thing I said when I looked at it, I said well, everybody else was there.  Where was I?  So, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, nobody talked about it.  My--I tried to find out from my aunt, and I tried to find out from my mother, and I tried to find out from my grandmother.  And nobody would talk about it.  I tried to find out from another cousin.  Nobody would talk about.  So, I don't know what's being hidden, but it's certainly well hidden.  I hope Ancestry can uncover it for me.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you've been in foster care ever since you were born?  I mean where were you--?
Speaker 2: I mean, I, the only--the thing I remember is that I was like very young.  And I know when I went out to Avon I was five years old.  Before that, I was in a foster care.  I vaguely remember the people.  But they got too old to handle us four, so they sent us out to Avon.
Speaker 1: So, it was four of you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: My cousin, my first cousin Thelma's--my aunt's oldest son and me.  And then there was another two children who were brother and sister.  So, we all ended up at the Wilson's house in Avon, New York, George Wilson.  Now, what I can tell you about George Wilson is that he was 12--he was a--how do I want to put this?  I think he was a slave until he was 12, when he was released, whenever, you know.  So, but he wouldn't talk about it either.  I tried to get an oral history from him at one point, and he was talking with cousins in Culpeper.  That's where he was living.
Speaker 1: So, he was born in about 1852.
Speaker 2: Or something, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, I had this tape recorder...  But every time I went in there, they stopped talking.  (laughter).  So, I never could get the full information from him.  But--
Speaker 1: He was born in, I'm sorry, I missed that part.  But he was born in Culpeper?
Speaker 2: I believe so.  I'm not sure about it.  But I know he was living in Culpeper.
Story_ID: 39874
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was born probably in Virginia or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, we went to the Wilson's house.  And then when I was eleven, I went to live with the daughter.  And her name was Edna Cottom and Henry Cottom.  And I lived with them.  They were my family until I got out of school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They kicked me out of the system, but then... the State kicked me out of the system... when you're 17.  But they're still my family.  I still, you know, go back.
Speaker 1: And their name is, again?
Speaker 2: Cottom, C-O-T-T-O-M.
Speaker 1: 'C', Cotton?
Speaker 2: Cottom.
Speaker 1: Cottom, with an 'm.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm still in touch with the family.  Those are my brothers and sisters.  She had four, let's see...  Barbara, Birdie, Nancy, Bud, Jeff... five children.  Yeah.  My brother, my youngest brother just died last year.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so but--
Speaker 2: So other than that, I'm an only child, other than them.
Speaker 1: Did George Wilson have any stories?  Since he was born in slavery, did he have any stories he talked about then?
Speaker 2: He had them, but he wouldn't tell us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I... I tried to get an oral history one time.  Every time I went in and he was talking to a cousin--every time I went in the room, they'd stop talking. (laughter).  They were remembering things, and he wouldn't talk about it.  He would not talk about it.
Speaker 1: Interesting.  So, and are there any rumors about who your father was?
Speaker 2: No. (laughter).  If there were rumors, then probably I could find out who it is.  But, no rumors.  Nobody would say anything.  It's been very closed-mouthed.
Speaker 1: A pretty big secret.
Speaker 2: Isn't that strange?  Yeah, it's a strange secret to keep.  And Rochester is not that big a place in terms of where black folks lived.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And somebody knows.  A lot of people knew (laughter), but nobody talks.  The only thing I understand is that my mom, Loretta, used to sing in nightclubs.  Now, it could have been somebody passing through who was in the music arena.  I don't know.  But, it's a well-kept secret.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I've got a secret daddy.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know.  Does DNA reveal stuff like that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I didn't think so.  You have to have--
Speaker 1: You have to have some--
Speaker 2: Somebody on that side?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can compare your DNA to somebody's.  But if you don't have anybody to compare it to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it doesn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so-
Speaker 1: --reveal who they are.
Story_ID: 39875
Speaker 1: At any rate, so when you think about--you know, who was the biggest influence on you, growing up, would you say?
Speaker 2: Edna Wilson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: George's wife.  She was a wonderful woman.  I loved her.
Speaker 1: And was she from Culpeper, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were in Avon by the time that--and he was running a small farm.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Avon?
Speaker 2: A-V-O-N.
Speaker 1: Oh, Avon, okay.
Speaker 2: We call it 'Ave-on' (ph) (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're not British. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Shakespeare's home, they call it Avon.
Speaker 2: Right.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, we have Avon Products.
Speaker 2: (laughter) I know.  But we called it 'Ave-on' (ph).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was good growing up on the farm.  I mean running free and all that.  They were good people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us more about Edna Wilson.
Speaker 2: Well, she was such a gentle woman.  And she loved homemaking, and she loved her family, and she loved her church.  She taught me a lot about cooking, and that's why I can cook today.  And I used to watch her.  And she let us do certain things.  She was just a generous woman, yeah.  Because, can you imagine?  We weren't the only foster children there.  There were four of us, and then she had had others before.  And some, a few were still around.  They had a big house.  But she made sure that we knew the rules, and she wasn't harsh about it.  She was very loving.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, so you grew up basically at the Wilson home, I mean until--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in that family, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's my family.
Speaker 1: Oh, you say you were there until you were 12 or so, and then you went and moved to--
Speaker 2: I went to the Wilsons when--I went to the Cottoms when I was eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was at the Wilsons from five until eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to the Cottoms, and that's where I stayed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did they live in Avon, too?
Speaker 2: They lived in Avon and they lived in Geneseo.  All these little towns are about seven miles apart.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell Geneseo?
Speaker 2: G-E-N-E-S-E-O.  They have a state university there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: SUNY Geneseo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Geneseo, okay.  And were they on a farm, too, situation?
Speaker 2: No.  They had to do different other things.  They weren't on a farm.
Speaker 1: They lived in town?
Speaker 2: Well, on the outskirts.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On the outskirts of town.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we always ask this question.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: That was, the memory I had was sitting with my back to the door, dressed, next to the other three children when we were getting ready to go to Avon.
Story_ID: 39876
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Can you describe the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, being that we were on a farm, the sights were watching the animals--pigs and cows and horses--and going out in the barn and of course smelling the manure.  Then also, the big lawn that we had, the grass--rolling around in the grass and picking hollyhocks and catching bees in jars and catching--what do you call them, fireflies--the bugs that light up night?
Speaker 1: Yeah, fireflies or--
Speaker 2: Fireflies.
Speaker 1: --lightning bugs.
Speaker 2: Lightning bugs, that's it.  That's what we used to call them.  Catching those in a jar and watching them light up, and just running around and playing hide-and-seek behind trees and walking for miles, following the creek along in the spring.  That's why it's my favorite, because the water would be flowing in the creeks, and I would walk and walk and walk; sliding down hills in the wintertime on a sled, belly flopping, going down the hill.  And then walking when we wanted candy.  There was one place that was--it wasn't a store, but it was a residence where they sold candy.  And we would go there and walk and walk and walk until we got there, and buy candy and walk back.  So, I did a lot of walking in my younger days.  Thank goodness, because I can't walk much now.  (laughter).  But it was always my favorite thing to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I tried riding a horse once.  I love horses.  But I got up there and I stayed on until the horse started gathering a little steam, starting trotting.  And I had to get down (laughter).  I couldn't do it.  So, you know, of course there were always kittens around, and dogs, and you know, stuff like that.  And we did have guns, but it wasn't an issue.  They had long guns--and we were on the farm.  And the kids didn't bother the guns and we, you know, it was just--like, animals were there.  The gun was there.  I mean, it wasn't something that we did.
Story_ID: 39877
Speaker 1: And Grandfather, Grandpa Wilson, we called him.  He--for some reason, we all went to Mumford, the Second Baptist Church in Mumford.  And for some reason, Grandpa, they had a falling out and he wouldn't go to church.  But what he would do with us is, he would get the Bible out and read.  We'd read the Bible together, and we would sing.  And that was, he would have church for us.  And then the rest of us would go to church on Sunday as usual.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eventually, eventually he did go back.  But I never found out the reason for falling out, but there's always that possibility in the church community, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is Mumford?
Speaker 1: Mumford.  It's in Mumford, New York, and it's the Second Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The pastor now, his last name is Thurmond.  Would you believe that?  Howard Thurman.  I don't know if he's related to the other Thurmonds or not.
Speaker 2: But his name is Howard Thurmond?
Speaker 1: Uh huh. (laughter).
Speaker 2: When I was there and when I was baptized, the minister was Rev. Ivor Moore.  He came after--of course, he came after Mordacei Johnson.  But a lot of the students at Rochester--University of Rochester Divinity School, would do their practice at Mumford.  They would come to Mumford and preach.
Speaker 1: Are you saying that Mordecai Johnson once preached there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was once a preacher there.  And I don't know if he, it was because he went to the University of Rochester.  We'd have to look that up.  But I know he was at Mumford before I got there, well before.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But we got a lot of young ministers that would come through there.  What's his name?  It's one here in D.C.  I can't think of his name right now.  But he was at Mumford, and now he's at Metropolitan Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: I'm not familiar with that, you know.  But--
Speaker 2: His name will come to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But, alright, so Second Baptist was, was that the only black church in the area?
Speaker 2: It might have been the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In--it was in Ashley.  Mumford is close to Caledonia.  So yeah, it was, I think it was the only one in that area.  And the next one was in, I think someplace in Leroy, which is further away.
Story_ID: 39878
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in this part of New York are there, what's the black population like?  Are there a lot of black people?
Speaker 2: There are pockets of black folks.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: In my graduating class, there were three of us out of maybe 40, 45.  And we had a class reunion for our 50th Class Reunion.  And it was in Geneseo, and it was wonderful.  Of course, I was the only black one there.  The other folks--one of them had died, and the other one didn't come.  So, it was me and my classmates.  We had a good time, though.  We're still in touch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We got in touch through the internet--back in touch, which was great.
Speaker 1: So where did you start school?  What was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school?   Avon Central.  It's like it starts at kindergarten and goes all the way up to 12th grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was that the only school?  I mean, the only--
Speaker 2: No, I went to Geneseo starting in, I think junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I graduated from Geneseo Central High.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were at Avon Central from kindergarten through fifth grade?
Speaker 2: No, through probably eighth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Eighth grade, okay, Avon Central.  Okay.  So, but did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved it.  I've always loved learning.  And I loved athletics.  I used to play everything they threw my way.  The only thing they didn't have was, at the time...  They have it now, but they didn't have a swimming pool.  So, I didn't learn how to swim.  I still don't know how.  But I played everything from field hockey...  I was a great basketball player.  I led the team (laughter) to victory.  I'm still in touch with a woman that was on my team.  She lives in Santa Clarita in California, and we're in touch. And whenever I go visit my daughter, we get in touch.  Yeah, she was on my basketball team. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Story_ID: 39879
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we were talking about school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, in elementary school, did you have a favorite subject or favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: I don't remember having a favorite subject or teacher.  I was just excited about school.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, about how students were at Avon?
Speaker 2: Probably around the same kind of numbers.  It was a small school, it was a small town.
Speaker 1: So, a couple of black students in your class?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any other blacks in my class at Avon, 'Ave-on' (ph), you know.  (laughter).  You got me all confused now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, were you treated alright?
Speaker 2: Pretty much.  Except one day--this was one thing I remember about Avon.  There was this one little white boy who was so afraid of black people.  He thought that if he touched me, he would turn black, right.  So, I spent a whole recess one time chasing him around (laughter), chasing him around the building.  It was just around this square building, until I caught him.  And I just grabbed him and I said, 'See, it didn't happen.  It won't come off on you.'  His name was Billy Bash.  (laughter).  I will always remember running after Billy Bash to show him that it wouldn't change his color.  (laughter).  My color wouldn't change...  Oh, my goodness.  But that's the only incident I kind of remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as being sort of negative.  But it--you know, I didn't beat him up.  I just touched him and I said...
Speaker 1: That's not really negative.  That's just, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But he was tumbling around the school, and I was tumbling around after him.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, this is 1941, or so?
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Forty-One [1941] or '42' [1942]?  Yeah.  So, did you go to kindergarten there, too?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Did they have it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, kindergarten through eighth grade.  And so, how would you get to school?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: I went on the bus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what I do recall is that, you know, you get a lot of snow there.  And I don't think we ever had a snow day.  I don't ever recall (laughter) a time when the yellow school bus didn't come and pick us up.  And the snow banks were up over our heads, of course.  And we got to school on the school bus.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: It's like a little snow here will paralyze--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: It still amazes me.  I'm going, like, I know we used to have snow back then, because we used to slide down the snow banks when we would be playing in it.  And the bus would come.
Story_ID: 39880
Speaker 1: So, you and your foster brothers--you've got like one cousin, right--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then two foster children are with you, that you grew--
Speaker 2: Who were brother and sister, yeah.
Speaker 1: Brother and sister, yeah.
Speaker 2: Warren and Sandra Taylor.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: He's deceased now, and I've been in touch with her.  And we usually send Christmas cards, but this year I didn't get one.  And I called her and I couldn't get an answer, so she might be deceased, I'm not sure.  I've been trying to get in touch.
Speaker 1: But you all grew up together.  Now, were the Taylors about the same age, or were they--?
Speaker 2: Warren was a year older than I, and Sandra was two years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my cousin was--I think he's two years younger as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Than me.
Speaker 1: So, you were kind of in the middle.  You were right under Warren?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: You, Warren, and then the other two.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 39881
Speaker 1: So, you did have a favorite subject in school, in grade school?
Speaker 2: Reading.  I've always loved to read.
Speaker 1: Did you have good access to books when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  And the thing is, I remember at the Wilsons, they had this old cook stove.  You know--wood stove, put wood in it.  And there's a space behind it, right?  I used to get in back of that stove, and I'd read and read and read.  And they used to run me out of the house because I would read so much.  They'd say, 'Go outside and get some exercise.'  (laughter).  I would read all the time.
Speaker 1: Well, what were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: I do remember that there was series of books that I liked.  And they were always about animals--otters, mostly, who had families.  And they told these stories through the vision of the otters.  And then I also liked biographies.  They used to have these biographies that were like orange covered books.  And I used to get those biographies and I'd read them.
Speaker 1: So, the series--
Speaker 2: And I remember my grand--my mom, Edna Cottom, gave me a book called 'Up From Slavery,' yeah.
Speaker 1: It was called?
Speaker 2: 'Up from Slavery.'
Speaker 1: Oh, by Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  Yeah, she gave it to me.  She liked to read, too.  And we'd read magazines.  And the other kids liked to read comics, but I never got into comics.  And they would collect them, and they had big piles.  And they would compete about who had the most comic books.  But that never fascinated me.  I just--and still don't read comics.  I may read some of the editorial comments, but I don't read comics.
Speaker 1: Well, what was it about comics that you didn't--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I just didn't like all those little (laughter), all those little bubbles and all that non-sense.  (laughter).  Some of them are funny and some of them are not funny at all.  Now, I like Snoopy, and I used to like Lucy--the ones that didn't have a whole lot of jibber jabber, that made sense.  But some of them, they just--oh, no.  (laughter).

Speaker 1: Alright, now, so you move when you're eleven?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And you went to school in--
Speaker 2: Geneseo.
Speaker 1: Geneseo, okay.  Now, how did things change now when you moved to, you know, the Cottoms, you know?  Now, this is the daughter--
Speaker 2: This is the daughter of the Wilsons.
Speaker 1: Of the Wilsons, yeah.  What happened?  Did the Wilsons just get too old?
Speaker 2: They got too old and yeah, gave it up.
Speaker 1: Mr. Wilson would have been pushing a hundred.  He was getting close to--
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't quite there.  Because he moved back to Culpeper, and when he died he was 94 or 95.  I used to go down from--I went to Culpeper to see him a couple of times.  Because his first wife, Edna Wilson, she died and he married again.  So, he wasn't up in the hundreds.
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.  (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) I don't have his exact birthday.  He was quite a--
Speaker 1: He was born twelve years before slavery ended.  He was twelve when slavery ended, and that was 1865.  And he would have been born by 1852.  And we're talking about--I guess now when you're eleven, that's 1947 or so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I remember the World War I, I mean World War--it would have been II--in '45' [1945]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, World War II.
Speaker 2: I remember that.  It was scary for me as a young woman, a young girl.  But one of their sons went off to war, and came back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was pushing ninety, pretty much I guess around when you were eleven, if he was born before the war. I mean, you know, ninety would be--
Speaker 2: I don't think he was that old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Maybe--
Speaker 2: I may have gotten it wrong about his age when slavery ended, but I don't think he was that old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He might have been eighty, eighty-something.  I'm looking at it now from a perspective, a different perspective.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was very active, and I know that (laughter).  When I went to Culpeper--and I had my daughter by that time--he was driving down the road.  He wouldn't give up that car.  But he would be driving in Culpeper in the middle of the road.  And I had, I followed (laughter), I followed to try to protect him from cars running into him.  He was quite a guy.  Yeah, he married and, re-married, and went to live in Culpeper.
Story_ID: 39883
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, at Geneseo, was it same group of children--you and your cousins and--?
Speaker 2: No, we split up.  I went with the Cottoms.  Tyrone, who was my cousin, he went with a family called the Struthers.  And Sandra went back to Rochester.  I don't know who she went with.  And Warren went with a family out in the country called the Pollards, the Pollard family.  But I don't know...  Sandra went back to Rochester.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we were all in different places, yeah.  But I was still able to see Warren and Tyrone, because the families all mingled together.  The Struthers were related to the Cottoms, and the Pollards went to the same, they all went to the same church.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were able to see each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did things change much with the Cottoms, in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Well, I had more brothers and sisters.  And I don't know how--I'm trying to figure out how it changed.  The one, one sister named Roberta and I, were very close.  In fact, that's how I got to the Cottoms, because I guess they were divvying us up, and she wanted--we were very close when I was at the Wilsons.  And she wanted me to be the one to come live with them.  So, that's how I was chosen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So--
Speaker 2: She's passed on now.  She was my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both of my sisters are passed on, and my younger brother.  So, I've got one brother remaining.  He lives, still lives up in Rochester.
Story_ID: 39884
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, all during this time, now did you have any contact with your mother, or your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I remember when I was at the Wilsons my mom came maybe once or twice.  And when I was at the Cottoms, I believe that's when I went to visit my grandmother a couple of times, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't remember that Tyrone ever did.  I don't--we have the same grandmother.  I don't remember him ever going down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did.
Speaker 1: So, what was the school in Geneseo called?
Speaker 2: What is the name of it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Geneseo Central.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was attached to the college, the back--
Speaker 1: The SUNY School?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was called, just, it was called--I forgot the full name of Geneseo.  It wasn't a SUNY the time, it was a _______ college.  But it's a SUNY now.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, now, did you have a favorite subject in middle school, or junior high school?  Is this junior high school, or--?
Speaker 2: It was junior high, to high.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  English and reading.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And art.  I used to love to draw.  I forgot that part.
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers or mentors in this period?
Speaker 2: There was a teacher named Mr.--he was a guidance counselor.  I think it was Mr., it wasn't Mr. Patrick.  Anyway, he was a guidance counselor, and he was the one that encouraged me to go to college.  And he was the one--I used to go into the guidance office and look through all the books and stuff like that for colleges.  And he helped facilitate my getting a scholarship, partial scholarship, to Buffalo.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is interesting.  So, he actually, so he got you in touch with a scholarship fund?
Speaker 2: Well, he steered me more or less.  He mentored me.
Story_ID: 39885
Speaker 1: Now, I know you played basketball in high school, right?  What else did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I liked to read.  (laughter).  Here we go again.
Speaker 1: Were there any clubs or anything that you were a member of?
Speaker 2: I was in the Glee Club.  I was in the senior play.
Speaker 1: What were you playing?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I can't remember.  I have my book in there, my yearbook.  And I can give you, fill you in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What else?
Speaker 1: In terms of basketball, you said you were the star of the team.  Did--
Speaker 2: I was the captain.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you get any accolades?  I mean, how was girls' basketball, like, seen in that era?
Speaker 2: At that time--basketball isn't like it is today.  We only did half-court.  And also, there was no Title 9, so you couldn't get any, you couldn't get to college by playing basketball.  Otherwise, I probably would have been able to, you know, get a scholarship like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was fun.  We used to travel in the yellow bus and have competition with the other schools, and all that kind of stuff.  So, I got to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did they have like a--so, were you on the college track, I guess, at school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They had classes that were college prep, and then they had other classes.  I don't know what they call it, vocational or whatever, because at that time you had vocational schools for guys or girls.  And they'd do woodshop and Home Ec and all that, which they've taken out of schools now for the most part, which is a shame.  But anyway, they were preparing people for either college or for work, which they need to get back to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, you were college prepped, and--?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Oh, and I liked French.  I took French, and I loved it.  I took three years in high school and then one year in college.  I couldn't fit any more in my schedule because it was a two-year school, a two-year course for an associate.  So, I didn't have much time for electives, or much space.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is in, you're in high in the fifties.  This was from '50 [1950] to '54 [1954]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated in '54 [1954], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was seventeen.  Kids get out now, they're twenty.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 39886
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did you like music and--
Speaker 2: I loved music.  I still do.  And I love to dance.  One thing that happened in our, what I would call our neighborhood, a small town--the black folks would get together on the weekends and have parties at each other's houses, and we'd dance the night away.  No liquor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  We just danced.  So--
Speaker 1: Who were the popular musicians?  Now this was just before the big rock and roll, rhythm and blues kind of takeover, I guess.  So, I don't know.  Who was the--
Speaker 2: Well, there was some that Mom didn't like us to have.  But there was Fats Domino and there was the Platters, and there was--I was in Buffalo by the time...  There was the Platters.  It was... I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, I'm thinking when you were in high school... I know the Platters, seem like they came out in '55' [1955].  They just--
Speaker 2: They did.
Speaker 1: Just at the break.
Speaker 2: I was in Buffalo then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Fats Domino--
Speaker 2: I know Fats Domino--and what's his name, Bobby Blue Bland.  She didn't like us to do, what you call gut bucket blues.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like Lloyd Price was out then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We used to have stacks of 45's too.  And like idiots, we gave them away or something.  We should still have them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I can't name all the people.  We just liked the music.  And Barbara, my oldest sister, she played the piano.  And we used to get around the piano and sing mostly church music, gospel music.  She played for the church.  But we would get there and sing, and she played some regular popular music too, but no R and B.
Speaker 1: What about TV and movies?  Were they influential?
Speaker 2: Well, we would go to the movies.  It was a little small movie house, and we'd go there.  And Saturday nights you would go into town.  And the older folks would sit in the car and run, chat with each other, and we'd go to the movies.  And then when we got out of the movies, we'd run and down the street.  We'd get candy and run up and down the street, the main street.  (laughter).  That was our activity, seeing each other every Saturday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But TV, we, I remember we had a small TV, but we didn't watch TV like, not like now.  I got a TV in every room.  We didn't just watch TV.  We watched some things that Grandpa liked or the older folks liked.  But it wasn't no such thing as us choosing TV.  No remote.  You got up and you turned the knob. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You didn't sit back and press a--you got up and you turned the knob.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 39887
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, when you're on the verge of graduation, did you have a vocation in mind, an aspiration in terms of--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that I did.  What I do remember is that once I got the scholarship, I had to look at what they had to offer as associates.  And that's when I selected secretarial science.  But if I'd had my druthers, I probably would have gone on with French or something like that, or English, which eventually I went on with English when I went to Wayne State.  But, and it was educational, I wanted to be a teacher.  But, and there was a school in Brockport.  But I didn't get any money for Brockport, so I couldn't go there.  I wanted to go to the Brockport of Syracuse, but I didn't get any money, so I couldn't go.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, let's see.  So, when you graduated, did you graduate with any honors or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: How were your grades in school?  I guess they were--
Speaker 2: They were good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think you should have had some honors, if everything was going the way it should?
Speaker 2: See, this is the way it is in my life.  I'm like one of the worker bees.  And I don't often get honors.  Some people do.  I guess I don't PR myself enough.  That's just me.  I do the work and whatever comes, comes.  But a lot of times you have to, what I call politick, and I don't do that.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, is anything notable about graduation?
Speaker 2: No, just that I graduated; nothing notable at that point.
Speaker 1: Did your mother and your grandmother come?
Speaker 2: No, nope.
Speaker 1: And that really seems strange, that they--
Speaker 2: They were strange people.  I don't understand it, and I guess I never will.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  But--
Speaker 2: Because Rochester is like not that far from where we were.  It's about maybe twenty miles or so from Rochester, and between Rochester and Avon or Geneseo, or--so it's not far away.  No cards, no letters, no visits, for the most part.  No visits, for the most part; no cards, no letters, for real.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 39888
Speaker 1: So, then, so when you graduate...  I didn't ask you.  Did you have to work when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were bean-pickers (laughter).  We picked fruit and vegetables.  I remember picking strawberries.  I remember picking apples.  There was this, there was somebody who had a truck, and he would come around and gather us up--different kids in the neighborhood who wanted to make a little money.  We picked gooseberries--and those things, oh, they're prickly.  Their branches are prickly.  I don't hear much about gooseberries.
Speaker 1: No, I've read about them--
Speaker 2: Have you?
Speaker 1: --in grade school, but I've never seen one.
Speaker 2: They're kind of like a grape, but they're light and they've got stripes on it.  And the bushes are prickly, they're hard to...  So, we'd do tomatoes, strawberries, apples--I would only climb so high in the apple tree.  I had to be on the low hanging branches.  And cherries, corn, what else?  That's all I can remember that we picked.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I earned a little money.  And the babysitting, of course.
Story_ID: 39889
Speaker 1: When you're on--well, so, the summer after you graduated, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Probably the same thing--babysitting and all of that, and getting ready to move to Buffalo.
Speaker 1: So, who did you stay with in Buffalo?
Speaker 2: I stayed with my dad's brother and his wife.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Mr. Wilson's--
Speaker 2: Mr. Cottom.
Speaker 1: Mr. Cottom, okay.
Speaker 2: Henry Robert Cottom was my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was married to Edna, who was a Wilson, and she became a Cottom.  So, I stayed with them for awhile.  I won't give you the gory details, but there were some.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she was PMS-ing, the wife.  And she was mean to me; put me out in the snow.  And you know, it snows in buffalo.  So, I had to call my minister.  It was a good thing I was in church.  And he came and rescued me.  But--
Speaker 1: So that was like, was that early on, or later?
Speaker 2: [crying].  Excuse me.
Speaker 1: That's alright, take your time.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That was before I graduated from college.  And I graduated when I was 19.  So, anyway, the minister put me with some people who went to his church, and the church that I was going to as well.  And that's where I stayed until I got out of school.  And when I got out of school, after I graduated is when I decided I would go live with my mom, my real mom, my biological--I'll put it that way, my biological mom in Detroit.  That's how I got to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I stayed with her, and then she became ill.  She had breast cancer and they, my grandmother arranged to bring her back to Rochester.  And so, I was on my own.
Story_ID: 39890
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back to...  So, the school in Buffalo, the college is called Buffalo--
Speaker 2: It's SUNY.
Speaker 1: SUNY Buffalo?
Speaker 2: State University, yeah.  It was called the University of Buffalo at the time.
Speaker 1: You took a two-year course there?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For an associate's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked in the cafeteria.  They gave me a partial scholarship, so I worked in the cafeteria, to supplement.
Speaker 1: So, you graduated in secretarial science?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any important teachers or figures there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you consider, you know, trying to stay to get a four-year degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I considered it.  But, you know, it was very difficult.  There was not, you know, there was no student loans.  There was no, you know, there weren't many opportunities to stay, unless you had money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this would mean you would have graduated around 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956].  Okay, alright.  So, was it shortly after then that you moved to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was like right away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have, did you get a--was it hard to find a job in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well, that's when I went to the VA and I got a job.  It was a federal job as a Secretary, GS-1.
Story_ID: 39891
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were saying off-camera that you stayed on Woodward Avenue in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed right on the corner of Woodward and Blaine.  That was the house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you like Detroit?  Now, this is--
Speaker 2: I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still do.  I'm sorry it's going downhill, but I had a lot of good memories of Detroit, and a lot of good friends in Detroit.  It was a very good city.
Speaker 1: You were there during the heyday of Detroit, I guess.  This is when Detroit was really cooking, and I know for us in the Midwest, it was like New York City.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's where the auto jobs--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody in all those other--
Speaker 2: And that brought a lot of people into the middle class, which they're trying to do now.  And don't they understand?  Give people jobs, and they can move up into the middle class, decent jobs.  And it was always people working in the auto industry were able to make it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, when you moved to Detroit with your mother, you were saying earlier you still didn't really--she still didn't really talk that much about--
Speaker 2: No, she wouldn't tell me.
Speaker 1: --life or anything?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright.
Speaker 2: She called me Sweetie, but I don't remember ever being hugged by her, or my grandma.
Speaker 1: That's very strange.
Speaker 2: Yeah, strange family.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a story there somewhere, and if we can, you know--
Speaker 2: I've been trying to ferret it out for the longest, but I haven't succeeded.  Maybe I don't need to know.
Speaker 1: How long had your mother been in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Oh, she'd been there awhile.  I don't remember exactly how long because, you know, we weren't in touch that much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she happy about you coming in to, coming back to--
Speaker 2: Well, she, yeah, she accepted me.  I mean, I don't know if she was happy, but--
Speaker 1: I don't see--
Speaker 2: She let it happen.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, for anybody to live with you, it's gotta--you have to--there's got to be some acceptance, so--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, at any rate.  Now, you worked at the VA Center.
Speaker 2: Veteran's Administration.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Veteran's Administration, right.  And now, did you, I didn't ask you this earlier.  Did--growing up, did you really pay attention to the news, newspapers and such?  Did you get newspapers when you were a kid, and in high school, or in--
Speaker 2: I don't think I paid that much attention to newspapers then.
Speaker 1: You don't remember reading columns or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Not columns, no.  Most of my reading was I would be reading books--and not the Sunday funnies.  (laughter).  I know we used to get the paper, but I didn't read that stuff.
Story_ID: 39892
Speaker 1: Do you remember, when you graduated, the Brown v. the Board of Education decision was rendered.  Did you--
Speaker 2: I don't remember that at all then.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I became an activist in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when I started paying attention to stuff.
Speaker 1: Now, how did this take place?  Was there something that occurred, that called your attention to current events?
Speaker 2: No, I just, just living life, I guess.  Remember, I told you the incident about the work at the VA.  And I was becoming more aware of what people do to each other.  Having grown up in a situation where I didn't, I wasn't confronted that much with racism.  There were a few of us.  And we still understood, and we still, like, partied separately.  But there weren't any incidents that were hateful towards us.  So, I didn't become aware of that until sort of at the VA.  And it was like--I had grown-up, and said, well, I'm just like everybody else.  I'm just as good as everyone else.  And in school, that's the way I was treated.  But when I got out in the world and people started making a difference to me, making it seem like I wasn't capable or somebody else was favored, that's when I started becoming politically aware.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the story at the VA.  I think you told it to me in the kitchen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about my first job.  They offered me a job working for the boss of the unit, as a secretary.  And one day they came to me and asked me if I would transfer to the steno pool, where different folks were doing, you know, stenography and typing and all that.  And the reason they wanted me to move was because a young white girl came in, and they wanted her to have my job, and I was supposed to go the pool.  But I refused.  Huh, me and Rosa Parks.  But anyway I refused.  And so, I kept the job that I had, and she went to the pool.  That's when I started becoming, you know, more activist and everything, because--
Speaker 1: What they were actually doing is asking you to demote yourself?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: To make room for someone else?
Speaker 2: Right.  I wasn't going to do that.  And it was a federal job, so they really didn't make a stink about it.  But that's what they wanted me to do, to volunteer to go over there so she could be the secretary, the boss's secretary.
Story_ID: 39893
Speaker 1: So, you were at the VA.  So, did you live with your...  Well, you--
Speaker 2: Well, she became ill.  I think I lived with her just under two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she became ill with, like, with cancer.  And so, then I was out.  Like I said, I lived by myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: At some point you went to Wayne State, right?  And so--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, at some point I did.
Speaker 1: Is that sooner than later?  I mean, I'm just trying to follow the chronology, you know, what happened next.
Speaker 2: I got a job at Wayne State in 1959 in the College of Education, as a secretary.  And I stayed there for about five years.  But as I was there, they offered you, you could take college courses and you didn't have to pay tuition.  So, I took advantage of that and I finished my degree--got a Bachelor of Science in education, secondary education, with a major in English.  And then I left Wayne State and I...  After I left Wayne State, I went to, I got a job at General Motors as a secretary.
Speaker 1: Now, were you trying to find employment as a teacher?
Speaker 2: That's why I think I got something mixed up.  I think I got my teaching certificate after I left Wayne State as an employee.  I think I went back and continued my education.  So, I stayed at Wayne State for about five years, and then I went to General Motors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a secretary.  And I did do my student teaching at Miller Junior High School on the east side.  But I forgot where I was working.  Anyway, I was making more as a secretary than I would have made as a teacher, beginning teacher.  So, I didn't go into teaching; I stayed where I was.
Speaker 1: So, Miller was a junior high school then?
Speaker 2: It was a junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I had seventh and eighth graders, teaching English.
Speaker 1: Miller is still standing.  They haven't knocked it down yet.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  A good thing, huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I was at the closing of Miller, you know.  It's a long story, but I was at the closing.  But yeah, you're on the east side.
Story_ID: 39894
Speaker 1: So, okay, so, at General--you were at General Motors a long time, I guess then, right?  You went to General Motors in--?
Speaker 2: I know I was there when Dr. King was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Now, that's '68' [1968], so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, let's see.
Speaker 1: So, you went to Wayne State in '59' [1959].  So, you there--
Speaker 2: And I stayed five years.
Speaker 1: Sixty-Four [1964]...
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then General Motors from '64' [1964] to--would that be '64' [1964] to--?
Speaker 2: I may have had another job in between there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Just why I say, you ought to rest me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But anyway, I...  Now, what was your question again?
Speaker 1: Well, we were just trying to follow the chronology of happened, you know, next and stuff.
Speaker 2: There may have been some other job.  But the major points are general Motors.  And I know I was there when King was shot, because I came into General Motors the next day with a black armband on.  And I went down to the coffee shop, and it was filled up.  And I took a seat, right?  The next thing I know, there was nobody in there but me.  (laughter).  That armband scared them off.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Now, '68' [1968].  Now, let's put it in perspective, now.  In Detroit, I think there was a major riot in '67' [1967], right?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And that was the, was that the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Algiers Motel thing, or something--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the Algiers Motel.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They had a big riot in '67' [1967].  So, when Dr. King was killed in '68' [1968]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: --there were also riots weren't there, after that?
Speaker 2: I missed all the riots.  And I, I missed a key part.  I left Detroit and moved to Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I left, I moved to Los Angeles just after the Watts riots, so I missed the Watts riots.  So, I stayed in Los Angeles, like two years.
Speaker 1: That's '66' [1966] to '68' [1968]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-Seven [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I came back just after--
Speaker 1: The Detroit riots in '67' [1967]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I came back after the Detroit riots.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you just missed those.  (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I missed both of, both of the riots.  (laughter).  And then I landed at General Motors, and I was there when Dr. King was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I forgot the L.A. part.
Story_ID: 39895
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, when you were in Los Angeles, did you work for--?
Speaker 2: I worked for Hughes Aircraft.
Speaker 1: Hughes Aircraft.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I also worked for Ebony Magazine.
Speaker 1: Ebony Magazine?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us about--
Speaker 2: I was a secretary at both.  I was like the first--at Hughes, I was the first black administrative secretary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course at Ebony I was the secretary to the guy who was heading up that office.
Speaker 1: In the Los Angeles bureau?
Speaker 2: Uh huh, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Who was in charge of that?
Speaker 2: Louis, his name was Louis Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, why would you come back from Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Because I hated it.  (laughter).  I wanted--I told you I liked Detroit.  I hated it.  I missed the seasons.  I'm an East Coast girl.  I missed the seasons, and I just didn't really like Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I made my way back to Detroit.
Speaker 1: As Berry Gordy was trying to get to Los Angeles (laughter).
Speaker 2: (laughter).  They kicked him out, kicked him out of Detroit.  You know they did.  (laughter).  We won't say that, will we?   But anyway, so I went back.  And that's when I worked for, I worked for General Motors.
Story_ID: 39896
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now all this time--now, did you do any writing as a--
Speaker 2: The only writing I did was when I was in, when I was taking my degree at Wayne State.  And I graduated from there in '73' [1973].  But I took a creative writing course, and I did a lot of poetry and stuff like that.  And I wrote a poem about the Black Panthers.  And my teacher didn't like it at all.  The students--
Speaker 1: Is this at Wayne State, or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The students understood, but the teacher did not like it at all.  (laughter).  And she marked me down.  I still have my poem.  But that's the writing I did.  I wrote about that, I wrote a poem about when Kennedy was assassinated.  I was into poetry at the time.  And I even tried to do some lyrics for Motown, which they accepted a few of my lyrics.  And then somebody stole one, and made it into a Grammy winning song.
Speaker 1: Which one was that?
Speaker 2: 'Chairman of the Board.'  I think it was 'Chairman of the Board.'  And it called 'Patches.'  And that was what I did.  Remember the song, 'Patches, I'm Depending--
Speaker 1: 'I'm depending on you, Son.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You wrote that song?
Speaker 2: I wrote it, and they took it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Clarence Carter made that song popular.  I think he got a gold record for that.
Speaker 2: I know.  So, I typed writing lyrics.  I still have some lyrics that had, were set to music, that nobody's ever produced; I've got a couple of songs.
Speaker 1: That's really a heart-rending song.  And I remember it very well from the early seventies, yeah.  But you didn't get any credit for it?
Speaker 2: of course not.
Speaker 1: So, you send--
Speaker 2: They twisted a little--few words, and you know...  They took--and I went to this--I tried to get some information about copyrights from somebody in Ann Arbor.  And what he said was you can't really, you can't really copyright lyrics, per se, unless they have music to them, to it.  And you can copyright poems, but in groups.  So, I lost out.
Story_ID: 39897
Speaker 1: Now, these are days--late sixties, early seventies in Detroit, a lot of poets.  So, we were talking earlier about Ron Milner, the playwright.  And he was also a poet; he passed away.  I think there was the guy, Dudley Randall Broadside--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Naomi Long Madgett.  There's a lot--did you know some of the, the poets--?
Speaker 2: I know Dudley.
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: And I know Ron.  And I also know that Motown had a reputation of accepting lyrics from people and paying people...  You know, people were writing lyrics.  And they were just like, more or less, quote unquote 'pilfered' lyrics from folks...  and pay maybe a little bit...  and they'd go out and make money.  So, I know that one reason that one of my songs did not get produced is because I had a songwriter's contract which was fifty-fifty, and fifty percent to them and fifty percent to me.  But before they would produce it, they wanted me to give them some money under the table, and I said no.  So, I still have the lyrics. (laughter).  I said no.  I said, 'You're getting half already.  Why do you want more, more of my half?'
Speaker 1: Now, were you a part of any writer's collectives or anything?
Speaker 2: Uh uh.  I was just trying stuff out.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know there were plenty of cultural groups that were trying to--you know, form organizations, you know, for writers and, you know--
Speaker 2: No, it was just me.
Speaker 1: --poets and...
Speaker 2: I... yeah...
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, did you have any poems published in any of the magazines in those days?
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Speaker 1: Not yet, huh?  Okay.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  I keep saying I'm going to publish these poems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I do have them up on-line in one of my websites called 'Marlene's Musings.'  I put them there, but I haven't published them.
Story_ID: 39898
Speaker 1: I interrupted the story about Dr. Marin Luther King, but there's--when you were at General Motors, you told a story before we started about what happened--you know, the aftermath of Dr. King's assassination.  How did you find out?  You were at work when you found out about it?
Speaker 2: I was probably at home, because I came in to work with a black armband.  So, I know I was at home.  I didn't--they didn't give them out at GM (laughter), so I was at home.
Speaker 1: There was some sort of--
Speaker 2: But there was a memorial service at the Shrine of the Black Madonna.  So much was going on then.  I think it was for Dr. Marin Luther King.  I know Rosa Parks was there.  That was the first time I laid eyes on Rosa.  But so, I knew about it, and I said, 'Well, I'll call in sick, and I'm going to this memorial.  And I did that.  And when I got back to work, the day I got my check, they had taken off a day's pay.  And I was going like, 'Wait a minute, my check is wrong.'  They said--I said, 'I called in sick.'  And they said, 'Well, I understand you were at the Shrine of the Black Madonna.'  I said, 'Well, how would you know that?  Did you go?'  Because I know they didn't go there.  And, 'Well, we heard.'  And I said, 'Well, now I called in sick.  When other people call in sick, do you question them about whether they're really sick or whether they went shopping?'  And they said, 'Well, no.  Did you go shopping?'  And I said, 'Yeah, I went shopping.'  And that was the end of that.  I got my money.
Story_ID: 39899
Speaker 1: As we enter the seventies, then you're writing and trying to, you know...  Are you writing any essays or anything?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't really--what happened was, I used to work for SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] for awhile.  And then I got a job with Congressman [John] Conyers.  And at that time, Rosa Parks was working with him, and she stayed there until she retired.  But, and so, I got a job with Congressman Conyers.
Speaker 1: John Conyers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, give me some years.  Now, when did you work for SCLC?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Is this in the seventies after you came back from L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was after.
Speaker 1: After that, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, would this be in the--?
Speaker 2: And then I went to work for Congressman Conyers.  Now, my daughter was born in '71' [1971].  So, I had worked for Conyers maybe a couple of years, and then I became pregnant.  And so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you worked for John Conyers' office there in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this, it seems to me--and correct me if I'm wrong.  It seems like you have a reputation as a fine secretary, right?
Speaker 2: (laughter).  I was good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you seem to moving from the Veteran's Administration to General Motors?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, I worked for John.  And then I went back after my daughter was born, and I worked with him briefly.  And then I understood that the Associated Press was looking for--  A friend of mine told me that somebody had just left the Associated Press, and there was a job opening, and they were looking for somebody black.  So, I thought about it for about a week.  And I said, 'Well, I might as well try it.'  Because I knew I could write.  So, I did go in, and I did take the test, and they did hire me.
Story_ID: 39900
Speaker 1: So, this is in what year?
Speaker 2: I got hired in, I think '72' [1972].
Speaker 1: 1972, okay.
Speaker 2: And what they said to me was that they had a one-year training program, and they were going to hire me under that.  And so, that's what, that's what happened.  But actually, they didn't really have a training program.  What they did was, they showed me the different wires and you know, walked me around the room, and they sat me in front of the computer, and then they sent me out on the street.  And I covered stories and I wrote stories.  There was one guy who was on the desk who was always like reluctant to give me stuff.  And anyway, somebody amongst them had a complaint that I wrote too slowly.  So--
Speaker 1: You had no training whatsoever, right?  Except for how to, how things functioned--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean you still trying to develop...
Speaker 2: Right, no training, no training.  And so, like nine months in, the boss decides that he's going to retire, and he's going to dump me.  And I said oh, my gosh.  And so, I was very upset.  And so, a friend of mine--well, a co-worker...  There was a guy who I'm still in touch with who is now the--I heard he's the managing editor at the Detroit News.  His name is John Wolman.  John came in during that period of time when I was there.  John, his dad was a newspaper guy in Madison, Wisconsin, so John grew up with newspapers.  And John taught me a whole lot.  If it wasn't for John, I wouldn't have been able to really work at the AP, but John taught me a whole lot.  And I would write, and if was doing it too long, he'd say, 'Get up off that copy.'  (laughter).  I love John.  And so, I would get up off that copy.  But it wasn't that it was poorly written, it was just I kept re-writing myself, and John knew it.  So, anyway when that happened, he and another co-worker named Marty Hirschman came to me.  And I was in the Guild, and they said, 'Well, do you want to file suit, if we can get other people to join you?'  And I said sure.  And so, that's what happened.  They got eight other people.  I was--and they were all black except one woman, Francis Leewine, I believe, a white woman.  And the rest were black guys and maybe a black woman.  And that's how the suit went forward, until it got to the class action part, until it got to the--what do you want to call it?  It split to the civil suit, it got to the civil suit.  And that's when they--this woman who was going after the money who was an attorney in New York, dumped my name off.  The reason I knew that happened is because a woman that I was working with in the Guild named Louise Walsh, I ran into her, and we were on a plane together.  And she said, 'You know what?'  We had become friends.  She said, 'I don't remember seeing your name on the suit anymore.'  And I said, 'Well, why wouldn't it be on there?'  And so, she told me who to call, and I called the guy, Sid Wrightsman, and I asked him.  And he waffled and told me about the attorney in New York who was doing the other part of the suit, the civil part.  And when I talked to her, she was really nasty.  And she was going, 'You know, it takes a lot to be a named complainant on a suit.'  I said, 'I've already been on there seven years.' 'Well, you decided you wanted not to be on it.'  I said, 'No, I did not.  Nobody asked me, you just took my name off.'  'Well, we got, we want to represent women.'  And so what happened is, the suit turned from black and one white, to all white and one black.  And the one black--the one that went to the civil suit.  They took my name off and put another woman's name on it--a black woman who I had never heard of before.  And that's how it went down.  So, when the money came out--of course Simeon Booker wrote about it in the Jet for me.  But they got like eleven or twelve grand, and I got fifteen hundred dollars.
Story_ID: 39901
Speaker 1: And I wasn't in it for the money.  And so, I was really insulted when this woman said to me, 'You know, it's difficult to be a named complainant.'  I said, 'Well, who are you telling?  Who are you telling?  I've been going through this for seven years now.'  So, anyway, after that, my name was mud and I couldn't get jobs in the industry.  So, after we won the suit--I don't want to leave this part out because...  After we won the class action part, the Newspaper Guild called me and offered me a job in Washington.  That's how I got there.  And I went to work for the Newspaper Guild, because they were all behind me when I was suing the AP, right?  So, I figured okay, cool.  And I was the assistant to the guy that, the editor of the Guild Reporter, and the person who did the research and... the research--half and half.
Story_ID: 39902
Speaker 1: What the suit was about originally was racism.  There was no reason for him to fire me, because they were--I was filing a copy, and there was nothing wrong with the copy.  There was no other reason.  And so, what we did was we filed a suit in terms of discrimination.  One of the guys who was on the desk wouldn't give me copy when he was on there, so a lot of times I would sit there and not have anything to do.  We had to write both for the wire and for broadcast--print and broadcast.  And they wanted to claim that I wasn't doing it fast enough.  And later on, I find out this one guy who was there--and he used to really file fast, and I knew why.  He wouldn't, he wouldn't write through.  He would just file, write the top sentence and then file the same that had been filed before.  So, he was like cheating.  But anyway, it was based on racial discrimination.  And because I was a woman, that was tagged onto it as well, yeah.  So, that's what happened.  Now--
Speaker 2: The suit was in, so you joined the AP in '72' [1972]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, the suit was--about what time was the suit filed?
Speaker 1: The suit was filed when I had been there nine months.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's when they were trying to let me go, because it didn't actually--it was supposed to be a year-long training program.  So, they didn't even give me the whole year, yeah.  So--
Speaker 2: So, this is still '72' [1972]?  And then how long did it take for the suit to--
Speaker 1: About ten years.
Speaker 2: About ten years?  So that's in--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Eighty-Two [1982].
Speaker 1: It was seventy--yeah, it was about ten years, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But I was at the point where I was going to tell you something, but I don't remember what it is.  I was telling you about Marty Hirschman and John Wolman, who filed a suit.  Marty Hirschman took the lead and filed a suit on my behalf.  And like I said, they added eight other people.  But when the suit, when the civil action went down, the suit had completely turned from blacks and one white, to white--all white women and one black.  All the black guys were gone from the suit.  The claim was that they didn't want to wait.  And I was going like, 'Yeah, right.'  So, that's what it turned out.  When it came time for the money to be doled out, black folks didn't get it again.
Speaker 2: Well, that's a heck of a trick.  I haven't heard that one before.
Speaker 1: Well, I hadn't heard of it either.  (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's why they pay these people lots of money to be lawyers, so--
Speaker 1: Oh, I was so mad at that woman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was so rude to me, like I was...  'You're messing...'  She said, 'You're messing up my suit.'  I said, 'What are you talking about, your suit.  I'm the one that started this suit.  Your suit?'
Speaker 2: That is some trick.  I haven't--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a trick.  People started waffling.  Sid Wrightsman, who had been so nice to me all along, didn't have answers all of a sudden.  They referred me to her. Nobody wanted to--
Speaker 2: So, Simeon Booker wrote about it in 'Jet'?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he put a little piece about it in Jet, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My good friend, Simeon, yeah.
Story_ID: 39903
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, at any rate, so--
Speaker 2: So after that--
Speaker 1: You worked for the Newspaper Guild immediately after--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --filing the suit?  After it was filed?
Speaker 2: After, how did that happen?  I went to work for the Newspaper Guild in '75' [1975], because I moved to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because you say you were like kind of blackballed then, and you couldn't get a job as a--
Speaker 2: No, well--
Speaker 1: You went to the Guild in '75' [1975]?
Speaker 2: '72' [1972], yeah.  Yeah, I couldn't get another job in the newspaper industry.  I tried at the Free Press, I tried at Detroit News.  But then the Newspaper Guild did offer me this position, and it was working for two guys who hated each other's guts.  (laughter).  And so, there I was, stuck in the middle.  And I had to work--actually, I had to actually physically move--side by side offices...  I had to actually, when I was working for the editor, I'd sit in his office.  When I was working for the research guy, I had to move over there and sit in his office.  So, I made a decision on my own that I would stay in the office of the editor, because I could easily do research in there.  So, while I was in there, one time when I was doing some research--just going back and looking at old Guild reporters to find out information about strikes, right.  And I noticed that the research guy kept coming in and pulling stuff down off the shelf.  The next thing I know, he was chastising me because he said I didn't do it right.  He said I'd missed a lot of copy.  He said this, and he said that.  So, the next thing you know, they were getting ready to fire me.  So, I said okay.  And I stepped out of there... [did I mess the mike up?]  I stepped out of there and went to eat.  You know, I had a friend there.  And I filed a suit against the Newspaper Guild, because they were trying to dump me because these two idiots--excuse me--these two guys couldn't manage their work.  And it only made sense to me--instead of shuffling every other day--to sit in one office and do the work.  So, they gave me an evaluation, and they hadn't presented me with the evaluation.  They just decided that we can't keep you, because of this evaluation.  I said, 'Well, what are you talking about?  You haven't talked to me about an evaluation.  You haven't warned me about anything.'  And that's when I went to the EEOC.  And I had a friend there, and he walked me through it.  And there was another suit.  And that time, I got a little money, and I was able to use it to put a down payment on a house.  It wasn't that much, but it was enough to make a down payment.
Speaker 1: Now, the Newspaper Guild job, was it here in D.C., or--?
Speaker 2: It was in D.C.
Speaker 1: In D.C., okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  They were right across the street from The Washington Post, when The Post was having that big strike, and the helicopters were landing on the roof.  (laughter).  I was across the street looking.
Story_ID: 39904
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, after that I went into public relations.  I worked for the National Caucus and Center on Black Aging.  And from then on, I kept working--
Speaker 2: National Caucus and--
Speaker 1: Caucus and Center on Black Aging.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They're still, they're still in D.C [Washington, D.C.].  They're still going.  And I worked for several others, which you have on my resume.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I ended up--after doing some temp work and stuff, I ended up, I worked for the National--I'm sorry--the National Urban League, the National 4-H Council. And I ran into a woman I know who told me that they were looking to hire at the Washington Times, and she encouraged me to send in my resume.  And I waited and waffled again--waited, waited.  And after a week, I decided, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, let me go back a little bit.  Now, let's get some dates on some of this activity.  So, you came to D.C. to work for the National Council in seventy--
Speaker 1: No, I came to D.C. to work--
Speaker 2: I mean the Guild, rather.
Speaker 1: Guild.
Speaker 2: In '75' [1975], yeah, in '75' [1975].  Okay, in 1975.  Then--
Speaker 1: In '76' [1976], I went to work for the National Caucus and Center.
Speaker 2: National Caucus and Center in '76' [1976], alright.  And so, then you had other jobs at the Urban League, the National 4-H Council--?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What were some of the, any highlights here?  You know, anything you really enjoyed in this--
Speaker 1: I enjoyed working for the National 4-H Council, because it was working with young people.  And you know, every summer they would have young people from all over the country coming to the 4-H Council for a week of activities.  And then every winter, every fall or winter, they would have a National 4-H Congress in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right, you were telling me--
Speaker 1: And I enjoyed that, because we'd go to Chicago and they'd have a week of activities.  But I liked working with the college age young people.  That was fun to me.  And of course, with my farming background, (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I met a lot of kids that have... you know...  But it was a lot of work, typing up press releases for every winner from every little country, every little town in the United States who did something, who won a sheep contest--who won this...  Yeah, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, this is all through the eighties, I guess.  You were doing, you were working the Urban League, the 4-H Council--?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: --the National--
Speaker 1: Committee Against Discrimination in Housing.
Speaker 2: Against...  Okay.  Now, these are all, you're really getting quite an education on some level.  You know, anytime you work in these organizations--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I was.
Speaker 2: --the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing...
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was interesting, too.
Speaker 2: ...in-depth pockets of information a lot of people don't have.
Speaker 1: It was about testing--you know, they would send out testers to see if they could get houses.  And all that was interesting.  They're still doing some of that.
Speaker 2: And the test where they would send a white person and a black person out--?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: --to see what kind of deal they each could get?
Speaker 1: To see if they could get a, you know, they'd send them to the same place.
Speaker 2: With similar qualifications and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: Uh huh, uh huh.  And they'd find that the black families get turned away, and the white family would get, be able to get the, rent the house or buy the house.
Speaker 2: This is shocking.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's what I told you.  I didn't become an activist until I got out into the world on my own, because all this was eye-opening to me.
Speaker 2: So, at that time did you kind of believe that the housing market was fair, until you actually saw it?
Speaker 1: Well, no, I hadn't paid any attention.  I got a job, and once I got in there, I learned what was going on, you know.  And it was like unbelievable to me.
Story_ID: 39905
Speaker 1: So, so this takes us--  Now, when you heard about the Washington Times job, did you have any idea what the Washington Times was?
Speaker 2: I knew what it was, because I was by then following it.  And I knew The Star had folded.
Speaker 1: This is what, 1982 or so?
Speaker 2: The Star had folded, but I didn't get to The Times until 1994?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, The Times started what, in '82' [1982], I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: I think?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Washington--
Speaker 2: And so, a lot of the--a lot of the people from The Star ended up at The Times.  And the woman that approached me was one of those who had been at The Star.
Speaker 1: Kind of walk us through this.  Now, Washington Star was a rival of The Washington Post, on some level.
Speaker 2: Uh huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: A little rivalry.
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Because The Washington Post is a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I always liked The Star.  And I read both of them, but I liked The Star, and I was sad to see it go.  But--
Speaker 1: You liked The Star, but you were glad to see it--
Speaker 2: I said I was sad to see--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --sad, to see it go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but anyway, she told me about the job.  And I didn't apply right away, so she put somebody else on me to say, 'Girl, you better send them your resume.'  So, I did, and I got hired as an assistant editor--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, The Washington Times was--
Speaker 2: --for Features.
Speaker 1: It was founded by Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church--
Speaker 2: Right, the late.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And it was established as a conservative voice in the--
Speaker 2: Well, see, I wasn't politically aware enough to understand all of that.  I was a looking for a job (laughter).  And so, that's what happened.  I wanted to get back into the newspaper.  Actually, at the time, I was doing temporary work.  And I was working for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Association, that had to deal with guaranteeing the pensions of federal employees.  And so, I was working with them.  And the lady there liked me, and she was about to put me on staff full-time, instead of being a temp.  So, this opportunity came, to work at The Times.  And I said, 'I can't pass it up.  I've been wanting to do journalism all this time.'  So, that's what I shared with her--that I, you know, it's a once in a lifetime chance for me.  'And so, I thank you for your consideration of me as a full-time permanent staff person in the personnel department.  But I just have to make this change.'  So, that's when I went to The Washington Times.  And as far as it being conservative or not, I had no knowledge.  What I do know is that two black folks who worked there wanted me to come there.  And that's why I said okay, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, The Washington Times, 1994.  This is--
Speaker 2: I worked there almost ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, '94' [1994] to 2004 or 2003?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was in--it was in 2004, before my tenth anniversary, that I left to go pursue my degree at Divinity School at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what were you brought on to do at The Washington Times?
Speaker 2: To work in the Features department as an editor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I quite enjoyed that.  Oftentimes, I would also cover stories like Cece Winans and Eric Benet, and different ones that I wanted to cover... theatre.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you know, the cultural activities, the arts?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like it, yeah, the arts.  I love it.  And it was a good opportunity for me to get my, get there in depth and know what's going on.  Although one time there was--(laughter)--people are funny.  I'm running the paper--I'm doing what's out there.  It just so happened that there were two key events from entertainers that were black.  I put them both in the paper.  I got called on it.  'You're writing too many black stories.'  I said, 'Well, that's who's out there.  You know, we're covering the Kennedy Center, we're covering the National Theatre, we're covering...  That's who's out there.'  But they didn't like it.  And I was going, like, how could they say that, when everyday they have lots of stories about white people.  Why are they telling me I had two stories about black people?  I couldn't believe it.
Story_ID: 39906
Speaker 1: But then an opportunity came.  The same guy, Vincent, who got me, helped get me into the paper--he was moving on to something else.  So, I wanted his job in Metro, and they decided they would give me his job.  Vince McCraw, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, that made you the metro desk--
Speaker 1: Assistant Metro Editor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Look,' they said, 'We can't give you the same money that he was making, because he was with us for a long time.'  And I was going like, okay, here we go.  And I quite enjoyed that as well, because it was 'Breaking News,' and it was, you know...
Speaker 2: And what I've read--and I've only read a little bit about Washington Times...  I've seen The Washington Times from time to time here in D.C., coming to visit and stuff.  But I heard that The Times, first of all, it broke ground in terms of the way it was constructed.  It had ink that wouldn't rub off on your hands.  They had more color photos, better--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I had color for a long time.  That's what I loved about the arts.  I could put splashy colored photos on the front pages.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The ownership, you know, spared no money in terms of--
Speaker 1: Right.  And they made none.
Speaker 2: --publication.  Yeah, in fact they had a debt of over a billion dollars--I mean, well--
Speaker 1: They made none.
Speaker 2: Not debt, but spending--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they never made a profit.
Speaker 2: --capitalizing on, you know, to make sure it wouldn't fall into the tune of over a billion dollars.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But the other thing I heard, in addition to the graphics being flashier than The Post, and the ink being more permanent--the other thing was that the coverage of local news was keener in The Washington Times than it was in The Washington Post.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That _______ of The Washington Post had grown more to a feat to cover local stories.
Speaker 1: Right.  We, yeah, we beat them on a lot of things.  And I can tell you this: that you had a lot of opportunities at The Times that you wouldn't have gotten at The Post, because it was not a union paper.  So, you could do a lot of different things.  And Moon had put the edict down, I understand, that if it ever became unionized, he would close it down.  So, it's still not a union paper.  But that allowed you flexibility to do a lot of things.
Speaker 2: How so?  How does that allow for more flexibility?
Speaker 1: In other words, I could go back and lay out pages in the back shop.  In a union, you couldn't touch those pages.  You could send them back to them, but that was it.  You didn't get to cross lines, and do different things.  And I wouldn't, as an editor, be able to run out and cover stories, you know.  I would have to stay and edit.
Speaker 2: Okay, stay and edit.
Speaker 1: So, there was a lot of flexibility.  I would draw the pages, and I would go back and make sure it was correct, and all that.  So, I think there was a lot more that I learned.  And I was allowed to go on press trips, just to travel and write travel stories.  And there was another person who was the travel editor, but he would sometimes shoot me...  If he wasn't going, he would say, 'You want to go?'  And I would go, and I would cover the story.  So, I got to go a lot of places.  And I don't think that happens in union shops.  Yeah.  So, if you aren't able to go, I think the story just doesn't get done, I don't know.  But I know that I had a lot of opportunities when I was there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now did, when you were there though, did the editorial policies or positions of The Times disturb you at all?
Speaker 1: What do you mean by the editorial policies?
Speaker 2: Well, being very conservative, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the way I felt about it is, the truth is the truth.  And if I was going to write a story, I was going to get the facts.  Now, they could shade it anyway they wanted to.  I know that one thing that would happen--was a friend of mine who was the religion editor--is that sometimes her story would get dipped into by the top boss, who would change stuff.  And one time there was a kerfuffle with some, I think Muslims, because he dipped in and made something incorrect because of his point of view.  But from doing the metro stuff--and oh, I think one time I did get chastised because--it was about Marion Berry, and they didn't think I was harsh enough on him.  But I was telling the truth about what was going on at the time.  But they wanted me to dig back into when he said, 'Somebody set me up.'  And it wasn't--to me it wasn't pertinent to the story at the time.  So, I didn't dig back.  But they went in, and 'You didn't do this right.'  So, that's the only time that I really felt the conservative bend interfering with my, what I was doing.
Story_ID: 39907
Speaker 1: Now, the story about you writing too many black stories--that's, that had to do with a managing editor named Koons (ph).  I can't think of his first name.
Speaker 2: Fran, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Francis Koons (ph), yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now he--
Speaker 2: He's a Facebook friend of mine.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was Fran.
Speaker 1: Before this interview, I was reading a Huffington Post article from 2006 where a fellow had a, was criticizing Francis Koons (ph) and his wife for being a... and they mentioned you.  That's why, that's how I saw it.
Speaker 2: They mentioned me?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were cited as somebody that had experienced racism at--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --at the Washington Times, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I have to see that, because I didn't know they wrote about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in the Huffington Post.  I can't think-the guy's name was--let's see exactly who wrote it.  George Archibald.  Right, George Archibald.
Speaker 2: Oh, George Archibald, wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And what he did, he cited--he wrote an article citing The Times, well, George Koons (ph) as being a racist.  And they said it wasn't--I mean of course The Times said it wasn't true.  And he cited statements by Koons' (ph) wife, actually, who writes for 'Right Wing.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: There are variations that basically said that, 'Oh, he's not--he has the same views I have, except he can't express them in The Times, because they're too strong.'
Speaker 2: They are.  She's way out there, I'm telling you.
Speaker 1: And then he cited your incident, that you were, you know--
Speaker 2: My incident?
Speaker 1: The one about you were writing too many black stories.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Oh, yeah, that.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he quoted you on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you're not the only one that's criticizing him.  There other people that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was the point he was trying to make.
Story_ID: 39908
Speaker 1: But you were--so, at The Times, did you have a highlight of your time with The Times?
Speaker 2: Highlight?  I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Or a time you were able to make a difference through what you wrote?  Or, do you think you got information out that nobody else knew about?
Speaker 2: Well, I think of only one incident where I was on the lead on something.  And that was when there was a fire right over here at Fort Lincoln.  And one of the firefighters ended up dying from that fire, as a result of it.  But I went out--I stepped out to get my mail, or something, and I saw all these fire trucks.  So, I went over to see what was going on, and there was a fire going on.  So, I called The Times.  And the guy I called on the desk, at first he didn't want to cover it.  'We don't cover spot news.'  I said, 'Well, why not, I'm right here.'  So, he decided that they would cover the story.  And he sent out another reporter to come out and cover it.  And we won an award for local spot news coverage, because you know...  So, I was out front on that.  I wasn't at work, I was off that day.  But I guess something I said to him made him decide to re-group (laughter).  I said, 'Well, I got all the information.  What do you mean, you don't cover spot news?'  So, he did, and we got an award.
Speaker 1: What were the--as metro, the assistant metro editor, what were some of the issues that you remember here in D.C. that you think were the most dramatic, I guess, of the paper in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I don't know--seems like they all tumble together now.  I've been away for such a long time, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: I know Marion Berry's crisis or whatever you--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I think the one thing that did happen is--that's when Maureen Bunyan stepped down from her position at, what is it, WJLA?  Anyway, she stepped down.  And I called her, and I talked to Maureen for about an hour.  And they wanted a story.  I talked to Maureen for about an hour, got all this information, and I wrote it up.  The next thing I know, the very woman that brought me into The Times--she's still there, and I don't understand.  But anyway, the next thing I know, she--I see the story, and it's got somebody else's co-byline with me.  And I said, 'Well, who is this person?  They didn't contribute anything.'  And so, I went in and talked to Fran.  And I said, 'Fran, I don't know what you all are doing.'  I said, 'But she didn't contribute anything to this article.  You got everything that I wrote.'  I said, 'So, but if you insist, you can take my name off.'  And he said, 'Oh, no, we can't do that.'  I said, 'Well, you're doing something wrong anyway, just take my name off.  You want to give the woman credit for something she didn't do, just leave her name there.'  And so as it ended up, my name was there, and they gave her a tagline.  She still didn't do anything.  I couldn't believe it.  It was a friend of this woman's that brought me in, Debbie, and she wanted her to have some credit.  Well, fine, if you do something.  But I talked to Maureen for an hour, and she gave me the goods, and I wrote the story.
Speaker 1: They were trying to pass some kind of vicarious credibility onto someone else, or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Because she had a--I don't know, she used to work for--she worked for someplace that they thought must be good.  And so, they were trying to give her some credit for something she didn't do, on my dime.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 39909
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know that they re-wrote mine, but I know that the religion writer, Julia, they used to mess with her copy all the time.  They didn't like the religion angle, and ultimately they decided that they were not going to have a religion writer.  She was there 13, 14 years.  They're letting people go now.
Speaker 1: What was it--now, this is--the paper is founded by a minister--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of a giant church.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A worldwide church.  I mean what did he have against the religious copy--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, that was just her.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was a--?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was him.  I think the people that were running the paper decided that they couldn't deal with the religion writer.  Because she was, she's a standup woman, and she wouldn't let them get away with stuff.  And when they did that to her copy, she went out and confronted them.  And I think what happened was--the reason they gave--was one time was somebody from The Post interviewed her about something about The Times building, and the upkeep.  And what she said was something about seeing snakes in the...  (laughter).  She was in a meeting and she--there were snakes, there was a snake in the room.  Because they had stopped--you know, it's right back up against the woods, and some of the janitorial people were not there any longer.  So, it found its way inside.  And she made a mistake of letting herself be quoted in The Post talking about that.  And then they let her go.  And so now, they've got a religion writer who is a nasty guy.  Oh, he's horrible.  And it was a guy who I had met and talked with, and I thought he was kind of cool, thought he was okay.  But now when I see his columns, he reminds me of Mrs. Koons (ph).
Speaker 1: Interesting.  I mean, so you have--now you left The Washington Times in 2004?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So, almost ten years--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --you were there.  Do you--when you left, you were still assistant metro editor?
Speaker 2: I was the assistant metro editor, and I had gotten a call.  I think I explained to you about my call to go to Divinity School at Howard.  And I enrolled at Divinity School, and I thought I could do both because of the way the classes were scheduled, and because of the way I was scheduled at The Times.  Time wise, it would have looked fine.  You would have looked at it, and said, 'Oh, that can be done.'  But what I didn't know is how much work I was, how much reading I was going to have to do at Divinity School.  And so, I finally made the determination that I couldn't do both.  So, I turned in my resignation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I resigned from The Times.
Speaker 1: So, did that--did that cut you off completely, or does that mean that you retired, or what was it?  Did you get a retirement from them, or did you just resign cold?
Speaker 2: I resigned, and I missed out in terms of the 401-K.  You had to be there exactly ten years before you get all of what they put in.  So, I missed out in that regard, but I've never been a person that runs after money.  So, I had something more important that I had to do, which was going to divinity school, which I did.  But we left on good terms.  I mean they said--I mean, Fran said, 'Let me know what happens when you get out of divinity school.'  They were kind of like, 'You're going to divinity school?'  I said, 'Yeah, I am.'  And they wanted to know what--you know, 'Let me know what happens when you get out.'
Story_ID: 39910
Speaker 1: Now, you say you had a calling.
Speaker 2: I did have a calling.  I--
Speaker 1: Well, what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when you sleep, sometimes you dream about things.  And this particular night, I had a dream.  And the dream was telling me that you should go to divinity school, I want you to go to divinity school.  I want you to go to Howard [Howard University].  And when I woke up--  I usually don't remember my dreams.  But when I woke up, I remembered it, and I said, 'What?'  And I said, 'Okay, let me look and see what Howard has to offer.'  And so, I went on-line and I looked, and I saw what they had to offer, and I saw exactly what I wanted to study for.  It was a Master of Arts in Religious Studies, Religious and Social Ethics.  I thought, wow, that fits right into who I am.  And so, that's--I got busy.  I got on the phone to call to ask about registration.  And the woman on the phone told me, 'Well, we can get you in this semester.'  I was thinking of going the next semester, to start the next semester.  She said, 'We can get you in this semester.'  I said, 'Really?'  And so they did, and so I went.  And then I graduated in '07' [2007].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a wonderful experience.
Story_ID: 39911
Speaker 1: Well, what, tell us about the experience.  Who were some of your teachers, and some of the things you learned at divinity school [Howard University].
Speaker 2: One of my favorite teachers was Dr. Gene Rice, who had been for years.  And he taught New Testament, and everybody loved Dr. Rice.  He's retired now.  And of course, Kane Hope Felder, who has written this--who has his own Bible, has written this black version of the Bible which I have a copy of.  Ian Straker, who did the Bible history, I believe.  And one of my other main favorites is Cheryl Sanders who was my advisor in--she really is the person who does the religious and social ethics piece.  So, we read things like 'God's Long Summer' by a guy named Marsh.  It was wonderful.  It was about the Civil Rights Movement, and it's about how the churches--the white churches and the black churches--were not, were separated, and some of the things that went on in the churches during that time.  It was a very good, very interesting book.  But yeah, Dr. Sanders is one of my favorite folks.  She's been there a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did, I suppose you had to write a thesis or something?
Speaker 2: I had to write a thesis, yes.  And at the time, it was right after Katrina.  And so, I wrote my thesis on Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and blacks in the Diaspora, and it was based on a lot of things that happened during Katrina.  And yeah, she gave me an A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what were you--what, can you sum it up for us, what you were writing about?
Speaker 2: I was really just looking at some of the issues, like how the people were treated; how the government responded.  You know, what happened to people--why it happened in the first place, in terms of the levees breaking and what New Orleans was like, and the people that came there.  And you know, the historical piece was it's a mix of different racial groups and different cultures that still stands today.  And so I just looked, gave an overview of everything--you know, the political fallout and what the politicians were doing and what they didn't do, and what they should have done--stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That sounds kind of analytical, but is there, what's the theological or the spiritual--?
Speaker 2: Well, religious and social ethics.  So, when you talk about social ethics in this particular thesis--do they have any ethics, or don't they?  Some of the stuff was not ethical, like leaving those people in the Superdome, or wherever.  Was it the Superdome?  Yeah.  And not, you know, not taking care of folks--and the late response, you know.  It was horrible.  So, that's kind of why I was in religious and social ethics, looking at how people behave ethically--or don't behave, you know.  So, I had kind of a wide range.  But she approved it.  And I think we first had--in her class, we had to give like the first twenty pages, and then we went on from there.  If she approved it, then we could go on.  And so, she approved it.
Speaker 1: Now, at any juncture, I mean, do your journalistic ethics and spiritual ethics come together?
Speaker 2: Converge?
Speaker 1: Converge.
Speaker 2: Well, what I can say is they should, and they do.  For me, truth--you know, and being ethical--they might not for some people.  One of the most difficult things that I had to do was put my own voice in stories--in articles, in papers--because as a journalist, you're observing, and you don't put your voice in it.  And so, I had to make that transition.  And it took a little, it took a minute, for me to, you know, write.  Because I had one professor say, 'Well, what do you think about it?'  And I was going like, 'What?'  (laughter).  I didn't know he wanted me to put that in, because I was used to writing journalistic style.  But that was a transition I had to make, and I made it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was all good.
Story_ID: 39912
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: I--one of my hopes and concerns is--well, I have a number.  We need to get back to basics.  By that, I mean we need to stop killing each other.  Young people need to stop killing each other.  There are so many things that impinge on their consciousness that, you know, they--the adults may not be leading them well, by just...  It's like a time when anything goes.  And whatever they do is okay.  And the parents are not being parents.  They're trying to be kids, and the kids are not being directed properly.  They're killing each other too much.  And I'm wondering, well, where are their parents, and why do they have guns in the first place?  I don't understand.  We've got to get back to some real concern about ourselves.  You think about it, and you think that Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King]--all that he did was--he talked about non-violence; that was his mission.  Now, here we are more violent than ever.  And yet people want to raise his name when the time is right, but they're not doing what they're supposed to do.  And so, everything seems like it's in chaos.  And the young girls, I mean, I see it on TV everyday--the young women who are saying, 'Well, is he the daddy or isn't he?'  Well, wait a minute.  And the guys who... 'I'm not the daddy.'  Well, wait a minute.  You people ought to be able to be more responsible as young people, you know.  There's ways that you can keep from being the daddy.  There's ways that you can keep from being the mama.  I mean, so why are you on TV yelling at each other?  It's ridiculous, it totally is.  And there's just, like, no ethical behavior, it seems like--no morals.  Anything goes.  'I want money, and I'm going to do anything to get it.'  I don't know all the answers, but I do know it hurts my soul to see what's going on, it really does.
Story_ID: 39913
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on everything you've done professionally...  Now, you're not--well, let me just... You were telling me earlier you're not a practicing minister.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You mean you got a degree in theology, but the calling is not to necessarily preach--
Speaker 2: Not to preach, no.
Speaker 1: --but to get the information, I guess, or--
Speaker 2: Right.  It was a calling in that it was a calling to a ministry.  I often tell people that I'm like Moses.  Moses didn't like to speak in public, so Aaron did it.  I'm like Moses.  I bring you the news, but somebody else may voice it.  Everybody is not supposed to be a pastor, and I know that I'm not supposed to be.  If the time comes when I'm supposed to be in a pulpit, I'll know it.  But I am a person who is very shy of speaking to large groups of people, and I always have been.  I think I told you I was in a senior play, but I was trembling, (laughter) with my little having to say.  And a lot of, if you know it, a lot of people who are actors and actresses are shy people.  And I'm a shy in a way.  And when I tell people that, they say you can't be shy.  Yes, I am, in a way.  And that's the way in which I'm shy.  And if you're a preacher, you've got to preach.  And you perform, and you've got to get people to listen.  And if you're standing up there and your voice is trembling, you're not going to get the word across.  And one of the things I had said to myself a long time ago, Dr, King is my model for oratory.  If I can't get there (laughter), I'm not preaching.  And I'm serious about that.  If you can't be effective in it, why do it?  And I'm not effective in that.  I'm a writer.  I can be effective as a writer.  And so, I do write for my church.  I do write for other people, but I'm not effective as a speaker to large groups of people.  So, I'm leaving that alone, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you consider doing any counseling or any other kind of--?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things I thought of when I got the calling was counseling, because it seems like a lot of people come to me for advice.  But then I came to understand that pastoral counseling is somewhat different.  It's for real, and you counsel people who are in grief and all of that.  My soul was too fragile for that, I think.  So, I don't do counseling.  I didn't want to go into that on that level.  I took one course in pastoral counseling and it was interesting, but I knew it wasn't going to be a fit for me, yeah.  So, if people want my advice, I'm willing to give it on an ad hoc basis, but not as a professional pastoral counselor.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you do take some projects, some writing projects, from time to time?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I've been busy ever since I've been retired.  I continue--maybe almost eight or ten years--that I've written a magazine for the Washington Urban League, which I'm currently involved with.  They have a gala every year in honor of the late Whitney M. Young, Jr.  And we put together a very glossy magazine about all the activities of the Urban League, and it's given out at the gala.  And so, I'm kind of in the throes of writing it now.  And I enjoy doing that, because it gives me a perspective of what's going on in the city and what's going on in terms of activities for young people.  I think if more young people did get involved with the Urban League, we could save more folks.  They have programs for fathers, to help them father their children.  They have programs for veterans and the homeless.  They have programs for young people and camps.  So, there's programs for the entire family, if more people would get involved.  They're right up in Columbia Heights; it's not a far place.  And if you--and they have nutrition programs, they have programs for the elderly.  If you need help with your children, with your families--you need to go the Urban League and see what they have to offer, and maybe volunteer, and you'll find out some things.  They have scholarships for young students, and that's a pride.  Every year, they give out a lot of scholarships to young people who have decided that they really want to do what's right.  And so, you know, there's organizations out that will help people.  But somebody has to point them in the right direction, and maybe then we can save some of our young people.  And I think the whole thing about the 2nd Amendment rights--they always leave out the part about the militia.  That was for the militia, it wasn't for everyday people that have guns.  But they conveniently leave that part out.  We don't all need guns.  Like I said, I grew up in a house where there was a gun.  It was on a farm.  They would go out and shoot something, if they had to.  But we didn't ever bother the guns.  It was not an issue in our homes.  We didn't ever pick up a gun against each other.  I mean, so I don't understand this madness about we need to let people buy guns whenever they want.  That's ridiculous, that's totally ridiculous.  Why do we need that?  There was a time in this country when you did, when it was getting settled, yeah.  You're going out west, and you don't know what's there, okay.  That's not this time.  You know, that's passed.  And the whole thing about 2nd Amendment--if you're going to quote it, quote the whole thing.  That's what you call social ethics.  They're not being ethical when they don't talk about the militia part of it, and that's what it was written for.  And some people say it was written (laughter), written so that black folks wouldn't be able to have guns.  Do you hear me?  Yeah.  So, don't talk about 2nd Amendment rights.  That's the only rights you want to talk about.

Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done professionally, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, some people would say, I guess, the thing at the AP [Associated Press}.  I'm not sure if it's still going on, though.  It seems like we have to keep walking the same road to get the same, to get to the same place.  I think they might still have it, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, what is specifically--?
Speaker 2: But, what I do know--
Speaker 1: What is it specifically?
Speaker 2: The internship program for minorities.  But what I do know is that there more minorities working at the Associated Press, so maybe it's not needed.  I guess my legacy would be being a mom to a wonderful daughter who now has now has two wonderful young people, and being a good person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How to, being a person who has overcome is what--you know, they sing 'We Shall Overcome.'  Well, I overcame a lot, and I think I'm still a good person, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us some more about your daughter.  Now, you've had a--
Speaker 2: My daughter, my one and only lovely daughter.  (laughter).  Her name is Morenike.  Her dad is Nigerian.  We had a romance, and I have a daughter.  She is an emerging director, Black Pearl Filmworks.  She's done a lot of work.  She started out at--I'm sorry, she started out at BET.  And from there she's branched out, and she's been doing projects on her own.  And she's covered the Oscars, and she's done a lot of things.  So, she's right now trying to get a web series going.  She's got it all written out, but she needs funding.  So, we're trying to make that happen.  But she's a, she was a child who gave me no trouble.  And I was a single mom, so you know, it could have been that she was a hard person to raise, but she wasn't.  And thank God for that, because it worked out fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, is, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, is there any major thing that you wouldn't, that you'd do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the major thing that I would do differently is I would do more due diligence when it comes to, when it came to jobs and certain things.  But I was like raising my daughter on my own, so I had to do--I had to get a job.  I couldn't spend time doing due diligence to see if I, you know, it would fit me.  But, so, that's probably the only thing, I guess.  And I wouldn't get married twice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't do due diligence with that, either.  (laughter).  So, I--my desire was to have a family, a stable family.  But coming from my background...  And to have four kids and a stable family... but, I didn't do my due diligence, trying to pick a husband.
Speaker 1: It was tough.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, it's not easy.
Speaker 2: And it's not easy.  It's not easy at all.  So, I've been a single woman most of my life.  But that's okay.  I've got a beautiful daughter out of it, and wonderful grandkids.  (laughter).  That's my family.

Speaker 1: Well, is there anything I need to talk about before I ask my...  Oh, I didn't ask you about NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists].  I didn't ask you about that.  Are you a member of NABJ?
Speaker 2: You could say I'm a member.  I've haven't paid my dues in a minute.  But I have been active, oh, for a long time.  When they first got organized, I was working for the NCBA (ph), National Association of Black _______, and they a conference here.  And at the time, because I was in PR, NABJ wasn't accepting PR folks.  And I remember standing in the hotel corridor with information to give to them, because they wouldn't let me register, even though I had the money.  So, you could say I've been there a long time.  And I have worked with the young people, I like doing that.  I worked on an NABJ monitor at the convention, where they'd run out and get the story, and you'd help them with the copy editing and what not.  It was always fun to me.  But my physical limitations have limited me from participating fully in the last couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they're still my heart.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I need to ask you about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  You pretty much dredged everything out of me that I had in me.  (laughter).  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Maam, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought I just answered that question.  How would I like to be remembered?  I'd like to be remembered as a friend, as somebody you could count on, as a good Christian woman, as a strong woman, as a loving person, as a good mom, as a wonderful grandmom.  And that's pretty much it.  And I was a good wife.  They have a show named after me, 'The Good Wife.'  And the same thing happened to her that happened to me.  (laughter).  So, yeah, that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you, it's been enjoyable.
