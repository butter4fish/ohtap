Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is July 16, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are currently at Morgan State University in the Department of Computer Science conference room, Room 205.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626364
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five warm-up questions that we ask.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is it?
Speaker 2: Oranges.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's April 1st.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Paris, France.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, in physics, we don't teach you what to think.  We think you--we teach you how to think about things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I've gotta go back to April 1st because I know that's April Fool's Day, but what is the significance for April 1st to you?
Speaker 2: April, the significance of April 1st to me was in my youth, it was usually the time of spring skiing, a good time to go spring skiing in the mountains at South Lake Tahoe or in Tahoe in California.  In my older years, it's a good time.  It's usually the start of the sailing season and first (unclear) occurred there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 626365
Speaker 1: All right, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we're gonna keep 'em separate and then bring them together later on.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Gloria Ann Jackson, G-L-O-R-I-A, A-N-N, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Nine [pause], nine three--I'm sorry.  Eleven, three, 1923 [November 3, 1923], Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's her maiden name?  I'm sorry, I didn't ask about that.
Speaker 2: Her maiden name is Stewart.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's S-T-
Speaker 2: S-T-E-W-A-R-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  What were they doing and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can trace them, on the Stewart side, I can trace them back at least to the 19--beginning of, 1900s and maybe back further.  If I go back as far as I can remember, my, the oldest ancestor I can remember was born in Madagascar [Republic of Madagascar, an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the southeastern coast of Africa].
Speaker 1: Now, who is this?  This would be who?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the name, but she was on the, my mother's side.  And she came over to the United States as an indentured servant and worked for a Confederate colonel who, after the war [Civil War], relocated to Columbus, relocated to Ohio.
Speaker 1: Now, where did she work for the Confederate--
Speaker 2: I believe she worked in Georgia, though I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: In Georgia, okay.  Now, this is interesting.  We've had, I think it was like last month, a person who traced his ancestry to Madagascar.  And it's not a usual, you know, path for black people in this country to have ancestors from Madagascar.  So this happened in this project.  Of a thousand or so interviews that I've done, I've heard three such stories, you know.  So there's something to this, and, you know, I just--it'd be interesting to follow up on that.  For anybody watching this, you know, I'm just saying that there is something to it.  They shouldn't dismiss it if they, oh, Madagascar, how could that happen, you know.  But, yeah, and actually, I've heard this story now twice outside of the project too, about Madagascar.  So, usually, the path is through the Gulf, you know, but I don't know--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --I don't know if that's the path your ancestor came, I mean made it to the U.S. from or not.  But--
Speaker 2: It was, like I said, from Madagascar.  Actually, a relative, a cousin of mine had traced it to the point where she had her, I guess they called it a contract, when she immigrated over here.  And then they went up to Ohio.  I'm not clear what happened after the war, but she went from there.  And she married a man, and then they moved up to Ohio.  And, well, Ohio, West Virginia.  And that became the, the beginnings of the Stewart family.
Speaker 1: So the man from Georgia's name was Stewart?
Speaker 2: I presume so, yes.  That was his assumed name, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother, Pearl Stewart, was one of, I believe, six sisters, who lived between Cleveland [Ohio] and West Virginia and Columbus [Ohio].  And she married a--, well, she married Joseph Stewart.  And I can't remember my grandmother's maiden name.  And he was, he worked for the railroad.  He was also a soldier during World War I and had gone over to, to France to fight, came back and worked for the railroad.
Speaker 1: So Pearl Stewart would have been born around the turn of the century, I take it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was 18--
Speaker 1: In the 1890s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe 1883, no, 1893.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she would have been about thirty-four, thirty-three when your mother was born?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so, so, okay, so your grandfather worked for the railroad?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Joseph Stewart.
Speaker 1: Now, was he a Pullman porter or a brakeman or--
Speaker 2: He might have been like a brakeman kind of person, but no he didn't have a porter position.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he passed, leaving my grandmother to raise, and her family to raise--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--
Speaker 2: --four children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626366
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] say about growing up?  What experiences did she have growing up in Columbus [Ohio]?  What was it like and--
Speaker 2: Well, she lived in an area in Columbus that was wedged between two segregated neighborhoods.  And, in fact, it was just one street wedged between that was Metropolitan Columbus, wedged between Arlington, what became upper Arlington and Grandview.  And on this one street, most of my family, both my--that's where my mother met my father.  And so you had this one street that went for two blocks that was cut off, wedged between these two communities.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the street?
Speaker 2: Sixteen--North Star Road.  And since she wasn't a member of those two communities, she had to catch the bus to Central High School in Columbus.  When she was growing up, they didn't have inside plumbing.  And she talked about that a lot in that, in my grandmother's house.  And, you know, she told stories about how she had grown up, you know, there and how they had, you know, played, you know, had grown up with my--who was, the man who was gonna be my father, Russell Jackson and his family.  And that she would talk a lot about, you know, how smart he was and all the numbers of books that he had read, even as a teenager.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, a lot about growing up in segregated Columbus, you know, lack of opportunities.  And then her experience--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  People would consider Columbus the North, you know, so how was it, I mean what was the segregation like in Columbus?  Was it overt or (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, it was pretty overt.  Like I said, we were sitting on this one, this two-block strip of North Star Road.  And on either side of you, you have two separate communities.  And so, for example, Granville High School, which you could literally see from my grandmother's porch, they weren't allowed to attend.  And the other high school in upper Arlington, they couldn't attend that one either.  They had to take a half hour bus ride.  And at the time, I think they had to pay for the bus.  Of course, you know, the cost was pretty nominal.  And they couldn't go to the movies because, you know, blacks weren't allowed in the movies.  Even though my mother and her sisters were light skinned, they, they couldn't go to the movies.  And just those kinds of things.  When they graduated, so it was more, when they graduated from Central High School, they all went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], the college, including my--now, my father went before them.  He went to Ohio State when he was fifteen years old.
Story_ID: 626367
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] talk about what her aspirations were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had said she had worked as someone cleaning houses.  And she knew she didn't wanna do that.  And I think that motivated her to go to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and seek a job as, well, in those days the main jobs were school teachers.  And so I think she went there with that aspiration, and I guess that changed to social work.  She graduated in social work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she married, when they were in school, she married my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have any stories about growing up that she shared with you that would be interesting to pass down?
Speaker 2: Well, she, you know, she felt that they had grown up, you know, very poor.  And the particular, the thing that she used to emphasize, that, was the lack of indoor plumbing and how embarrassed she was when, you know, people would come over to visit, and then they asked to use the bathroom, and they had to go outside.  That was the main thing that I recall.  I must admit it's been a long time so those things have eroded, and the fact that the only jobs for, you know, black people at that time, regardless of their skin color, seemed to be working cleaning the homes of people.
Speaker 1: What they called day work in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, day work.  It seems like she mentioned something about taking in, being like a seamstress or taking in that type of work, doing those kinds of things as the other alternative.
Speaker 1: Now, was it, was it difficult for her to get into Ohio State?  Now, we know Ohio State is a state school, but being from Ohio myself, I know that the state set up, assisted Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and then at one point took a portion of Wilberforce for its own to funnel black students from, you know, Ohio too, you know, so they wouldn't go to the other state schools.  I mean that's the, what we presume when we look back at it.  But was it hard for her to get in Ohio State or was it, any barriers to overcome?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know how that, 'cause I always thought that was odd.  I know that historically, the member of my, other members of my extended family had always been big in education, you know, big, strong supporters of education and had gone to what were called the "normal" schools of the day and that one of my ancestors was the former president of what's become, I think it was West Virginia State University [Charleston, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: What's the name?  Do you remember the name of the person?
Speaker 2: No, no.  But this would have been around the 18--, 1890s or something like that.  And but, no, I don't have any specifics on her admission to Ohio State.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting, knowing the time that she went to Ohio State.  Jesse Owens [track and field athlete; Olympics winner] had been there already, I guess, just thinking about her age growing up.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he would have already been there.  There were black folks there, but I'm just thinking it might have been hard to, or some kind of maneuver to get into Ohio State in those days, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 626368
Speaker 1: But, let me go then to your father's side.  Then we'll bring 'em together.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His full name is Russell Hunter Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is the Hunter reference to another family name that's important?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, his place of birth is Columbus, Ohio.  I'm not certain of his birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he was older than your mother [Gloria Ann Jackson], you said?
Speaker 2: Yes, but not by much.
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe 1920, you think or thereabouts?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And that'd be like, yeah, 1920, yeah, that would probably be right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, the stories I've heard had been that my grandmother on his side was a very dynamic woman.  She had gone to, she had married my grandfather and had gone to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] or had gone to college somewhere.  I believe it was Ohio State and gotten her master's degree.  I'm not even clear what the field was.  And then which was not the habit of the time, she divorced my grandfather and remarried into the Sawyer family.  She had--and which, again, she married, she had already had my father whom my grandfather, whom I knew as Mr. Jackson (laughter).  And so that was for those days, that was considered, you know, unconventional.  She was an outspoken woman.  Unhappily, she died early.  And my father was raised by the Sawyers who also lived on North Star Road, along that strip that's pretty much--those two families, that was pretty much the strip there at that time; also happened to be one of the first locations for Wendy's [hamburgers] (laughter) in Columbus.  But, and the Sawyers were, you know, fairly, a very interesting family.  They're, three of the brothers were Tuskegee Airmen.  My father also joined the [U.S.] Air Force, not as a Tuskegee Airman, but as a, he joined, he was fair skinned, so he was able to join the regular Air Force.
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back a second.  Now, these, the Sawyers that became Tuskegee Airmen were his half brothers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, they were--okay.  All right, so--
Speaker 2: And they became--
Speaker 1: They were younger than your father?
Speaker 2: They were older.
Speaker 1: Older, okay, so Mr. Sawyer already had some sons before he married your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they're stepbrothers then actually--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean, you know, I don't know if they even accept it that way, but they're
Speaker 2: And since, and he had a younger--
Speaker 1: Did he have any younger brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: No, he had a younger--no, no, he didn't have any younger brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was the youngest then in that family?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I think, 'cause he had a sister who was younger than him, stepsister that was younger than him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Mr. Sawyer got married again to someone else?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Or had been married to someone else previously before he met my grandmother, yeah--well, no, he got married again, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is long ago, so.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 626369
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but your father [Russell Hunter Jackson], he was, he enlisted in the regular Air Force.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But did they know--
Speaker 2: I mean regular [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Regular Army.  It was an Army Air Corp, I guess, the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But was he in the Air Corp?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he, did they know he was black?
Speaker 2: I [pause] don't think so or they weren't concerned.  Or they weren't that concerned (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, yeah, in those--
Speaker 2: I think it was he was light enough so, and he trained as a navigator, never saw action.  And, in fact, he was, his main duty was to train Chinese airmen.
Speaker 1: So he trained them here in the states though?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's interesting.  I never knew they did that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They brought Chinese airmen into Texas to train them, to go back to China--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just found this out as I, I dug through his discharge papers.
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: And I think he actually trained in Tuskegee [Alabama].
Speaker 1: You know, there's a, there's been a movement for the past few years to call anyone who trained at Tuskegee, you know, who is black, are the Tuskegee Airmen, you know, whether they were ground crew or whatever 'cause, at one time they, it was exclusively used to describe the pilots, you know.  But now they're saying, you know, they try to, now, they're more inclusive in terms of their--so, he may be qualified to be called a Tuskegee Airman now.
Speaker 2: Well, I, you know, until I read his discharge papers, that's what I called him, but as I was digging through my--my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] passed away two years ago, and as I was digging through her papers, I found his discharge material.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your father say about growing up?  Now, he grew up on that same block--
Speaker 2: Same block [as Jackson's mother, in Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: And you say that your mother said that he had read just about every book.
Speaker 2: Well, early on, he had demonstrated unique, you know, intelligence in terms of performance in school, memory and mental, what I call, mental fidelity.  And as a result, he was able to enter Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] at an early age, what we would consider an early age, fifteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that prior to the war [World War II], he was at Ohio State?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did he attend a special high school in Columbus or--
Speaker 2: No, he attended Central High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did he major in at Ohio State?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not clear.  He always wanted to be a lawyer.  So whatever you could major in to go to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did the war interrupt his college education?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  So, well, it didn't interrupt it.  I mean I believe he graduated, but then he joined the Air Corp or the Army, and after the War, because of the GI Bill, he was able to attend law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did he go to Ohio State Law School?
Speaker 2: No, he went to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He had always wanted to, at an early age, he always wanted to go to Harvard.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did he talk about his experiences at Harvard Law School?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother conveyed to me.  You have to realize my father died when I was four years old.  But my mother conveyed to me her experiences in Cambridge when he was at the law school.  And my father was very active in liberal politics there, what passed for liberal politics in those days.  And as a result of being at Harvard, he, you know, met, even with the people of Ohio, I believe it was Weiss Fowler, who was there at the same time.  And she, my mother would talk about he came, Fowler would come over for dinner and stuff.  And Fowler eventually became a governor or Ohio.  And I'm not sure if that's the name, but there was one person, one of his [Jackson's father] associates at Harvard became governor of Ohio.  Of course, this is after he died.  And she talked about, at the time, I believe there was another African American at Harvard who became a solicitor general, first black solicitor general of the United States.  And one of the remarks that, when he came back to Ohio, he found it very difficult to get a, you know, a job as an attorney 'cause he wanted to work for Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio].  He couldn't, even with a Harvard degree, couldn't get a job with Procter and Gamble or any corporate entity.  And so he wound up going into private practice.  And even that was very difficult because, you know, he, my mother said he complained bitterly that members of the black community wouldn't utilize his services and even members, you know, middle-class or well-to-do members of his own family wouldn't use his own services for, you know, routine matters like property transfers or whatever you have to do to get a business license, wills, those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he had also began to enter politics at that time.  He ran for, I believe the state legislature.
Story_ID: 626370
Speaker 1: All right, so your father [Russell Hunter Jackson] was, he ran for state office, you said he ran for state legislature?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I saw, I vaguely recall seeing some pictures of him during those days.
Speaker 1: So this would have been, what, about 1950 or so?
Speaker 2: It'd 19--yeah, probably like 1953 or '52 [1952], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was just before you were born, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: And see, I don't know whether it was before I was born or right after I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, my father had started his own law firm.  He, you know, began practicing.  Unhappily, in 1955, '56 [1956], he started having health problems.  And as it turned out, he had some form or heart disease.  I don't know exactly what it was.  You have to remember, this is, it might have been a, you know, a heart valve issue.  And this is pre-artificial heart valves.  And, you know, he passed away.  And that was, that left my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] alone to raise two children.
Speaker 1: So he passed away in '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now your mother was a social worker by that time, right?
Speaker 2: Well, she had been, you know, a stay-at-home mom, as we call 'em now.  So she had not been at work, no.  I mean she had a degree in social work, but she had not been working.  And so after his death, she did, she had to go to work.  And she worked for Franklin County Welfare Department.
Story_ID: 626371
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Gloria Ann Jackson and Russell Hunter Jackson] got together.  I know they lived right across the street from each other, but is there a story of how they got together and got married?
Speaker 2: Well, there was, my mother had four sisters.  And when they were in, well, her and her older sister were in college at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], my father had come over.  You know, I guess they began what we call now dating in, you know, and he would come over, and, you know, visit her at my grandmother's home, which was right down the street.  And the story she told me was is that he said, well, he really wanted to date her sister, but there, I guess there were other suitors for the sister.  So he dated her, and they were both at Ohio State [University].  And, you know, they fell in love and got married, you know, when they were both in college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was before the war [World War II] started?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 626372
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents [Gloria Ann Jackson and Russell Hunter Jackson] personalities and their gifts, their talents, their dispositions, their looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I think looks wise, I probably look more like, you know, my mother.  I think personality wise, I'm more like my father and that would be my, you know, in terms of risk-taking ability or comfort redress.  I think I'm more like my father than mother.  In terms of attachment to family and friends, I'm probably more like my father than mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 626373
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any, do you have vivid memories of your father [Russell Hunter Jackson]?
Speaker 2: No, I really only can remember about three things.  I can remember watching--remember Gillette [shaving/razors] used to have these, sponsored these fights on TV.  So I remember watching one of those.  I remember watching the old, original 'King Kong' [movie].  I remember sitting in the back of his MG Midget [two-seater sports car] that he had, you know, two-seater with a little, little space in the back.  And then I remember going, looking in his face when he was in his coffin at his funeral, during the viewing period.  And that's about, that's about it.
Story_ID: 626374
Speaker 1: Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, well, I had an older brother.  He passed away in 2003.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was his name?
Speaker 2: David Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just the two of you?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would probably be the 'King Kong' movie [that he watched with his father, Russell Hunter Jackson] (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Now, did--
Speaker 2: I distinctly remember King Kong biting off somebody's head (laughter).  Yeah, so you remember that scene (laughter).  But that would probably be my earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 1: Now, this is on television, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was on black and white, rabbit-eared television (laughter) that was probably fifteen inches.
Speaker 1: And what was your impression of King Kong (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, at the time I was petrified, and I figured well, the other thing, he might be running around here in Columbus [Ohio] (laughter) and wasn't quite clear of the size at the time.  But, yeah, I just remember that scene.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was a traumatic scene for a little kid in those days.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, I shudder to think what they think now on some of the stuff that's on.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, as you do these interviews, you ought to see how many people remember that scene (laughter), our age.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I certainly remember it.  I was a little kid.  I think I lost my dinner when I saw it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 626375
Speaker 1: But, so, now, did you live--where did you live growing up?  Did you live in the same place growing up or--
Speaker 2: No, no, soon after I was born the family moved--my brother [David Jackson] lived on North Star Road [Columbus, Ohio] for a time.  But soon after I was born or maybe when my mother was expecting, they moved out of, off of North Star Road to a community called East Gate on what's, I used to call the East side of Columbus.  Given the change in demographics, I don't know if it's still considered the East side.  But, and so we moved into a home there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you grew up basically in the same place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, at 1860 Clifton Avenue, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, well, we always ask this question.  What were, and kind of describe the neighborhood for us, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a middle-class neighborhood largely.  When I was growing up, there was an island in the middle of it that divided the two sides of the neighborhood.  And there was a--
Speaker 1: Like a boulevard type of situation, like--
Speaker 2: Well, it was kind of like a, it was kind of like a boulevard in a sense, but there were no--there was only one three.  And so you could use it as a, you know, a game field, a football field, we used to use it for or to play baseball and fly kites.  And there was, the one tree was a pear tree.  And every once in a while, for reasons I don't understand, pears would grow on it.  And then every once in a while, they were tasty.  That was the main thing.  And the other thing, it was surrounded by buckeye trees, to the point where they had become a nuisance.  And I can remember taking off one time through an area that had these buckeyes on it, and slipping on 'em and falling to the ground.
Speaker 1: Describe what a buckeye is 'cause a lot of people don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it looks like, and maybe it is, an edible nut.  I think the only thing that eats 'em are squirrels.  I'm not even sure they eat 'em.  It's, you know, a dark brown, if not black, with a light portion on the bottom of it.  And there's, the tree are very prolific, and they generate a lot of buckeyes.  I've since learned that there's some way--from my children growing up and reading some of the books, one book was, 'A Day No Pig Will Die' where it seems that one strategy for buckeyes was to allow a squirrel or some other animal that consumes 'em to eat 'em.  And then, you know, catch the squirrel, butcher it and then take out the half digested buckeyes and cook those, not something I've ever tried.  But that's what a buckeye is.  It's also, that's why you have the Ohio State Buckeyes [Ohio State University's intercollegiate sports teams].  Those trees are all around.  The other site was, there was a railroad crossing close by, and I remember that thing waking me up at night because of the proximity and causing the house to vibrate.  Then I remember in the summer it was seemingly--this was pre-air conditioning, at least pre-air conditioning for me, that it was like unbearably hot and humid.  And they had gnats everywhere, that, you know, it was just very, very unpleasant.  And then in the back of my house, there was a cherry tree which was very prolific every summer and two plum trees.  The other one was the noise of people bringing out their trash cans, the old aluminum trash cans.  That was something else that would wake you up early in the morning.  But it was the, the house was on a corner lot so I had, my room was on the quiet side, facing the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's some of the sights and sounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 626376
Speaker 1: Now, did you have much occasion to go downtown in Columbus [Ohio] or leave the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a big, that was a big event, was to get on the bus and go downtown to Lazarus, the department store there.  And they had other, you know, they, they had other shops and things downtown.  That was also closest to the main library.  But, generally, we stayed in, well, as I was growing up, stayed in East Gate, and the other thing I remember was, it was separated by, that, again, from my doorstep, there was another community, Bexley, ah, yeah, Bexley, which was not too far from my house.  And I can't remember the name of the street, but it'll probably come to me in a second.  But, again, you were separated from Bexley by one street.  And Bexley was a very rich--well, the Governor's mansion was in Bexley.  And it was a very well-to-do neighborhood with all the amenities such as swimming pools and parks, private schools and things.  And you were expressly forbidden from, you know, people seem to have this thing about swimming pools.  But they had this, you couldn't go to, you couldn't use their swimming pool (laughter).  You had, in those days, in fact, you couldn't even go across the street.  There was a park there.  It's called Alum Creek Park now.  Well, you had Alum Creek Park which was on my side of the street, so you could go down there.  But there was a, Alum Creek separated it.  And on the other side of Alum Creek, there was, I forget the name of their park, but there was another, there was the other side of the park, which these mansions back up onto.  And you were strictly forbidden from crossing the street or crossing the creek and going over there to that park.
Speaker 1: So, did you know anybody that actually went over there anyway?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you know, as children, yeah, we'd go over there.  And we, I don't know anybody that ever got to use the swimming pool, but, you know, my cousin and I would go over there and ride our bikes and stuff at night along the park, their park on their side.  One reason was is they were the only ones that had paths at that time.  On the other, in Alum Creek Park, they had put up some, later in life they had put up some basketball courts which attracted a lot of people.  So I stopped going there.  But, yeah, that kind of give you the, you know, so even, again, even though you're off North Star Road, there's a clear line of demarcation which you wouldn't go, couldn't go.
Speaker 1: So in Columbus, would people actually get hurt going on to the other side or arrested or would--
Speaker 2: Well, what would happen was--
Speaker 1: How were they discouraged?
Speaker 2: Well, normally, if you went over there, you know, the usual--I can remember one time going over there and having my, I was walking my dog, you know.  And I've never been one to walk her with a leash.  And I'd walked across, and I figured, well, I'm just gonna--I wasn't gonna go to the park part.  I was just, you know, along the side there.  I was gonna walk up to the next street, which was a considerable distance and then walk back and then take her home.  And as I was walking back a police car stopped, you know, the usual, "What are you doing?"  And I said, well, walking my dog.  He said, "Well, come on, I'll give you a lift."  And me and the dog got in the back of the car, and he drove me home.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And he asked me who I was and where, well, naturally, he had to know where I lived and stuff.  But, you know, it was clear then.  Yeah, they didn't want you over there.  And I don't know of anyone among my peers--I think there was one girl that she actually got to go to the swimming pool once.  And that was, in those days, you had the Columbus Academy there and Columbus School for Girls.  And these were two elite private schools.  The academy relocated to some place further out in Columbus.  I don't know if the Columbus School for Girls is still there or not.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is this near downtown?
Speaker 2: No, well, it depends on what you mean by "near", but I believe we're in--if I could tell you the name of this street.  See, there's East Broad Street.  It goes downtown.  And then there's a cross street.  And I can't remember that one, but that's the line of demarcation.  So, for example, there's Franklin Park, okay, which is on the Columbus side, and then there was this thing called Wolf Park, which was on the Bexley side, okay.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Bexley?
Speaker 2: B-E-X-E-L-Y, I believe.  But you might wanna look that up.  [Bexley, Ohio].
Speaker 1: I think you're right.  I just couldn't, I think I've seen it before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then in my day, that was exclusively Jewish and white, well, I guess they're the same, but, yeah.  And the Governor's mansion was there.
Story_ID: 626377
Speaker 1: So, now, where did you start school?  What was your first school?
Speaker 2: East Gate Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you go to kindergarten or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, went to kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Did you have any pre-school?  I guess I should ask that.
Speaker 2: Other than kindergarten, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: [Pause] Yeah, yeah, I would say, for a child, yeah, I liked school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For example, I never thought about not going to school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, was it, it was not anything that you would think of in your household (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, that might be true, but, you know, I never thought about like, like not going to school.  And I can remember--well, the only time, I mean in the dead of winter when it was really cold, I used to listen to the radio for school closures.  And I remember one time I walked to school and it was, it must have been five below zero.  But it was frightfully cold.  And I didn't have any gloves, and so I just had my hands in the pocket.  And then I got to the school, and it was closed.  And I had to walk back, and that was hard for a small child.  But, you know, in general, but the idea of avoiding school, never really, never really occurred to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: In elementary school?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I can't say.  It wasn't like I, you know, longed for math period or anything like that.  I liked reading because they emphasized that and since I could read well, you know, I tended to do, you know, do that.  Writing, I didn't like so much.  You know, then, the emphasis was on, you know, the belief that if you had neat or pretty handwriting, that was a sign of intelligence or something.  And I wasn't really good at drawing, and, you know, script writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I didn't like that so much.
Speaker 1: So did they, so did--were you a good math student?
Speaker 2: I was probably a mediocre math student for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't catch the main ideas, probably due to, you know, lack of seriousness on my part and, by seriousness for a child, I mean actually, class participation by doing homework and other things.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, did you have a lot of supervision when you came home or would you--since your mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] was working, was she around to--
Speaker 2: No, I was probably one of the original "latch-key" children.  So, you know, school ended at three[ o'clock].  I'd walk home, and between three and five [o'clock], I'd be left to my own devices.  So I'd usually come in, fix a snack and if the TV was working, watch TV.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you wouldn't be doing any scientific experiments or anything like that or (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, as I got older, you know, once I was in like junior high school, yeah.  I mean I would play with things.  I had a chemistry set.  I had a, I don't know if you're familiar with these rockets, little salt rockets, that, you know, I'd fire off, actually, down there at the park.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, and many of my rockets went into Bexley [neighboring community that was segregated] (laughter).  So I guess I was (laughter), and, you know, it was, it was really discouraging 'cause once it floated over--in fact, I stopped, these rockets have parachutes that come out for recovery.  So I stopped putting the parachutes on 'cause, if you put, as soon as the parachute opened, it would just drift.  You know, and if it went up high enough, they would just drift over there to Bexley.  So there was no hope of recovery.  You had more, a greater chance of recovery just having the thing come down 'cause they're real light.  So they reached terminal velocity very quickly.  And all you have to do is, you know, you'd break off a tail-fin, but then you just cut another one out of balsa wood and stick it back on.  And so they're not real heavy.  So I stopped putting parachutes on them.  And that way, I had some hope of recovery.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wouldn't go as far--
Speaker 2: Well, it wouldn't drift over there, 'cause like I said, they do go, they do go appreciable, even with the small engines, they go to appreciable heights.
Story_ID: 626378
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you got involved with the rockets in middle school [in Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, I also was a big reader of comic books.  And so if you recall, when you read comic books, there were these advertisements in 'em, like where you, some of them where you got so many coupons, you'd get--I never went for that.  But there was also a company, and the company's still in existence, Estes, that would advertise their little model rockets.  And they didn't cost very much.  And so you'd send that in, and they'd send you a catalog, and you'd pick stuff out the catalog and ship 'em off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then over time, you build up enough of an inventory of parts and things so you can, it really gets inexpensive.
Speaker 1: So you'd actually swap out different parts and build, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, these are all out of balsa wood, so you'd cut, you know, you'd take a, well, actually, I took a kitchen knife.  But you could take an, what's--I eventually moved up to an Exacto knife, and I used to use razor blades too.  So you'd cut those things out.  It wasn't like you were testing 'em in a wind tunnel or anything.  So, and then, the main part to get was the, the engine from Estes, and the igniters, the devices which would, you'd send a current through, and they set off a little charge and that sends the, that ignites the rocket engine.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of an engine was it?
Speaker 2: It's a solid rocket engine.  So, so one piece.  It's much like a firecracker, well, I don't know what the propellant was, per se.  It's, it's, it is a true solid rocket engine.  It's just small.  And, as I said, you'd, it had--and it's engineered so it has a fuel stage that pushes it up, you know, to whatever heights it goes.  Then that stage ignites another charge which deploys the parachutes, pops off the top, the nosecone and the parachute come out and brings it down.  Then they have ones that are for multiple stages.  And so that charge, that's a different engine and that charge will then set off the second stage.  And I believe they even had three-stage engines at that time.  And then they, you know, so they had a whole assortment of parts and technology.  The key thing was--and the electrical portion of it, which you used to initiate the launch 'cause, you know, you definitely don't wanna be down there, you know, they have warnings on there.  You don't wanna be down there trying to put a fuse in there, you know, that, that's bad technology to start with.  But, you know, with the, the electrical thing only required four batteries, four, D-cell batteries and then a switch, a key switch.  So as you're shoving the igniter up there, you don't want it to go off accidentally, and then a little, a rod, so you put a straw on the side of the rocket, and then you push a rod through that deflector, which deflects part of that blast so you don't burn up your launcher.  And that was it.  And all that, you could carry in a bag.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you found out about that from reading comic books.   Did--
Speaker 2: Well, and also the literature from Estes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean they were very--obviously, they were concerned about somebody blowing off their hand (laughter), like you read about, stories about people who would (laughter), would try to saw the thing in half and these are little, you know, it looks like cardboard.  It's just a cardboard cylinder about three-quarters of an inch in diameter.  But people would try to saw it in half to take out the propellant.  And sometimes you could generate enough heat with the saw to set it off, and, you know, people would lose, you know, eyebrows and they would get severe burns.  The rockets themselves didn't have a lot of thrust.  So, to give you a measure, one of the things you can do which is not recommended by any means by Estes, is you could ignite the rocket and you could keep it on the pad, by just putting your finger there.  It would never build up enough thrust and that would--
Speaker 1: So this would be between the pad and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, if it's on the pad, pointing up, if you put your hand there and set it off, it wouldn't go anywhere.  And the charge would last, I believe it was three seconds, yeah.
Story_ID: 626379
Speaker 1: All right, now, were you a follower of the [U.S.] Space program?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean 'cause in those days, in the schools, whenever they had a launch, they'd bring a TV in, and you could watch the launch.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that there were so many astronauts from Ohio that it seemed--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to make it seem like it was something local on some level.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, 'cause I can remember thinking, where is Houston, Ohio at (laughter).  But I think the thing that I lost, actually I lost interest in, once I had the rockets, I kind of lost interest in the Space program.  Even as a child, I never, I didn't like the idea of manned space flights so much.
Speaker 1: What was it about it that you didn't like?
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't have a purpose.  I never bought the--once it became clear that you weren't gonna be traveling to Mars or planets and things any time soon, and I didn't like the--the other thing was during the Cold War, you know, when they would, you know, the duck-and-cover thing, you know, that used to petrify me 'cause I'd dream, you know, one day I'd wake up, and, you know, there'd be like a nuclear wasteland out there.  And I thought that the, the "space race" just accelerated that.  And the thought was, was that, well, they're gonna have all these missiles and eventually, they'll have so many missiles that somebody will have to use 'em.  And I thought the space race accelerated that.  And then, for example, you do the space race.  Well, once you realize, you get--even as a child, you get an idea of how far things are away, particularly, the idea of what a light year is.  And you see that as pointless (laughter).  But, you know, that's a good, and in many ways, that's a good thing because it starts you, it gets back to my basic theme, is that, what physics does is teach you how to think about things, not what to think.
Story_ID: 626380
Speaker 1: Speaking of that, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I never, you know, though my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] said I needed to go to church or we needed, never.  I never went to church.
Speaker 1: Now, did she go?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall, other than to a social occasion.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she encouraged you to go, you said, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but no, I never went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I went when I attended Catholic school for a short time.  I went to, I had to take religion class.  But I never went to church on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know, I always ask people about the church experience.  But, you know, you don't have, hear that many stories about folks that have a secular, you know, upbringing, where they really, it's really not, you know, a big part of growing up.  And so, I've interviewed people who were secular themselves as children, but had to go to church all the time, you know.  And, but I just wondered--and so was anybody in your family religious, your grandparents or anybody?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I have one, one of my relatives.  She's a minister in the Episcopalian church.  But, no, we weren't particularly religious.  Well, I mean my, one of my uncles, his family was very religious.  And he used to complain bitterly about it, not that he wasn't religious.  I don't know--now, that I think about it, I don't know that he ever went to church on Sunday either much.  I think he went occasionally.
Story_ID: 626381
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was your brother [David Jackson] like, was he--he was close enough in age where you all were--were you all close growing up?  Did he have a--
Speaker 2: Well, he was seven years older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that's a pretty, that's a considerable gap.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so he left home in, I think it was 1965 to go to college.
Speaker 1: Yeah, seven years is quite a gap.  So did you have friends involved in your rocket experiments?
Speaker 2: No, I mean other than spectators, between that and, you know, I moved from the rockets to the slot cars.  So that was a time where you had these little slot cars, well, they actually had, I guess, like little commercial places you could go and race your slot cars.  So I kind of moved into that technology.
Story_ID: 626382
Speaker 1: I think it's called model motoring with the little cars and--
Speaker 2: Well, there's a couple of variances of it.  There's a, the gasoline engine ones (laughter), which again, they suffer from the same problem the rocket engine.  Their scale speeds are like five or 600 miles an hour.  And so when you put that thing down, it's really ripping along.  And so, but the slot cars, since they're electrical, their scale speeds, you can control their speeds a lot more accurately than with the gas cars.  And so then, you know, you can think about things like, you know, having races.  And, as I said, these places would develop, or these businesses developed that had very elaborate slot car tracks, more so than you could ever have.  I had like a little, they call 'em HO cars which were really small cars.  And I had a little track like that in my house that I could play with.  But, then I moved up to the 124th and 132nd size cars.  And, you know, that basically gave me the grounding in electricity and magnetism, trying to take care--between the controllers, that's where I learned that Ohm's law, what I soon learned later in life was Ohm's law that V is equal to IR [voltage is equal to the product of resistance (R) and current flowing through the resistance (I)].  And so the "R" was in the controller.  So the controller was a variable resistor.  The "I" was what made the motor go around, okay.  And then the voltage was what you read across your track when you put down a meter, and then the intricacies of the technology.  So one of the things was to, the stronger--so you have fixed magnets inside electrical motor.  But then what really gives it its drive is the magnetic field created by the electro-magnet that makes up the rotor, okay, the part that moves.  The trick, you know, one thing is you can put--you can only put in so much current, right.  But you realize that the current is equal to, the current "I" is equal to the number of turns times the short length of wire, the length of the wire.  So if you put longer wire, oophs, the more current you have, okay.  Well, the way you make the longer, the wire longer is you wrap more around.  And so one of the standard techniques was to rewind, what we called "rewind your engine," the motor.  So you basically take the rotor out and you put it on this device that allows you to wrap and use smaller gauge wire, which allows you to wrap more wire around each of the windings.  And then you reassemble that, and your motor will go, will rotate much faster and hence, through the gears, your car will go much faster.  And then, in fact, it goes so much faster that breaking becomes an issue.  Well, there is no--well, in the simple sets, there are no brakes.  That means that when you take the power off of the car, it rolls to a stop, and if it's going real fast, that's not sufficient to be able to make it around, 'cause these tracks have turns and things, you know.  And so you gain speed, and you would lose control.  One way to introduce control was to attach a battery to it that's wire in the opposite direction so that when you--so that battery only puts out one and a half volts, right.  To drive the car was 12 volts max.  And so the difference between the two was 10.5 volts, all right.  And since you have so many windings, but the thing that drives the car is a current, not the voltage.  And since you have so many windings on the motor, that doesn't, losing that 1.5 volts doesn't make any different.  The advantage is, is when you take the voltage that's on the track off, you now have 1.5 volts that's causing the thing, the motor to rotate in the opposite direction.  And when it, and that's your breaking.  And that way, you regain control.  And so, that was the kind of thing that you'd learn from working with the technology, plus--so you learn intimately how at least, a motor works.  You don't learn much about electricity and magnetism, other than how to make, well, its main use was just to (laughter), you know, run motors.  And, you know, the technology of, you know, how your, you put--we, we would put these various solutions on tires.  As the tires go on the track, they pick up dust.  That way, they don't have much traction.  And so they could pick up enough dust, you would hear the things wind as the tires would speed to no effect, with no traction.  So one of the things you would do is to put various things on your tires, the simplest thing being a soap solution that would clean off the dust and prevent other dust on it, until these more elaborate hydrocarbon carbon-based solutions and different tires, different tire schemes.  So sometimes you would use, if you had big tires, which were like two inches, made out of silicon rubber, silicone rubber, you would put a solution that would clean 'em off.  If you had smaller tires, you can make those out of a sponge-like material.  It's an advantage to have smaller tires because they could rotate more times than a larger tire.  Hence, you could go faster (laughter).  And, they always had the smaller, at least the material didn't have the trouble with picking up dust from the track and it was easy to get good traction on those and high speed and control.  So, you know, that was the kind of technology that you'd settle in.  And then, naturally, you know, who had the fanciest, you know, the hottest-looking car.
Story_ID: 626383
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were there any special teachers or mentors around when you were growing up for you, 'cause your father's [Russell Hunter Jackson] gone.  I mean were you in the Boy Scouts or anything or a member of the 'Y' [YMCA; Young Men's Christian Association] or--
Speaker 2: Well, I was a member of the 'Y', and I would--that's where I learned how to swim.  And I was a member there.  We had a swim team at the 'Y'.  And I would do that a lot, and I could go there and play chess and shoot pool and play basketball.  You know, they had a karate class there, a martial arts class.  But I can't recall a particular, there was no one that helped me with the, the more technical things.  And, you know, my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] hated going to the martial arts tournaments.  I don't think she ever went.  And she didn't like me swimming.  She was definitely afraid of the water.  So then I would pretty much do that, you know, with my friends.  And, yeah, there was, I did have one, well, one friend and his father.  He would at least take us to the slot car track.  But, yeah, no one, hands-on kind of stuff, for those kinds of things.  And I had people who would show me how to do plumbing, you know, how to, you know, I'd watch and figure out how to fix things around the house.  And, you know, the trouble was most people were deathly afraid of electricity, like in your house.  So, you know, we had a house that had fuses.  A fuse blows, you know, I always wound up eventually changing the fuses.  And then, you know, I don't, and I mean it had like, obviously, electricity is dangerous, right.  And for the uninitiated, it's not, I had a good idea to work on circuits that are energized.  The problem is, is to do anything significant, without instruments, they have to be energized.  If you don't have a meter, how are you (laughter), you know, you have to, I mean you won't, it's probably not the best idea--'cause I had one electrician show me where he, you know, where people wet their hands and (laughter), that's definitely not a good idea.  I mean that takes a certain amount of skill.  However, usually, a wire, an insulated wire, you know, would suffice.  So you'll see a spark and you know the thing's energized.  And I never had, when I was fixing things around the house, I never had a meter when I was growing up.  In fact, I didn't have a meter that I owned until I was thirty [years old].  I still have it, actually, but (laughter) anyway, I would learn, I would learn how to fix, how--I think the thing was with plumbing was learning how to do brazing, soldering, I'm sorry, not brazing.  So then most of the problems inside of people's home are a clogged line, clogged sink, clogged toilet.  Occasionally, in Ohio, you can get a clogged supply line from calcium carbonate build up, as I later found out.
Speaker 1: With all the limestone and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and for that, you know, you couldn't do anything, at least I couldn't.  I mean you had to call a real plumber.  But with a stopped up drain, there are a variety of techniques to clear that from, or a toilet, you know, plunge, you know, (unclear) use of a plunger; a drain, you have the physical issue.  If you have a physical blockage, all you have to do is push it away.  And there's a number of ways to do that, snake is probably the one most people are familiar with and learning how to handle a plumbing snake.  Then the one that I like the best is the use of pressure of water to do it.  So you have a clogged drain or, you know, or bathtub.  If you can, so if you have a source of water there, and it's a 110 psi [unit of pressure] around, as I later found out, behind it, then that can push away a whole lot of stuff.  So the trick, most people don't realize is, you take off the showerhead and you screw on an adapter that allows you to put a garden hose there.  Then you sacrifice the garden hose and cut it to a workable length and you can always shove it down the drain.  And then you just put old wash clothes and things around it.  And you turn on the water, and nine times out of ten, in fact, I've never had a time when it didn't--
Speaker 1: End up moving it--
Speaker 2: Moves that out.  And, particularly, if you've been throwing Drano down there, and you're dealing mostly with hair clogs, even physical, I mean, you know, physical clogs will go away.  And then all you have to do is put the showerhead back up.  And so, well, what became, you know, an hour, hour and a half, struggle with a snake, 'cause trouble is, the snake is small.  If there's a physical block, there are things that can stop it, now become a half hour kind of deal.
Speaker 1: Now, who taught you that when you were--
Speaker 2: Well, I think the way that worked was, is a plumber came once.  And he left the connector, the adapter there or he dropped one.  I don't know.  And I had the adapter, and one day I was tired of it taking, you know, the better part of half a day for the bathtub to drain.  And it was no one at home.  So I took the, I had a wrench.  I took off the showerhead, put that thing up there and did exactly that.  Then the thing ran for, for years after that.  I mean the thing was, we were putting up with this since I was seven years old (laughter), and now in a half hour, the thing is gone forever, 'cause we only had one bathroom in the house.

Speaker 1: So do you think this is just basically part of your identity, you know, being able to solve, you'd like to solve problems and then do it if you can figure out how to do it?
Speaker 2: Well, I, it's, I mean, 'cause there's many problems.  I never solved the gnat problem, which really bugged me.
Speaker 1: I think all that fruit around there probably had something to do with it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I mean there's a number of problems they couldn't solve, never been able to solve as I was growing up, like the gnat problem, the heat problem.  But, you know, it takes some time, and, you know, it's the ability to look at different things that you have around, particularly, when you don't have an established technology.  So like with the slot cars and the rockets, you know, you'd have a supplier.  You had Estes [rocket model manufacturer].  I can't remember who made the cars.  And these things go together a certain way.  You don't have an understanding of the, you know, you don't have an understanding of the underlying principles.  And you just look at it, and you're willing to, you know, take the risk.  I said, well, I know I can take the showerhead off and put it back on before anybody gets home, okay.  I can put this nipple in, and it's really, you know, the worst that can happen is, is that the wash clothes in there, you know, come out black or whatever, and they'll have to be sacrificed.  But you put it away, and then you get so much satisfaction out of solving those kinds of problems that it tends to encourage you to solve the next problem--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and become a problem solver.
Story_ID: 626385
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was the name of your middle school or junior high school?  Was it junior high school or middle school at that time [in Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Champion Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, Champion Junior High School.  Did you have a favorite teacher there?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see.  I remember my home room teacher 'cause she had a long-standing issue with my grandmother, and I guess they had been rivals or something.  And my grandmother had stole her boyfriend as it were (laughter).  I remember her (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, did she treat you okay or did she--
Speaker 2: Well, she was, you know, a difficult woman, but, you know, let me see.  No, I don't, I'm drawing a blank.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: There certainly were--
Speaker 1: --if there was somebody that stood out, I guess you'd remember.
Speaker 2: Well, they were, (unclear) certain, I think his name was Willis, the principal, he stood out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were, I shouldn't--there certainly were teachers and unhappily, I don't recall their--
Speaker 1: So this would be about 1965 or so when you were in middle school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't really recall their names.
Speaker 1: Now, how were your grades?  Are you making good grades at this point or are you just kind of in the middle or--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I'm not making good grades.  I'm making, and I'm not making like 4.0 kinds of grades.  I'm making like, B--I mean or As.  I'm making like Bs and Cs kind of thing.  I recall the history teachers.  They were quite good.  I felt they were quite good or interesting.  I mean who can say for, you know, twelve, thirteen year old, but they did a team teaching kind of deal, which made it very interesting.
Speaker 1: Now, were they teaching black history in those days?
Speaker 2: No (laughter), no, we'd--
Speaker 1: I'm asking (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think we had just gotten a little bit beyond the earth being created in seven days.  But, no, they would teach, you know, American history.  Yeah, it was American history.
Speaker 1: Now, was Champion completely segregated or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, did you, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] took me out of Champion and put me into a Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the name of that one?
Speaker 2: Bishop Hartley.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, was that in the neighborhood or--
Speaker 2: No, that was out, so just above Bexley [a segregated white-only community in Columbus, Ohio] (laughter) where mysteriously, it becomes Columbus again (laughter).  You have, you know, a white community, for lack of a better term 'cause it wasn't diverse.  You had a white community, and then you had Columbus schools up there.  And up there, there was Bishop Hartley [School].  It was a long, it's off Livingston Avenue and Country Club Road, yeah.
Speaker 1: And it's interesting.  Is that the same part of Livingston Avenue that's mostly black now?
Speaker 2: No, you just keep going up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Maybe it is mostly black now, but, yeah, I know what you're talking about.  My uncle lived over there, but no, that was (laughter), that was to be avoided.  But, no, if you kept going up--if I could just remember the name of, for some reason I wanna say Alum Creek Drive.  But as soon as you went up, okay, so you go to the part you're talking about.  And then that crosses over, that same dividing line, and then you have Bexley.  And then you keep going up, and then that turns into Columbus again.  And that's where Bishop Hartley was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you like that after so many years at--
Speaker 2: Well, it was, well, it was a couple of things about it that I liked.  One, the lunches were much better and cheaper.  I guess the thing that was most striking about it was that when I was at Champion [Junior High School], I remember the, remember the little cartons of milk you used to get, right.  Okay, at Champion, they were a nickel.  And that was a poor neighborhood, right, and subsidized and all that other stuff, as my mother would say.  And the lunches were subsidized.  I didn't know what that meant exactly.  But she meant that was an example of how the [U.S.] Department of Ed [Education]--she had started to work for the school system at that time.  That was what the school system would do for people.  And then when I got to Bishop Hartley where it's a private school, Catholic school in a well-to-do neighborhood, the milks were three cents.  And the lunches were twenty-five cents.  And I remember that seemed inexplicable to me, and the quality was way up there, at least for the palate of a student (laughter)--
Speaker 1: A middle school student.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Known for consuming--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean quality, I say, well there was more there, and it tasted better.
Story_ID: 626386
Speaker 1: Now, as today, as chairman of the physics department here at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland], we all know that you have the academic chops and everything.  But in middle school, you were like in public school, you're a B, C student, and you seemed to be interested in solving problems.  You have an active mind, but was school, public school really challenging you, you think, or did you receive that challenge in Catholic school [Bishop Hartley Catholic School in Columbus, Ohio] or--
Speaker 2: Well, when I think back, I think the main reason that my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] decided I should go to the Catholic school was, is that, you know, I began to participate in the science fairs.  And I had shown my interest in, you know, in science.  And a lot of the resources of the school were going toward what she felt like remedial, you know, to deal with the social challenges there.  And even though there were a group of students that had been, you know, in those days, they would put people in different tracks, okay.  So we had like a vocational track and then you had like a so-called college prep track, which I was in.  And so you would have like all, you know, sons and daughters of doctors, lawyers, and, you know, significant merchants and those kinds of things in those classes.  The bulk of the classes were--because, 'cause Champion was centered in a project, a housing project--the bulk of the students, you know, were, the bulk of the emphasis of the school was training students that had very, had a lot of social issues, that were economically deprived, living in projects who had all the symptoms of even what we see today in public housing.  And, you know, students, teachers spent and administrators spent so much time dealing with their issues that it was unclear whether folks that had demonstrated academic acumen, who didn't fall in that category, were gonna be able to get the kind of preparation necessary to move forward.  And by move forward, I'm not talking about moving forward to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or just being able to go to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio].  And I think one of the things that was, was that there was a bond issue, to raise money to remodel the school, okay.  And I think the thing that disturbed her was--and this is general for people in the social science, was that one thing that disturbed her was that it wasn't going toward like hiring more teachers.  And you really couldn't use those kinds of funds to hire more teachers and stuff.  But they elected to build a gymnasium and given all the issues and things that were facing the school, the choice of building a gymnasium, you know, said that, she felt that there wasn't gonna be a lot of emphasis on academic kinds of things or there wasn't anyone there to address the academic problems.  Again, this is, and so then I found myself at Bishop Hartley [Catholic school].
Story_ID: 626387
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, were there any significant relationships with teachers at, or mentors at Bishop Hartley [Catholic School, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, there was one nun there who was the, like vice principal or head nun in charge that I recall.  And one of the things that they did was, was that when they saw people--that was about the time when things were opening up for black people.  And one of the things she did was she identified people who or students that she felt had extraordinary talent to get, to receive scholarships to go to these private schools or the private schools initiated it.  They were looking to find students they thought would benefit from a private school experience.  And she identified me and another student there to participate in those things 'cause when I had gotten there, they had placed me in this--they had tracks too.  And this also shows you the problem with tracks is that, you know, once you get more into track, it becomes difficult to keep track, tracking anyone.  So I was in what was called a lower track algebra or geometry class.  And, you know, the truth is, is I even tell people to this day, there's only one kind of math.  There's no business math.  There's no math for the social sciences (laughter).  There's only mathematics.  I said, what you guys are attempting to do is to do some kind of branding or marketing, but there's really, underlying all of that, there's only one math.  So even in the remedial math class, you know, if someone gives you a second order equation to solve, you use the quadratic formula.  So I knew the quadratic formula.  So when they, and I would use it religiously.  So once you know--there is one other thing you have to know, but once you know the quadratic formula and then how to square something so you can solve it, and then how to solve, manipulate--I guess it's, manipulation is the key thing.  You can breeze through those things, and, you know, quadratic equation is like a breakthrough.  You know, like you can build an amplifier from transistors, but it's a lot better to just go out, once you know how to build one from transistors, it's a lot better to just go out and buy one, and that's what the quadratic formula is like.  Yeah, there's a lot of ways to solve second order equations.  Okay, as to (unclear) equations, one where you have X squared, plus 2X, plus one equals zero.  And even in the track one class, they only had second order equations.  And once you've memorized the quadratic formula, even if you memorized it at Champion Junior High School, it still works.  And so from that, and other things, you know, I was able to, you know, get As in those classes.  And that's how I got identified to go to these, to apply for the scholarship to these, I think it was [Phillips] Exeter Academy [private, residential school in Exeter, New Hampshire].  Now, as it turns out, my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] did not want me to go there, and she didn't want her son leaving there.  But that was one example of what the nuns would do.  And--
Speaker 1: So you didn't go to Exeter?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there an alternative thing for you to do?  I mean, well, you stay in Catholic school, I guess or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, just stayed there at Hartley for a while.  And then I transferred from Bishop Hartley to Eastmoor.
Speaker 1: Okay, is Eastmoor, that's a middle school too?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: High school, okay.  So what is, what year is this?
Speaker 2: '69 [1969], '68 [1968], '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626388
Speaker 1: And Eastmoor [high school, Columbus, Ohio], you spell that, the "moor" part?
Speaker 2: M-O-O-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I thought.  Eastmoor, okay, Eastmoor High School.  So, all right, 1968, '69 [1969].  Now, this is the year that Dr. King's [Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassinated.  And is Eastmoor a predominantly black school?
Speaker 2: No, Eastmoor is one of the places that was getting desegregated, was in the process of getting desegregated.
Speaker 1: So this is court-ordered busing into Eastmoor or what?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It was just busing.  I don't know if it was court ordered other than the Supreme Court, 'Brown versus Board of Education'.
Speaker 1: So, you, a desegregation plan was going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how formal it was, but people from my neighborhood were getting bussed out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was this like, I mean going to Bishop Hartley, and then going to Eastmoor, was this like, did you go through any kind of culture shock, you know, with the--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean I wanted to go there 'cause I had, you know, a lot of my friends were going to Eastmoor, even my friends who were at [Bishop] Hartley [Catholic School; middle school], and they were why, that's--but, yeah, it was, it was horrible.  I mean, 'cause I can remember going there and people would throw bricks at the bus.  And everybody knew where the bus was going.  In fact, there were many times I didn't take the school bus.  I just took the city bus 'cause that way, you know, you could, you know, get back to, you could get--you had to walk to the city bus line.  But, you know, there wasn't, you weren't exactly a target, you know, walking.  It was like people were fixated on this school bus.  And, plus, there were two directions you could go.  You could go up to Main Street or you could go to Broad Street.  And plus you could leave any time you wanted if--
Speaker 1: So it was kind of an ugly atmosphere around the whole bus--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I felt it was, at the time I felt it was ugly, and I felt I hadn't made the best decision to go there, but, you know, it was, you know, you get used to it after a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, I mean did, in the school, were you treated fairly well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to say.  I mean clearly, the guy who was principal, his name was Obert, and he did not like the intrusion of, you know, the desegregation order and he would do the trappings of being a fair guy.  So he would give somebody, I mean he would, he would conspicuously remark about how he'd given like some black guy a ride home that was at his daughter's birthday party or something or some kind of party.  It reminded me of the policeman that gave me a ride home when I was walking my dog (laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: To make sure that you go home.
Speaker 2: And, you know, the thing is with high school principals, they're, you know, they have this fixation with controlling their faculty, controlling the students.  So, and it's interesting, was that about a year after I graduated, they found the principal had, he had OD'd [overdosed] on some prescription drugs.  He also was involved in a shooting.  He shot this woman he claimed was trying to steal his car stereo.  And I don't know about you, but I don't know too many that go out and steal car stereos (laughter).  But,--
Speaker 1: Now, was this a white woman he shot or a black woman?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  At that time, I was at college and didn't take much--I never had a lot of contact with him.  I had more contact with the guy that was in charge of school operations.  His name, I forget.
Story_ID: 626389
Speaker 1: So, at any rate, so Eastmoor High School [Columbus, Ohio], so was the quality of instruction higher, I mean or better than it had been or had you basically kind of, basically, had more confidence by the time that you got there?
Speaker 2: I had plenty of confidence.  Plus, they had, you know, they, they, you know, they offered the science courses there.  And, you know, they were small, obviously, all science courses, I mean the--so they had like stand-alone physics, stand-alone chemistry, stand-alone biology.  I think they even had a calculus course, but I never took it there.  So it's hard to say.  I know the guy that taught physics was a little odd.  So for example, and the one key skill to learn in school is how to take a test, at least in those days.  And this guy would give exams.  And he would never pass 'em back.
Speaker 1: So you could never see what you did wrong.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could never see what you had done wrong, and he was like, he said, well, if you wanna see what you'd done wrong, you'd have to meet with him.  And, you know, I wasn't doing that well in the class at that time, and my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] was upset.  And so she came and met with him, and then I started doing a little better.  And, you know, I had not really, I had thought about going into physics, but I said, well, you know, maybe I should succumb to social pressure and become a doctor or something like that.  Then, as I read about physics, and I said, well, yeah, I can do physics and be a doctor too.  But then I remember taking the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] test, and in those days, you took subject matter tests like physics and English.  And as a lark, I'd signed up for physics.  And I did very well on in it.  In fact, the valedictorian of my class who had also taken the physics subject test, he was concerned, he was upset 'cause I had done a hundred points better than him.  And (laughter), he a, he's a Jewish guy, and he said, well, you, you did better because--you know, I had had, he had taken it before me.  I had had six weeks more physics than him.  You know, from this guy, I didn't know what was going on.  And so I think that was a one skill, because of very, you know, 'cause in those days, you know, you were always taking placement tests for these tracks that they had where the instruction was supposed to be more intense.  So instead of, you know, getting a high school, that a high school coach, you got somebody who majored in English, teaching math.  That was the difference between (laughter) quality, but because of that experience, you know, I got used to, you know, taking--you know, everybody, you know, gets butterflies when it's time to visibly demonstrate their talent by taking a test.  And by that time, I had learned how to take a test.  Actually, that's probably one of my main marks of success.  I probably, it's not my knowledge of physics so much but ability to sit down and use whatever I know and, and sit for the two hours or whatever it takes to take the exam.  But anyway, after that experience, I said, well, I might as well, if I'm gonna be a doctor, I might as well major in physics.  And, because that opportunity--just because you major in physics, that opportunity isn't closed to you.  And it surprises me even today, students believe that to be a doctor, you have to major in biology.  And there's like no supporting evidence for that, and granted, you know, you can make the evidence look like whatever you want to a certain extent.  But even the medical schools don't say that, and what they indicate is, they never really look into, you know, most people live off of hearsay.  They never investigate, you know, the basic assumptions and what, even with the web and everything today, they don't go to a website and see what the people who are in medical school say or the medical schools themselves say.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, in high school, now, did you, were you involved in--now, it was your freshman year that Dr. King was assassinated while you all were going through the bussing crisis.  Did that accelerate the crisis or did it make it any better or increase dialogue or--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't any dialogue.  I mean I can't remember, there was only one other--I can't remember, I never had a single friend, at least white friend in high school.
Speaker 1: So what was the ratio numbers wise?  This had been a previously all-white high school, I guess?
Speaker 2: I think it was maybe 10 to 20 percent.  And it was the same high school that Darryl and Archie Griffin went to.
Speaker 1: Were they there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Darryl Griffin was there.  I guess he, I guess Archie was there, but he was younger than me.  And, you know, there are a number of people who went to Eastmoor.  One reason, typically because the people who went to Eastmoor came from the more well-to-do families and well-to-do areas, middle-class areas as opposed to the people that went to East High School, which was in Columbus.  That was the closest one to me.  That's where my brother [David Jackson] had gone to high school.
Speaker 1: Right, I remember them for all the basketball championships and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and so then we had a, I mean for example, when I got to Stanford, there was a couple of guys there from Eastmoor who were in the law school and I think, business school.
Story_ID: 626390
Speaker 1: So were you involved in any of the social activities, I guess very little, at Eastmoor [High School, Columbus, Ohio], the social activities, you know, like the prom and the student government?
Speaker 2: No, no, I think I did have, it seems like I did have some role in student government.  But, no, I didn't go to the prom.  And, you know, there were other political things within the, the city that I was involved with, that weren't necessarily centered at Eastmoor.  They were actually centered more at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was going on there?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a Dr. Charles, I wanna say, Ross [Charles O. Ross].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, that had come there and was in the, I guess, black studies department.  And he had done some outreach in the community and reached out to youth there.  And I had become, you know, involved with him and the people around him which were, they had, I mean there were a whole, I mean there were a set of intellectuals.  Then there were people who were like akin to like the Columbus version of the Black Panther Party, kind of thing.  And he had done outreach to, well, I don't know, it seemed like he had looked at, maybe Eastmoor was a center for this kind of activity.  I don't really recall.  I know East [High School] wasn't.  That, I can't recall anybody from East High School being there or Linda McKinley or the other all-black high schools in the city.  But, you know, he was, and though he was in the humanities kind of thing, he was very supportive about, well, one, people going to college and then people going into science or other disciplines or exploring disciplines.  And, you know, college as a place for self discovery as opposed to a vocational school kind of thing.  And that's probably where I've gotten my general view of higher education, not the vocational view that most people carry forward.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there seems to be a tendency now for people to talk about colleges and vocational, I mean, if you're gonna pay all this money, you may as well get, you know, get a profession where you're gonna make a lot of money and do it as fast as possible and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, I'm trying to think.  There was something he said.  Something he said, I still use.  He says, "Is there anything about physics that tells you what's gonna be the highest paying profession five years from now?  Is there anything in physics that allows you to predict the future?"  Yeah, I think that stayed with me.  And, so, you know, the thing is, is to learn to--and, again, college as a, or higher ed [education], as a place for self discovery, for learning how to think about things and using that to effect.  And also being able to, I don't know what did they call it in our day?  The hard books (laughter), read the hard books as opposed to a how-to manual.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a name for the program that he had at Ohio State [University] that--
Speaker 2: No, this was all--there probably was, but I don't know what it--
Speaker 1: Was it an 'Upward Bound' program or something?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Not something like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I know he founded an independent black school and he had something called a culture unit weekend, you know, every year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the trapping, the beginning of that.  And that he was arrested for something.  I guess he was arrested at some protest or something 'cause he had a real famous lawyer come and defend him.  And I know the people at State [Ohio State University], the administration at State hated him.
Story_ID: 626391
Speaker 1: So, so when you graduated from high school in what, 1971?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you rank when you graduated?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I was at, upper 25 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, did you get any financial assistance to go to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], scholarships or anything?
Speaker 2: I didn't explore Ohio State.  I didn't really like, yeah, I mean it was clear.  You know, I had talked to [Charles O.] Ross, and he made it clear, yeah, I could come there, but, you know, you're gonna be one of a class, of, you know, one of a crowd of 50,000 people.  And I had even been over to the physics department there on a couple of occasions.  But I didn't wanna be in a place that large.  And, you know, so I started applying to schools.  I applied to a lot of schools 'cause I wanted to make sure I got in some place.  And then I had applied to Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio] and visited there.  And that was supposed to be the avant-garde place (laughter).  And I didn't really see going there at all.
Speaker 1: What was it about Antioch that kind of discouraged you?
Speaker 2: Well, one, they didn't have any particular strengths in the sciences, and it's really for someone who is self directed.  And they had this thing that every, every other semester, you had to go do these internships.  So you were traveling all around, and I didn't just, I didn't--and it seemed to be mainly for people in the social sciences or humanities or, you know, policy kinds of things, not for somebody that wanted to major in science or engineering.
Story_ID: 626392
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're exploring schools, and we just talked about Antioch [College, Yellow Springs, Ohio].  What other schools did you explore?
Speaker 2: Well, I looked at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], no, I'm sorry, I looked at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I looked at, for a little brief time, West Point [The United States Military Academy at West Point], and then Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia], Columbia [University, New York] and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley], yeah, 'cause my brother was at Berkeley.  And I didn't get into, I didn't get into those, well, I think I got into Berkeley.  And that was an odd one, but I centered down on Morehouse [College] and Howard [University] though my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] desperately wanted me to go to Antioch [College].  You know, no one was really particularly wild about this science thing.  They seemed to be operating, even educated people, from the idea, "Well, you'll never be able to get a job in science."  A black person can't get a job in science.  And, yeah, like I said, that's four years off, and, you know, the guys, you know, among your peers, yeah, you don't know any scientists.  So, well, I got into, I got into Howard and Morehouse.  And Howard had given me a little bit of financial aid.  And then Morehouse gave me a full tuition scholarship with room and board.  And so I decided to go to Morehouse, and they had a reputation for producing black doctors.  So I said, well, if I can't make it, if it becomes clear I can't make it in physics, I can always be a doctor.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this sounds interesting that you state it like that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you had placed a higher value on becoming a physicist than a doctor because there's so, so much--many times in the black community here, you know, people aspire to become a doctor, and people assume that's the highest thing you can become, is a medical doctor, you know.  And I think it's traditional in America that, you know, immigrants, the sons of immigrants become doctors.  They say, my son is a doctor, you know, and that sort of thing.  So why did you think a physicist was superior to a doctor?
Speaker 2: Well, and I think it comes back from my comic book days in reading like 'Spiderman' 'cause the original Spiderman, of which I actually have a copy of, like Peter Parker was a physicist or he was studying.  Actually, I took it to be a physicist.  Actually, it seems like he was just studying science, but when you looked at the villains and stuff, they were all physicists so (laughter), I figured he was studying to be a physicist.  And so, you know, I held that in regard, and then with a combination of--you have to realize that if you think about the highest, when I was coming up, the highest-ranked profession was being a nuclear physicist because of the Cold War and stuff like that.  That's what I thought of, and, you know, the thing was, was that I, you know, had the desire to be a physicist, and I looked at being a doctor, you know, as being a fall-back position if all these stories that people had told me turned out to be true.  And, and you have to realize it was, and when I said, physicist, I meant like Ph.D. level, having a Ph.D. in physics.  So, even then, I knew this was a long haul.  And, you know, so I figured, well, I have enough time to figure out if I can really make it in this, and be competitive in this and build a career in this or a job.  I guess in those days we weren't thinking about a career, if I could get a job in this.  And so, I took comfort in the fact that, you know, I figured if I could, I'd only have to suffer through a biology course, and then all the other stuff like chemistry, physics, mathematics, I'm strong in.  I wasn't, I'd never really taken a biology course.  So I figured I didn't have any, you know, use this time to, to investigate, you know, to see where the real interest is, because, you know, this stuff about trying--and one thing is clear in physics.  You cannot with absolute certainty predict the future.  And certainly, the, you know, the people who were giving me advice, the adults, they don't have, you know, they're well-meaning people, but, again, they've never met a scientist.  In fact, they've never met an engineer.  They've never met a biologist so how can they say?  The only thing they know is that a doctor--they're operating from the fact that a doctor seems to make a lot more money than them.  And one of the examples that I knew was a doctor, he didn't appear to be doing that well.  Now, there's probably a lot of reasons for that, but, again, he was living in a smaller house.  His family was living in a smaller house than mine.  He was a strange guy, and so, you know, there's no absolute certainty, so, and like I said, I, you know, I was young, you know, immortal.  And I had time.  I think the key thing was, I wasn't anxious to get out of school.  Number one, you got to rise, you know, they had a draft then.  And, you know, and when I started school, you could get a deferment for staying in school.  And I didn't have a lot of, I could meet, you know, having a scholarship.  I could meet most of my material needs, and being, young, if necessary, I could lower my standards substantially (laughter), versus--and believe me, when you're in school, you know, even as an undergraduate, most classes don't start until nine [o'clock], and almost all of 'em are done by three o'clock.  And then the only thing you have to do is homework and read.  And, you know, you have time to yourself.  And that looked a lot, even in that age, that looked a lot better than going to a job and it definitely looked a lot better than going to Vietnam and going in the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 626393
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] is a, you know, now, was that a--how did you adapt to Morehouse 'cause it, and what I mean by "adapt" is that, from what you described, you were used to a lot of personal freedom at home, you know, being there by yourself a lot.  And Morehouse is a very structured environment in terms of the schools and, from the grads [graduates] I've talked to, with Benjamin Mays [president of Morehouse College from 1940-1967] and all, you know, and the black--it's more of an old-modeled black college environment.  Is that true or am I--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was in the crux of change.  And, and you had to go to, I don't know what, we used to call it "chapel", but the extent of the discipline was, they had structured curriculum.  They had, had to go to chapel once a week.  But I think if you lived--I didn't live on campus.  Well, I only lived on campus my freshman year.  But I didn't see a lot of structure there, other than those kinds of things, which I didn't, I mean to sit up in chapel once a week, and not to mention--not that I went to chapel every week.  I'd go every once in a while, sit up there for an hour.  And I've always been a stickler about going to class, you know, unless I was sick or something.  So I didn't mind having to go to class, but I didn't think about that as a great (laughter), you know, limit on my personal freedom.  So I mean, I mean I hear what you're saying and a lot of people reacted.  I can't, a lot of my classmates reacted badly, but mentally, a lot of my classmates had very, very bad habits.  And quite frankly, a number of 'em needed some structure, and what instruction was there, wasn't particularly effective.  And the strangest thing was, since I didn't live on campus, so, for example, not living on campus, people would assume things about you, that you had, first of all, that you had some den of sin (laughter) that you were running.  And then they would say things like, well, you're moving away from God.  I'll never forget this.  And I'm thinking, you know, not having a religious background, I thought this woman was having like pre-senile dementia.
Speaker 1: Is this a teacher or administrator?
Speaker 2: No, this was a dorm, well, we had dorm mothers, which was really strange because most of the dorm mothers were petrified of the men that were there at the dorms.  And so their job consisted of them locking themselves in their room and screaming at the dorm director that so and so was doing this, that and the other thing.  And we even had a nun that was a dorm mother in one of the more notorious, well, notorious dorms.  And she had a nasty habit of calling the police on the people in the dorm (laughter), and after a while, the Atlanta [Georgia] police started to ignore it.
Story_ID: 626394
Speaker 1: But, you know, I enjoyed Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and the nice thing about it was, is that after my freshman year, we got a new department chair for physics who was a real, in my view, a real physicist.  He had a Ph.D. from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], a plasma physicist, experimentalist.
Speaker 2: Now, who is this?
Speaker 1: His name is Carl Spight [also a HistoryMaker].  Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've interviewed Dr. Carl Spight.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so then we could get down, instead of all this--one thing about Morehouse and those [Benjamin] Mays' [president of Morehouse College from 1940-1967] people, they're into this image thing.  And, you know, don't get me wrong, I mean, you know, image is important.  But, you know, in science, you have to be able to do something.  You know, you have to be able to take a derivative.  You have to know Coon's Law.  You have to know Maxwell's equations.  You have to know how to use stuff.  You have to know their history, their importance, right.  And this image thing doesn't work for that.  And the nice thing, when Carl [Spight] came there, the image thing took on a different character.  So he says, wait, I'm a scientist, I'm an intellectual.  And, yes, you will learn what a Krisenhoff (ph.) symbol is, which is one of the fundamental objects in the general theory of relativity.  And, you know, you start to learn about things like the general theory of relativity, special theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and they don't become this thing that is too hard.  This concept of something being hard goes away.  The thing is, it's something to learn and something else to do.  And it resonated with me because this notion of, like [Charles O.] Ross [at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], this notion of the hard books, like when you put "hard", like 'Moby Dick', the adjective "hard" doesn't apply to 'Moby Dick' (laughter).  I mean it's certainly long (laughter), and that's not an indicator of low quality in literature, right.  And so, you know, then learning takes on a more deeper, fundamental aspect instead of, well, I gotta read this book so I can write this paper, so I can get a grade.  And it becomes something that's illuminating.  And that's what Carl does for physics.  And so we don't have these conversations about--we can have informed conversations about what you do with a degree in physics.  And actually, those are pretty short.  The main thing is, listen, you made the decision to major in physics, you know.  That ship has sailed, so now, you gotta learn some physics, all right.  And that's where you get this notion that one reason you learn like Maxwell's equations, when you go out and work, wherever you're gonna be, and you're working with colleagues that come from China, you know, upper Arlington or whatever, the only thing you're gonna have in common with these people is your discipline.  That's what you use to form whatever your relationship is gonna be.  Are you gonna be friends?  Are you just gonna be people who work together or do business together?  That becomes the starting point, okay.  You know, this guy doesn't care about your mother being poor or your grandfather coming from (laughter), your grandmother coming from Madagascar [Republic of Madagascar, off the southeastern coast of Africa, where Jackson's maternal ancestry traced back].  You, you're sitting here, and you're working on a problem.  And it's a problem that might not even have a solution.  And the whole enterprise might not work out well for everybody in the room.  And so the only thing you have to build a relationship with is the science that you know.  And you apply that to solving the problem.  And so the thing is, is that's what Carl brought to the table.
Story_ID: 626395
Speaker 1: And the other thing he [Carl Spight; also a HistoryMaker] brought to the table was he had sufficient reputation, he had a sufficient reputation and contact to bring another real physicist there [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] to work, James Turner, who has his Ph.D. from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so then you start learning things that the people at MIT and Princeton [University] learn, you know, professional things.  And you don't worry about image so much.  You know, what are the important questions in physics that physics professionals talk, they don't talk about with laymen, right.  They're real problems that folks have, that we gloss over a lot of times and the structure of science.  And people call it the history of science, but, you know, how we've built up to this point or why it's important to know this, that or the other things, 'cause, you know, most folks think of [Albert] Einstein as a smart guy, right.  Well, there were a lot of people a lot smarter than Einstein.  But the big difference was, was they weren't willing to abandon the ideas they had to work on something else.  So, for example, a big idea, oh, big idea.  The earth goes around the sun, okay.  And the sun doesn't go around the earth.  The problem is if you're a smart guy and whatever reason, you believe the sun goes around the earth, you can use your intelligence to put together, and you can look at a history of science, I mean there were a lot of people, real smart, that did whatever you could do with Euclidian geometry and whatever you stole from (laughter) the (unclear) Arabs and (laughter) other things to try to figure out the orbits of these planets.  In fact, their greatest contribution was the development of mathematics because it was an incredible thing.  And they did an incredible job.  The trouble was it was all based on the wrong assumption.  And then you get Kepler, who says, okay, let's take the (unclear) view and see what we can do with that.  And then, you know, he becomes one of the giants of astronomy.  And these other poor people who worked, I imagine, very hard on trying--and the payoff was, how do you build a navigational chart so you can sail around the Horn of Africa, both ways.  And by the way, it doesn't matter if--to show why that's important because you say, well, I can get in a boat and sail around the Horn of Africa.  Well, how can you get a set of navigation charts that are accurate enough so a merchant in India will put the equivalent of a hundred million dollars worth of property on a ship and sail that around the Horn of Africa with some comfort that he's gonna get paid (laughter).  That's a far more difficult problem.  And, you know, that's the thing that Carl and Turner and other ones, those were the worlds that they opened up.  And this image thing about running around, well, I mean obviously, you have to be able to prevent your results, and you have to, you know, know what an educated person knows.  But in science, you have to be able to share that same body of knowledge with your colleagues because no one in science works alone.  There's no way you can attract, you attack a problem of scale by yourself.  And that's what Carl and, and Jim Turner provided the confidence to do.  So then, you know, instead of talking about how hard differential equations is, you learn how to solve differential equations.  Furthermore, you learn to get a foundation in calculus, mathematics, so the hard stuff, you can read what, you can read about in Whittaker and Lotson or whatever text, and use it.
Story_ID: 626396
Speaker 1: What you're saying now, I guess, is that prior to the appearance of Dr. [Carl] Spight [also a HistoryMaker], there was--well, he changed the landscape of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, of the department [of physics at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Yeah, they had a woman there that was more interested in teaching science to kids in nursery school.  It always amazes me how folks elect to become professors in colleges and universities and then wanna revert back to teaching high school and elementary school (laughter).  I mean, that's why we have universities, you know, and colleges.  And they've had a historic mission of adding to people's knowledge, not teaching high school and nursery school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got a solid foundation at Morehouse [College]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: Well, between that and, with Carl there, you know, you had a confidence because I also went to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] as part of that.  Because of that woman (laughter), who was chair of the physics department, I came in there, I should get, thank her, I said, I'm getting out of this, you know.  I'm tired of, well, I didn't come here to take care of the little children.  I know that sounds mean, selfish, narcissistic, but that's the fact.  I came there to become a physicist, and it was very, you know, it was very disturbing, I mean 'cause she was, I think her name was Dr. Hanna.  It was, you know, she was a nice person.  Don't get me wrong.  And she was passionate about what she was doing.  It's just that that didn't have anything to do with physics, the profession of physics.  You weren't gonna be able to go to graduate school based upon what she was doing.  She didn't know the difference between real spin and iso-spin, didn't care.  That wasn't important, you know, to her.  And, you know, when you're sitting up there thinking about how to take--at the time, I thought I had to take the subject matter test in physics for the Graduate Record Exam [GRE].  And I saw, you know, in these little books they sell, examples of those.  And I'm saying, well, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, I thought it was gonna be an unmitigated disaster.  I felt at that time I should have gone to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] or any place other than this 'cause, you know, I'm not--these people are gonna send me into a gun fight with some paperclips.  And the only thing I'm gonna have is a, the best they can do is give me a coat and tie and have me speak right (laughter).  And then you gonna send me up in front of people who are building bombs that melt the skin off the bones of little children, you know.  But, no, when Carl got there, it all--well, I stayed in the engineering program.  That was the back--
Speaker 1: So this is a dual--we interviewed someone else this week that was in a dual program, and hers was Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Georgia Tech.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 626397
Speaker 1: So you could do this dual program for the bachelors [degree]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could do it for the whole, well, at the time I was there, since there was a lot of industrial money coming into it, it was for the whole center, for the whole AU [Atlanta University] center, as I later found out.  And it was led by a Dr. Charles Meredith, who had got his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.  And he was an aspiring, in his own way, scientist, you know, as long as he talked about scientists, as long as he talked about science, you know, he had a lot--and in many ways he and some others were responsible for my interest in--a lot of what I do is related to chemistry.  And he was a real chemist.  He wasn't one of these, these people who, (unclear) some chemists, they're like cooks (laughter).  They wanna, they, they just wanna, they just wanna mix things together (laughter).  And there's no underlying science there.  And I don't talk about, I'm not talking about like the quantum mechanics, you know, things that we do now.  I mean I'm talking about like electrochemistry, you know, something that dates back to Michael Faraday, okay.  So, you have to realize that the first mission, the first people who had the mission for electricity and magnetism, well, for, well, electricity and magnetism, they didn't call it magnetism then, were chemists because they were the people who could invent electro-chemical cells, i.e., batteries.  It was only in the 1850s to 1900s where it became a solid part and a foundation of physics.  And physics was applied to it.  And that's why I keep talking about Maxwell's equations, okay.  But, you know, there's a lot of chemists that didn't know anything about that.  And they were into this, like I said, recipe.  Now, to Morehouse's credit, although he was an administrator, they had Dr. Meredith, they had Dr. [Henry] McBay [chemistry faculty].  And they weren't like that at all.  They knew about the science of chemistry.  They knew about the relationship to thermodynamics, what we call statistical mechanics, you know, formal, real chemistry, and not this recipe thing, which many of the students, unfortunately, tended to embrace as real chemistry.  So, you know, Morehouse was good at having a real good collection of scientists, real African American scientists with degrees from the top universities, okay, who had had post-doctoral experience and who had had industrial experience.  And, and they were mathematics too.  And that's really, and I guess one of the things I object to is when you think about Morehouse, you think about, what's his name, [Benjamin] Mays [president of Morehouse College from 1940-1967], right.  And to his, to his credit Mays, well, Mays--well, not Mays so much, but Gloster [Hugh Gloster, president of Morehouse College from 1967-1986] , he brought in real people as opposed to these image builders and wanna-be preachers.  And the nice thing about real people, when they come from those schools, they can write you letters of recommendations that can get you into their graduate programs, you know, provided you have, you know, the grades and background to qualify for those.
Speaker 1: So would you credit Dr. Gloster's administration for really bringing the--
Speaker 2: I would say--
Speaker 1: --shoring up the science--
Speaker 2: Well, the thing was, I think the argument was, and, yeah, there was a Dr. Joseph Gales, too, in chemistry.  I think he got his degree from Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  But when they brought that generation of people in, it then became possible, that coupled with fruits of the Civil Rights Movement, to gain attendance to the significant graduate programs.  So, for example, let me give you an example, okay, we had another Morehouse alumnus, William Hutchinson.  He told me a story.  He was in chemistry, he majored in chemistry at Morehouse, all right.  And this was right after the state of, and maybe you know this, Mississippi, Alabama and maybe Georgia, they didn't want you going to like their schools, like the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  However, if you managed to gain admission to a school outside of the state, they would pay for you to go there, okay.
Speaker 1: It's one of the most baffling aspect of segregation.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's more for the triumph of knowledge in higher learning.
Story_ID: 626398
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, well, tell us about this--
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. Hutchinson was, now, Dr. Hutchinson at the time, he was offered admission.  He had gained admission to the California Institute of Technology [Pasadena, California], which is by anyone's standards one of the holy temples of science.  However, his teachers at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] wanted him to apply to the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] so he could desegregate the department of chemistry there by gaining admission to their graduate program.  Irrespective of whether or not all the people there were gonna somehow be objective and forget about their years of segregation, the fact that it's a public institution and in we would call now a red--I guess then it was like a red-hot state, right, and deny him the opportunities to study at, as I would call it, the holy temple of science and gain the advantages of what knowledge is there.  Not respecting, he would be facing probably in many ways, the same challenges he would face at the University of Alabama, but even though he would take on the same risks, the reward, i.e., the degree, would be much greater.  And obviously, he elected to go to California, but the difference is, is that when you had a class of scholars who had been trained at majority institutions, the highly-ranked majority institutions, they bring in both the knowledge and the contacts to the university that can propel other people to those institutions.  And I think in large part, people like Dr. [Carl] Spight [also a HistoryMaker] and Dr. [James] Turner and Dr. Meredith and a Dr. Frances Bacon and Joseph Giles, they enabled the cadre of scientists from Morehouse that we see now, that are my age, sixty or so, and that's the difference that they make.
Story_ID: 626399
Speaker 1: Okay, so a lot of students in science spend so much time in the departments, they don't really have much time to do anything else.  Was that your experience at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, my experience was, is that, I mean there were other things.  You know, I had a, I wouldn't call it by today's standards a vibrant social life, but, you know, I had, you know, a type of life that I expected of college and university.  You know, I've never been much of a, you know, sports fan.  You know, I don't like watching football or basketball.  My fondest memories of playing with balls is playing with my dog, and I could do that.  I could throw the ball and have her get it for hours.  But in terms of what I wanted to do, you know, college was ideal.  There was, I didn't feel that there were extraordinary demands on my time.  I got to immerse myself in physics and electrical engineering.  I got to play with all the toys of the day, what we used to call, minicomputers and mainframe computers.  Now, I must admit, my experience with the mainframe computers at the time, I got it all wrong because I had to--to program a computer then, you had to type out these cards and put it in there.  And after typing a few of those cards and writing the programs, I said, I don't see how this can go anywhere.  Now, happily, two years later the CRT terminal (laughter) became available, and then life got a lot better.  Stacking those cards and the quality of the operating, what they called operating systems, really weren't operating systems.  But once I got introduced to modern, well, even the primitive operating system that I could attack from the terminal, I then could begin to use some of my stronger mathematical skills.  And I got involved with the fledging science or engineering field of digital signal processing, which spoke to my stronger mathematical skills.  So I don't know.  I found the college experience find.  I think I was pleased with my social life.  I made friends that, you know, have been my friends to this day.  And we shared a common interest, at least--well, we shared a common professional interest and work ethic, you know, appropriate for the disciplines that we were going into.  That was the other important thing about the professors in the department.  They knew what level of intensity, at least of study, that you had to have to be a physicist.  And it's not like what I see in students today.  And the realization that physics and science at this level is, as taught in the United States, is very competitive.  And, you know, to be--and you have to be, you have to do the things that make you competitive and learn the things that make you competitive.  You cannot be a physicist and not have a firm understanding of quantum mechanics.  You cannot be a physicist unless you have a strong understanding of electricity and magnetism.  And these are the core disciplines that you need to master to be able to move forward.  And I structured, you know, my life accordingly until I gained--and others, gained a comfort level that we could continue to progress.  And I mean others chose not to and they chose to do something else.  And that's what college is for.  Sometimes, you're gonna do something other than what you trained for.  And, hopefully, you have the, you know, broad-laced skills to be able to do that.  And there's nothing wrong with that.
Story_ID: 626400
Speaker 1: Now, was there an attempt, did any of the--I know during the early '70s [1970s], that was a time when a lot of the black professional organizations were formed.  I know Dr. [Carl] Spight [also a HistoryMaker] is part of the, organization of black physicists.  Did, were those organizations being formed in those days?  Did you, were you a part of that as a student?
Speaker 2: Well, I was part of, I was at the founding conference for the National Society of Black Engineers.  And I did not get involved with the National Society of Black Physicists until--I'm trying to think of the first meeting I went to.  I think the first meeting I went to was in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They met at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] or they had--
Speaker 1: I just wondered what the activity--
Speaker 2: But there was, there was a lot of activity within the, or discussion within the American Physical Society.  You know, you had people, you know you had William Shockley running around, you know, you know, it's not wise for a physicist, particularly, someone like Shockley with his personality--
Speaker 1: Well, just explain who he is.  He's a white physicist who--
Speaker 2: Well, no, he's a--
Speaker 1: --Noble Prize winner, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambrifge, Massachusetts], Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] or Cal-Tech, MIT (laughter) Ph.D.-level physicist.  He is one of the inventors of the transistor, more exactly, the bipolar junction transistor, okay.  And he received the Nobel Prize [in 1956] for doing that.  He latched on to this notion that had been advocated back in Edwardian England (laughter) about genetic dispositions toward intelligence.  And he had worked out, very similarly to the people in the 1800s (laughter) this scale, based on race and tried to back it up with concepts from evolutionary biology and stuff.  And it's a first, it's one of the many demonstrations of pathological science.  But, naturally, this creates quite a stir.  And, you know, and people reacted to it.  Had I been around in those days, I would have reacted to it differently.  I would have pointed to his dismal failure as a business person, and the fact that the transistor he invented, even during, by 1980, had become irrelevant (laughter) and the fact that the people who invented, that he had tried to prevent the development of the technology that we use now for transistors.  And I would tell them about the stories, 'cause the founders of Intel had worked for Shockley, and because of his, given his lack of knowledge about evolutionary biology and genetics, that was only multiplied by his lack of knowledge about how to manage an enterprise (laughter).  And so, Craig Barrett, I'm trying to think of the other guy, Charles Moore, Andrew Drove, they all left Fairchild--one of his management tools was to, he took the salaries of everybody and made 'em public.  And so he would post them up on the wall what everybody was making.  And since he was supervising these people, (laughter)--now, I'm not an expert on human resource development anyway, but somehow, I think that's the quickest way you could destroy an organization is to list, is to take all the workers and put their salary up for them to see.  And eventually, those three guys left, and they formed what became Intel.  Shockley let, Fairchild got rid of Shockley, and he became a fellow at Stanford where they, I don't even think they even allowed, after a time, they didn't even allow him to teach a course.  He just was off some place.  But anyway, at that time, you had him running around saying that, you know, well, implying that blacks weren't capable of understanding the intricacies of physics.  And, in fact, the people who were best suited to study science were Asians.  That's how he differed from the guys in the Edwardian era.  I guess he wanted to show his objectivity.  But (laughter), and there's a lot of questions about people going in the--and I must say, one of the things, the advantages of having people like Shockley say things like that, that it completely silenced people within, at least the Morehouse community, from saying the same thing.  So, for example, there were many instructors at Morehouse that seemed to believe that people couldn't master higher mathematics at that time and that we shouldn't offer higher mathematics 'cause nobody will take it and that we should emphasize more applied mathematics kinds of things, which were basically, was the key word for, you know, remedial, semi-professional type mathematics, not much more beyond, you know, most folks would get beyond differential equations.  And I believe they said that because they didn't know higher mathematics.  And in order to, and to teach higher mathematics, would result in a number of faculty positions going to white mathematicians who had been properly trained or trained in higher mathematics.  However, Shockley and the other folks, basically, shut those people down.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: You know, because, you know, you have to realize that, you know, as--that I realized a long time, as I was growing up, just as my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] and her friends had never encountered a black physicist or a black mathematician.  And maybe they did find some chemists or an engineer, right, that we had that were faculty members at HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] that had the same experience and had not been, you know, educated at top-tier institutions.  So they don't believe, they don't know about higher mathematics.  They don't know about quantum mechanics.  They're, and they certainly don't know about quantum field theory.  And so they get very threatened by people like Carl Spight, James Turner and things, that do, because it is empowering, you know.  And that's why you start making up other mathematics (laughter), so you can feel empowered too (laughter).  And that's what you'll see in a lot of the curriculums at these places.
Story_ID: 626401
Speaker 1: So you think like, now, you've been involved in two black colleges over the past twenty years, Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] and-
Speaker 2: Three, counting this one.
Speaker 1: Three, okay, Morgan State [University, Baltomore, Maryland] and Howard [University] and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Did you, over the years do you think, have things changed for the better for the most part or--
Speaker 2: Well, it's kind of a cycle because, you know, what happens is like at Howard, is, you'll get someone--so, for example, if they're--Howard's a research institution, right.  In fact, it's the highest ranked HBCU [historically black colleges and universities].  That's a research institution.  I mean it's up there in the top hundred, right.  The truth is to do research, you have to have people who are prepared to contribute to the knowledge base, okay, who are trained at a level where they can contribute.  And once you get those kinds of people in, then you can get access to federal funds from the agencies, okay.  And you need people that have the kind of credentials that say, and reputations that say that they can perform at that level because the whole thing is, it's been constructed to be competitive.  It's not an entitlement.  It's never been constructed as a, it's never been envisioned as an entitlement, okay.  And when I say "entitlement," it was not, you know, it doesn't take on the flavor the entitlement takes on now, where, you know, that's what we give to, you know, these--I guess what I'm trying to say is that majority institutions want entitlements too.  And it was decided long ago that federally-funded research would not be an entitlement.  In fact, originally it was only geared toward ten institutions, and it wasn't until 1962 it got opened up to other institutions like state institutions, like Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], University of Illinois, okay.  And so, and it's not perfect, obviously.  I'm sure, you know, there're earmarks and other things (laughter), but even those in science are competitive.  And you have to have a certain kind of person there who's, you know, pedigree fits that mode, okay, that they either have a list of degrees or accomplishments that fit that mode.  And what happened is early on, HBCUs had access to these people, like Carl Spight [also a HistoryMaker], [James] Turner and others.  And they were, you know, able to bring the knowledge and the credibility necessary to be able to compete for federal funds.  And the trouble with that, is, as I said, the real organizations.  When you bring people in who are either real bad or real good on the out, outliers of the mean, it becomes very disruptive.  I mean when I, you know, one analog might be Lebron James and Miami Heat [National Basketball Association] (laughter), when you bring, when, you know, you say it's a boom for him.  It's a loss for Cleveland [Ohio].  Overall, it was very disruptive for the league.  That doesn't mean they're gonna go broke or anything, but I think you'll agree that that's very disruptive.  Well, the same thing happens in academia.  If you bring in a number of people who, you know, pedigree is way above--and experience base is substantially different than the mean, it becomes very traumatic for the organization 'cause, you know, you have people saying, well, we had--for example, if you have someone like me that comes in.  And you have a like six tracks of physics.  You know, you got physics for scientists and engineers, physics for pre-medical students, physics for general education.  It's even physics for liberal arts (laughter).  And then you have me saying, well, wait a second.  No, there's only one kind of physics, okay.  And what we're gonna do is what's usual, customary and reasonable for our institution.  And, you, okay, we need to have certainly two flavors for scientists and engineers and one for students of the life sciences or for pre-medical type students, all right.  But, you know, we can't be, you can't be, you can't make up courses because what inevitably happens is, is that you water it down.  And so it's not physics for anyone.  And, you know, that was a kind of disruption you have.  And when you have people who have been teaching those courses for years and years, they start, you know, coming up with justifications for why those exists.  And a lot of time, those justifications are, well, our students can't handle it.  And that's happened as recently as, with a colleague of mine, who's a graduate student who's currently at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  One of the things is, is that physics for scientists and engineers.  Most times majors in like biology, chemistry, math or whatever are required to take the physics for scientists and engineers which is calculus-based, which means they have to have had calculus, okay.  And if you're planning graduate school, say at Princeton, most of the people who are matriculating to Princeton have had physics for scientists and engineers with calculus, and calculus and other things.  So imagine your surprise if you've come to Princeton.  You do well at Spelman [College] or Morehouse [College] [Atlanta, Georgia] and then you come to Princeton, and you haven't had physics for scientists and engineers.  You've had physics that's not calculus based.  And, well, what does that mean?  Well, that means you have none of the tools that allow you to analyze a continuous charge distribution like in an electrophoresis cell for electrophoresis separation, which is a common procedure in molecular biology.  So you don't have any of the tools.  So, again, it's a situation where you send somebody into a gunfight with a knife.  And they'll say, well, I'm not majoring in physics.  I'm never gonna use this or I'm not majoring in math.  I'm never gonna use this.  And, again, what you've lost--that's partially true, but what you've lost is that connection with the colleague standing next to you who's had that experience, that you're trying to desperately to establish a professional relationship with.  And that's what starts to happen if you don't have a curriculum that's properly set up.
Story_ID: 626402
Speaker 1: And there's, there's a number of pathologies that you can get into in science departments because, again, in science, the notion of accumulation of knowledge is important, that one course builds on another.  So, for example, you can't take Physics II until you've taken Physics I.  I know it delays, you can't fit Physics I in your schedule.  Can't you take Physics II?  And you have to exercise leadership to say, no.  And, they'll say well, I could do this, I could do that.  No, because the only thing you can say is, on average people do better after they've taken Physics I.  You know, you might be an outlier of the average, but I say, on average, they do better.  And even though it affects your schedule, even thought it affects your time to, it may affect your time to degree, you know, whether or not you can take a vacation this summer, it doesn't matter.  You've got to take Physics II, lecture and lab before you take Physics--Physics I before you can take Physics II.  And you have to have a foundation before you can take upper division courses in Physics.  You have to have the mathematical foundation to cover them.  And, you know, this was what gets lost many times within departments.  That's what academic leadership is.  And, you know, it's painful.  You know, nobody likes, no one likes telling somebody, no.  But these are the things that, at least when I was in school, people would take you aside and say.  That's what Dr. [James] Turner would say, said, I'll never forget.  I was taking or auditing a course that Dr. [Carl] Spight [also a HistoryMaker] was teaching that involved tensor analysis, for special, for the general theory of relativity.  And I recall, he looked at me 'cause we were working with these Krisenhoff symbols which are horrible things (laughter).  But, but, and he looked at me, and he said, "Listen, if you're gonna be taken seriously in graduate school, you have to master these."  I said, well, I'm gonna be an experimentalist.  I'm gonna be in a lab.  He said, no, you're not gonna get to the lab.  You're not get past problem set four.  You're not gonna get past the qualifier.  To get to the lab, you've gotta get past the qualifier for which you get maybe two shots.  And so they're gonna ask you what a Krisenhoff symbol is.  They don't care about what you need in the lab.  Yeah, you know, you can do your little (laughter), yeah, you know, you can go to a lab and tell 'em, yeah, I'm the kind of guy that changes the oil in his car.  You know, that'll impress them, but to get to the lab (laughter), you're gonna have to know what a Krisenhoff symbol is and what a tensor is and how to use them and when to use them.  And just solving the problem isn't good enough.  There's a question of elegance.  So, no, if you just add everything up, that doesn't look very good.  And you will be judged on how elegant your calculations are.
Story_ID: 626403
Speaker 1: They're strong in, they try to be strong in engineering, but I don't know.  When I give my look at it, 'cause I still consider myself from the rocket days, a technologist.  So I'm always looking at new toys, okay, and new developments, particularly, in electronics.  And what you find is, is like at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and at FAMU [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], in their school of engineering, the students don't learn how to use the new devices.  So, for example, you know what a gyroscope is, right?  Okay--
Speaker 2: Should we get this on--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  We're rolling.
Speaker 2: Oh, you are rolling, okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: So, early on, you learn how to use the gyroscope, okay, and gyroscope, you know, you pull it, and then it points in one direction, right.  And there's conversation angle or minimal oilers equations and a lot of things that go on.  And it's one of the problems in physics that we talk about a lot in the course called 'mechanics'.  Well, because of developments in the semiconductor industry, people have learned how to build electronic gyroscopes and moreover, they've learned how to build electronic accelerometers, okay.  So your iPhone or your, when you turn it around, the screen flips.  That's because there's a gyroscope in there that can tell it what orientation it is.  And this is a class of devices known as Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems [MEMS].  And they are difficult devices to use, suitable for an undergraduate in electrical engineering or even mechanical engineering to learn.  It's not something, and a lot of hobbyists can pick it up now, right.  And, but there's a whole field of MEMS devices that represent the next big thing.  And I can even give you a time for the big thing too.  In 2016, all the, all automobiles manufactured in the United States will have to have electronic stability control.  One of the key issues of stability is, well, which way is the car tilting?  Well, the only device we can use to do that (laughter) is a gyroscope, okay.  And so each car is gonna have to have one of these things, and for redundancy, probably three.  So it'd be helpful, you know, if you have, if you're educating engineers that they know how to use this thing, at least they know that it exists.  And what I see, have seen in schools of engineering is that those devices haven't entered the laboratories.  And many people, particularly people educated in colleges of education, we don't have the money, okay.  We can't afford a lab of this.  And your next question should be, how much does it cost, 'cause that would have meant you looked into it, just like when my mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] told me I'm not gonna make any money in physics, if I had been impertinent, I would have asked her, well, how much does a physicist make?  The point is, is that those things don't cost that much.  In fact, I can tell you exactly how much it cost since I happen to have six of 'em.  You can get one for 11.95 [dollars].  So let's round that off to 10 [dollars].  Well, if he had fifteen kids in the class, that's a 150 dollars.  So I'm expected to believe we've budgeted to $150 per semester?  And so the, my point is, is that the entry of--one of the things that university is a place where new knowledge is generated and conveyed.  And that's one of the missions that seems to have gotten lost in all this talk of vocationalism and other things, is that your base mission is the generation of knowledge.  And the value of your graduates is the knowledge that they carry, and in science and engineering, that relates to the techniques, their knowledge of physics, what are the areas, what are their significance, what affects they can have, how they can be applied, what consequences they have.  And I can think of--and I don't know how useful it is, I can think of numerous examples that occur--so for example, we had, we were bringing in transfer students into the school of science, into the university.  But they came to the school of science.  And there were none of them that wanted to be physics majors, okay.  Most of 'em, as you might predict, wanted to be pre-medical majors.  And, you know, this isn't unexpected.  There's no one, even the California institution, [California] Institute of Technology [Pasadena, California] doesn't have a lot of physics majors.  But the point I made to the students was, you know, and I'm not gonna get mad 'cause you don't wanna major in physics.  You know, that's up to you.  That's a very serious decision.
Story_ID: 626404
Speaker 1: But the point is, last Thursday, or two Thursdays ago now [this session of the interview was conducted on July 16, 2012], because of physics, there was a discovery in physics, two discoveries in physics, they're gonna change your life.  They're gonna affect you directly.  One was discovery of or proof of the existence of the Higgs boson in Geneva [Switzerland, at CERN, the European organization for Nuclear Research].  The other was, Intel bought a 15 percent stake in ASML, the company that builds semiconductor equipment, manufacturing equipment.  The discovery of Higgs is like discovering, for real, that the sun doesn't go around the earth.  The 15 percent stake in ASML tells you that Intel will probably be the only surviving semiconductor manufacturing factor.  They will be the only manufacturer of microprocessors, the chips for servers and probably the, reduced instruction set machines that are used in iPads, simply because by that 15 percent stake, that gives them total control over one tool that is used in semiconductor manufacturing which is the lithography tool, the tool that actually prints the circuit, that the tools that ASML make will be able to present, will be able to manufacture circuits with feature size below fifteen nanometers, which is five nanometers, seven nanometers below the limits of what you can do with silicon.  So whatever the next transistor is, Intel will be the only person--they'll either be the only person that can make it or they'll rake in the money from selling their tools to other people.  And I can guarantee you, from what I know, from my interaction with Intel, they'll never sell the best tool to a competitor.  And that will change your life.  Maybe it will be your 401(k) that's got Intel in it (laughter).  That's what I'm betting on (laughter).  But those are things related to physics.  And if you were immersed in the field, you'd know about it.  And the existence of the Higgs, because people, colleagues here always say, well, what's the importance of the Higgs?  Well, suppose, because of the existence of the Higgs, we find out, well, there're more dimensions.  The only reason we know about the dimensions that we can see now is because we can see, touch and feel them.  Is it a little arrogant to believe that because of our evolutionary biology that there aren't dimensions that we can't see, touch and feel?  Okay, but just because we can't see it, doesn't mean they're not there, or touch it or feel it.  And, just because we can't see it, touch it or feel it, doesn't mean we can't exploit them.
Story_ID: 626405
Speaker 1: Okay, now, break this down for the common man, which I am, actually (laughter).  I don't understand physics, so, yet. Maybe one day I might, but what is the Higgs boson?  What are we talking about?
Speaker 2: What is a Higgs boson?  Well, that's a long story.  A Higgs, in the modern theory--I'm sorry, in the current theory of interactions--well, let's start.  In the beginning, we've looked at the forces between things, like the force of gravity and like electrostatic force between two charged particles, okay.  So in Isaac Newton's day, we characterize everything in terms of forces, okay.  Well, then, Maxwell [James Clerk Maxwell, Scottish theoretical physicist] came along in 1878, and we began and we began, instead of looking at the forces, we had to invent fields that go between them, okay, 'cause the field are what?  Convey the forces.  And so instead of looking at forces, we decided it's a lot easier to look at the underlying fields and then at the end of the day, do something to the field to determine the force, okay.  Now, we fast forward, and we say that, well, it's a little bit more complicated than that because there're different types of fields, in particular, the fields that mediate the strong force, the nuclear force, which you probably don't have a lot, that we may have built, (unclear) thermonuclear weapons out of, okay, those fields are different than the electrostatic field and gravitational field, okay.  And so the way those work is that we exchange particles.  In the case of the, so for every field, there's a particle that mediates it.  For the electromagnetic field, there's the photon.  For the strong force, there's the gluon.  For the weak interaction, the force responsible for radioactivity, okay, the field is a lot more complex, primarily due to a unification.  And that is, is that, it turns out that the weak interaction is the same force as the electromagnetic force that we see.  It's just manifestations of the same thing, except the electromagnetic force uses a photon.  For the weak interaction, we have the Higgs boson, okay.  Now, this was pre--as you might imagine, this was predicted by Higgs, a guy named Peter Higgs in Scotland, yeah, Scotland, okay.  And the nice thing about it is, is that the electro weak theory which involves a standard model, our best theory of physics.  In order for that to work, there has to be a Higgs boson.  Then you say, well, who cares about all this stuff of particles?  The reason why people care or particularly, physicists care, is that the mathematical (laughter) framework for the, and particularly, one process called spontaneous symmetry breaking, has application in other fields of physics.  For example, the ones that you use to predict the properties of LEDs [light-emitting diodes] and solid-state physics, and low-temperature physics, and the physics of having a whole bunch of particles together, okay.  You can use this thing called spontaneous--it's like inventing a derivative, okay.  Say, who's it, oh, yeah, Newton or (unclear), they invented how to take a mathematical derivative or let's do it simpler.  The guy who invented how you write an equation for a line, okay.  Now, you take that equation and you use it in physics, chemistry, mathematics, business, everything, right.  In fact, you take that for granted.  Now, what happens if one day someone says, oh, that's all wrong.  That's really not true.  It has a written, it has a limited range of applicability.  And all those linear equations, all those littering features, all the things you predict from it, all that comes into question as to their validity.  That's why it's important to find the Higgs.  So we can keep that little bit of knowledge and it looks real strange too because he had this theory that explains most of the things you see.  But it predicts this particle sitting there at 126 GEV.  And you don't see it there.  So you gotta think, well, maybe this theory's wrong.  Actually, it's proof that it's wrong.  So what do we replace it with?  And we don't have a good replacement.  We don't, there's not a replacement on the horizon.  Now, the other thing it does--that's why people in physics are interested in it, and that's why you should be concerned.  But the other thing is, is that it also, the predictions that is proof of the existence of extra dimensions, okay.  So, well, what do I mean?  So, if a long time ago when you stepped out onto a field, it looks like the earth's flat, right.  Okay, because the curvature of the earth is so great unless you look over a distance, you don't see it go.  So the natural assumption made is, well, the earth's flat.  Okay, now, when you go up in a balloon, you can clearly see, well, wait, the earth's not flat.  That's a big difference, okay.  Now, that's what happens when you find other dimensions, and then you can exploit the fact that the earth's not flat.  Like you say, oh, yeah, I can get to India by going this way.  And eventually, I'll come around there, okay.  That means I could trade with India, you know, I could make money or whatever, okay.  Now, imagine that there're seven additional dimensions, okay.  Now, the next question is, well, can I exploit those?  And the answer is, well, I don't know, but if I go from the two--from the flat earth to the curved earth, I was able to exploit that, so (laughter), if I go from the four dimensions to seven dimensions, odds are I can exploit that.  How?  I don't know.
Story_ID: 626406
Speaker 1: Okay. One way you might be able to exploit it [finding out that there are other dimensions to the universe, as an implication of the discovery of the Higgs boson] is to explain where gravity comes from, okay.  The other thing you can do is you can explain where 95 percent of the matter in the universe is that we can't see.  And you also might be able to explain why the universe is accelerating, okay.  We see the expansion from the Big Bang.  So, you know, you see the universe expands from the Big Bang, but it's doing more of an expanding.  The rate of expansion is increasing, so it's flying apart, okay.  Well, the only force we have that's repulsive is when you got like charges.  So gravity, we've never seen repulsive gravity, right.  Strong force, always attractive, even the weak interaction, attractive, though it's weak.  So that means, for things to fly apart in the simplest sense, there has to be a fifth force that's causing it to accelerate with its field and its mediator.  So, and all those things, contribute to fundamental understanding, and all of them are potentially exploitable for the, you know, practical things like keeping your car from turning over (laughter).  You know, having better, you know, having little flashlights everywhere (laughter) on your keychain.  But, the point is, that's what you don't know.  And that's why, and then with the Intel exploiting extreme ultraviolet lithography, and dual patterning, to build the next generation of ICs, microprocessor, and having a technology that extends beyond the limits of silicon, okay, carries us into what's ever the next big thing.  Now, what's gonna be the big thing will probably be silicon somehow, but it's not gonna look like the way we build transistors now.  So it's like going from a straw house, mud hut to a brick house and with the obvious economic benefits, and a threat, to society of having one company control the technology.  And their control is just based on the cost, the R and D [research and development] costs and the construction--the structure of the patent laws, how long they can keep somebody else from getting it.  If it takes too much money for someone else to catch up with them and, you know, the international laws pertaining to patents hold, they'll hold their dominance.  And they'll gobble up everybody else.
Story_ID: 626407
Speaker 1: Okay, let's, okay, let me catch up with the chronology a little bit now.  So, when you left Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], you left Morehouse in 1974 or five [1975]?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see.  I left Morehouse for Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1974.
Speaker 1: '74 [1974], okay.
Speaker 2: And I was there for, until '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I got my two degrees [bachelors in physics and electrical engineering] and moved on to graduate school.
Speaker 1: So you went to Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], right, for grad [graduate] school?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].
Speaker 1: No, it was Stanford, okay.  All right, now, how, why did I keep, wanna put you in Ohio State.  All right, well Stanford, all right.  So you go on to Stanford--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and so what happened at Stanford?  Was, you were, I assume you were prepared for Stanford.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, once I got to Stanford, that was like, that must have been like the people, the underground railroad, when they finally got to Canada (laughter) because (laughter), Stanford was, you know, it was nice.  I mean it was more than nice.  I mean it was a whole different experience than Georgia Tech.  You know, the physics department is, you know, the departments at places like Stanford are really independent of the university.  So it's like your own little, so it's like the department which is your own, like planet earth.  Then there's the science, engineering community which is like your solar system.  And then there's the rest of the university.  And, you know, I got there, and, you know, it's just a whole type of, it's a whole different relationship.  You know, everyone wants to come and give a talk at Stanford.  So you meet all the luminaries of physics, current physics that are there.  You have access to tremendous facilities, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center [SLAC] was the one I spent most of my time at.  The campus facilities, they have machine shops.  They had electronic (laughter), they had an electronic shop, and they had a store room for both, you know, nuts and bolts and other things, all the things you need to, you know, put equipment together.  And they're definitely in the line of putting things together for research 'cause they have all kinds of capabilities.  You know the social structure is, you know, purely academic, a high level, elitist kind of thing.  And they had a large African American population of graduate students and undergraduate students and far more so than Georgia Tech.  And the physics department had a very large number of African American graduate students.  I mean there were four guys in my class out of a class of twenty-five.  And so it was a great, and, you know, one of my, my best friend from Morehouse [College], he was in medical school there.  And they had their own communities and things and we were able to room together.  You know, weather is nice, the campus--I don't know if you've ever been there.  The campus is beautiful, a lot of space.  You know, I was there and settled in, started taking classes, actually bumped into [William] Shockley [winner of the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics] there, actually, literally did--I was running to quantum mechanics, and I bumped into him when I had a cup of coffee in my hand.  And he had been neutered by then, so (laughter).  It didn't make any difference.  You know, you're at the height of Silicon Valley, Santa Clara, computer club was there.  That was the one that [Steve] Wozniak and [Steve] Jobs [co-founders of Apple Computers] was in.  You could, there were parts everywhere.  I mean you could get all the ICs that you needed to build whatever, memory for what were then microcomputers.  And, you know, you had so many, you know, it was like a technical mecca, and then you had the, you know, folks, everybody wanted to, everybody was trying to strike it rich, kind of folks there.  So it was a very, you know, positive, you know, for a technical person, scientist, it was a very positive environment.  They had just, '76 [1976], Stanford had discovered the cy particle.  That was there, and so they were, you know, Noble Prize winners, potential Noble Prize winners there, and Martin Perl had discovered the Tau electron [won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1995].  They invented a laser, Arthur Shiloh was a member of the faculty.  And then the laser group, I called it the light, the people who work with light, be it lasers or other light sources, was very vibrant in there.  And, you know, you didn't have to go very far.  I mean you had Hewitt Packard there, Variant there, Intel, Motorola, Vance Micro Devices, all the big companies were there.  So it was a place, as I used to say, you know, you could come there as a graduate student and you could wind up retiring in Silicon Valley.
Story_ID: 626408
Speaker 1: So what did you focus on in terms of your research, I mean to get your master's and Ph.D. [degrees].  And I assume you just went straight through, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I was, first of all, that's the other thing that we have to kill at HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  In science, when you get a master's degree, that's called a consolation prize.  That's for people who didn't rise to candidacy for a Ph.D.  And as I tell, try to tell students here, who think about it as a serial process.  I say, no, it's not a serial process.  I say, when you apply to graduate school, you tell them that you wanna get a Ph.D.  It's not like they're gonna stop you from getting a master's.  And you're saying that, why would they provide financial aid for somebody who's not getting a Ph.D.?  You know, if you wanna get a master's [degree], you need to join the [U.S.] Army or something where they send you there and they're paying for it, you know, or unless you're independently wealthy and like paying for it.  So, you know, you gotta get that out of your mind.  And you need to make the commitment.  You either make the commitment or you need to make a commitment to something else.  And there's no playing around, not at the elite places, you know.  They're dead serious.  You know, they didn't get all this money for doing research by having master's students around (laughter).  You know, so you need to get that out of your mind altogether.  And so, anyway, I started at Stanford and what I wound up, what my field of interest is, is loosely called Atomic Molecular Physics.  And primarily, what I say is, I learned how to use light like a sculpture, a sculptor does.  I use it to make things.  I use it to analyze things.  I use it to pull out new knowledge.  I don't focus on the source.  I've used lamps.  I've used lasers and most of my reputation is based on using something called synchrotron radiation sources or light sources for short.
Story_ID: 626409
Speaker 1: So, when I got to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], I immediately, at first I had wanted to work with the laser community, laser electro-optic community, in particular, Arthur Shiloh in his group and Ted Hinch (ph.), in his group.  And then seeing that that was a little crowded.  At the time, there were three African Americans working in his group, I decided to look into other things.  And a very good friend of mine, Dr. Deborah Jackson, no relation, was working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center [SLAC] at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at the time, or actually, it was the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Project at the time.  And I went out there to visit.  And they were doing some very, you know--I know it sounds trite, but they were doing very interesting things.  One of the problems in the light source community is that for different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, there aren't good light sources, okay.  And that means sources of light where you can exploit all the properties of light.  As you probably realize, light is a wave, okay, or we think of light as a wave, okay.  Well, one of the reasons we like to think about it as a wave, is there are things you can do with waves that you can't do with particles.  So, for example, the big thing that you can do with waves is you can interfere 'em to get either constructive or destructive interference, meaning that you can either by just manipulating the phase of the wave, you can make it disappear or you can square, quadruple its strength, okay.  But that means that you have a source of light that has a extremely well-defined wavelength.  That's what a laser is, okay.  Because of the laser process itself, the amplification process and the construction of optical resonators, we're able to achieve unprecedented control over the phase of the wave, and, in fact, we call that wave-front engineering.  That's what allows holography.  That's what allows laser light shows.  That's what allows us to do phase contrast imaging, all non-linear optics, all the things that we do with lasers that we can never do with a light bulb or a chaotic source of light.  In the x-ray region of the spectrum, particularly at that time, there was no wave-front engineering.  One of the problems with x-rays is that we don't have optics to control them.  So we don't have a lens for x-rays to focus it to a spot.  We don't, at that time, we didn't even have mirrors for an x-ray, okay.  So typically what you do is you have an x-ray tube and it puts out x-rays in all directions.  And then you put a screen in front of it, and you punch a hole through it and the x-rays come out and you do your experiment.  Well, all the light that's radiated around is lost, can't use, okay.  Stanford had been exploiting the idea of using a particle accelerator to generate x-rays.  And the idea is simple, and it'd been demonstrated early on.  The idea is, the way we get light, most of the radiation that we see, is that we take an electrical charge, and we accelerate it.  So we, when you have it going around in a circle because it's generating, changing direction, it's accelerating all the time and your circular motion gives you constant acceleration.  Now, the magic happens is when you accelerate a particle to extremely high energies, to relativistic energies, okay.  Special relativity, in fact, relativistic radiation theory tells us very precisely what will happen.  One of the things that happens is, is something called the search light effect.  And that means, instead of the x-rays being emitted above and below the plane of the storage ring, the area they're circulating around, the two lobes come forward like a search light so that the angle between the two lobes is infinitesimal.  And so it just looks like one, okay.  And then all the energy that you put into generating the, to accelerating a particle, most of it comes out as x-rays.  The spectral distribution of the light is shifted to extremely high-energy x-rays, the type of which you could never produce in a tube, okay.  Now, you still have the problem of optics, particularly back in 1976 'cause we didn't have x-rays mirrors.  So the best you could do is grazing incident type of reflections, which meant you take a very well-polished surface, and you have x-rays come in at an extremely small and they reflect off with some efficiency, okay.  Now, the trouble is, is that you're not gonna get a large change that way, but it's enough so you can direct light out of the accelerator into an experimental beam line.  And the other thing is, is that these x-rays have very well-defined phases.  So if you can shift the phase between two waves, you can get constructive, destructive interference.  And though you can't easily do that, particularly in '76 [1976], atoms and molecules can do that.  And so that becomes the basis of the technique known as Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy or XAFS and a number of other techniques, okay.  And my colleague was working on XAFS at the time which eventually someone should probably get the Nobel Prize for, but I think their chances have dimmed.  But that was a revolutionary way of studying materials and chemical compounds, particularly in the solid state or in liquid state, something like that.  And so that work was going on there at the time, and I looked at that.  And that was a little far afield from what I had envisioned as my career.  And, and so I thought about going into condensed matter physics, low-temperature physics 'cause there was a group there working on that.  I was then approached by a group in the chemistry department about doing work at the Synchrotron Radiation Lab.  And I started working with them.  And as it turned out, that's who turned out to be my thesis advisor, Dr. Richard Zare.  And the experiment was very simple, which was one of its appeals, as opposed to this XAFs thing, which was, you know, they had a lot of chemists and biologists and other people working on it.  And I didn't think it was pure enough physics, whereas what Dr. Zare was proposing was very physics-y.
Speaker 2: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: Z-A-R-E.
Speaker 2: Z-A-R-E.
Story_ID: 626410
Speaker 1: And the experiment [at Stanford University's Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory] was, conceptually was this.  Believe it or not, we don't--, one of the things people in physics and chemistry like to do is to study simple systems.  So a simple system would be a two-atom molecule in the gas phase, two atoms because then there's only two atoms.  If you have just one atom, that's atomic physics.  If you have two, that's molecular.  So that's the simplest molecular physics problem, okay.  And so that makes it chemistry instead of physics, kind of, in some people's mind.  And what we wanted to do was to look at the internal distribution of energy.  When you, when you take a, an energy and angle of momentum, when you take like nitrogen, let's say, and you put a light in that has energy greater than the energy of the bond that's holding them together, and when you do that, that breaks the bond.  And the two atoms move apart, you put in sufficient energy to break the chemical bond, all right.  Now, you say, well, why do you wanna do this?  Well, there're a number of ways of breaking chemical bonds.  You put it in water, it dissolves, put it with another chemical, it forms compounds.  But to this day, no one understands how that works.  Then you say, well, who cares 'cause we, you know, we're making gasoline and all this other stuff.  Well, suppose you wanna make something that doesn't exist in nature.  Suppose you have something that has more (laughter) than one bond in it?  Or even better, suppose you wanna take something apart and make it harmless like Sarin [organo-phosphorus compound; chemical weapon; potent as a nerve agent] or other things.  You know, not only is Sarin deadly as a nerve gas, it's a tough little joker to take apart.  And you'd really like, you know, when you have something like Sarin around, you don't like doing the recipe chemistry (laughter) because, you know--and by the way, you'd really like to be able to get rid of more than a milliliter of it, right, you know, when somebody's got like 50, 60 metric tons of this stuff laying around.  So, to do that, as I tell people all the time, you have to understand what's going on and in some detail.  And so we had, Dr. [Richard] Zare [Jackson's doctoral thesis advisor] has a simple problem.  And he says, okay, we wanna, we have this molecule here, and we're gonna put in light to split the bond.  As these two atoms split apart, you know, when you split the bond, you also, the excess energy goes to creating an ion.  So this one's charged, and this one's charged (laughter).  And now we have two charged things.  Well, they're both charged so they'll be running apart, right.  That's true.  The trouble is, that doesn't happen instantaneously.  As they go apart because they're two charged particles, they generate an electric field.  The electric field, okay, we have this atom, it's still, even though we split it apart, it's still spinning, doing this.  And so it has a dipole moment.  The dipole interacts with the field, and the thing aligns.  Okay, so it points, the dipole moment which is a quantity you're not familiar with, but it points in--what direction does it point in?  He said, well, it points this way.  No, it can't point that way.  That's not allowed by quantum mechanics.  Well, it goes like this.  Well, how do you know?  That's more energetically favored.  Well, no, it's not.  What about this?  And what about this energy that's spinning it around?  It could suck some from there and do that, and the question is, nobody knows how that occurs, okay.  And because it's aligned, some of the energy also goes into exciting this and then it decays and gives off light.  That light carries the signature of the angular momentum of the particle, which allows us to calculate which way it's pointing, provided you can break enough of 'em, so you can get enough light out.  And, you know, because it's not an absolute process, most of the light goes straight through and so you need a very intense source at the ultraviolet wavelength, extreme ultraviolet wavelengths.  And they're, the only domestic source are these lamps which are horribly, horribly feeble.  And so you can never get enough signal count to be able to do it in the laboratory.  Well, I calculated once how long it would take you, and I could remember my classmate, Gary McClellan [ph.], who said, oh, you can do this.  If you count for two years and you take the weekends off (laughter), you'll be able to get enough statistics so you're at the one percent level.  And, you know, barring any power outages or, and you're getting exchange, you know, you keep a supply of these lamps, you'd be able to do the experiment.  And then, you know, I counter with a calculation of how many photons, how much, what the intensity of the synchrotron radiation is, in which case you could do it in four hours.  And that meant, well, that immediately says you can do it on more than nitrogen.  You can do nitrogen, carbon monoxide, NH, H [hydrogen]--, you know, it opens up the whole realm of things to do just that little experiment.  And, and so we went--and, you know, Dr. Zare had already worked through all this, and he had done it with atoms when he was at Columbia [University, New York].  Now, he wanted to do it--the synchrotron opened up the possibility to do it with molecules.  And it's a fundamental kind of experiment.  It's not something like, you know, it's gonna lead to building faster micro-processors or better iPhone.  But it's a good fundamental problem for a student of physics, and quite frankly, that's the time, when you're young, as I tell students here, that is the time to work on fundamental problems, you know.  That's when you, before you have, you know, family and responsibilities, that's the time when you can spend the time looking for the origin of the universe and things like that to work on, look for the Higgs [boson].  You don't wanna be sixty going out looking for the Higgs.  That's a young man's job.
Story_ID: 626411
Speaker 1: And, and so we, myself--then I had a senior graduate student assisting me.  I mean I was assisting or apprenticing with a senior graduate student.  And we went around the task of putting together the apparatus to use on the storage ring, the synchrotron radiation source.  There were a couple of problems, technical problems, meaning that we didn't wanna use, we had to use windows.  The storage ring operates at an extreme vacuum.  And it is exquisitely sensitive to contamination.  And we're in a situation where we're gonna have an apparatus that's open to the storage ring, and we're squirting gas inside.  And so they were very upset.  And I can only tell, I know one time I was there getting ready for an experiment, not doing one, getting ready for an experiment, and they had a vacuum accident.  And what that meant was an experimenter had led air into their chamber, which leaked down into the storage ring which shuts down the storage ring.  And as I was there, and I heard, you know--this is the kind of thing where you hear people screaming.  And I'm sitting there in my little hut, wondering, and the place goes quiet.  I'm thinking, wow, there's nobody here.  And all of a sudden the double doors bursts open from the outside, and in walks Burt Richter [Burton Richter, Nobel Prize in physics in 1976], who was the director of Stanford Linear Accelerator Center [SLAC], Martin Perl, Nobel Prize winner [1995, for the discovery of the tau lepton]--actually, Richter got the Nobel Prize too.  And then I can't remember the guy that was head of operations, and I remember them screaming, "Gentleman, your careers--he said, you know, "Gentleman, my reputation and your careers depend upon us resolving this accident."  And I was alone, I was the lone one-and-a-half year graduate student in the room, and here we have two pillars of physics talking about people's careers.  And that was one of the things I had learned, that was the key word that somebody's gonna get fired over this.  And then it changed to someone's gonna get fired and blacklisted (laughter) over this.  And I wanted to say, listen, guys (laughter), I got nothing to do with this (laughter).  I said, I'm just here, you know, looking at my apparatus here (laughter).  Those other people, they went outside and around here.  They're probably gone over to, in Station A to go talk to you now.
Story_ID: 626412
Speaker 1: But, so anyway, so we engineered an apparatus after we looked at the requirements, okay.  So we have to have a window, something that shows us from the storage ring.  And so we have to use a thin film metal window.  Then the issue was, well, if you vent your chamber, you let it up to air, if there's atmospheric pressure there, it's gonna break through this window.  I said, well, we're not, I'm naive and I say, well, we're not gonna let it vent.  And they say, well, what we're gonna have is we're gonna have a fine.  Anybody who vents their chambers, $10,000.  And I said, well, maybe we'll get a thicker window.  So I started to look into getting windows thick enough to take atmospheric pressure--and by the way, these foils are about a hundred times thinner than a sheet of aluminum foil.  A sheet of aluminum foil is a hundred microns thick.  These films, these foils were ten microns thick.  Your hair is 125 microns thick.  And it soon became clear, well, there's no foil on earth that's gonna be thin enough that I could put in there.  So I, then I looked at supported films.  And so there's a mesh there, and somehow, this guy miraculously gets aluminum foil on there that's three microns thick.  And I say, well, that's still not gonna support this thing if I vent.  And so the senior graduate student said--he wants to graduate.  And so he's saying, well, we're gonna go back to the first suggestion of not venting the chamber and use the reputation of Dr. [Richard] Zare [Jackson's doctoral thesis advisor] and the desire that they had to get other people using this thing.  And so we tried that, once.  And this graduate student I was working for was from India.  His name is Javed Hus--well, his ancestry is Indian.  I don't think he was, I think he was born in the United States.  And so we're running an experiment, and he's putting these things in, noxious gases.  And I'm saying, well, Javed, you know, we don't really have the equipment to be handling this.  And so we're doing that.  We're getting some data, and the people come up there and inspect our apparatus.  And we complete the experiment, and as I'm taking the thing down 'cause I was the only one authorized to use the crane, all right, the director of operations comes over to me.  And I'll never forget, he says, well, Jackson, you're okay, but we don't want this Indian guy here anymore.  And you need to go tell Zare.  And in the meantime, 'cause I'm thinking, boy, you know, here I gotta go play, I gotta play rat.  And in the meantime, he's getting impatient 'cause he wants to graduate.  He's been there seven years, and he's not such a great experimentalist, all right.  So he's starting an experiment in the lab using a laser and it's a gas laser, and he's got the gas plumb to it.  And he got impatient and he didn't hook up the gas properly.  So he took a big cylinder--and normally, you have a regulator that drops the pressure, he built an adapter where he was taking the straight pressure from the cylinder, with just some plastic tubing.  And it's a low-pressure cylinder, but, no way.  And the gas reacted with the plastic, burned away and the gas pours out into the room.  The gas is poisonous.  The other fifteen members of the group exit, you know, the lab, and they're out on the lawn.  I came into the building from the back.  I didn't see 'em.  I come into the elevator.  I go down into the lab.  We're in the basement.  And I opened the door and it was like a fist struck me from the gas that was in there.  Happily, there was a graduate student, no, a post-doc that was there that was there with a gas mask or he made a gas mask.  And he helped me back in the elevator, and we got up to the lawn where I was sitting up there coughing away.  And after I regained my composure, I conveyed to Dr. Zare what the operations director said, and agreed with him (laughter).  He's gotta go, you know.  And then he got tremendous flack from the chemistry department and the university for the accident down there.  And therefore, I, you know, that's where he worked out another experiment for the student to do, and I got to take over the experiment and, eventually got another assistant; engineered a system, a safety system that would shut two valves to protect the accelerator, sensor mat to go with it, utilized a new species of pump, turbo-molecular pump, to evacuate the chamber, all first for there, initiated collaborations with another scientist, David Shirley, director of Lawrence Berkeley [National] Laboratory [Berkeley, California], to get some experiments going, why this stuff was being built.  And then got it, and did the experiment, did it on two gases, well, I did it on three gases, published the thesis on two, CO [carbon monoxide] and N2 [nitrogen] and was, you know, able to demonstrate for one of the first measurements, first that the alignment actually exist, what its value was, how to--the theory for coupling together the angular momentum so that it agrees with the experimental results and published that.  That was my thesis.  And then took a job in, at Hewett Packard [HP] in the semi-conductor device laboratory.
Story_ID: 626413
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated and got your Ph.D. [degree] in '82 [1982]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I also got married in between there, which provided the motivation.  I needed to graduate 'cause I would have been a lifer too.  But I mean, you know, you're sitting around.  You're getting paid, you know, you have meager material needs.  And you get to play--you have to understand in the [Richard] Zare [Jackson's doctoral thesis advisor] lab, any time somebody invented a new laser, commercial laser, they would deposit it down in our lab.  That was the advantage over [Arthur] Shiloh's lab.  Now, here we've got the inventor of the laser, and he didn't have that many lasers.  And they were a nightmare (laughter).  They had a, they had all these wires coming out.  They had all this, I mean it was just not, it didn't look--I mean now we'll say it didn't look professional.  To me, it looked like a mess.  He had this, he had people working on their own power supplies that weren't electrical engineers.  And the trouble with these things is, they're high voltage, high current, and they gotta be quiet.  They gotta, they can't have any--like most of the power supplies you use, like for your phone and stuff, they're, you know, they're not very good 'cause they don't have to be, right.  Here you got the thing--and that's low power.  Here, you got this thing that's got an incredible amount of power in there, kilovolt amperes of power, the kind of power you use to power your house.  And it can't change more than a hundredth of a percent.  And the electronics necessary to do that, you know, it's, is not for a hobbyist.  I mean it's okay for me, you know, I've had circuit theory and all that other stuff.  But for these guys who may have never had an electronics course in life, they would, in fact, we lost a couple of people or at least the community did.  I think there were two people who got electrocuted when I was there.  And it comes from this arrogance, saying well, I'm from, I'm from Yale [University, new haven, Connecticut] and I can do any (laughter)--and he thinks those little electrons down there, got some respect for that.  You know, and they would stupid things--they'd do stupid things like work on it by themselves at night.  They'd, you know, and it's just like, you know, they wouldn't use the right meters, just had no technique.  And then they'd slip or touch something, and they'd find them the next day, hanging over their laser.
Story_ID: 626414
Speaker 1: Okay, Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia], what are some of the, I guess highlights of your stay at Howard or significant things that you worked on at Howard before we--
Speaker 2: Now, one of the things I should clarify, when I initially started at Howard in 1988, I was in the department of physics there, okay.  And then a year later, I transferred from physics to the department of electrical engineering, in the School of Engineering.
Speaker 1: And just, I'm sorry.  I didn't slate this right.  So we're just gonna do it right now as we're rolling.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But your name is:
Speaker 2: My name is Keith Hunter Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm currently professor and chair of the department of physics at Morgan State University.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is September 10, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're currently in Room 203 of Calloway Hall in the department of computer science.
Speaker 1: All right, and I'm Larry Crowe, interviewer with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  I just wanna make sure I got that in there.  And we're, this is, we're completing the interview that we started about a month and a half ago [on July 16, 2012], I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so, all right, so as we were saying, so you went from the department of physics to the department of electrical engineering at Howard.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the reason?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a couple of things.  One was, I was not real happy in the physics department there.  And there were two colleagues of mine, a Dr. Gary Harris, who's still at Howard, currently interim dean of the graduate school, and a Dr. Michael Spencer, who both, you know, convinced me that, you know, the idea of leaving the university wasn't a good one and that I should instead consider joining them in the department of electrical engineering and helping them to put together their lab or work alongside them in the laboratory facilities there which were considerable for a school of Howard's size.  They had the latest and greatest technology for making very interesting materials, at least in those days, such as gallium arsenide, being able to grow, using molecular beam epistaxy, gallium arsenide and other compounds and aluminum gallium arsenide and to be able to grow thin layers of these materials, which allow you to build semi-conductor lasers and are responsible for most of the things you see around you today.  They also had some very interesting work as it turned out, in the fabrication and growth of single crystal layers and silicon carbide which could be used as a high temperature, semi-conductor material.  So as you can imagine, a semi-conductor that would be able to operate at temperatures above 300 degrees F, they can certainly operate at 150 degrees in different, like in more arid parts of the world.  And they were interesting, you know, scientifically, for many reasons because they're different crystalling phases.  And it turned out they were also active optically, which some of my skills came into play with in terms of being able to characterize and measure different types of characteristics and properties that the materials have.  And there were a number of courses that I could clearly teach in electrical engineering.  One was electro-magnetic theory.  The other was electronics, analog electronics, which I've always had a fair, was always very strong in, in particular, analog integrated circuits, the more complex ones.  So it seemed like, you know, a good decision, you know.  My wife at that time was a resident at Howard University Hospital, and so it was certainly convenient to be, have us both co-located there.  We had small children at that time.  So I moved over with the help of actually, Dr. Eugene Deloach (ph.) who is the dean of engineering here at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] now which is ironic.  And I was in the department of electrical engineering for four years until 1988.
Story_ID: 626415
Speaker 1: What happened in '88 [1988], yeah?
Speaker 2: Well, we had been very, as a group, we had been very successful in getting a lot of research support and also graduating PhD students [department of electrical engineering, Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia], sending some of those students to the top laboratories in the country, like Bell Laboratories [New Jersey], at that time, the old Bell Laboratories before they became Delcor and broke up.  And we had submitted a proposal to get what's called now, what was called then a "press center", which was a large award from NSF [National Science Foundation].  It was basically a million dollars a year for five years, renewable up to eleven years.  And, at that point in time, my wife had finished her residency.  And, you know, it was time to make a decision about, you know, what we were gonna do 'cause she wanted to do a residency in plastic surgery which would have meant leaving the D.C. [District of Columbia] area.  And, you know, as I was thinking about it, you know, one of the issues that we felt, or at least I felt, needed to be addressed was the issue of, you know, compensation, you know, my personal compensation.  And since you're a group, that meant everyone's compensation 'cause here we have, there's no longer a single investigator-type of research effort.  Here we have like a major group that is funded between the NSF awards and the other awards that we had from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and others at a fairly high level.  And at the time, there seemed, the university turned a deaf ear.  It was no, you know, you could do all this work, but, no, there was gonna be no additional compensation.  So there was no incentive.  And it was particularly disturbing because other professors, in particular, a Dr. William Jackson, who had also built--in chemistry, who had built a large research group and a first-class facility, he, too, faced this dilemma in a different way where he gained enough notoriety where the University of California at Davis recruited him.  And the university [Howard University] just let him go and, again, over a matter of, you know, compensation.  And when you look around and you see individuals, administrators, who are making, you know, salaries that are, you know, even in those days, that were six figures.  And when you come from an institution like Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], in my case, where the president isn't necessarily the highest compensated individual (laughter).  You know, there's not this like hierarchy that places like Howard had, and from what I can tell, still have.  So when you feel like, you know, you're making this sacrifice.  When you feel like you're making a financial sacrifice that others don't have to make, you have to question whether or not you're gonna twerk your family around and make the argument that, you know, you should stay here while your wife goes off and does her residency in plastic surgery.  And so I just decided that it was time for me to separate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went off to work in, at Rocketdyne [rocket engine design and production company].  And, you know, there was an argument made that, well, you know, you wouldn't have gotten that offer unless you'd been at Howard.  And I said, that's probably, that might be true.  But the point is, is that this is an opportunity, right, this is an opportunity.  People had, you know, fought for, so you would have access to.  So, it'd be very disrespectful not to take advantage of it.  And then it also had other consequences or other decisions.  I don't know how interesting it is, for purposes of this interview, but, you know, the idea, I also made the conscious decision to fund my own retirement or, you know, 'cause those were the days of Reagan right, and her said, well, you know, you need to take responsibility for your own retirement.  And I said, well, you know, that's probably a good idea because depending upon these people, you know, you know, it might get a little shaky.  And I initially started making small investments in my, in 401(k)'s and in their analogs, their 403(b)s and other things, and so I would not have to depend upon pensions from employers.  And I can say, since I've benefited from all the various boons and busts that happened, it seems to have worked out.  But anyway, we took off that August for southern California, and I worked at Rocketdyne Division in a place called the Advance Programs, which was heavily funded.
Story_ID: 626416
Speaker 1: Rocketdyne [rocket engine design and production company] is a company that builds the space shuttle's main engine.  That's their main line of business.  Another part of the company, Advance Programs, were involved in the construction of high-energy lasers and high-powered lasers, actually, and was financed primarily from the strategic defense initiative in those days.  And we were doing work associated, that primarily, as you may not know, the primary laser for shooting down strategic ballistic missiles in those days was something called a chemical laser.  And the way a chemical laser works is, is you take two chemicals.  You mix 'em together in a very special way and instead of their energy coming out as, like an explosion, pressure, a volume increase which leads to a pressure increase, which leads to a big boom, the energy is channeled through, optically active energy levels.  And the optical decay gives you light out.  And so one way to think about it is, is if you had an explosive like dynamite.  And instead of the--and you set it off.  Instead of the explosion occurring, you have an equivalent, an energy equivalent amount of light that comes out.  And you can imagine that is a whole lot of light.  And that's how chemical energy, that's why a chemical laser is the laser of choice in these large weapons-type programs.
Speaker 2: Now, did you work on that project, that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I worked tangentially on that project.  What there was also the interest in was the use of a device called a free electron laser which had been pioneered at Stanford by a colleague of mine named John Meady (ph.).  And Rocketdyne had a small test bed at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  And I managed to get assigned to it for a time because I was a Stanford graduate.  I had known of John's work since 1976.  I never really believed that you could build a weapon out of it, but it was very interesting from a couple of standpoints.  One is, a free electron laser is an accelerator-based laser.  And I've had most of my experiences with accelerator-based forms of light sources.  He had a particular, particularly interesting scientific angle.  He was building a laser with a photocathode generated electron gun.  So you shine a smaller laser in, a very sharp pulse.  It strikes the photocathode of his electron gun.  Electrons come out, and they get accelerated through the accelerator, a linear accelerator, and then they become part, those electrons become--once they reach the proper energy, they become the medium, the game medium for the laser, okay.  And, the problem had always been, is that most conventional electron guns, they put out electrons that have a very wide range of energies.  When you have a photocathode-based gun, the electrons that are emitted have a very small energy spread.  So they all basically have the same energy as they come off of the cathode.  That means when they get accelerated down the cavity, all the electrons basically have the same energy.  So they're like correlated with each other.  And hence, you can build brighter beams, narrower beams, more intense beams.  And hence, the thought was, you would be able to build a very powerful laser, okay.  And our group was the first to, along with John, to demonstrate that at least of that was correct.  After that, that was a very difficult experiment to work on, primarily because it was located so far away, and--
Speaker 2: Where was it?
Speaker 1: It was at Stanford, so Rocketdyne's main laboratory was in Canoga Park, California, close to Los Angeles, so, and that's like 400 miles difference.
Story_ID: 626417
Speaker 1: And so when I finished that assignment, my main task became, developed an interest at Rocketdyne [rocket engine design and production company], through a Dr. Sandor (ph.) Hawley, in the creation of diamond thin films.  And I was the person, since I, from the Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] experience, I had considerable experience in gas-phase synthesis of thin films.  And so I built the first, a diamond laboratory.  And so this was a laboratory to synthesize diamond, thin films, single-crystal diamond, thin films, and also to characterize them.  The two ways we would characterize them was Raman Spectroscopy and Thermo-conductivity measurements.  When you look at a diamond, most people don't realize is that because of its unique structure, a diamond conducts heat.  In fact, it conducts heat five times better than copper.  Most of the things that you think of as good thermo-conductors are also good electrical conductors.  So when you take glass, you don't think about glass conducting heat, right.  In fact, you think gas--glass is an insulator for heat.  And then copper is a metal.  Obviously, it conducts heat well and electricity.  That's because of the type of process through which thermo conduction occurs.  In metals, thermo-conduction occurs through electronic transmissions, transitions or energy exchange.  In crystals, it goes through particles we call phonites (ph.) which are the continuum vibrations or the vibrations or the normal mode oscillations of the continuum lattice.  And diamond, because of its strength and peculiar bonding has enormous thermo-conduction.  The reason Rocketdyne was interested in it was that it became very clear quickly that no time soon was a laser gonna take out a strategic missile, right.  So, the best choice was to have something called the endoatmospheric interceptor, that is a ground-based missile that you shoot up at an incoming strategic missile, okay.  But, obviously, a strategic missile is coming--if the Soviets or somebody was to fire an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile], when it's re-entering the atmosphere, it's coming down like at about mach 18 [unit of speed].  And so it's coming, so if you're gonna send something up to hit it, it's gotta be extremely fast, which isn't a big problem.  The problem is, is that you have to be able to find the strategic missile and guide it.  And you'd like to be on board.  And so the easiest way to do it is to look at the exhaust plume of the missile, the strategic missile as its coming down or the heated--'cause obviously, at mach 18, you get a lot of atmospheric heating.  They use an IR [infra-red] camera to look for this hot object coming down at mach 18 or whatever.  But you have a problem 'cause to hit something at mach 18, that means it's gotta be going up there close to mach 18.  And then, if you have a window on it and a camera behind it, that window is gonna heat up from frictional heating.  And when the window gets hot, it blinds the IR camera behind it, and it can't see the missile.  So the strategy is, is that you'd have a sapphire window and then you'd have a tank of helium in there.  And you squirt the helium on the window to cool it.  And then that way the camera can look up through there, but then you have the complications of the helium tank, the cooling nozzles and everything else which limits the size of the interceptor that you can use and it's, how long it's actually active.  So a simple calculation shows that if you had a diamond window there, a single-crystal diamond, you wouldn't have to carry any helium--the thermo-conductivity is high enough that it would stay cool, at least cool enough for the camera to look through, and you don't have to carry any helium at all.  And so the race was on to develop diamond windows, okay.  And so the, or, an opt--you know, a diamond window that you can optically polish and put onto a missile that it could look through.  The other idea, with the other problem was, was that, with a shuttle main engine was the ball bearings that are used for the turbo-molecular pumps that pump the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and give you, at supersonic speeds, the, then the gases mix and ignite and give you the rocket propulsion part, was that after every shuttle launch, you had to switch out the bearings because you do a calculation real quick.  And just--even though the bearings on the shuttle main are the roundest objects, you know, human hands have ever made, there's still rolling friction, though it's very small.  But at the speeds at which they rotate up, it's hot enough that if you could see those ball bearings are glowing red, and they're in a bath of--the only thing that keeps 'em cool is they're in a bath of liquid oxygen on one side and liquid hydrogen on the other.  And so there was tremendous, particularly after the Challenger [Space Shuttle Challenger] accident--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, now, that was in nineteen eighty--
Speaker 1: 1984, I believe [January 28, 1986].
Speaker 2: '84 [1984]?
Speaker 1: Maybe '85 [1985], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm thinking '86 [1986], but that's, okay.
Story_ID: 626418
Speaker 1: And so there's all this concern within the company [Rocketdyne; rocket engine design and production company], 'cause remember that's the main product, there's all this concern about the shuttle main engines.  And, you know, the thought was, was if you could coat the bearings, the ball bearings with a diamond film, that between the smoothness, if you will, diamond and polish it, that the smoothness or slickness of the diamond surface, and its thermo-conductivity, that you would be able to reduce the temperature rise in the bearings due to rolling friction.  Now, that was a little bit unrealistic, but not so much as that if you did an entirely different switch out, is, if instead of using stainless steel ball bearings, you would use silicon nitride ball bearings, ceramic ball bearings.  Those, you could easily coat with diamond-thin films.  And you have the added advantage of the ceramic bearings, silicon nitride bearings, are in many ways, much harder than the 440-C ball bearings.  Now, there was a considerable amount of concern within the company, well, you got this ceramic ball bearing in there, and you know, their fracture toughness isn't as great as 440-C.  That means like if you were to drop it on the ground, it would shatter like a piece of glass.  And so the, the rocket men, as I used to call 'em, they didn't like that at all.  So they would say, well, we tried one of these in 1976 in the engine, and the engine blew up.  And I said, well, how many engines did you do?  He said, we just did it once.  And I said, well, you know, the [U.S.] Army, I'm, the, yeah, the Army uses ceramic ball bearings in helicopter rotors because they wanna have bearings that can run if there's a, they lose oil, they lose lubrication, silicon nitride bearings.  They could run 'em for a hundred hours without 'em, you know, breaking, essentially damaging.  More importantly, they don't damage catastrophically like people talk, thought they'd damage in the same way that 440-C bearings do.  They spall, they don't catastrophically fracture.  But there have been tremendous studies by the Army on this very problem and that 440-C, I mean that silicon nitride bearings were adequate for helicopter services.  And so we began a small program where we explored the compatibility of diamond films with silicon nitride substrates also.
Story_ID: 626419
Speaker 1: About this time, there was, I made a reintroduction to the synchrotron light source community because we had, the company [Rocketdyne; rocket engine design and production company] had a contract or thought that they were competing for a contract to build a large free-electron laser.  And this was a half billion dollar contract.  A lot of effort went into it, and eventually, the [U.S.] Air Force decided that they weren't gonna go for it.  They weren't gonna build this huge free electron laser to take out satellites because they didn't believe--I mean take out missiles because they didn't believe it would work, which left us with a number of technologies.  One was the, one was, had to do with particle accelerators and magnetic structures called undulators that go around them.  And it also left us with a division that built cooled mirrors, water-cooled mirrors, okay.
Speaker 2: What--okay.
Speaker 1: So you'd have a water-cooled mirror for the laser.  That way you'd be able to keep the temperature rise at the surface, and the optics wouldn't distort and the laser would keep running.  Now, the trouble is, when you looked at this, well, who else needed these kinds of technologies, you know?  Who, who could, who had the pocketbook to pay for this and the technical need.  And I argued within the company that the synchrotron radiations community needed these kinds of optics because the advance photon source at the Argonne National Lab [Illinois] was coming on line, and also the advance light source at Berkeley [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California] was coming on line.  And when you looked--these were sources that were built for these small-cap, magnetic insertion devices called undulators.  And when you put these undulators into being, they pulled out a tremendous amount of light at x-ray wavelength, at EUV [extreme ultra violet], and x-ray wavelengths.  And they would, and when you had optics on there, they would build a tremendous amount, there would be a tremendous amount of thermo loading on the mirrors.  And they had various schemes, technologies that they had developed that were, that relied on very exotic cooling techniques.  One was a liquid gallium cooled mirrors.  So gallium like mercury is a liquid, not quite at room temperature, but add a little bit above.  And you have the, you can pump it as you would any liquid, and it has a tremendous thermo-conductivity.  And so there was one scheme where you would use this to cool a mirror.  Now, I never, the reason I smile is, I never believed that that would work.  And the people at the Advanced Photon Source at the time said that something like 90 percent of their mirrors would be these gallium-based things.  And this is, and plus, they did not have the technology--they would have to build the mirrors.  That's how they, because that's why it was gonna be 90 percent of it so they would have a job for life.  But, you know, we had a company, a little company that actually built these mirrors, these water-cooled mirrors.  We had prototypes, we had some of the--Rocketdyne solved these technical problems like how you bond these mirrors together, how you actually, you had, we had different types of 'em, some of 'em which had, we called 'em pinFET.  That means you stuck little pins in, and then you put it on top, and then you blow water through it.  And you can change the size of this pin.  You could change the concentration of the pins.  So we needed something, one area cooler than the other.  There were even schemes for being able to use the thermo differences to bend and focus mirrors, which was unheard of at these wavelengths.
Story_ID: 626420
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you work directly on the, on the [Space Shuttle] Challenger with the--I know we mentioned off-camera, you knew Ronald McNair [NASA astronaut who died on Challenger in 1986] and--did the black folks that worked around kind of know each other or did, as in a lot of settings or did you work on some specific project with them?
Speaker 2: No, I never worked with Ron [McNair] on a specific project.  I mean I knew of his, you know, work, and he, as I said, he had been a recruiter from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I had met him at a recruiting event in Atlanta [Georgia] at one point in time.  And then I had taken an interest--I guess my interest in him was, was, before he became an astronaut because he had gotten a job at Hughes Research Center in California, in Los Angeles.  And that was one of the places, since I was in Northern California, that was one of the places that I had thought about, you know, I might eventually wind up.  I mean the thing is, is that once you get into graduate school in physics, you know, you're, you know, you're in it, you know.  This is gonna be your profession.  So now you had to figure out, you know, what you're gonna do, how you're gonna make your way.  And you know you wanna try to get the, you know, like everybody, you wanna get the best appointment that you can, particularly, your critical first appointment, right.  And so you wanna find out, and say, okay, you wanna get the best appointment that you can.  Well, what constitutes a good appointment?  Well, yeah, obviously, if I was a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] Junior Fellow that would be good, a job at Bell Laboratories [New Jersey], that would be good.  And a job at IBM [International Business Machines], Watson Research Center, that would be good.  But then you find that, you know, there're other places that are good where you can have a real career.  And that's when, you know, when you start talking about people--when you start talking to people, you find that these places that, you know, you don't read about in 'Scientific American' [magazine] that constitute a good first appointment.  Now, what makes a good first appointment?  Well, one is, prestige.  The other is compensation, longevity, you know, is it gonna be a community that can support--I mean the ideal solution is, is if you get a job and you can start there as a post-doc [post-doctoral researcher] and then twenty years later, retire from there, right.  And those places are hard to find and very competitive.
Speaker 1: I've heard that Bell Labs was one such place that was, everybody talks about it.   Was Rockwell [International, now Boeing] a good place like that, in terms of the collegial atmosphere there?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know about the collegial, I mean you could--and I still have friends.  You could go to Rockwell.  You could start there, and you could retire from there.  Also, it was large enough so that, and it was connected to a manufacturing, a significant manufacturing operation.  If you really wanted to get your compensation up, you could move to a different location and work.  So, for example, if all of a sudden they decide they're gonna start building planes again or more reasonably, if they're gonna build whatever the follow on is to the Shuttle [space shuttle] and you can somehow get involved with that or any other big successful program, you know, essentially, your career would be made.  And that's, I mean that's one of the things I find lacking in students today is kind of like, no one actively thinks about, okay, now, I gotta a degree in physics.  You know, where are the places that I wanna work, okay.  And well, what makes it, what constitutes a good match.  And, you know, that's an important thing to realize.  You know, is the--so, for example, different companies have different cultures, like Intel.  You know, Intel's obviously a large company.  You know, you have--and you could start there and end there easily.  Their compensation level is very high.  There's a retirement plan, medical benefits, but do you really fit in with the culture.  So, for example, are you willing to move to Oregon or Washington and live in the, what I call the little Intel development or science city.  So when they have a large plant there, you know, those people go in there, and they, you know, you've heard about housing developments, well, those are just, you know, you'll be in a housing development, and then most of the people there work for Intel.  And the same with, well, it used to be the same way with Motorola.  And you begin to think of yourself in terms of that corporate culture and where you fit in it. And that becomes, you know, that's who your children play with.  You know, that becomes, actually, I used to call 'em, and say a "culture tribe."  And actually, that's the same way in the national labs, like Argonne National Lab [Illinois].  They're a certain tribe and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab  [Berkeley, California] and Los Alamos in Livermore [California].  And you would think there would be a lot of, you know, they're all national labs, there would be interactions between 'em or transferring between 'em.  That's not the case.  Once you become a member (laughter) of one tribe (laughter), there is no mobility to the other.  I mean maybe in the, you know, the executive class, but for the workers, no.
Story_ID: 626421
Speaker 1: Now, well, that raises a question here.  In 1992, you moved on to Lawrence Berkeley [National Laboratory, Berkeley, California]--well, that's not corporate America though.  But how did that move take place?
Speaker 2: Well, as a result of going around and I had gotten some money from the company, from Rocketdyne, to see if there was any interest in purchasing these mirrors for the various light source, light sources, synchrotron light sources.  And the main, the main owner of light sources in this country is the United States of America, Department of Energy and, in fact, the Office of Science within the [U.S.] Department of Energy.  They operate user facilities and light sources.  So they operate the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven [National Laboratory, Upton, New York], the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, where I did my Ph.D. at Stanford, the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Labs and the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.  And now they have the long coherent light source at Stanford that they operate.  And so the thing is, is all these light sources, these third-generation, as they were called at that time, light sources, had--there were serious concerns about thermo heating on the optics.  And what that means is if we have a mirror and you dump a lot of power into it, it reflects most of that power, right?  That's why it's a mirror.  But it might absorb one percent of it.  And that one percent that's absorbed or a tenth of a percent of it that's absorbed, heats up the mirror.  When the mirror gets hot, it thermally expands, and it loses its figure, its shape, which distorts the beam.  And sometimes it can distort the beam enough that all the benefits that you gain from having an accelerator-based, third-generation light source is negated completely.  So it's kind of like you shouldn't have built this source in the first place.  And, and so there was, I could say there were tons of studies done because the power, at least the optical power, the amount of light coming out of these things was tremendous.  And it was being put in various, it was being (unclear), and the idea was it had to be focused to a very, very, very, very small spot to be able to reap the benefits.  And so you needed mirrors that were some of the most finely-finished mirror comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope and the one meter mirrors that NSA [National Security Agency] uses in their satellites or was it the National Reconnaissance Agency or something, the one that they just made?  Anyway, they had, you know, and in the optics community, you know, there's these one-meter mirrors, a meter across, that have these, that are machined to some, you know, extreme tolerance that are put in satellite-based telescopes, National Reconnaissance Agency [National Reconnaissance Office; NRO], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the telescopes, they're a meter, and the telescopes look down and so they can, you know, they're the ones that can photograph license plates from, you know, 22,000 miles up.  And, and so when you have finely-finished optics like that--now, they don't have any load 'em.  In fact, they're sitting up there at constant temperature because they're in space, right.  They might get a little hot, but they're not gonna distort, so they don't need any cooling.  But, now, imagine you have a mirror figured like that, that you're dumping, you know, thousands, if not tens of thousands of watts on.  It's sitting there.  It's gonna get hot.  And so these communities would need cooled optics, and the cooled optics that we were selling, they were, these mirrors were like three million a piece with the, with the pumps and stuff necessary to push the water through, which was concerning, but again, if you have a 150 million dollar machine and you need a 3 million dollar mirror to be able to reap the benefits of that machine, you know, it'd be worth the price.  So anyway, I made the case to the company, and I got to go to a bunch of the meetings and design meetings that they were having involving these machines and to see if there was any interests.  And then there were, you know, we had considerable engineering capability, and so people were interested not only in our mirrors, but also in our ability to engineer these beam lines that would be used for synchrotron radiation.  And as a consequence of going to these conferences and instrumentation meetings, I met David Atwood at Center for, who was director of Center for X-Ray Optics at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.  And he was looking for a project manager or program manager type and to help him with several beam-line construction projects he had gotten.  And also, he needed someone that had some familiarity with the semi-conductor industry.  And then, you know, we had talked for a few months and eventually, you know, I decided to--he made an offer, and I decided to leave Rockwell [International; now Boeing] and go up to Berkeley.  You know, it had the attraction of being at Berkeley, at a university atmosphere, a national lab.  I don't know if you've ever been to Lawrence Berkeley Lab, but it sits on a hilltop above the Berkeley campus.  You know, it's back in Northern California.  I knew my wife wouldn't mind relocating there from Los Angeles.  She had just finished her fellowship in plastic surgery, and she was kind of, you know in transition between being a resident and starting her own practice.  And we had friends in, I had good friends in Northern California, and family even, in Northern California.  And so we elected to move up there.  So that's how I came upon, and that's how I joined the scientific staff at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
Story_ID: 626422
Speaker 1: So, this is 1992.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, you know, and [Lawrence] Berkeley [national Laboratory] had a lot more prestige associated than working for Rocketdyne [rocket engine manufacturing division of Rockwell International; now Boeing].  Also, I was concerned about continued support of the [U.S.] Pentagon for laser-based weapons, particularly, when you had the competition from ground-based interceptors.  Ground-based interceptors, though they're a lot different than the SAMS and things, you know, the [U.S.] Air Force and the [U.S.] Army and stuff, they all knew how to handle those things.  And all you're doing is making 'em a little faster, and you're putting more electronics in 'em, and, you know, you Hughes Aircraft or Hughes Space and Missile Systems.  You know, that's the kind of stuff those guys did and TRW, you know.  And the technological hurdles to getting those, to get able to take out a strategic missile, you know, weren't so high.  And then, you know, you had the Iraq, well, the first Iraqi War come along.  And then they started, you know, when Iraqis started firing Scuds, naturally, the idea was, oh, we'll use airborne lasers to take out Scuds.  And when you started looking at the technological issues involved with shooting down a Scud versus shooting a continental ballistic missile, you know, that was like, that just wasn't gonna--you know, 'cause Scuds, you know, they're made out of steel.  You know, the missiles we're talking about, they're made out of aluminum.  And if you didn't realize it, you know, steel is harder than aluminum (laughter), steel is tougher (laughter).  You know, I'm a scientist and all, but shoot, you know, steel (laughter) is a lot tougher than aluminum, you know, and aluminum is only a eighth wall thick.  You know, these Scud things, those, I mean it looked like, I mean I saw some of that metal.  I mean like, if you look at the Titan Missile, right, it's made out of aluminum.  So if you took the body off, you can bend it in your hands.  In fact, that's one of the problems they have is like, people work on it and they drop a wrench down, and it sticks a hole in it.  Okay, so I'm looking at a piece of Scud or at least a mock up of the thing.  And we're talking about, you know, 'cause we're concerned, well, what's this optical observativity, and I lift this thing up.  And I said, wow, I can't bend this with my hand.  And I could not see, I mean when you start thinking about what kind of laser powers you would need, you know, I would think about, okay, what we'll do is, yeah, 'cause the base plan was to take a laser and stick it there for a while like a magnifying glass, and then burn through.  That's gonna work.  So I started thinking about steams like which you use a pulse laser.  What would the pulse format look like?  Thinking about it, cause it has certain advantages.  And we go back and forth, and it's, oh, just, you know, you can't even, you know, I'm not a choirboy or any of that.  You know, I can make up a story like anybody, but I like to, I at least like there to be a shred (laughter) of truth to it (laughter).  You know, I gotta have something to hold onto to.  And when you start doing these calculations, and you're like power, you know, you're like--you know, if I'm 10 off, you know, I can raise my hand, but, you know, when you're like 300 off or 600 off (laughter), you say, well, this is--and you check this thing and calculation, ten or fifteen times, and you're clear that you haven't done something stupid.  You can see that this is not gonna work.  And so that, then you say well, this might be a good time to make a transition back to Berkeley.  And at least you can work on some, you know, you're working in a national lab.  You know, like I said, it's very prestigious.  It's got several Nobel Prize winners that have come from the place.  You're close to the [University of California] Berkeley campus.  So that was one of the reasons I, and plus, I was back in Northern California.
Story_ID: 626423
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, this is 1992.  And you were there [at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] until 2005.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And did you enter in as the, it says here you were associate director of the Center for X-Ray Optics.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So did you come in with that title?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Came there--
Speaker 1: And did you leave with the same title?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Stayed at the same spot.  Now, how was their pay as related to Rockwell [International; now Boeing]?
Speaker 2: Well, I basically never make a transition unless I get, I can, you know, the rule of thumb is, if you can get 15 percent increase, that basically negates anything lost in retirement benefits or anything else.  So, yeah, I got, I got a nice--I didn't get a big bump up there, but, you know, I got paid more at Berkeley than I did at Rockwell, at Rocketdyne [rocket engine manufacturing division of Rockwell International].  They had, the Center had gotten a large award from the Defense Advance Project's research agency [DARPA, Defense Advanced Projects Agency] to develop what's called, was come to be called Extreme Ultraviolet [EUV] Lithography.
Speaker 1: Well, what is that?
Speaker 2: Well, lithography is the base technology that is used in the fabrication of integrated circuits, microprocessors.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I'm familiar with it in the art world--
Speaker 2: Well, it's the same--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) a print on a rock basically--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's the same thing.  Well, one way to look at it is, is the transfer of a pattern from one object to another, okay, using some kind of photosens--photo lithography, it uses some kind of photosensitive material like film, okay, or, actually, it's very similar to film, but what you do is, instead of buying it already as film, you drop it on a wafer and you put a coating on it, right, and then you transfer the pattern now.  Now, the rub is, is that when you transfer the pattern, what you do to make a microcircuit is that you'd have a pattern here, and then you reduce it by a factor of ten, okay.  So you de-magnify it by ten.  So if the feature up here was an inch, the feature down on the wafer is a tenth of an inch.  If the feature up here is a hundred microns, then the feature down there will be ten microns.  If the feature up there is one micron, then the feature down there will be a hundred nanometers, okay.  And so you have to, that's how you get the reduction.  And the driving thing, the driving force in semi-conductor manufacture is to increase the number of transistors that there are on a given, on a given microprocessor.
Story_ID: 626424
Speaker 1: And so our goal [at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory] was to--and the problem gets to be, is that you have to be able to transfer the pattern with extreme accuracy or a high resolution.  Well, the resolution of a transferred pattern by a lens or mirror, is determined by the wavelength of light that you use.  The shorter wavelength of light that you use, the finer the resolution of the pattern you can put down.  And so what people in the semi-conductor industry, well, what people in optics do is, they've continued to use shorter and shorter wavelengths of light, okay.  So at first it was like a mercury lamp at--I used to know this.  I think basically, 25, 250 nanometers.  So that's like near ultraviolet.  Then it went to another mercury line that was about 220 nanometers.  Then it went to krypton fluoride laser, which operates at 248 nanometers, then to an argonne fluoride laser that operated at 193 nanometers.  In extreme ultraviolet lithography, we operated at 13 nanometers, 13.5 nanometers, and you see it's a big difference between 193 (laughter) and 13.5, okay.  And so, in theory, using extreme ultraviolet lithography, we could reduce, we could reproduce feature sizes as small as 13 nanometers, okay.  And just from the process.  Now, in semi-conductor manufacture, right now, using two for, using 193 lithography, and currently, today in 2012, are able to get down to 45 nanometers.  Now, the trick is, is that you say, well, how can you do that with 193?  How can you get 45?  And the answer is, with great difficulty.  And you have to use things such as hard and soft, phase shifting.  We have to go through a lot of changes to be able to do that.  Okay, with extreme ultraviolet lithography, just to get down, to get down to, say 20 nanometers, you don't have to do anything.  You just, well, you do have to do a lot, but you don't have to do any quantum optics types of things.  The other advantage is, is that with some minor differences, is that, extreme ultraviolet lithography could take you through the end of silicon as a semi-conductor material, okay, 'cause at some point in time, once you get down to two or three atoms, you know, your transistor, it doesn't work, okay.  Now, obviously, there's probably different ways to do it, but once you over the EUV, it's not like you have to go to an entirely--there's another new technology to go to.  And so we began, when we started working on EUV in '92 [1992], the target was 100 nanometers.  And at that time, industry was at around 150 nanometers.  And every year, the industry would get--in fact, there's a roadmap for the indus--semi-conductor industry plans how they're gonna go down smaller and smaller.  One reason that's the driving force is that you learn very quickly everything gets better when you go smaller.  Your devices get faster.  They, your yields go up, and with your yield, your profits go up.  Your costs per wafer go down (laughter).  That's why it's a driving force, okay, and because it's a driving force, it's like a living thing.  Every year, it gets smaller and smaller.  So when I left Berkeley in 2005--we had started off at 100 nanometers.  And we said, well, the insertion point for, well, that was the insertion point for EUV is 100 nanometers.  If we ask 'em today, they would say the insertion point is 22 nanometers (laughter) because of the progression of the visible--also, the guys that do 19e, well, 248 and 193 lithography, they don't wanna change, you know, 'cause then they'd have to learn how to do EUV lithography and whatever.  So they push harder and harder.  And then the people who supply them with photo resist, with masks, with all the supporting technology, they push harder and harder, except now, they're really up against a techno--well, I think if I was in it, I think they're pretty close to a technological wall.  But then they invent other things like they invent those core things.  You know, how you have due core processors.  They say, well, okay, we can't make 'em any smarter--smaller, so we'll just put more of 'em down there (laughter).  And so, so they start, when I started that business they didn't have any due core processors or quad-core processors.  I mean I saw one now where they wanna go to 16, you know, that's not--and so, again, we have other people who are trying to work around it.
Story_ID: 626425
Speaker 1: Just for references, Strategic Defense Initiative at Rockwell [International; now Boeing], was the Star Wars--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Program that Ronald Reagan [President Reagan]--
Speaker 2: In fact, it was the most speculative part of Star Wars, the Star War lasers.  And, well, Star Wars lasers, Star Wars particle beams.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, what, just for the sake of science fiction fans, and, you know, what, is there, I mean is--are there ever gonna be lasers or are there lasers that can be used like they were used in 'Star Wars', the movie where the people just have a little gun and you shoot, you know, a laser beam and the person vaporizes and that sort of them, or a hole--
Speaker 2: Well, on that level, no.  I think lasers, so, for example, if you ever get to the point where, say you were to have battles in space.  So the best thing to have is, the deadliest laser would be a laser in space that can shoot down, shoot up or blind or disable satellites, okay.  When you're in space, everything works for you.  There's no atmosphere to distort the beam.  The temperature is just about right.  There is a little problem with heating or taking the heat away.  And the natural target would be a satellite.  And you don't have to blow up a satellite.  A sufficiently intense laser could render all of the sensors, at least cameras, useless.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It could damage those and then the satellite has no real purpose, no use anymore.
Speaker 1: And I'm just thinking about something like this.  It would be a war that everybody would lose, right?
Speaker 2: Well, everybody, well, everybody except the people who build satellites (laughter), you know.  And then even then, you know, the issue is, is, you know, it's really hard energy wise to come up with a laser that's better than a cannonball.  So, so, for example, if you have enough targeting sensors, and you can drop ball bearings and stuff out of a killer satellite, and have it hit another one, that's it.  That'll do--
Speaker 1: That would be enough.
Speaker 2: --do, yeah.  And, you know, the little steel balls are relatively inexpensive.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they move pretty fast in space (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they'll move fast in space, well, they move just as fast as the craft that let's 'em out (laughter) and not to mention, even if they're standing still, and the other craft hits them (laughter), you know, I mean once you can build, I mean that was, another part of the company would build things like that, these micro-interceptors.  And basically, they were little rockets that would like hover and could move this way.  We had a little demonstration room for 'em.  And so their whole mission in life was, well, I'm not gonna chase after anything since it's coming this way.  I'm just gonna stay here and get in front of it.  And when it hits me, I'll either explode or I won't even have to explode.  I'll, it'll hit me so fast that I'll go right through it.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's interesting.  I mean, did--were there plans where they're working on things to disrupt enemy--
Speaker 2: We had, within Advanced Programs, there were plans for every science fiction.  In fact, I had the suspicion that's where most of the ideas came from.  So, for example, one was something called a Neutral Particle Beam Weapon, which was, you'd take an accelerator and you launch it up in space.  And you accelerate, essentially, accelerate protons, and as they come out, you attach an electron to 'em, and then they come out as hydrogen atoms.  So they're neutral, okay.  A problem with an electron beam is, is that since electrons are charged particles, they repel each other.  And so when they come out, you know, unless they're really energetic, they spread.  So in a neutral particle beam, there's no beam spreading, and also, they're much heavier particles.  They're a thousand times heavier than electrons.  So they can apart much more damage in theory.  And at one point in time, the entire Advance Programs division was working on a proposal for one.  And my colleagues had been so successful in convincing the company that it was, the executives in the company, that it was technologically possible, one of the executives rewrote the proposal and instead of it being a research and development proposal, he wrote it as a management proposal.  And it kind of went like, well, this is tried and true technology, and what we want is the contract just to manage the construction, well, to construct it and then manage it after it's operational, to which the [U.S.] Air Force laughed, and they called us back about a week later after the proposal was submitted.  And they, after this executive had rewritten it, and they, he said, this is the worst thing he had ever seen (laughter), and they should not waste another moment of the company's time on this proposal (laughter).  And he felt, and that poor executive fell out of favor, and a lot of the guys, middle managers associated with it.  And that's one reason why it does pay to have a Ph.D. [degree].  Executives were business people.
Speaker 1: They were cheaper than--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  They just believed, and they were just so confident that (laughter), that you could like go down to, you know, you could go down to a shop and assemble this thing and then throw it up in orbit, that, you know, the Air Force was gonna give 'em a billion dollars to do this.  Actually, it was two billion dollars.
Story_ID: 626426
Speaker 1: Well, let me, now, before you left Lawrence Berkeley [National Laboratory], you served as president of the National Society of Black Physicists from 2001 to 2006.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I think, I don't know if we've mentioned it before in this interview, but what--tell us a little bit about the National Society of Black Physicists.  I think it was formed in the '70s [1970s], was it not?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: It was formed in 1977 at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  And the original meeting was a meeting of, you know, African American physicists where they had, in '77 [1977], they talked about their research interests, primarily.  So it was a day of scientific lectures.  And it had evolved into an annual affair where NSBP was primarily concerned or an outlet for people to get their research ideas or technical ideas, kind of a place to vet them first so they could talk about whatever work they were doing.  And then it started to grow from there.  When I took the presidency, I hadn't been involved, when I was a graduate student, I wasn't involved much with NSBP.  It really wasn't until I guess my last year at Rocketdyne [rocket engine manufacturing division of Rockwell International].  And then when I was at [Lawrence] Berkeley [National Lab], then I started attending the meetings again 'cause I could get travel funds to go to the meetings.  And we had a meeting at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] in 2001.  And the thing that struck me was, you know, the possible--the reason I had been involved in organizing the meeting at Stanford because of my good friend and mentor, Dr. Walker, Arthur Walker, who was a professor of applied physics had gotten ill with cancer.  And he couldn't serve on the committee anymore.  And then word had gotten back to me that, you know, they needed some help in terms of organizing the NSBP meeting.  In those days, it was a combined meeting.  There was this organization called the National Society of Black Physics Students that had been loosely formed over the years.  And when I came to the meeting, one of the organizational meetings there, one of the things that concerned me was--and I had chaired a meeting previously at Berkeley, of NSBP.  We held it at LBL [Lawrence Berkeley Lab].  The thing that struck me was, was that there was a lot of interest in having the students there.  And there was like almost no interest in having the professionals there.  And maybe "no" interest is a harsh term, but it was kind of like, well, you know, you guys are grown men.  You're on your own.  You gotta raise your own money and all this other stuff.  And what we're gonna do is Stanford's gonna pay for the students basically, though they raised a little bit of money for the students.  And so I started the process of raising the money for the meeting.  And the thing was, was that, you know, the size of the meeting was largely dictated by the amount of funding you could get to support travel.  So it's like any scientific meeting.  And I discovered that there was a tremendous, you know, that it was relatively--if you were willing to write a proposal and do a little bit of work, you could really make the meeting arbitrarily large.  So, for example, a meeting of the students would be like, with Stanford [University, palo Alto, California] running it, it would be like 100, 125 people.  And then if we'd let them do it with professionals, there might have been another 50, right.  And when I started writing proposals, we were able to grow that meeting to 700 by just saying, like, well, you put into the proposal--so, for example, when I write a proposal, I put in a meeting, you know, support for or partial support for, you know, 700 people total.  And there was none of this thing where, you know, I mean it was like the people were saying, well, you're asking NSF [National Science Foundation] for too much money.  And I said, NSF can tell me they only got enough money for 300 people.  And actually, in that meeting the big thing was, was the ability to--we were largely supported by the National Institute of Health [NIH], all right.  And we were able to, you know, get enough money and hold a meeting for 700, a combined meeting.
Story_ID: 626427
Speaker 1: And so one of the things I learned was, is that you really can't count on Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] or other people really putting a lot of effort into these meetings, that it needs to be, if it's gonna be of this size, it needs to be something that's put on by NSBP, and NSBP [National Society of Black Physicists] needs to be able to control the funding, okay.  And so, we, as an organization--they'd say, well, you're an organization.  You can't write for NSF [National Science Foundation] support or NIH [National Institutes of Health] support.  And I said, that's not true.  There're little companies that get money from NIH and NSF, you know.  They're professional societies.  They get money from NSF, NIH and DOE [U.S. Department of Energy] and everybody else to hold professional meetings, you know.  Why can't NSBP?  Well, that's a, you know, NSBP, I mean they, they give partial.  I said, well, yeah, we'll get partial money too, and we'll charge registration and all the other stuff, and this will be subsidized.  And we'll do it like any other professional organization.  And since I was at Berkeley, you know, I could take a lot of the, you know, administrative things, I could contract with Berkeley to do or whomever as we contracted with our own meeting planner and stuff.  And it also allows the organization to do things like hold a job fair because that was the real interest, is to have like a single place where people from REU [Research Experience for Undergraduates] programs, the various universities, university recruiters, in some cases, federal agencies, government recruiters, could recruit students of physics.  It was like one-stop shopping, and so we started to do that.  At first we tried to do it jointly.  The trouble was with the student organization is that a student organization, they really wanted to keep the thing small because that was something, their vision was.  They had no interest in having a large meeting, and also, there was this, I felt that there was this conspiracy to maintain the myth that there weren't that many African American students interested in physics.
Story_ID: 626428
Speaker 1: And then there was also, the issue I had was the lack of the presence of African American physics, physicists at a professional level at our, at the DOE [U.S. Department of Energy] laboratories.  And I wrote a paper, and I can't remember when it was exactly, 2000 or 2004 or something like that, about that 'cause, you know, you had all these diversity people running around.
Speaker 2: Now, this is, I think, is this the 2002, the 'Status of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'The Status of the African American Physicist in the Department of Energy National Laboratories'.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, here you look at, they say, well, there's a, you know, there're not that many African, Ph.D.-level African American physicists and then when you do the calculation, you find out that, well, that doesn't mean like, zero.  And when you looked at national laboratories that had no one there (laughter), you know, like that place, yeah, like Argonne National Lab [Illinois].  They had no one, and then when you looked at it in detail, and that was what I looked at, was that, when I said, "no one", no one in a continuing position, that's permanently employed there.  You had, and then you actually didn't have anybody in post-doctoral positions then.  And I mean I could remember getting called up ideally, "Well, how do you know?"  And I said, well, what do you think it is?  You're saying I don't know how many of my folks (laughter) are at the place.  Can you produce anybody (laughter)?  All you gotta do is tell me I'm wrong, right.  I said, if you just tell me how many folks are there?  And they said, well, we have privacy concerns.  I said, what do you mean you got privacy concerns (laughter)?  And then when you do in proportion to the number of people from the former Soviet Union that are working there in career positions and people (laughter) from the Peoples Republic of China, I said, you know, I did another study, like, I said, well, if you look at it in terms of opportunity, the Chinese student with a Ph.D. in physics has starting twice the opportunity that an African American physicist has because the Chinese student can access the positions in the European Union and the positions here, right, whereas, an African American student, he can only access the positions here, 'cause he ain't going over to Italy.  I mean I've actually had colleagues that said, that they were told point blank, that they'll never get a job in Italy because they're not Italian citizens.  But that raised quite a stir.  And I said, well, listen, you know, you're saying that there's nobody here, and here I got this meeting where I got 700 people, plus students.  And you don't have any representatives there.  And then we started to get, you know, well, we'd get some interests from DOE and instantly at Lawrence Berkeley Lab we got, one year, soon after that, we got five, well, at least they had five post docs there.
Speaker 2: I think the little box here with the stats show that there were, out of 3,372--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --people, there were only eleven black scientific staff in all the national laboratories.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in, you know, real jobs, not these little play, play jobs like--'cause that's what they'll do, is they get all these poor people who've got degrees in education and master's degrees and they call them, they wanna call them--they wanna count them as scientists.
Speaker 2: And these are thirteen labs, I guess--I just did a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --look at it, thirteen labs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Fermi Lab, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], you know, at Stanford Linear Accelerator, here you got Stanford as an institution that's graduated the largest number of African Americans with Ph.D.s in physics, and you got nobody there.
Story_ID: 626429
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the purpose for the formation of the National Society of Black--the National Black Educators or National Black Police Association, the, you can go on down the line, National Black Firefighter, the, all these organizations formed to solve these kind of problems.
Speaker 2: Well, the interesting counter to that, I believe, was that within DOE (laughter), what they wanted, all of a sudden they started having all these outreach programs, the K through 12 [kindergarten through twelfth grade], get people interested in science.  I mean they wanted people so far away from 'em, that they'd never be anybody that would threaten their little jobs (laughter), that would say--
Speaker 1: So instead of trying to employ the physicist that need jobs--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right now, they'd rather go back and start cultivating people.
Speaker 2: Well, what you would do is, is they would then hire like, you know, science teacher and others to run these little programs.  And, and I'm saying, well, wait a second.  Since when is that the mission of a national lab?  You know, you're not into science, you know, science education.  That means if you get your Ph.D. from Berkeley, you can get a job here, not that you're out here running into somebody's public school to get them interested in physics 'cause after that, they had, at the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley, they had recruited all these people from England (laughter), right.  I don't know if they recruited them, but anyway, they were there.  And so they brought up some students from Oakland [California] Public Schools, right, to show how, get them interested in science.  So they come in there, they give 'em a tour of the facilities, show 'em the labs and then they wanna give 'em, give 'em the test.  And so one of the questions on the test was, "What does a scientist look like?"  And two of the students had answered, "It looks like an English guy with a beard."  (Laughter)  And then the, the guy from, that was running the program comes up to me, and he says--and I said, well, that's right.  What's he gonna see?  I said, you know, the scientific director of the Advanced Light Source is English, the director of experimental systems group is English.  They've got their wives there.  What do you think?  The kid is blind?  He said, well, these are the best people.  I said, oh, yeah, all the people, I said, well, if you need the best people in the world, how come we got four storage rings, and you only got one in England.  I said, you think--I mean and also at that time, that was the height of the H-1B visa [non-immigrant work visa] crisis.  So if you went up to Berkeley, actually, if you went to any national labs, you'll see there's a lot of people from the European Union there.  Okay, and one of the reasons they're there is that the only way they can get there is on H-1B.  And the people in the lab like the H-1Bs and people, visa holders, because that means they don't have to take out a long-term mortgage on anybody.  And they have an easy means to get rid of 'em, right, because the visa is gonna expire and we can't, you know, we can't renew it.  And that's why they have it, that way, a lab manager once told me, we get access to people of high quality, but limited opportunity (laughter).  And this was well known among, that's why a number of students, you know, students would not even consider Berkeley because they knew they were gonna, always gonna hire, you know, these H-1B folks, all right.  And the thing is, it was Berkeley had enough cash so they didn't have to get people from Asia.  They could get people from Germany and England and Spain and all those kinds of folks.  And sometimes, they'd work out and stay there and sometimes they didn't.  And then they went.  And, you know, that was the environment.  It wasn't like, well, you know, we don't have any--'cause the interesting thing was, was at Berkeley, as I commented once, I'd say, well, you got three African American scientists here.  But you don't have any painters, you know, like the guys that paint the walls and things.  They didn't have (laughter), and so, you mean, there's nobody in Oakland (laughter) that's interested in being a painter, not to mention in trucking, 'cause they had just fired the one black person they had in trucking.  I said, you got nobody in, what was it, internal trucking.  And, you know, so it was well known that LBL, that their main labor pool were in the, what was it?  I can't remember what they called it.  It was, I know it was through the tunnel, (unclear) one of those places like Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Antioch, these other suburbs [Oakland, California].
Speaker 1: Richmond and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Not (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, never, never.  In fact, I remember (laughter), I've never met anybody from Richmond in Berkeley, at [Lawrence] Berkeley [National Laboratory, Berkeley, California].  And so, you know, that was, that was the environment, and it was mirrored at Brookhaven [National Laboratory, Upton, New York], at, at Argonne [National Laboratory, Illinois], especially, and the other places like Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and [Lawrence] Livermore [National Laboratory], yeah, the goo log (ph.).  Yeah, 'cause I used to work out there.  Those, those people were desperate to keep their--I mean that was our science city, like, you know, the Soviets are supposed to have a science city.  Well, Livermore was our science.  I mean we have our own science cities, all right.  And Livermore is exactly like that.  The whole thing is driven--'cause there's no other activity in Livermore where they're gonna get 3 billion dollars a year to pour in there.  And as a consequence, you know, you have housing around there.  I think they have a mall there now.  But, and it was just like, you know, mentality.  To keep the lab going, they were very politically, they're always afraid that this, that or the other thing would get cut.  And they hated people from Berkeley.
Story_ID: 626430
Speaker 1: So were you able to put a--, I mean to shake 'em up a little bit on these things, to change any of [change the lack of African American scientists at the national laboratories run by the Department of Energy, for instance, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where Jackson worked]--
Speaker 2: Well, considering it was, since you were working at zero, it was easy to get it changed (laughter).  All you to do was get 'em to hire one person (laughter).  So, yeah, I mean at [Lawrence] Berkeley [National Laboratory, Berkeley, California], yeah, I mean one time before I left, there were like five folks there.  I mean they were post-doc [postdoctoral] positions and two were in continuing positions, permanent, well, what goes for permanent.  But the trick is to get somebody there and they have to, it's like Rockwell [International; now Boeing].  You have to engage with the community.  And it's gotta be more than I wanna get a job here.  You have to, as I said, somehow, engage with the community and make it so that you're, you have to be very competitive.  You gotta be like Woody Hayes [football player and coach].  And I mean what happens to a lot of scientists is that they get there, and they only wanna, they only have--so each lab has like a main big program, that, for whatever reason, they feel is gonna carry 'em through the next decade or whatever, all right.  And the trick is, is to identify that program and get on it.  Now, maybe it's in some area that you're not really interested in, like, you know, like working on those Scud [ballistic missiles developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War] things.  I had like zero.  It wasn't like I went home at night dreaming about how the take out a Scud.  The only thing I can keep seeing was that steel thing in my hand (laughter), and thinking this is no way a piece of light is gonna punch through this, 'cause you had to punch through it to get to the fuel.  And I didn't think, well, maybe you can transfer--that was the only problem.  You know, since it's steel, steel doesn't transfer heat real well, like aluminum.  So you had no hope of getting it in there and getting it hot enough to ignite the fuel, 'cause they had, you know, they had pretty volatile fuels.  They have kerosene up there.  But anyway, that's where people would, you know, where you find that people falter.  And it could be, so, for example, like at Brookhaven [National Laboratory, Upton, New York], in the high-energy physics group, basically, once the SSC [Superconducting Super Collider] got killed, and the L8C came up, if you wanted to do high-energy physics, you gotta go to L8C, all right.  You gotta get associated with a project, like L8C.  You can't sit at home at Brookhaven, working on those little dinky accelerators and expect to get any standing in the community, and, you know, black or white.  And what'll happen would be, people would say, well, I don't wanna go over to Europe, and I don't wanna--and I said, well, listen, then you're dead.  You just said that you don't wanna be a high-energy physicist anymore.  Nobody here is gonna keep--well, they're keeping this, that and the other thing running.  Yeah, that's just until these guys die.  They're not gonna replace those folks.  Everybody they replace in high-energy physics, they're gonna be working on, what is that thing called, "ATLAS", yeah, they're gonna work on the ATLAS [a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)], and they're gonna work on the CMS [particle physics experiment].  And that's it.  And the same thing with fusion.  They're only gonna work on that Edorer (ph.) in France.  And so, you know, if you wanna be successful, you gotta, you know, you gotta hitch your horse up to that and get on that plane and, you know, tell your wife and kids, well, I'm running off to France, you know.  You guys can come every once in a while, but, you know, this is, this is the way we're gonna pay the mortgage and stuff.
Story_ID: 626431
Speaker 1: The (unclear) was, was that it was very difficult to get African, when you looked at the DOE [U.S. Department of Energy]--first of all, most people don't know that the Department of Energy is the largest supporter of physical scientists in this country.  And most folks have never heard of the Office of Science, which is where most of the money in the physical sciences, for physical sciences research exists.  And what you'll hear are people with, are government employees with suits that come on who will say, DOE is a mission-oriented agency and dah, dah, which implies they support only a very limited scope of research, scientific research.  However, my term for DOE is the Department of Everything because from what I can tell as a professional, I can find no single line of physics research they do not support.  And, you know, and the thing is, is that the major universities.  Most of them are funded by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, in particular, basic energy sciences, okay.  And you'll find that at HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], they're funded by NNSA, which is National Nuclear Security Agency, which is separate and distinct from the Office of Science.  As a result, I believe that has occurred because the Office of Science says, well, we're only gonna support the major research universities and HBCUs are not those, whereas NNSA says, well, we need for political considerations to support everybody.  And that becomes the break off.  And the trouble is, is that all of the national labs are supported by the Office of Science.  All the national user facilities are supported by the Office of Science.  And so most of the continuing money, money that occurs every year for basic research, particularly academic research, is through the Office of Science.  One of the things that is particularly galling for me as a professional is that when you look at the Office of Science and the African American civil servants that work there, none of 'em are scientists, even though they have extremely, at least from their titles, you know, they have high senior ranks.  So, for example, the budget manager at one time, who was an African American, it turned out that he was a minister.  And I'm thinking, well, here is the holy temple of science (laughter)--and the representation from our community is a minister.
Speaker 2: Now, I would have guessed he would have at least been an accountant, but--
Speaker 1: No, well, I think he had an accounting background or business background, but his main degree was, he was a minister.  And (laughter), and then when you go to the labs, that the, we look at African Americans that are on the managerial side, they have like, they're basically things like ex-high school principals, some business people, I mean some people with, like an MBA [Master's in Business Administration] kind of degree.  But again, when you look at everybody else, they have degrees in science, not just physics, but, you know, like biology, chemistry, engineering.  But there's nada--and, you know, I found this, you know, particularly galling, and, you know, it just is amazing to me that, you know, this has been allowed to occur.  And that was part of the thing that drove, I tried to, you know, push when I was president of NSBP [National Society of Black Physicists].
Story_ID: 626432
Speaker 1: Now, there're some notable exceptions [to national laboratories that have a shortage of African American scientists on the staff].  I mean, for example, if you looked at Thomas Jefferson Laboratory [J-Lab; Virginia], which is adjacent to Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], there's very active collaboration between Hampton [University] and Thomas Jefferson Lab, though it's one of the smaller facilities.
Speaker 2: And that's more recent too.
Speaker 1: Yes, it's more recent.
Speaker 2: Because at the time you wrote your study, they had zero black people involved--
Speaker 1: On staff.  Well, what they, well, they didn't have anybody that was on the payroll.  But they have, they were able to do things like have a professor at Hampton whose research was funded at [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [J-Lab; Virginia] or through Jefferson Lab.  In fact, his name is Keith Baker [also a HistoryMaker], and he left Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], and he got a full professorship at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  And he works on the Atlas project [particle accelerator project at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN] in Switzerland.  And Paul Gaye, who's the current president of NSBP, he also has a role at Jefferson Lab.  But more importantly, not only did he have a role at Jefferson Lab, but also at SURA, which is the Southeastern, I mean Southwestern, I mean South--Southern University Research Association [Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And they actually run, they manage SURA for DOE [Department of Energy].  And at one time, the chairman, the chair of SURA was William Harvey of Hampton.  And so there you do have a driving force in our community that's, you know, leading the organization.  And that's, quite frankly, the model that you like to see as opposed to having these people who are running around to try to get the children interested in careers in science.  And then you see that, when they come to the laboratory, they see that the people who get hired in science for careers in science at our national laboratories, most of 'em are not from our nation.  And, actually, that would be the more interesting study, is that, to look at, well, what are, what proportion of the new hires with a Ph.D. at our national labs were born in the USA?  And do you really believe that the high schools in China are better than the high schools in Chicago [Illinois]?  I mean--
Speaker 2: If they do, then--
Speaker 1: I said, so, like what would be your proof?  I mean do they have like a better curriculum?  Do they have better assessments?  Do they have all that professional educational stuff?  Or is it because they have a Ph.D. and they're of high quality, but limited opportunity?  And they're, there's a lot of 'em.  They're easy to get, and they're willing to work on what your interests are.  I mean that is the challenge, is as I tell students here when they say, you know, they ask like what does a physicist do?  I can tell 'em what a physicist does.  But when they say, they assert that there's some shortage of people with physics, that I cannot say.  How would you tell there was a shortage?  Now, there's certainly a shortage of physicists that are willing to work for $40,000 a year with a Ph.D. in the United States.  There's not a shortage of people willing to work for $40,000 a year in China or even in Spain and Greece now.  And that is who you compete against.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Story_ID: 626433
Speaker 1: So you were president of NSBP [National Association of Black Physicists] for, until 2006.  But during that period of time, you worked at the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, NAEOHE, as a--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, I was at [Lawrence] Berkeley [National Laboratory], and I decided to, NAEOHE wanted to establish an academy at Moffett Field [Moffett Federal Airfield] in Mountain View, California--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had been trying for a couple of years.  And they approached me about, you know, working in that position.  And what I did was, one of the nice things about being at a place like Berkeley is, it's not uncommon to take time off without pay and still be able to come back to your job.  In fact, at Berkeley, you can do it for up to two years.  And, and, actually, this is not an uncommon practice within our national laboratory system.  So, for example, it was not uncommon for a scientist to take time off and go work at one of the Max Planck Institutes or one of the major research facilities throughout the world.  And this is unheard of at HBCUs [historically black colleges an universities] and at one of these businesses (laughter).  But that's, that's one of the ways that a national lab is different.  So I elected to do that and go down to, you know, Mountain View and establish this academy.  One problem they had had, they had tried to use retired people from Silicon Valley that were not technical people, that were retired from HP [Hewlett Packard].  For example, they were a human resource person or that, and they did not have the scientific contacts or reputation within the community to be able, within the research community, to be able to make any forward motion because it became like, well, how do you recruit students?  And what kind of students?  And one of the things about science is, you know, quality is a, a big issue.  Quality is measured by, you know, GPA, you know, progress through your studies at school, what you've actually taken and other things, is extremely important.  And then the ability to sit down as a peer and, you know, talk to people about putting folks in their labs because, you know, I realize when you take somebody in your lab, if you're at a laboratory, you know, your career is riding on this because there're certain things you need to get done to stay competitive in order to keep whatever research support that you're getting.  If you're somebody that's working on developing an idea, you really don't have time to mentor students.  You have to be able--'cause you're gonna be on travel.  You gotta go to Washington or wherever your customer is and push your program.  If you're someone that's working on something long term, say, you have like an institute for plasma physics, right, that implies there's some ongoing function, funding.  And, you know, that's a person that has a little bit of leisure time and post-docs and other things, that they can, you know, mentor a student, a summer student in the laboratory.  And for the people that had been hired there as directors, they did not have that.  Their thought was, well, their analysis of a national lab is, well, you have a director, right, so NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] gives the director all this money.  And then the director, you know, hands it out.  And that couldn't be further from the truth because what happens is that within a lab like Ames Lab [U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory in Ames, Iowa] where I was, is that each of the directors of departments and even down to the individual scientists, they have what I call a patron, at NASA, DOE [U.S. Department of Energy], DOD [U.S. Department of Defense] (laughter) or whatever, who's funding their work.  They fund the work.  They give some proportion of that funding to, to the director in the form overhead or indirect costs, okay.  And the director uses that money to keep the lights on and maybe, if there's some left over and he'll have some discretions to fund, you know, new ideas and new work that will lead to something.  But the idea that most people have of this director doling out money to the divisions, it's not true.  And so, you know, so people have a lot of, individual scientists have a lot of autonomy.  But they also have a lot of risks if it doesn't, if things don't work out.  And to have someone that's familiar with the system as director, it's a lot easier to go into places and, you know, work with people and get things, well, simple things like the placements of students and faculty for sabbatical.  And so I took some time off, and I did that for about two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626434
Speaker 1: Now, all right, so you were basically, arranging for placements of students in laboratories or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: There were two operations.  There was placements of students in laboratories for a summer program, and then also sabbaticals for faculty members at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], Inc., which one of the--that was really the interesting part of the program because then, you know, that's a real opportunity to boost people in their careers because if they spend a year there onsite, odds are they can leave there with, they'll leave with a lot of contacts within NASA and possibly funding from NASA and certainly, a preferred place for being able to deal with announcements and things.  They come from NASA.  Again, you have to work on a program that's gonna be funded continually.  That's something that NASA is interested in, and it can't be, hopefully, that is well aligned with your interests, but that is a necessary condition to be able to received sponsored research funding.
Speaker 1: Okay, 2004, you were selected as one of the 50 most important African Americans in Technology by 'U.S. Engineering and Information Technology', which is a--that's a publication?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.  Yeah, it didn't say on here.  Is it still in publication?
Speaker 2: No, the main--yeah, I think they do have like an online thing now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But their main activities now are like the Black Engineer of the Year meeting that, well, actually, they had it in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And, oh, I didn't, we didn't point out that NAEOHE is basically staffed by ex-black college presidents, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Dr. [Fred] Humphries, used to be at FAMU [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florids]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Dr. Arthur Thomas used to be at Central State [University, Wilburforce, Ohio], Dr. Johnson, I think, who is at Prairie View [A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], I think, or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, I've met some of them.
Speaker 2: And William Harvey at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  And he's still president and will be for a while, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, he'll be president there forever, I mean, well, as long as he wanted to be president.  And he's done a, I don't know, of the presidents I meet, he's the one that's impressed me the most, personally.  And he's been a very strong supporter of science and physics, in particular.  I mean he's one that early on, that, you know, saw that, you know, physics could be used to build, well, actually, to build the quality of the, of the campus and also bring in significant resources and visibility and prestige.
Story_ID: 626435
Speaker 1: Okay, now, 2005, you left Lawrence Berkeley [National Laboratory, Berkeley, California] and became vice president of research and professor of physics at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University [Tallahassee, Florida], otherwise known as FAMU?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so, how did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: Well, the other thing was, was that my wife passed away in 2004.  And I was back at Berkeley, and we had finished up the, we finished up a phase of the EUV [extreme ultra-violet] program.  And we were able ready to push towards the next phase, and that was gonna be, and it was gonna be particularly strenuous because in many ways, we had failed on a major initiative, which the State of New York benefited from. We had teamed very closely with International Sematech which is an international trade association for the semiconductor industry for the support of EUV.  And at the same time, the State of New York or the state university system of New York [SUNY system] formed a college of nanoscience at New York State University in Albany [New York].  And the state said, they made a deal with Sematech.  One of the problems with organizations like Sematech is that they're membership based.  That means the members pay dues and based upon those dues, that's (laughter), that's how much money that the organization gets 'cause they don't sell--I mean they make some money through training and other things--don't get me wrong, and testing specific tools that will be put in the manufacturing plants.  But the only way a membership organization can grow is that, well, you can get more members.  So you get more dues.  But, or you can increase the dues.  Well, you know, the number of semiconductor manufacturers is not a growing number.  In fact, it's a shrinking number.  I think it combined in other things.  And there's not a lot of, when you have organizations that are based upon collaborations of competitors, there's not a lot of room for growth.  And so what happened was an opportunity.  The state university system of New York said, well, listen, if Sematech moves a significant part of its organization to New York, we'll give 'em "x" number of dollars, and "x" is a big number and facilities and other things.  And, plus, we have this college of nanoscience that we're putting together.  And we're gonna emphasize, you know, the semiconductor industry 'cause that'll be the greatest immediate beneficiaries of nanoscience.  And what we at Berkeley said was, well, we just need more money so we can build the next generation lithography tool, EUV tool and solve these other problems.  So, and we didn't have any money to put on the table.  And so Sematech moved to New York--actually, a couple of people from our lab moved, joined up with the State University of New York [SUNY] and Sematech.  Curiously enough, they came back, well, one of 'em came back.  But, so now we had to go out and get our own contract from Sematech.  So we were gonna, we were gearing up for that battle, and I thought it was gonna be a big battle, and, you know, both of my children were here on the East Coast at that time.  My son was in Atlanta [Georgia] at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  My daughter was working in, well, she was at school in Columbia [University, New York].  So I decided it was time for a transition.  So I took my dog and cat, I took the dog and threw him in a kennel.  It's amazing.  You can take a dog and put it in a kennel and put that on the plane and they really do show up at the other end.  And the cat, well, cat got to ride in first class.  That was like, and the cat carried underneath the seat in front of you (laughter).  She wasn't real happy, but she managed to make the trip.  And so I moved down to Tallahassee.
Story_ID: 626436
Speaker 1: They [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), Tallahassee, Florida] had a, they were going through a transition of their own.  They had a new interim president when Fred Humphries left in 2001, they had moved through one interim, well, one interim president, a president, [Fred] Gainous, who lasted eighteen months, and then Dr. Castile Bryant was imported--appointed interim.  And she came in.  They also had a long-standing problem with the National Science Foundation [NSF], which they had largely, before I got there, had straightened out.  But it was a real mess.  It was--
Speaker 2: Was it over funding or something or--
Speaker 1: It was, yeah, it was over funding.  It was over the management of a large research proposal they had gotten, the Crest Center there.  And they had been fighting with NSF for, from what I could tell, three or four years.  And it had gone, it was, it was a comedy of errors, and eventually, it had resulted in Florida A and M having to pay back $1.43 million to NSF.  But in the process they had terminated their, the vice president of research and a number of other employees, not necessarily related to that.  And so they needed, the interim president needed a vice president of research.  And one of my colleagues there, Dr. Joseph Johnson and another one, Dr. Lewis Johnson, encouraged me to, you know, apply for the job or put in a good word for me.  And I had met with the president on one of my trips down there to visit them.  And so I was offered the position, and after some negotiation, decided to take a post down there.  And it was quite an experience.  You know, so one of the things that, you know, shows that people, you really have to be immersed in the research process or enterprise, you know, to understand how it works, particularly at a university in terms of the details of the, you know, what's expected for the monies that come in.  So when you have people who have backgrounds in education, they hear the word "grant," and they take that literal.  Well, here, you've given us the money.  We can do anything we want with it.  And (laughter), and, you know, they don't realize how prescriptive it is, differences between a contract versus a grant.  The basic notion, and the fundamental thing is that research, as practiced in the United States, with some exceptions, is done on a reimbursed, reimbursable basis.  And what that means is, say you have an award for a million dollars, okay.  The government of the United States or the National Science Foundation as an agency of the United States, does not send a million dollars down to a bank account, and then you pull that down as you use it, nor do they have a bank account up at NSF where you pull down the funds and use it.  The way the business works is, is that you do the research, and the expenses associated with the research.  You then collect the costs, and you then invoice the government, okay.  And then if you're lucky (laughter), the government will allow the cost and they'll send you a check.
Speaker 2: That seems, just let me interject, it seems like a risky way of--and implies that you have the means to do this research, you know, upfront, first, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which is, and a lot of our black colleges and universities are strapped financially so that--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the world is an unfair place (laughter), and there are a lot of sixty-year old women with them ankle bracelets, for testifying, you know, as testimony to how unfair the world is (laughter).  But, you say they're under resourced, okay.  Well, what would constitute a well resourced university of 11,000 students?  How much money do you think they should have?  How about, would $400 million seem like a reasonable amount?
Story_ID: 626437
Speaker 1: But the way research is done in the United States of America, our tradition that dates back to Vannevar Bush [head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II] and 'The Endless Frontier', a document written in 1948, that laid out how we do--and that's why it's a partnership with the federal government, all right, states--and modified in 1963, so that state universities (laughter) could participate 'cause originally, it was only meant for twelve universities to participate, the ones that participated in the Manhattan Project.  That was 'The Endless Frontier' (laughter).  In 1963, they had to modify that so Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and these other places could participate, okay.  And so the deal is, is that you do the research, you collect the cost associated with that research, you send it to NSF [National Science Foundation].  They review it in thirty days, and then they send you back the money.  And if you did what you're supposed to, said you were gonna do in your proposal, you're fine, all right.  Well, maybe not.  But if you did what you said you needed to do in the proposal (laughter), then you're fine.  And that wasn't what the understanding was, that most people have.  And they had different understandings, like, well, there's this money in the account.  We gotta draw it down, and we can draw it down whenever we want.  And what I found when I got there was that there were projects who hadn't drawn down their costs, long after the project expired.  You have ninety days after the end of the contract to accumulate costs and bill.  And I found that was like over a year, in which case, you become the greatest supporter of research because you wind up supporting that research on your own dime.  And that was the problem, and the, and the, the level of financial control of the institution wasn't there because what would happen is, is that, well, at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] at that time, they didn't have a C--they didn't have a CFO [Chief Financial Officer].  And then they were more fixated on getting the money that the state was providing 'cause that was a larger amount.
Speaker 2: Was that tied to the NSF money?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, this is, research money is treated the same way as the proceeds from the football games (laughter), as auxiliaries (laughter), and other things.  And what happens is, is that the research accounting is a lot more precise than the accounting that you have to do for the state.  So the state does act like, it does have like a bank account you're pulling.  They authorize so many lines.  You hear about lines.  Well, that's what they are.  They're like employment contracts, okay.  They have some set-aside for capitals and other stuff, but they're not demanding that you send them a statement every month or week or whatever.  They do it like once a year.  I mean you stay within those guidelines, you're fine.  Now, most of the time they don't stay in the guidelines.  And so as I got there, we started trying to, you know, clean it up.
Story_ID: 626438
Speaker 1: And then you have the issue of, the other associated--oh, the other thing about doing research, is you've probably heard of indirect costs.  So what the government says is that, listen, we're not gonna nickel and dime you for every little, you know, pint of pump oil and stuff you buy or whatever, that there're other costs associated with having the research there, like you have to have a purchasing department.  You have to have inventory control, okay.  What we're willing to do as a percentage to pay you, part of that back in indirect costs.  So, again, if you have a contract of a million dollars, well, if you have expenses such as travel, supplies and materials, personnel that you pay, like post-docs or maybe a laboratory assistant, maybe even an administrator, I mean an administrative assistant, okay, we'll let you collect those costs.  And then we'll send you a percentage of those costs.  In FAMU's [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] case, it was 45 percent.  So 45 percent of those categories are called modified total direct costs, okay.  It comes back to the university, which they can do anything they want with it, okay.  Now, the wise thing to do with it is to feed it back into the research process infra--and build your research infrastructure.  So you make sure that the accounting module for the university has a component for sponsored programs.  So you're not treating 'em like they're the football game and the basketball game, that your inventory control officer has the software so you can keep track of--I mean you've probably read in the paper, like at [Lawrence] Berkeley [national Laboratory, Berkeley, California], they'll say, Lawrence Berkeley Lab lost 20 million dollars worth of equipment or Lawrence Livermore [National] Lab [Livermore, California] lost 50 million dollars worth of equipment.  They haven't lost it.  It's probably sitting up there some place, but nobody, you know, cares about it.  Why?  Because it was 50 million dollars if you took it at its costs to acquire, but, as you know, things deteriorate with time.  So the PC [computer] that you spent 5,000 dollars on fifteen years ago, has a current cost of zero.  In fact, it's probably negative 'cause it costs somebody to pull it off, and you gotta keep track of it.  And so those things, that's a common practice in the government, right.  I'm sure they have a good reason, you know.  Maybe you're supposed to kiss their ass 'cause they bought you a chart recorder fifty years ago (laughter), but in any case, so anyway, you make sure your inventory guy has something to keep track of that, all right.  And that's what I mean by infrastructure.  I don't necessarily mean that, you know, that they're building me a new toy or something, but in, you know, you have, you give some money to the library.  So you got research journals there, okay.  That's how you build up the research infrastructure so you do have something like the other people do.  But you don't get anything unless you send in an invoice.  And that's what happened with the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  They don't send in an invoice.  I had, you have to go to any DOE [U.S. Department of Energy] or any program manager at any agency that has attempted to get, establish programs with an HBCU.  He'll tell you, they don't bill.  Now, maybe they have a good reason for not billing.  But I, I can't, I could never figure it out.  And when I was there, you know, my--so for example, a big, in academia, people will say, well, Dr. Jackson got a 500,000 dollar research grant, right.  And that we got 30 million dollars in research awards.  That's an irrelevant number.  The only number that a college president or chief financial officer should ask is "What is in my indirect cost return this month, this quarter?", 'cause that's how much money they've actually gotten in.  So, for example, if you have like a million-dollar grant, and the only thing that's in it is support for students, then the university doesn't get anything from that 'cause there're no indirect costs charged to support participants.  There's no indirect cost recovery because after all, that's what a university is supposed to do.  We can't double bill.  We're supposed to educate students (laughter).  So, the only thing that you, as a president or a chief financial officer or a vice president of research, should ask about, what is your indirect cost return this month, 'cause then that will drive the billing.  And if you're someone who's saying they lack resources, and you don't bill so you can get resources in, one has to question the believability of your lack of resources.
Story_ID: 626439
Speaker 1: Okay, so in the case of FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], before you got there, did they--you said they didn't have a CFO [Chief Financial Officer], and they, did they just not understand how to get their money or to how make it--
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of it was training--
Speaker 1: --worth their while?
Speaker 2: Yeah, staff training, particularly, middle management in the financial organization and also not holding people accountable, like there was, it wasn't clear.  It was like, one of the things that was done by the then provost, now, the interim president of FAMU, Larry Robertson, was, to incentivize people, was that some proportion of the indirect costs would be distributed.  So the, so that the dean would get a percentage, the department would get a percentage and, more importantly, the PIs [principal investigators] would get a percentage of the indirect costs return.  And in that way, their calling up and telling you to bill because they wanna get their money because one of the things that you really get in a grant is discretionary money and money for, like travel, to international meetings, money like that you can buy a fax machine with 'cause you can't really put that into an award, money to fund a secretary or a bookkeeper or a health physics officer, training for laser eye safety (laughter) and things like that, that you might need.  Suppose you're the only person on the campus that's got a laser.  So it doesn't make sense for them to have like, you know, a health physics person.  You just wanna send your students to a seminar so that, or, more importantly, have a consultant come in, right.  Well, you can't pay for that out of a research grant, typically.  And so, and, again, you know, it's not like you're gonna take this money out and go buy a Ferrari if you wanna have some longevity in the field.  So, you know, you know, the then provost, and now interim president, you know, did that.  And so that started to incentivize people.  And a lot of this is done before I got there.  I'm not gonna sit around and take credit for it.  One thing was, too, was that they were overstaffed in the division of research for an institution of their size.  And so we had to reduce staff--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --drastically.  And that was a big morale hit.  But, you know, research is allegedly what you have a university to do.  Universities are not vocational schools.  We are supposed to generate new knowledge, and I know that seems to change in people--everybody wants to rewrite the mission of a university, but the idea is, is that you have faculty there that are passionate about their field, be it physics, history, classical English literature, African American Studies, and they do research in their field.  They write articles and monographs and books and go to meetings.  And part of the deal is, so they can do that, they teach classes.  And then they are assessed upon that.  And, I don't know.  It seems like, you know, from, you know, my standpoint, everybody wants you to do everything other than what the mission of the place has been.  They want you to start businesses (laughter).  They want, they want you to be an entrepreneur (laughter).  And I said, well, wait a second, you know, I didn't sign up for that, you know, that's a whole different--you know, students, they all wanna be entrepreneurs.  I said, well, wait a second.  You know, you have to know something to be an entrepreneuring about.  You know, you can't be an entrepreneur 'cause you got a coat and tie on.  You know, you gotta know how to, you know, you have to know how to do search algorithms.  You gotta know how to, you know, you gotta know what a boson is.  You gotta know what a fermion is.  That's what you're here to learn.  And that seems to, in the rush for individual profit or independence or money or something, that's lost.  FAM, you know, I mean when I was there, FAM [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida] in terms, among HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], FAMU was the, had the fourth highest gross research dollars.  It was like 54 million dollars.
Story_ID: 626440
Speaker 1: And, were you able then, you said, I assume that you and others were able to refine the process and to bring it up to the speed in terms of how that money was--
Speaker 2: Well, the thing was, was to make sure that one, that we recovered, my thing was to recover what we've spent, you know, and then to somehow get that out there.  The other thing was to take advantage of the faculty that was there and make sure that you use them to the best, to the benefit of the university in terms of getting research dollars.  So, now, while I was at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], these things, direct appropriations, better known as earmarks, were still there, okay.  And there is a lot of unappreciated talent at FAMU.  I call them tortured geniuses at FAMU, that for reasons I don't quite understand, people would not take advantage of, or would not listen to or could not assess the wisdom of their words.  So FAMU, one of the presidents--well, you know, they had gone through this succession of leaders.  One of the leaders had hired a lobbyist who was based here in D.C. [District of Columbia]. The interim president didn't like the guy 'cause I think she basically felt that she did not like the image he portrayed.  He was a young guy, he's outspoken.  She thought of him as flashy.  He lived up here in D.C. because he was a federal lobbyist, and she did not like, she did not like dealing with him.  So she said, I should deal with him.  And when I met with him, we put together, he had a very, he had a excellent, very excellent tactic for lobbying the federal government.  And it's not only recognized by me, but by the other lobbyists in Florida 'cause every university, state university had a lobbyist, virtually.  And they were organized.  And many of them sang his praises.  And the tactic was, was to, that you could get more funds by teaming with people in the proper states, okay, on a project than you could ever get alone, 'cause alone, for a single project, it's pain and death to get over 250,000 dollars.  However, if you team with people in three other states, you could get earmarks that were totaling 10, 15 million dollars.  And then you divide it up by the rule of three, if you had three people, three states.  It's very difficult to get anything other than an even share.  And so, we embarked upon doing that.  And so what you do is, is that you had to have, I felt you needed to have an authentic project for believability.  And you had to have people with the credentials that made it believable.  So, for example, with a physics project, it would help to have three people with Ph.D.s in physics from named institutions.  This was not particularly popular.  I think it was said to be elitist.  But there were two advantages.  One, their degrees were recognized and respected.  Two, they had colleagues from like institutions in other states whose degrees were recognized and respected.  And so, and then they had, you know, they had other things like publications, a history.  They're a full professor that has, you know, twenty publications.  They're associate professor with fifteen publications or more.  And so we embarked upon, in physics, we embarked upon--well, in physics and engineering--oh, that's the other thing too, to recognize the federal government supports research in physics and engineering and science, okay, and, and medical things too 'cause we had a School of Pharmacy.  And to, you know, stop this Don Quixote stuff of running around talking about, well, you didn't give us money back in 1862 or wherever, and so we don't have the resources to participate now because then that response is, well, you say you do 'cause you say you're a university, and a university does research.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is to say that, well, if you give us more money, we'll do research (laughter).  That's not a very compelling argument.
Story_ID: 626441
Speaker 1: And, you know, to come up with a bold idea.  So, for example, one of the ideas we came up with, with our partners in Arkansas and Hawaii, was how to detect clandestine nuclear tests at 300 kilometers.  So one of the problems was at that time, was North Korea--it's still a problem, I guess.  And, you know, they had embarked on this nuclear program, and at that time they hadn't tested one.  And so the question becomes, well, how do you know that they really set a bomb off, a nuclear bomb off?  They do underground tests.  The only information you get is seismic.  And you could fake that, right.  You know, you could easily take several thousand tons of, oh, what's that, ammonium nitrate, and stick it down in the ground and pour down diesel fuel and make it mimic the signature of a nuclear explosion.  Then it's like, well, North Korea's got a nuclear bomb.  Now, I don't know why that's effective.  If I was North Korea, I wouldn't wanna be doing that, but, you know, they might think--in any case, the U.S. would like to know whether or not these guys really got one.  And if they did something like that, you wouldn't know.  So, and you can't look from a satellite down 'cause it's underground.  And it's not like you could sneak over there and put radiation monitors into the ground.  So how would you detect it?  And this, the idea is simple 'cause when you set off a nuclear explosion, you create nuclear isotopes, in particular, a radioactive form of argon.  And that, being a nerve gas, comes up through the ground some time later.  And then it's in the air.  And the question is, well, how do you detect it because it's still behind their border.  There's not enough of it to wait for it to blow over here or there.  And so you interrogate it with a laser beam and from the light scattered by the laser, you can determine which isotope of argon is there with high precision.  Now, it's a little bit more, obviously, a little bit more difficult than that, but that was the basic idea.  And then, the idea is scalable because then you can get a (unclear).  So our strategy, another part of our strategy is, you never go to an agency with an earmark unless, because ultimately, you say, okay, I got this earmark.  Well, how do I get this 10 million dollars.  The only way, the government can't write you a check (laughter).  They have to send it through one of their agencies, research agencies.  So they have to send it to like, a relevant one, like Strategic Missile Defense Command, SMDC, yeah, right, because they have the mission for treaty verification.  And so you don't want somebody trying to push it down on 'em because if they object, they can create all kinds of trouble for you.  And so our other tactic was, you go to the agency, and you say, listen, this is what we wanna do.  What do you think about this?  And they'll say, well, we don't have the money for it.  I said, okay, forget about that.  We'll get the money for it, but how do you feel about the idea?  Do you think it's gonna work?  Is it something you'd wanna be associated with and furthermore, the way you prove that is, are you willing to support somebody in your organization to work on this us?  And so you hire, will, you hire a post-doc [postdoctoral researcher] within your organization to work with us if we go out and get the money?  And most of these agencies, they have legislative liaisons who deal with this, 'cause the Department of Defense, despite how you might feel about earmarks, they are organized.  It's not just some random, I mean obviously, there must be cases where it's just random, but for science (laughter), it's not just random things because they'll be like a hue and cry if they don't wanna do it.  And so we would do that and use our contacts, both within the technical community to figure out who in the agencies did have this mission and go talk to them.  And so when the--now, one of the things through them is, is that, as an earmark--the untold story is when an earmark comes through, agencies apply taxes to 'em.  I call 'em taxes.  They call 'em taxes too.  And so they get a certain percentage of the earmark for administrative, administrating it, right.  And we're saying, well, the only thing we want you to do is that, with your taxes, use part of those to hire a post-doc 'cause, you know, a post-doc is in the [U.S.] Army or a complete overhead is maybe a hundred thousand dollars.  So, of whatever you get in taxes, we want you to hire a post-doc to work with us.  Or you could even hire one of your other, one of your guys that are there, pay part of his salary through it.  And this is one of the things they do with people who have fallen out of favor or don't wanna work on the big project.  And that technique was extremely successful.  And we were able to get, like I said, a total 15 million dollars and also to, you know, lobby, gain a lot of respect within, with the various legislators for giving them projects that they can support.
Story_ID: 626442
Speaker 1: A lot of people come to 'em and historically, at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], faculty would come up with projects that the federal government can't support.  You know, they don't, you know, by design or whatever, they don't have the ability to really support it.  Scientific research, they do, they can support.  They can't build a dorm.  They can't use (laughter), you can't use federal dollars to build a dorm.  And you can't use federal tax credits to subsidize a developer to build a dorm.  You know, and that, those are the kinds of things that people were going up there with, and they were getting smacked down.  When we went up there with--we had two projects.  We had a laser project and we had a composite materials project.  Both of those used this tactic and were successfully funded for at least seven years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was one thing that, and I don't feel that I ever got much credit for it.  They were more interested--I did get, we did get the indirect costs returns up.  Even though the total research dollars went down, the actual money into the institution went up.  But people could not respond to those numbers.  They didn't understand them.  They wanted to hear the big, oh, we got 10 million dollars.  And, you know, the sad thing is, for direct student support, there would be no dollars coming into the university.  And largely, those dollars went unused because as soon as you put on there--usually, when you have direct student support, like a scholarship or something, there was a requirement.  And the requirement was a student have a 3.0 or better [GPA, grade point average].  Sometimes, they would have the requirement that they enter a certain field.  And a lot of those funds went wanting 'cause we didn't have that many students in science with 3.0s.
Story_ID: 626443
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were at FAMU [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], when you left, you were a tenured full professor, and you had been associate chair of the department and director of research.  Now, what made you, did you retire from FAMU or did--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the thing is, is that, you know, FAMU had had another transition.  So they got a new president in, well, he's now the ex-president (laughter).  And, you know, he was a, you know, a nice enough guy, but, you know, so I was there--and he actually, I was the only member of the old administration that stayed on.  And that wasn't so much out of respect for me.  It was more like it showed where research sat on his agenda.  So his agenda was to, you know, he had previously been at FAMU there as provost.  And so, you know, he, one of the reasons that he was, you know, brought in or people were so happy to see him was that, you know, because of the patronage thing is that he wanted to bring in all the people that had been there, that he owed favors to when he was provost.  And this was amazing because this extended--I mean I could see it if, you know, at the dean level or chair level, but that wasn't where it was at.  That was among the staff.  And this gets into the, the, kind of the inversion, one of the main differences between HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and majority institutions is that, you know, I found that HBCUs, okay, so you have like the three, three rungs of the ladder, well, four rungs of the ladder.  You have the students, you have the faculty and you have the staff and then the "administration."  So if you go some place like Stanford, the, and you look at in a simplistic way, the staff, I mean the administration is more closely aligned to faculty than it is to the staff, to the faculty and students than it is to staff.  With HBCUs, the administration is more aligned to the staff and students.  One reason for that is because of the autocratic nature of HBCUs and the staff are really the only people that administration can fire or hire (laughter).  And it goes back to the idea of shared government.  So at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], you know, the faculty hire faculty, right.  They maintain the quality of the departments, whatever they do.  But you don't generally have the president coming in saying, well, I want you to hire Betty there in the Department of Education, okay (laughter).  And, you know, Betty doesn't have any qualifications to be in Stanford.  You know, she's not one of the top six people in her field or whatever, okay.  And so they respect that, you know, or don't, but anyway, that's what happens there, okay.  And then when the people that, at Stanford, they don't get mixed up in that.  And the staff are people who, you know, work for the administration and mainly, to keep the faculty happy so they continue to write research proposals and they think of good ideas and leverage the degree that the Stanford student gets.  Now, you know, 'cause most people will say, like I was talking to a young man out at the Marina the other day.  And he's saying like, well, he's from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], so how can he compete with people from Stanford and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley].  And, you know, I told him, I said, well, you know, people from Stanford and Berkeley don't get hired just because they're from Stanford and Berkeley.  What they get hired for is that if you're a manager at applied, I mean at Analog Devices, and you're managing the area that's devoted to creating a business out of micro-electro mechanical machines, you wanna hire people who have worked for the founder of that field or founders of that field, the known founders of the field, right.  You don't wanna hire like a double-E and hope that, you know, he goes and studies and learns what a micro-electrical mechanical machine is, system is.  You wanna hire somebody that knows about that.  And the founders of that field, you know, are at the Department of Computer, Electrical Engineering Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley.  You know that because you joined their industrial consortium so that you could have first pick of the people who get Ph.D.s from there, from the people who get master's degrees from there.  And that is what, that is why you have research faculty, so they can found new fields.  It doesn't just do to have and say, well, hey, the experts in this area are from Stanford.  The experts are here in (laughter) Stanford.  And so that's why you don't violate that because if they leave, you know, not only does their research grant go, whatever research dollars they bring in, but the ability of your students to get access to that new knowledge.  And, you know, that is why the tri--you know, that is why, that is one of the reasons why, the power curve is different.
Story_ID: 626444
Speaker 1: And so when I'm at, you know, FAMU [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], all of a sudden, I'm looking around and I have, we have all these people that come from North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina], that come into the administration with a different agenda.  You have all these people who had recently been fired from FAMU coming back in.  You have a new lobbyist come in who has this notion that earmarks are like an entitlement and wants to go back to saying, well, you haven't given us any money so you need to, you owe us kind of thing, doesn't seem to believe that, you know, the money is in science and doesn't follow up on, and is more interested in lobbying the state because, after all, we can get the appropriation from the state for FAMU kicked up.  That's gonna do more than getting these research dollars.  And so, you know, it became a very, I know, it was a difficult year.  They brought in a new vice president of audit and compliance that seemed to wanna do everything other than audit account things.  And we were still wrestling under the compliance agreement that NSF [National Science Foundation] had.  And, you know, so I decided, well, one day, you know, the president asked for my resignation.  He said he wanted to go in a different direction.  And I said, well, hey, I can just go back to the faculty, to the physics department and go there and teach and do research for a while.  But I just really, the thing is, is in that place, from the, you know, political perspective, you know, there was just no doing that.  You know, it seems like they wanted everybody out that was associated with the previous administration.  And then their emphasis changed.  So they decided in order to play to the mob to have a Hip Hop institute, and whatever, just saw our indirect costs, at least some of it, go into that, you know, faculty positions go into that, someone of questionable quality leading that.  And so, I sat down in the department for two years and I actually did some consulting work for Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida].  They wanted, and also toyed with the idea of taking a position over at Florida State because they wanted to build a light source.  And then, you know, offers started coming in.  Then my colleagues here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] in the physics department said they were looking for a chairman.  And so I decided to leave Tallahassee and come up this way.
Story_ID: 626445
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you've been here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] since 2010, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, January (unclear).
Speaker 1: 2010, yeah.  And what's your position here at--what is--
Speaker 2: I'm a professor and chair of physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, has your, has the emphasis changed for you in terms of, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, here it's more of a, I don't feel they're as advanced as FAMU [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], that's for sure.  One, FAMU had a lot more doctoral programs.  They had a doctoral program in physics.  And they, those, they didn't have, they had a lot faculty, and their faculty, largely, were tenure-track faculty, traditional faculty, didn't have a lot of researchers.  But because of my, you know, efforts as vice president of research, they have a lot of dollars, and it was invested the right way, at least I thought, you know, being a person--you know, I'm a scientist, and I'm driven by instrumentation.  And so they had a lot of instrumentation, and, in fact, they just fired up a plasma machine, a fusion machine at FAMU that we had used the earmark process to get funds for, the only HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] with a fusion machine on campus that's producing plasma, that they formed, you know, that forms a significant research program, internationally-recognized research program.  And they got hardly any press.  I mean they've gotten far more press for their, you know, for this hazing incident.  And you got folks, their own graduate, got their Ph.D. there, that we sent to Princeton [University, Princeton, New jersey] Applied, I mean Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, again, one of the holy temples of physics in this country, internationally recognized.  After two and a half years, he comes back, and he's on the faculty there.  We have a woman scientist who had been at Brookhaven National Lab [Upton, New York] that left there, worked at West Point [Academy], that we managed to attract to Tallahassee, is doing significant work, well, for people in physics trying to figure out if axions exist.  But, you know, doing what a university professor is supposed to do.  Again, no press.  And we have the laser work still going on, looking for improvised explosive devices now instead of nuclear materials, and also being able to use laser-sensing to evaluate the healthiness of crops over large areas.  But again, and, you know, that is completely lost and it is seriously endangered because science here is a very competitive business.  And you got to stay at it, and you got to get people to meetings.  They got to have the visibility or they won't stay funded.  And, you know, here, we're in more of a building phase than I would like.  And, again, a lot of the problems are the same.  There're certain things that I've done here that, again, get no recognition, but we've hired a vice president of research who will significantly advance the visibility of the research enterprise here by their, on the basis of their reputation.  And so I'm hoping that we can work with them, work with him, and do some of the same things that I did at FAMU and more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626446
Speaker 1: And, you know, there, I mean there are some challenges because this has not been a place where science, science is at HBCUs and maybe other places, is feared, science and engineering because, again, it's very threatening because given the opportunity, a real scientist can fund their work and provide treasure to the university.  And, you know, that's somewhat contrary to the tradition of HBCUs.  I mean you could read this book by [Kenneth] Manning, 'The Black Apollo of Science'.  And, largely, the struggles that [Ernest] Everett Just [African American biologist] went through with Mordecai Johnson [first black president of Howard University] still happens on a different level.  You know, so for, you know, for example, on, even the simplest things people would like to assert that, you know, that they should be, you know, that science shouldn't be emphasized, that they make as much a contribution in liberal arts and community health and community health, their work there saves lives (laughter).  And we should emphasize this to the state of Maryland (laughter), and they'll give us more treasure.  And I'm welcome to let that guy make his case.  And now, there's a lot of emphasis on coming up with ways to enhance the gaming industry (laughter).  And I can only think about the boys in Bologna or wherever in Italy when they were figuring out what a university should be (laughter).  You know, it's like, what can I do in physics to enhance the gaming industry?  You know, I got out of the gaming industry when they said you couldn't count cards anymore (laughter).  And I'm sitting around there trying to figure out--I don't know if you ever looked at these Paong Gao [ph.]--do you ever go to the gambling casino like--
Speaker 2: I've been, been towed along in 'em, but not really--
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was, some time along the line, I guess the people in Asia have like the gambling gene.  So a lot of table games in Las Vegas [Nevada] are these Paong Guo, they play with these tiles, right.  And they got more of those tables than they've got blackjack tables.  Yeah, I was trying to figure out, well, see if we can count these things (laughter), 'cause they got these tiles, and they got these, you know, it's not that many--it's not like they've got fifty-two cards that are six decks deep, you know.  Okay, I can't--actually, I think I can count those too, but that's a different story.  But, you know, that's the thing now, since, right now, in front of the Maryland State, there's SB-1, which is, you know, how to make, how to deal with taking, leveraging the opportunities formed by the gaming industry.
Story_ID: 626447
Speaker 1: That kind of leads to a question we always ask and that's, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a lot of concerns.  One is, you know, competitiveness, is that it is a global market place.  And it is very competitive.  One is, and the other is, my other concern is lack of hard skills in engineering, science, construction and other things.  And a lot, and a lack of emphasis on development of hard skills.  And one of the hard, I mean the first hard skill that I would emphasize, outside of science, is writing.  And I don't mean writing like your, you know, great novel or work of fiction, just to be able to write compelling reports that display, that are able to transmit thoughts and ideas and critique thoughts and ideas like in government.  That's one skill that I fear from reading the lab reports that our students put in, and just the real inability to convey a simply--clearly and succinctly, an idea.
Speaker 1: So, you've got to be able to do that, don't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, the emphasis is on being able to do it verbally, okay.  And, you know, that doesn't work.  And the other thing is, is the, you know, I'm kind of torn, you know, one of the concerns is this idea that a lot of students have, particularly, male ones, that they don't wanna work for anybody.  And, you know, that can be a goal, but that can't be a goal in and of itself because you do need resources to be able to do things, okay.  You do need to have access to discretionary resources to be able to do anything.  And the students have a totally unrealistic view of what it means to be self employer, particularly as a value, because it's gonna still be a very, first of all, it's a very difficult life.  And also, it's not as fulfilling as you might think.  And I see a lot of that there.  Yeah, there is, you know, children, I mean students at this age aiming low.  So I've had students, well, both here and FAMU [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], that say well, it's not, you know, they'll come in and they'll want me to change a grade on an exam because, well, it's not like I'm going, planning on going to Harvard [University] or MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And (laughter), you know, that's what I see as a really grave concern.  And a lot of that is, you know, that, well, it's not about going to Harvard or MIT.  Even if you decide that you wanna be, that the only job you qualify for is as a technician at Aberdeen Proving Grounds [U.S. Army facility, Aberdeen, Maryland], right, the point is there are technicians at Aberdeen who started there, had their whole careers there and retired from there and had a good life.  I mean that was one of the jokes at LBL [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, California] was, is that all the Texan things, they're the ones that had all the toys because, you know, they'd have like, you know, they'd have like classic cars or muscle cars.  They'd have airplanes, (laughter), they'd have sailboats (laughter) and powerboats.  Now, they might not have a house, but they'd have those, and RV's.  And, you know, there's a lot of scientists, if they weren't married, they were still living like they were graduate students (laughter), you know.  You know, so the thing is, is that, you know, you can--the point is, you know, you should, this is a point, you know, when you're in school, this is a time of discovery.  And one of the things you should discover is that there're many ways to live out your life that don't necessarily require you to be self employed or not working for anybody.  And, you know, there's lot of ways to be unhappy when you're working for anybody.  And that's what I fear that, you know, happens, you know, in our community, you know, very high-level dependence on state, well, city, state and local governments and where the budget ax goes there.  And it's, you know, real, you know, it's a real tough place.  And I guess I also fear that I don't see a lot of real leadership around or people willing to make tough decisions.  I mean one of the toughest decisions here is like, when is someone gonna really benefit from the education here?  And are we doing our students a service 'cause they're going into debt.  They're, you know, one concern I've had as of late is the number of engineering students who are taking physics for the third and fourth time, introductory, calculus-based physics.  And, you know, the question is, is it realistic to expect to be an engineer after taking, if you can't get through physics.  And, you know, so that's a real concern 'cause if you look at the resources that we put forth so our students can have the luxury of taking physics three or four times.  And that could be a faculty member working on a research project, developing new technology or new science or even new forms of dance movements, you know, what we were signed up to do.  And there seems to be no one willing to make that cut.
Speaker 1: Um--
Speaker 2: Well, there is one person willing to make a cut.  But (laughter) no one wants to empower him (laughter).

Speaker 1: This is another question we always ask, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to have said a fusion program at FAMU [Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida] and the laser program there, but I don't know that's gonna be much of a legacy the way things are going.  And the same thing with NSBP [National Society of Black Physicists] because upon my departure as president, the place, the organization has gone down considerably.  So I guess, one of my disappointments is the inability to generate a lasting legacy, something that's gonna, you know, endure, you know, much longer, is my greatest disappointment.  I can, the only thing I can say is that while I'm here, you know, my legacy is that, one that the department--well, one thing I'd like to see is that the department of physics take its proper place, moreover, that science take its proper place here at Morgan.  And if I can put an end to what I view as this vocationalization of science and to really get a, develop a cadre of students who decide that they are, for good or bad, going to make their profession in science and move on into the, whatever the next step is.  You know, maybe that'll be my legacy, but that's still a work in progress 'cause it's a, you know, it's a tough, you know, science is a tough sell.  That's why it's been cloistered for so long.
Story_ID: 626449
Speaker 1: All right, likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there, again, is there any major thing you'd do differently, if you could, something you would change?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I don't know.  Sometimes I think I should have stayed at Berkeley [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, California], but that's water under the bridge.  There was an opportunity to go to the National Science Foundation [NSF] as opposed to coming here to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] to work in the division of materials research.  And sometimes I think I would have been better off there 'cause visibility would have been a lot higher.  I could then, you know, see my comments in 'Science' magazine, like, I mean 'cause that was one of the things, nice about being at Berkeley, you'd get calls from the, particularly, the EUV [extreme ultra-violet] program, you know, you'd get calls from the 'Wall Street Journal', well, is this a form of corporate welfare?  Is this a, are the corporations raiding the public trust? (Laughter)  And you so you'd get sound bites in there.  But I don't know.  I think, you know, largely, I mean I'd have to go way back and think about, you know, maybe I should have just stayed in the semiconductor industry and really got more involved in, you know, industrial style research and setting up factories to build semiconductors.  Sometimes I have, like just yesterday, I realized that from playing around with light-emitting diodes, these light bulbs for my sailboat, that the Chinese manufacture 32 percent of all LEDs [light-emitting diodes] in the world.  And they built 3,000 fabrication facilities, factories, just to make LEDs for light bulbs, and I think back, where people would say, well, you'll never use--one time I proposed the idea of using the LEDs as light bulbs, right, and I even, even, I think I've thrown it out though.  Remember, they used to have these overhead things.  I had a overhead once saying that this quantum and mechanics and LEDs is gonna replace Maxwell's equations and the incandescent bulb.  And, you know, the incandescent bulb, to make is about a penny.  And at that time, the LED was like a couple thousand (laughter).  And, now, you know, twenty years later that's gonna be true.  Pretty soon, these guys are gonna outlaw these incandescent things.  And then General Electric and other folks will start buying up LEDs from the Chinese, maybe, if they're not too greedy, we'll start building factories ourselves.  And the cost of 'em will be next to nothing.  So everybody can make the money, and they're, you know, very efficient.  And a lot of the technology I worked with at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia] is what they use, metal organic chemical vapor deposition to build LEDs.  We have two reactors like that at Howard when I was there.  And so, in some cases, you know, I wish I had been more involved with that so I'd get the call and say, well, we wanna build a factory.  Can you consult and put this up?  Where do we get the tools at?  Where do we get the pumps at?  Who makes the best tools?  Who makes the best pumps?  What should the process look like?  Who are the best suppliers?  You know, the real industrial-type stuff.  So instead of dealing with, you know, literal research quantities, when I say I wanna have chemicals, I order, you know, I can say well, we gotta build, we got to build the factory close to a rail line so that when you order chemicals that they have, you know, train cars full of 'em.  Again, something on a scale.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's the thing that I guess I find most distressing is, is that students don't, here, don't really strive to gain the skills that allow them to attack problems with skill and that if you're really concerned about the money in engineering, the money in engineering is the ability to engineer a factory or to have a, carry enough knowledge in your head, as I said, to build a major industrial enterprise.

Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us something about your family.  I know your, your mother [Gloria Ann Jackson] passed away long ago when you were--
Speaker 2: No, my father [Russell Hunter Jackson] passed away--
Speaker 1: Your father, yeah.  Is your mother still alive?
Speaker 2: No, she passed away two years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so your father died in child, when you were about ten or so.
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: Four, okay, that's even younger.  So, well, tell us about your family.  You have daughters you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my son is, he's starting his third year--is it third or second year?  I think it's his third year of medical school.  He's at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles], Keck School of Medicine.  And he aspires to be a doctor.  He hasn't decided what kind yet.  My son graduated from Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] with a degree in chemistry and spent some time off, but now he's in medical school and well on his way.  My daughter got her undergraduate degree from Stanford University [Palo Alto, California] in economics, and she's worked as a consultant for two years and then went and got her MBA [Master's in Business Administration] from Columbia University [New York], worked at McKinsey [consulting firm] for two years and is now senior manager at Direct TV in Los Angeles.  So they both relocated to the West Coast.  And I've been thinking lately, maybe that's probably--it depends upon where they are, that probably will dictate where I retire, though I must admit, I went over to the Eastern shore and looked at some property over there, thought about, you know, maybe--well, you know, the trouble with this real estate thing, since I got houses in--you know, every place I've worked, I've left a house.  So I still have a house in Berkley and one in Tallahassee.  And, you know, I haven't been, fooled once (laughter), I don't know that I wanna buy any more real estate.  But I must admit the Eastern shore does look interesting.  But my children, they're doing, you know, better, they're doing quite well.  They've gotten, they're very independent.  So I can't, I can say that I'm pleased.  But I do, would like to, you know, I do feel that I need to be closer to 'em.  I haven't seen my daughter in about a year.  So I need to get back out to California and visit them.
Story_ID: 626451
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: [Pause] Not that I can think of, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered as, you know, an African American physicist, who's made fundamental contributions or at least some contributions to science and technology, and I'd also like to be remembered for spreading information about how science is practiced in the United States and the exact detail, and that, you know, it's not as--though it is difficult and it is a rigorous and arduous course of study, anything that anybody is passionate about, they're expected to delve into deeply.  And the thing I wish the most, I would like to be, at some point in time, recognized as an advocate for science in the African American community.  And I guess I would include engineering for that, though my views of engineering differ somewhat from the people, other, the people in the School of Engineering (laughter).  You know, 'cause I'm an engineer, I mean I'm the kind of person that likes, I'm the kind of person that changes the oil in his car (laughter).  It's hard for me to believe that you're gonna be an engineer (laughter) and can't change the oil in your car or can't program.  So.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Sure.
