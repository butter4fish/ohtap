So if you just want to go through and have you state your  name for the tape and tell me when and where you were born.  I   m Lois Lorena Harryman Golay. I was born September the 27, 1929. I was  born in Cimarron County on the north west corner of NW   -19-5-9.  You got it down pretty tight there where you were born.  I   m Margie Harryman Williams, I was born June 16, 1917 and I was born in  Cimarron County on SW 17-5-9.  I   m Geneva Harryman Williams and I was born 11  November  29 of 23, at  the Northwest corner of NW   -19-5-9.  You need to say your name, who you are and where you were born, and when  you were born.  Just say my name? Mary Lorena Harryman.  Okay, when were you born?  Montague Texas.  Okay, when?  1895.  What day?  Well I couldn   t     October the 11th.  5  Harryman  M. Williams  Kite  Golay  G. Williams  Kite  Lemons  G. Williams  Kite  Golay  G. Williams  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Well yes.  1895.  All right, and we   re trying to concentrate on the dustbowl period, the dirty  thirties they were called and the different effects that the dust storms had on  your lives. Maybe it changed your life or just the different aspects of that  period so were you all raised in a farming community, like a farming lifestyle,  working on the farm so on so forth? What would a typical day have been like  for you all growing up in the late 20   s and early 30   s?  Milk cows and separate the milk, wash dishes with lye soap.  We herded cows all day, I did.  A lot of herding going on there? (Laughs)  Did you have a lot of cattle?  Well all the way from 50 to 60-some or more.  How many milk cows?  Well whenever I was growing up it was generally around 18 to 20; now I don   t  know about the other girls.  But see we didn   t have fences then and so you   d take the cows out in mornings  and watch them and bring them back in for water or bring them back in the  evenings if there wasn   t water somewhere for them to water on while they  were out.  Open range, they just able to range wherever. How would you collect them  back in then again?  You didn   t get very far from them. We had to wash clothes on the scrub board.  Carry in the water and heat it with the kerosene stove.  You mentioned lye soap was that, did you make that yourself?  Mamma made it, Mamma made lye soap.  How long did you make lye soap for how long, was that something you learned  as a child or?  How long did you make lye soap?  How long?  All your life or?  6  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Lemons  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  Lemons  Golay  Lemons  Golay  I don   t know how long I just, ever since I   ve been old enough to work with  something like that.  Was it a hard job to do, making the soap?  Was it hard to do?  No it wasn   t hard for me to do anyway. (Laughs)  I   ve never known anybody that   s made their own soap.  They have a piece.  This is a piece of the soap?  Yeah, that she made.  You recognize that?  What is that?  That   s lye soap.  That   s your soap. (Laughter)  And that   s what you   d do all your washing with. How was it for getting     That   s what we did then, and whenever you washed the milk containers with  lye soap it was slick and slimy; it was not easy done.  How was lye soap for getting out stains? Was it a good?  It was good, very good.  All right, another thing we always talk about is things that you did growing up  for entertainment, for fun, what games you played or what toys you remember  as children or anything, activities, dances or what not growing up?  We made a lot of our toys.  What kind of toys would you make?  Well we made slingshots out of trees limbs and the sling part we would use  worn out tires   tubes out of the tires then.  What were you aiming at with your slingshot? I hope not each other.  (Laughter)  Generally at the barn or something, it could also be to each other. (Laughter)  7  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Golay  M. Williams  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  We cut paper dolls from catalogs and we cut out the people and we cut out  dresses and put on the dolls.  We had the old iron parts off of iron wheels and we would take that and then  have a long stick and you had an end on it and you   d roll that iron wheel  around, and of course we always played,    Annie Over    we called it, ball.  Could you describe how that was played, Annie Over?  There   d be so many on one side of the house, you chose up sides, and so many  on the other side of the house, and you   d throw it over and if they caught it and  could come around and catch you, then you were on their side. If they didn   t  catch it they had to throw it back over.  Right, you try to hit each other with the ball or would you chase them down  or?  You always tried to touch them when you came back around. If you caught the  ball and you came around you tried to touch one of them and that way they  would be on your side then, so you could have the most then when you ended  up.  Did you have any remembrances of ah games or entertainment that her  daughters played in during that period?  During the dust bowl what did you do for entertainment?  Well we played what we called games. We   d play, dance, and things like that.  You went to dances? Is that right?  Kinda like parties.  They called them party games then.  Party games, but it was kinda like square dance is now.  So was square dancing her favorite dance?  I don   t think that she would call it square dancing it was like party games.  Right, I understand the difference more. Anything else you could remember?  Like you were telling me the other day about a lot of family, neighbors  gathering together to visit.  They would generally bring their dinner and we   d all just   the neighbors  would get together and visit and have dinner together.  8  Lemons  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  M.

Different kinds of meat.  Different kinds of food?  Oh, well just what we had to eat like, oh, I don   t know, just different things,  mostly beans and things that way.  What kind of meat?  Well it was mostly hog meat.  We had fried chicken.  Yes, fried chicken.  Pumpkin pie?  What kind of desert?  Mostly watermelon. Watermelon rind preserves.  Oh, like watermelon rind pickles?  No, preserves, you make it into a jelly.  Oh wow, so is she a good watermelon seed spitter?  Could you spit watermelon seeds quite a ways?  Oh we   d just take a fork or a spoon and rake the seeds out. (Laughter)  Yeah I bet she was a big spitter.  We had a lot of box suppers.  How would that work?  Oh it   d be kinda like a sandwich. You   d decorate a box and have the  sandwiches.  We   d have spitting contests and get the seeds in our mouth and each one of us  would see which one of us could spit the seeds the farthest.  How far could you spit them?  9  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Harryman  Kite  Golay  G. Williams  Golay  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  Kite  Lemons  G. Williams  M. Williams  Golay  Kite  Lemons  Golay  How far could you spit?  Oh, not very far. (Laughter)  I thought I could see the watermelon seed spitter in there somewhere.  (Laughter) Ok, and the box dinners you   d meet at somebody   s house or a  place?  The boys could spit the seeds quite a ways.  Yeah they would win.  We   d join together at the schoolhouse and everybody   d decorate their own box  and the men wouldn   t know who   s box they were buying.  Then they   d auction them off.  Then they   d auction them off and the same way at the pie suppers. We   d make  a pie and whoever bought our pie, well we   d get to eat with the man that  bought it. (Laughs)  How much would the box dinners or the pies go for, how much would like a  typical one be?  Well in those times they   d come 50 cents or 75 cents, why that   s quite a bit.  Yeah, I never heard about that pie or dinner auction.  Box supper.  Yeah, so how would you decorate your boxes?  Yeah what kind of things would you use to decorate them?  Cr  pe paper or crayons or anything we had why we   d just decorate them. Is  that what you remember?  Yeah that   s what I remember, especially cr  pe paper.  Especially the boxes bought for it, if it happened to be that there was two that  was dating why then the other guys would bid against him.  Whoa, that sounds kid of ornery  (Laughter) That   s interesting that box dinner.  How often would they do that was it like an annual thing or two or three times  a month or how often?  Once every month or so.  10  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Golay  M. Williams  Harryman  It was two or three times a year anyway you know it was a money making  project for the school.  For the school, would raise money for things it was doing?  Funds it needed.  Like for 4-H or something like that?  I don   t know if they had 4-H at my time.  Yeah I didn   t know.  Some of it was to make money enough to have treats at Christmas time at the  school too, wasn   t it? Buy candy and fruit and things.  And you mentioned, when you were telling where you were born, you got  pretty specific with the township and the range and all of that. Where is that  located in relation to where we stand here?  Six miles north and six east of here.  And does the family still own that land? And the house, is the house still out  there?  Yes.  Were all of you born in the house?  Now where I was  born , there   s no house there right now, but where Geneva  and Lois were there   s a house, the house is still there  That   s where Geneva and I was born and all that.  Did she live in a dug out initially when she came to here or?  At one point they lived in a dugout house, but maybe not in the 30   s.  Right I was just kinda trying to follow her history.  I see, at some point they did but I   m not sure when and where.  Yeah, they lived in the dugout whenever they first come here.  When in your life did you live in a dugout, was it right after you moved to  Oklahoma or was it after you got married?  Well it was more after when I got married, we lived in a dugout.  11  M. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Lemons  M. Williams  Kite  Golay  G. Williams  Golay  M. Williams  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  I   m not sure.  I kind of forgot that question early on, I should have asked it earlier. All right  do you remember the first time you saw the dust storm coming in or what they  call a    duster    approaching your place? Do you remember the first time?  It was a dark, a big dark rolling cloud coming from the north and it wasn   t  snow, it was dirt.  Is that what you remember seeing, all of you the same image?  Yeah it was more the darkness, the cloud coming in, and it got so dark,  sometimes you couldn   t see your hand.  Yeah, and you would have been a little older when the first ones came through.  Yeah.  What was your feeling or what do you remember thinking or feeling when you  saw it?  Well I don   t know I can   t really say that     You didn   t think it was scary?  It was just something that had happened. (Laughs)  What about the younger kids, did you remember feeling afraid or running to  the cellar or hiding under a bed?  Well we didn   t have a cellar at the time I remember, did you?  We didn   t have a cellar.  I knew that it was time to get the cows in and get them corralled and we had to  get the chickens in to the hen houses.  Getting the cows in was pretty important.  So you could see them coming in time to start getting things prepared?  Most of the time; sometimes not.  What about your first memories of the first dust storm you saw coming in?  Do you remember the very first time you saw a dust storm? What was it like?  No, I don   t remember the first time because we had so many, it was different  at times. Now sometimes it   d come up in a real black cloud and then other  12  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Harryman  Lemons  M. Williams  Harryman  G. Williams  times it would come up in a yellow cloud. Now what the difference was, I  don   t know, because it was in the same ground and all, but I know there   d be  different ones. Sometime they   d come up in a black cloud and other times  they   d come up in a yellow cloud.  Were you afraid when you saw them?  Well some of them I was afraid of because they were sure vicious looking,  looked more like a cyclone coming or something like that.  What would you do to prepare when you saw them coming?  When you   d see those black clouds rolling in what did you do?  Well we generally got a wet cloth and we   d brush it before our mouths, of  course you all were babies and I   d hold one of you and brush a wet cloth over  your mouth so that you wouldn   t choke, breathe so much of the dirt because  the dirt blew black.  Like before the clouds whenever you   d see them in the distance     Yes.  Okay, then what would you do to prepare ahead of time?  Well mostly get our wet cloth ready and things. And we   d grab at least the  smallest ones of you up, we   d just brush the wet cloth across your face that  way, and you can imagine sometimes what your face looked like.  Did they get black?  It   d get dirty  (Laughter)  Did you put clothes over the windows and doors?  Yes, we did.  Did it work, did it keep the dust out?  Wet cloth.  No. (Laughs)  Did it help to keep the dust out?  It helped but it didn   t keep it out.  I   ve often thought that I don   t know how the folks made it because I woke up  many a night with     13  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  And you could write your name on the dirt or dust on the table and sometimes  I   d wipe the table off two or three times before we could eat on it.  How did you keep dust out of your food?  How did you keep the dirt out of the food?  Well we didn   t keep it all out, but (Laughter) we just did the best we could do.  A lot of times well I know I would sit and hold the smallest ones of you  children and fan a wet cloth over your face to keep the dirt out of your lungs.  You got a lot of extra minerals.  That   s what I was saying, I remember very well waking up in the night and  Momma and Daddy going through the house and flopping wet rags in the  middle of the night.  Trying to keep the dust down?  Oh for us kids, you know.  Do you remember waking up in the middle of dust storms like that with dust in  your mouth and dust all over?  Yeah there was dust everywhere, but I don   t see how the folks held up. They  were up some nights, a big part of the night, flopping those wet rags so we  could breathe.  Did your life change when the drought hit and the dust came. Did your chores  change or did you spend more time with a shovel than a bucket? What changes  were brought about in your life of the change in the weather?  There was a lot less food.  You remember a decrease in what you had to eat?  Yes.  I said I think the first that I realized that we was maybe hard up was when  Daddy quite bringing candy bars home from town and brought us all these  suckers. I guess that   s a funny idea but that   s when it struck me.  What was your favorite candy bar?  Hershey bar is about all I can remember then.  With or without nuts?  I don   t remember if we had nuts then. (Laughs)  14  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Golay  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Lemons  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  Golay  Then you remember it switching from a candy bar to suckers?  Yes, and that   s when I decided that we was hard up.  Yeah, and food on the table changed, maybe the dinner time changed?  Yes.  Could you maybe ask her how her dinner or food changed because of the  drought and Depression?  During the Depression and the drought and the dust bowl days did we have  less to eat? We didn   t have very many crops, how did it affect the amount of  food that we had?  Well we had chickens and had prairie chickens too.  Do you think that because of the drought and the Depression, did we have  less? Do you think that we had less to eat?  Well I don   t know whether we had less to eat but we had food that wasn   t as  nourishing and didn   t taste as good.  Like for example?  Like what, more beans?  Yes, beans was our main food.  Corn meal.  A lot of cornbread?  Well no, I don   t know that we had much more cornbread than we had light  bread.  Had a lot of light bread and biscuits.  Mush, corn mush?  Was that a typical breakfast or?  Ground wheat. We ground our wheat with a coffee grinder.  And make it into a mush-type meal and that   s what you had for breakfast? All  right, and what about like your clothes and do you remember material  possessions changing. I mean did you get less clothes or shoes or things?  We had one pair of shoes, when you went to the cow lot to milk, you   d come  15  Lemons  Golay  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  Lemons  Kite  G. Williams  Golay  Kite  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  in and wash your shoes off before you   d go to school and then our dresses  were made out of feed sacks. So were our bloomers.  Did you have a favorite pattern? People have said and stuff we   ve read about  different sacks had different patterns on them and there   s one person they  talked about they like the one with the ducks. Did you have a favorite pattern  in your feed sack dresses, one that you really liked?  I didn   t. (Laughs) I wasn   t real proud of them.  Did you feel wearing feed sack dresses, you were kind of embarrassed to wear  those to school or wear those out?  Guess it didn   t bother me. I said it didn   t bother me, but now my 8th grade  graduation dress was a feed sack dress and I was just glad to have a new dress  to wear to graduation.  What about you? Your wearing the feed sack dresses, did that bother you at  all? Was it something that     Well I think it did cause I felt like there was some of my friends maybe that  didn   t have to wear them, that was kind of the way it happened.  Could you tell they were feed sack dresses? I mean could you tell from the  pattern or from the way they looked that they were?  A lot of them were just plain. I mean, just didn   t even have a design on them.  What story did we hear, about the lady walking out of the house and you could  read the back of the feed company across it.  Right.  You could see it was just the funniest thing she   s just walking around it said  like    Anderson Grain    or something across it.  No that all washed out.  Sometimes.  It apparently didn   t all of the time. (Laughs)  Did you ever think about leaving the area because of the dust bowl?  Did you ever think of leaving? When the dirt was blowing did you and Daddy  ever think about picking up and leaving the country, going to California?  We didn   t have money to leave on  (Laughter) Elwood and Ruth had money  enough and they left and went to California, but we didn   t have very much  16  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  G. Williams  Golay  G. Williams  Golay  Kite  money.  What would you do to make money when you couldn   t raise crops and the  cattle were dying? How did you survive I guess?  What did Daddy do to support the family?  He just farmed. He was just doing what he could do.  Was there a government program called the WPA that came in and they built  roads and     Yes, he worked on that.  When he worked, what did he do with the WPA?  What all did they do, do you remember?  Well a lot of it was road work.  Bridges, building bridges?  Bridges and then the dirt work too.  Ask her if she thinks Franklin Roosevelt was a good president?  Do you remember Franklin Roosevelt when he was president?  I just remember the name.  Do you think he was a good president?  I never have even thought about it. We just took them as they came. (Laughter)  Do you guys remember friends or families around you leaving and loosing  friends or loosing neighbors as they would leave?  Well like she said, Uncle Elwood did. There were different ones. The kin folks  out there I can   t remember, the families that moved out. I think they was kind  of like us, they just didn   t have the money to make the trip.  Well Vredella and Dick moved.  Yeah.  Cecil and Carlos moved to California and Hildred and Jim Hutcherson.  Do you remember ever wanting to move? Like thinking    Oh I wish we could  get out of here     Was that ever a thought?  17  Golay  Lemons  M. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Lemons  It wasn   t for me. I was too much of a    scaredy cat.    I was always afraid that  I   d sure enough starve to death if I had got out from under Mom and Daddy.  What about you?  Well I guess I just figured we had to stay and I didn   t even think about it other  than not moving.  If you don   t have a choice, it makes staying a lot easier to decide to do. Other  than the WPA do you remember any other types of community assistance or  help that the church or schools might have given to people? Were there clothes  drives?  The churches and the schools was having a hard time of even, a lot of the  churches didn   t have preachers because they didn   t have enough money.  When a dirt storm would come in, I would hold you and have a wet cloth and  fan it around over your face to keep the dirt off, out of your lungs. It didn   t  keep it off of your face by any means, but then I could keep it out of your  lungs by fanning it back and forth before your mouth.  So you were born smack dab in the middle of it? Ask her if she remembers  April 14, 1935, Black Sunday.  Do you remember what they call    Black Sunday?    It was in April in    35?  Thirty-five.  In 1935?  Well I remember how black it was, it was so black we couldn   t hardly see our  way home from church.  Did you drive in the dust anyhow, did you try?  Did you make it home ahead of the storm?  No we didn   t.  Where did you stay?  We didn   t stay, we just kept moving slowly along.  All right, we have a lot of people that talk about the different people, like  tramps or hobo   s that came through the area. Do you remember any of those  people?  You   re shaking your head yes.  18  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  G. Williams  Golay  Lemons  Golay  Lemons  Golay  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Was there a lot of Gypsy-type people, hobo   s, transient people that came  through?  No, not very many, at least not out here. Maybe there was closer to town  where they could get something to eat but out here we didn   t have anything  left after we had eaten, much less feed them.  If they came to the house and asked for food, did you feed them?  Well if we had it left to feed them, we did.  All right, you have recollections of people wandering through?  Yes.  Mom always fed them, she always found something to feed them. Sometimes  it was a scrambled egg sandwich.  Yeah, I don   t think she   d ever turn anyone away. Whenever we   d see a car up  on the hill late in the evening we   d know that our chicken house was gonna be  raided that night. When they were brave enough they would go ahead and cook  it right up there, filled their car and cook it. I guess they were hungry too.  Did you try to do anything to save the chickens?  No we just had them in the chicken house.  Do you remember any, besides what you   d think of as a common hobo or a  tramp, anything about gypsies coming through the area?  Well that   s what we called the gypsies, the one   s that was a car load of people  that would come and take things, take the animals or something.  Did you ever have to drive them off of the farm? You know, shoo them away?  I don   t remember but we were very careful. I know Daddy and Momma were  always very careful, tried to give them enough that they would go on.  Yeah, ask her if she remembers gypsies.  Do you recall any gypsies, like a car load of gypsy type people?  No I don   t.  Did anyone steal her chickens?  Do you remember people coming through and maybe stealing out of the hen  house, stealing chickens?  19  Harryman  Golay  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Lemons  G. Williams  Lemons  G. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Well they didn   t steal any of ours, but I don   t know about the neighbors.  They did get the neighbors.  Yeah, we had a lot of gypsy stories come out of this area out of the dust bowl.  Shelly says we don   t have to ask this question but I want to ask for it. Animal  signs, a lot of times people will say that animals could predict when storms  were coming and I was just interested if you guys had seen any had  remembered seeing any animal behavior?  They would always bunch up, the cattle would get real close to each other and  bunch up and the chickens especially the mother hens, they would have their  wings a flapping and have their little chicks under their wings.  You   d kind of be able to know that something was happening, something was  coming.  I know some of the cattle would kind of, I don   t know the way they cocked  their head when they   d see that cloud or I guess maybe they just knew.  They knew something was coming.  That something was happening.  Did you have any family pets when you were little?  We had a dog. We had a coyote at one time.  As a pet? Huh. Did you have a name for him?  I don   t remember that but I remember we had a coyote until he began to nab at  us and so the folks got rid of him.  Ask her if she remembers the coyote.  Do you remember when we had a coyote that was real tame that hung around  the house a lot?  No I don   t.  I remember my daddy bringing in rabbits, little rabbits, just little ones and us  kids would have them awhile. They didn   t generally live too long but he would  bring in some from the field every once in awhile.  Do you think the dust bowl affected you after it was over? Did you have  recollections about it or did you fear it coming back or did you have anxieties  about that happening again at all?  We had another, in the 50   s we had a Black Sunday, it wasn   t as long as the  20  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite     35 one, but we had a Black Sunday in the 50   s, even on a Sunday afternoon.  Sunday afternoon.  Yeah, cause Charles had a nephew and his wife from Washington was coming  through, he was stationed in Florida and they came through and we were over  at Charles    sister   s eating. We went home that night and his nephew and his  wife went home with. His nephew took the scoop and helped him scoop the  dirt out of the house so we could all go to bed and I know Ron told Charles he  said    Well I feel sorry for you folks,    but he said    if you was gonna have it  I   m glad you had it while I was here because I never thought I   d get to see  one.    Of course it wasn   t like the    35 dark Sunday was but it was a black  Sunday; it came in about four o   clock.  And you scooped the dirt out of the house?  Yep.  Did you have nightmares about the dustbowl at all when you were kids, when  you were little, did it affect you that way?  I don   t remember. (Laughs)  I don   t remember now, whenever it happened again in the 50   s I kinda had a  fear or something that it would get as bad as it was in the 30   s. But now as far  as in the 30   s I can   t remember.  Right. Do you want to ask her if she had any reoccurring nightmares about the  dust storm or something like that?  Did you ever have bad dreams or nightmares about the dirt storms?  I didn   t, other people may have, but I didn   t.  All right.  Did you think it was just, like it was just gonna happen and you didn   t have  any control over it?  Yes, when we   d see a cloud coming up, we would watch it to see if it was  really a dirt storm or whether it was a cyclone.  Cyclone?  Cyclone?  Yes, cyclone.  Did the dust bowl change the way that you farmed?  21  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Did the dust bowl, did the dirt storms change how Daddy farmed?  Did it change, I don   t     Did he change his ways after that?  Did he get better machinery? Did he terrace a little better maybe?  Yes, he learned more how to do things, how to farm and things like that.  Do you think that   ll prevent another dust bowl?  Do you think that we will ever see another dust bowl?  I don   t think so because we have the machinery now that we didn   t have then  to keep it down, cultivate it and keep it down. We didn   t have machinery then  enough to do the cultivating to keep the dirt down then, but we have the  machinery now and we can go in and cultivate it and that helps to keep it  down.  Ask what does she think caused the dust bowl. I think it   s a pretty standard  answer but just go ahead.  What do you think caused the dust bowl. What do you think caused all those  black dirt storms?  Well I don   t know what caused it but I just know it was bad storms. Dirt just  rolled in, just in big rolls, sometimes it   d be black, and of course I guess that  was a different in the land, and sometimes it would be yellow, but we   d know  when that began to get colors, different colors that way that we would have a  dust storm.  Do you think it was partly because we didn   t have irrigation, lack of water?  Yes, I think it was.  Maybe we farmed more, now we have a lot more grassland.  Yeah.  Because a lot of this land should of never been broke up in this area.  A lot of it marginal, they call it sometimes, marginal/sub marginal land plowed  up.  Yeah, there was a lot of here that really wasn   t land that should have been  plowed up. It should have stayed in grass, and of course it   s been put back to  grass now. I think that   s the reason that we don   t have the dirt storms right  now.  22  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  Golay  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  When do you remember good times coming back? Do you remember a specific  event like the candy bars being changed to suckers, do you remember  something that brings to your mind, like things were picking up again or you  were doing all right again. Do you remember anything that brings to mind that  turn of events?  Well when we began to have more rain and we had more crops then and it was  right after the war time when things really began to pick up.  Do you remember the first rain you felt after a long time, do you remember  like when it started to really rain after a long period of drought?  I don   t know. (Laughs)  I just can   t imagine having it not rain you know for 6, 7, 8, 9 months and then  having it rain again.  Well it   s surely a down pour rain and I can remember the half mile south that  we had a big draw and it would fill up and we could hear the frogs croaking.  It   s something we all wanted to go down and see, the water rolling down that.  Does she remember the rain? The first rains that came after a big drought.  Do you remember when it started raining again and when the drought was  over? Do you remember when things started getting better?  Well I can   t remember the dates but I remember when things began to get  better.  What specifically do you remember mostly about it? Was there more rain, was  there     Well, a day when the dust blew, it blew and you just didn   t see things like the  clouds, the clouds would just come in blowing black sometimes.  But then whenever it started getting better?  Whenever it started getting better, the clouds wasn   t as dark.  Ask her if she ever danced in the rain.  When it was raining, like right after the dirt storms and it started getting better,  did you ever get out and dance in the rain?  No. No, I didn   t want the dirt loaded on me. (Laughter)  All right, kind of as a wrap up question sometimes we just ask people, what   s  their most vivid memory of the 30   s, something that to them maybe  characterizes that period.  23  Lemons  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  M. Williams  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Yeah, if someone says,    the dust bowl    to you, what   s the first thing that you  think of from you life?  We   ve had all kinds of answers. (Laughter)  Well I learned to be very saving and appreciate the environment, our  environment.  Do you think that attitude of saving has affected your life all the way down to  today?  Yes, I see myself a lot of times kind of like Momma, (Laughs) a little too  saving like her.  I still think that   s what has affected me is maybe being too saving, I don   t  know whether that   s it or whether that would have been otherwise.  You have that panicky feeling back there that that could happen again even  though we feel like we   re not going to but you just think,    I   d better not get  this today,    because something could happen.  Yeah, you always are thinking about what could happen.  Because when you   ve been through it when you were younger it stays with  you.  So thrift and economy are good lessons you learned?  Yes.  You want to ask her the same thing?  When someone talks, when someone says,    the dust bowl   , what   s the very  first thing that you think about?  Black dirt rolling in and big, it just rolled in, in big clouds, just kinda rolling  in.  Is that her most vivid memory of the dust bowl?  Is that your most vivid memory about it?  Yes, I believe it was because it was really just kinda rolling, the dirt was just  kinda rolling in.  How many days would it last?  Well sometimes it wouldn   t last all day and then sometimes it lasted two days.  24  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Golay  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Lemons  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Sometimes longer?  Yes.  Then would you have to scoop the house out, scoop the dirt out of the house?  Yes, there were times we took the shovel and shoveled it out because it got so  thick on the floor.  Did you ever get the doors trapped, did you ever get stuck in the house, dirt  piled up onto the doors?  I think Daddy was always very careful about trying to keep one door where he  could get out.  Did you ever get trapped in the house, did it ever get blown full of dirt to the  point where you couldn   t get out?  No, no we could get out.  All right so ask her if it changed the way she spent money, or did it change her  attitude towards money.  How did it affect your attitude toward money?  Well this was home and we took it as it come.  But did it make you more saving, more conservative?  Yes, yes it made us more saving because we had to save to have food enough  to eat.  Did it change the way she thought through the rest of her life, did it?  Does it affect you still today?  Well yes, I believe it does. (Laughter)  All right. Do you have anything else Shelly you   d like to ask?  No, I can   t think of anything else specifically. Is there anything that we didn   t  bring up that you wanted to share with us or that you think we should have  asked about?  Is there anything you need to add?  Well I can   t think of anything.  No, well I   m glad.  25  Kite  Lemons  Golay  Lemons  Golay  Lemons  M. Williams  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Golay  Kite  Golay  M. Williams  Kite  Lemons  M. Williams  G. Williams  Golay  Lemons  Golay  M. Williams  All right, well I guess that   s about it then.  Yeah, well thank you for talking with us today, we appreciate the time you guys  spent to do this.  Well we scooped down to the ceiling so the ceiling in our house would not fall  in.  Could you see it getting heavy?  Yeah.  I haven   t ever heard anyone tell me that.  Machinery had to be covered up.  The dirt is still up there, in the attic? Is that what you   re talking about?  Yeah, said they hadn   t cleaned it out.  Wow, yeah that   s the first time I   ve heard that.  Just take a shovel with a big barrel or bucket and they   d shovel it full and there  would be someone down below to take it out.  How much land did you guys farm, or did they farm, remember was it a  section or did you have sections.  328  acres .  Daddy owned 300  acres , Arthur said Daddy owned 320 acres and farmed  320 acres in the 30   s.  So whole sections, if he owned 320 and farmed it, yeah that   s a lot of land.  How many kids were in your family?  Six.  Seven.  There were six that   s alive, and there   s three that   s passed on.  So four girls and two boys or   ?  That   s alive.  One of the things you had in here was about the New Deal program, and my  brother was looking at this and he said that if these programs had not come in  26  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  G. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Kite  M. Williams  Harryman  M. Williams  Harryman  Kite  Lemons  probably at that particular time, we would have lost every thing.  Yeah since she mentioned the WPA and working on that, I thought that might.  So your brother then was very pro New Deal program?  Right.  Do you feel a lot of people in the area were for it? I know there   s some people  that did not like it but   ?  I don   t know, I think a lot of the farmers did, they would not have survived if it  hadn   t of been. I don   t know, what do you think? If it hadn   t been for the New  Deal programs to come in and help the farmers they would have probably lost  everything.  Do you remember being paid to kill livestock or to not farm land or to do  anything like that at all?  Daddy sold cattle and some of them were killed within our sight.  Yeah, and then some land was left unfarmed at different times?  Had some grass cattle and had to graze cattle.  Ask her how she felt about having to kill the livestock.  Do you remember at one point that Daddy had to sell off some of the cattle, or  that the government came in and bought some of the cattle and destroyed  them?  He had to destroy some of them, I remember very plain.  How did you feel about that?  Well I don   t know how I felt about it, but it was sad to see good cattle killed,  but we just didn   t have the food for them.  All right, I think I   m about questioned out here. I just want to say thank you  again for meeting us and for taking the time to help us out.  Yeah we appreciate it. It   s a big project for us.  -------  -------
