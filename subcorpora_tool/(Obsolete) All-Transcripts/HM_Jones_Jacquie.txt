Story_ID: 642205
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side separate from your father's [Humphrey Jones, Sr.] side.  And then we'll put them both together.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Claire, C-L-A-I-R-E.  And her legal name is Claire-hyphen-Clyde, C-L-Y-D-E.  Her middle name is also Michelle.  And her maiden name was Antoine, A-N-T-O-I-N-E [Claire Antoine Jones].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 4, 1942.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side, and what were they doing?  Are there any good stories?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.  Her father [Jacques Antoine] was from a political family.  His, he had been at one time the vice president of Haiti, and he became the U.S. ambassador from Haiti to the United States.  They were actually, he was the ambassador to the United States when the first Duvalier [Francois Duvalier] coup happened, which is why my mother grew up in Washington [D.C.] and not Haiti.  His family, I know was involved in politics for a long time. They were part of the, you know, that kind of mulatto class of people that was displaced by Duvalier.  But my grandfather was also very Pan Africanist and very, you know, sort of progressive, you know, as a black thinker.  So, I don't think he was kind of of the old mulatto class thing.  But that's, you know, that's all I really know about the Haitian side of my family.  My grandparents met in Washington.  My grandmother [Caroline Wickliffe Antoine] was a teacher at Bluefield State College in West Virginia [Bluefield, West Virginia].
Speaker 1: This is your father's--your mother's mother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is my mother's mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was working as a teacher at Bluefield State in West Virginia, and my grandfather was in Washington.  I'm not sure why.  And they met in Washington.  My grandmother's family I know a little bit more about. They're from California.  My grandmother was born in California in early 20th century.  She had one brother [Gustavus W. Wickliffe, Jr.].  Her father [Gustavus W. Wickliffe, Sr.] was an attorney who went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in the very late 19th century.  And her mother [Minnie Mitchell Wickliffe] had grown up in Oberlin, Ohio.  And then her--on her--on my grandmother's mother's side, they had originally been from around Danville, Virginia and northern North Carolina, and gone up to Ohio right after the Civil War.  On her father's side they were from Knoxville, around Knoxville, Tennessee.  And her father had been a--what do you call it--the druggist?  The pharmacist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pharmacist.
Speaker 2: --in Knoxville, Tennessee.  I don't know at what point--you know, I don't know at what point, like, slavery came--you know, into or out of the equation on either one, either side.  I mean I assume the Danville, Virginia people were first generation; had been born in slavery, and became free.  I mean, that's my assumption just based on the dates, but I don't really know.
Speaker 1: So, there are no stories passed down in the family about slavery, or--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the stories are all like from my grandmother's grandparents, and they were all free.  But that would have been in the 1860s.  So, everybody was free.
Story_ID: 642206
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories on your [maternal] grandfather's [Jacques Antoine] side of the Haitian Revolution, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I don't have any stories of the Haitian Revolution, no.  I know that his, his father had been someone, you know, very important in the Haitian government prior to that.  And there was a film we found of my grandparents' wedding and, you know, and all the people there were like the, you know, important people in Haiti at that time.  When my mother [Claire Antoine Jones] was born, apparently, like, there was a big article in the newspaper, you know, that kind of thing.  But I don't really have a lot.  And I didn't, I only knew my grandfather as a young child.  Like, I didn't know him.  You know, he taught at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] up until about two years before I went to Howard.  I didn't really know--grow up knowing him very well.
Speaker 1: Now, did he teach political science?
Speaker 2: He taught French.
Speaker 1: French, okay.
Speaker 2: He taught French.  But he was a, he was a scholar of Haitian history.  He wrote a book ['Jean Price-Mars and Haiti,' Jacques Carmeleau Antoine] about Jean Price-Mars, who's an anthropologist.  And I think he was--I've met a few people who he mentored that are political scientists.  But he taught at Howard for, I think, probably about thirty years.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  And where we are here--this is an aside to anybody watching this.  Where we are right now--the space is secured by Toni Cook Bush [Antoinette Cook Bush], who's a lawyer here, whose grandfather, Mercer Cook [Will Mercer Cook], taught French at Howard.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Mercer Cook was my mother's uncle.  Mercer, you know like, (laughter).  Yeah, they were very close.  And they grew--and my grandparents--after my grandfather was no longer living at the Haitian embassy-- which used to be on California [Street] off of 18th Street before it moved to where it is now.  But they moved, you know, when that ended they moved to Brookland [Washington, D.C.].  So, they were--like lived around the corner from Ralph Bunche, who we grew up, you know, knowing that family.  Not Ralph Bunche, but that family, you know, and that community and Mercer Cook and, yeah.
Story_ID: 642207
Speaker 1: Now did--so, your mother [Claire Antoine Jones], did she go to Howard herself?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My parents met at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she grew up here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  Did she grow up around Howard University?
Speaker 2: She lived in Brookland [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to McKinley [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what was your mother--what was her goal in terms of--
Speaker 2: School (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) going to school, yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  She didn't finish Howard.  She married my dad [Humphrey Jones, Sr.], I think, probably after her second year.  I think when my brother [Humphrey Jones, Jr.] was born, she was about twenty.  So, I don't know what her original major was.  She wen- ended up going back to school for social work, and she was a social worker while I was growing up.  And she started I guess in the '70s [1970s], early '70s [1970s], working for the Urban League [National Urban League].  And then my parents got divorced around 1971--or separated, around 1971, 1972.  And we end up moving--my brother and my mother and I ended up moving to Memphis [Tennessee] because of the work that the Urban League was doing in Memphis at that time.
Story_ID: 642208
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Humphrey, H-U-M-P-H-R-E-Y, Clarence Oliver Jones [Humphrey Jones, Sr.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He doesn't use the Oliver, though.  He just calls himself Humphrey C. Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 30, 1941.  He was born in Grand Turk [Grand Turk Island], which is in the Turks and Caicos Islands, in the British West Indies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where is Turks and Caicos?  Is it near Barbados, or--
Speaker 2: It's, actually, it's geographically part of the Bahamian chain.  So, it's just south and a little bit west of the Bahamas.  Like, if you think about how the Bahamas goes, it's like right here.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back do they go?
Speaker 2: Well, my--which side should I start with first? (Laughter) My grandmother [Hazel Astwood Jones] or my grand--
Speaker 1: Either one.
Speaker 2: So, my grandfather was educated at the University of the West Indies [University College of the West Indies; University of the West Indies] in Jamaica [Kingston, Jamaica].  He was a teacher and educator.  He became the head of the school in the Turks and Caicos Islands.  And then he later in life became an Anglican priest.  He was the first Anglican priest that was native to the Turks and Caicos Islands.  His father had been a carpenter, and actually carved all the pews in the church--both the churches in Grand Turk and the church in Salt Cay [Salt Cay Island, Tucks and Caicos Islands], which is the island that my grandfather was from.  His name was Clifford Jones.  And his father's name was Joseph Jones [ph.].  He was the carpenter.  He was married to a woman named Lucinda [Lucinda Jones (ph.)].  I don't know what her maiden name was.  She died relatively early.  Like, my father and uncles did not know her, they only knew my grandfather.  That--I mean, I've heard, you know, that he--my grandfather, who was very, kind of light-skinned--had a white father named--that was from the Morgan family--which is the biggest salt producing family in the Turks and Caicos Islands, which it was what it was originally known for.  Before they started mining salt, they would farm salt.  And this Mr. Morgan was like the biggest, richest person down there.  So, the word on the street is that he--my grandfather--my great-grandfather, was a Morgan.  But that's kind of, you know, hearsay.  My grandmother was originally from Middle Caicos [Middle Caicos Island, Turks and Caicos Islands], which is the largest land sized island.  The Turks and Caicos are very small, like, not really even a town.  And Middle Caicos was devastated by a hurricane.  At some point when my grandmother was little, her family moved to Grand Turk, and that's where she grew up the rest of the time.  My grandfather--I mean my father--grew up in the house that my grandmother grew up in, in Grand Turk.  She never worked.  I mean, I think she went to New York [New York] for a couple of years and worked, but she never had a career.  Her father was a white man from Brooklyn, New York.  And (laughter), her mother was a black woman from the Turks and Caicos Islands.  And apparently he would just come every few years, and they would have another baby.  They had eight babies.  (Laughter) They were never married.  It was not legal for them to be married at the time.  So, but, you know, my grandmother grew up knowing him as her father.  So, and I think later in life, he ended up living there with my grandmother's mother.  That's all I know.  I mean, I know that the people in the Turks and Caicos Islands were--some were slaves that had been brought from Mississippi by British loyalists after the Revolutionary War.  Others were freed by--when a big slave ship crashed right off the coast of there, and because they were--it was British territory, and slavery had been outlawed in England at that time.  Even though the slaves were supposed to be going to the United States, they end up there.  So, those were the two ways black people got there.  But I don't know which way my--these ancestors got there.
Story_ID: 642209
Speaker 1: So, your father [Humphrey Jones, Sr.] was born on Turks and Caicos [Grand Turk Island, Turks and Caicos Islands], and--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: --so, did, did he go to school there, too and--
Speaker 2: He went to up to high school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he, he went to college at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  All three of my uncles went.  And my dad and his two brothers all went to Lincoln.  And then my father went to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so he's a doctor now?
Speaker 2: He's a doctor now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of medicine did he--
Speaker 2: He's a surgeon.
Speaker 1: Surgeon, okay, all right.  So, so your parents met at Howard when your father was in medical school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In medical school.  And my mom [Claire Antoine Jones] was an undergrad [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how they met, that they tell?
Speaker 2: They met--my mom was a--my dad is a Que, Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  And my mom's friend, best friend, was a Que Pearl, whatever that is (laughter).  And that's, and so they met at some sort of Que event.  And I think they just--you know, they were young, and things happened, and they end up getting married (laughter).
Story_ID: 642210
Speaker 1: Who do you think you take the most after?
Speaker 2: In what way?
Speaker 1: Well, in terms of their personalities, their sense of humor, how they walk, talk, look, act?
Speaker 2: I think a little of both.  I think a little of both, yeah.  I mean my parents are both--even though--I mean, they've been divorced obviously for a long time.  But they have a lot of similar attributes, in terms of their personalities, you know.  They're both pretty--my dad [Humphrey Jones, Sr.] is really, really smart.  Like, he went to college [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] when he was fourteen.  And my mom [Claire Antoine Jones] is also really smart.  And they're both very interested in, like, current affairs and politics and--you know what I mean?  So, like, I always grew up with both of them--you know, having like very substantial conversations around the dinner table.  And my dad and my mom were not--I mean we grew up--my dad was very involved in our lives and there wasn't any estrangement, you know what I mean?  You know, there was no--growing up, you know, was pretty mellow between the two of them.  So, we--I don't know.  I mean I think--I think of them as my parents, you know what I mean--even though they didn't, they weren't married when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: They split up you said when you were about--?
Speaker 2: I was about six.
Speaker 1: About six, okay, okay.  Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have one brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is he older or younger?
Speaker 2: He's older.
Speaker 1: And what's his name, and what does he do?
Speaker 2: His name is Humphrey [Humphrey Jones, Jr.], also.  He's a junior.  He has a business that does IT [information technology] stuff, IT work, for you know, product clients.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He lives here in Washington [D.C.] also.
Story_ID: 642211
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have one, really--when we--when I was born here--we were both born here.  But I was born in April, and my dad [Humphrey Jones, Sr.] graduated from medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] in May.  And we moved to New York [New York] right after that, because he started his residency in New York.  So, I--my first few years of life were in New York.  And I have a very vivid memory of being--we lived in Brooklyn [New York]--of being on the stoop.  In a lemonade sale kind of situation (laughter).  And that's my earliest memory, is being on that stoop.
Story_ID: 642212
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No.  Not, not then.  I mean, we went to church in Memphis [Tennessee].  But it wasn't--not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your first few years are spent in--
Speaker 2: New York [New York].
Speaker 1: In New York, okay.  And so, did you start school there?
Speaker 2: No, I started school in Memphis.  I was, started first grade in Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I think back then, kindergarten was more of a half day affair.  It wasn't like it is now.  So, when I really started school, I was in the first grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: It was called Memphis State Campus School [Memphis State University Campus School; University of Memphis Campus School, Memphis, Tennessee] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were right--now, your mother's [Claire Antoine Jones] working with the Urban League [National Urban League], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so you're going to Memphis State Campus School.  Now this is like a lab school, I guess, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: So, this is one of the better schools in--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's 1972.  So, it was kind of out there, a little experimental.  Like we didn't have any grades, we didn't have any--like everything was individualized, so we all did whatever we--you know, read at our own pace, and did math at our own pace.  It was great.  I mean, it was, I still have friends that I went to Campus School with.  But I think it was an unusual moment, you know, in school in general--that there was just a lot of flexibility and fluidity.  And even though most of the schools in Memphis were still segregated, our school was very racially diverse, as well.
Speaker 1: This would have been 1976, you started (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I started school in 1972.
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972], oh, '72 [1972].  Right, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: It was '71 [1971] or '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971], probably.  I was six, probably.  So, yeah, it was an interesting time to, you know, be in school.  And I--at that time like, we were, I mean, like, we had heard of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  But we didn't really know the connection of Memphis to the Civil Rights Movement, or any of that, until much later.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a different Memphis than Dr. King was around, right?  I mean by '71 [1971], '72 [1972] this is an integrated school, I take it?
Speaker 2: Well, my school was integrated, but the public schools were not integrated.  I mean, some were, some had been forcibly desegregated.  But basically there were maybe two or three schools that were--that had black students in them--and white schools that had black students in them.  But the majority of black students went to black schools, and white students went to white schools.  When I was--actually when my brother [Humphrey Jones, Jr.] was going from elementary school to middle school, is when the schools were desegregated by the courts, and when the bussing started, and all of those things happened.  So, that would have been probably 1978, something like that.
Speaker 1: So, you were in sort of an unusual situation in Memphis, I guess, with going to the Campus School?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean the Campus School was definitely a progressive lab school.  So, it had a very different, you know, student body and different te- kind of teachers than the traditional public schools.
Story_ID: 642213
Speaker 1: Did you have any particular interest in school, in terms of a subject matter?
Speaker 2: In elementary school [Memphis State University Campus School; University of Memphis Campus School, Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  I mean I was--I really liked--probably language arts kind of things.  I always really liked to read, you know, as a very young child.  And I liked language, I always really liked language.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you have favorite authors?
Speaker 2: In high school [Central High School, Memphis, Tennessee], I did.  I mean as I got older, I did.  And I had a teacher that was really instrumental in teaching me about black writers.  Because I was kind of one of those students--like, I was very good at school.  I got good grades in school, but I was very, very--like my daughter [Ayana Clark]--very, like talky.  Like, I got in a lot of trouble (laughter) in school for talking, and for just being generally like disruptive.  Because I think a lot of times I was bored and not interested, you know.  So, I had--I mean one of the great things about that moment was that we had a lot of teachers who had come from segregated schools, and had like really looked out for us.  Because there were a lot of white teachers that didn't want to be teaching in integrated schools, you know.  So, we had a lot of pretty overt racism from teachers.  And then we had black teachers who, you know, were sort of trying to correct that, you know.  So one of my teachers in high school, you know, introduced me to--you know, like the work of the--of Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen--and I liked poetry a lot as a young person--and introduced me to all those kind of Black Arts Movement people and the Harlem Renaissance and all that, which was not part of our high school curriculum.  I think maybe a little Langston Hughes, but the other, the novels--Richard Wright, you know--
Speaker 1: So, this is in high school? When your teacher's introducing you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Jean Toomer, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I read a lot of those things in high school--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --because of this teacher that I had.
Story_ID: 642214
Speaker 1: Now what neighborhood did you live in in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: You know, I lived in east--what was then called East Memphis, which is no longer East Memphis, because Memphis has sprawled east.  But then that, that was what it was called, it was East Memphis.  It was very close to the southern, the Mississippi line, on a thoroughfare called Winchester Avenue, right off of Winchester Avenue.  But I don't even know what that neighborhood would be called now.  Because it couldn't be called East Memphis, because Memphis goes like twice as far east now, as it used to when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was it like?  I mean, was it like a suburban community, or was it like--
Speaker 2: It was.  It was a suburban community, and it was predominantly white when I lived there.  It's a hundred percent black now.  But it was predominantly white, but it was starting to be a little bit integrated.  So, one of our neighbors was a Stax musician [Al Green].  And there--you know, there were people like that that were around.  But it was--it was pretty, like, average suburban southern community.
Story_ID: 642215
Speaker 1: Now, was your mother [Claire Antoine Jones]--I mean did she--were you aware of any of the activities of the Urban League [National Urban League] when you were, you know, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean there was a lot going on, like, culturally then, too.  I mean we were very aware of Stax [Stax Records], you know.  And, you know, my next door neighbor--one of my best friends still, like growing up, her next door neighbor was Al Green, you know (laughter).  So, we were--we were very aware of that, you know.  And my brother's [Humphrey Jones, Jr.] best friend was the son of the guy that owned the funeral home that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was taken to.  And that's really how we knew about Martin Luther King being assassinated in Memphis [Tennessee].  You know and it was very--we really--I mean when I saw 'Eyes on the Prize' I was like wow, nobody told us any of this stuff, really, you know.  Maybe in high school [Central High School, Memphis, Tennessee], we knew about the sanitation workers strike, maybe.  But I feel like I didn't know any of that when I saw it.
Speaker 1: So, they didn't discuss the Civil Rights Movement when you were growing up in school, or--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: And your mother didn't?
Speaker 2: My mother probably did a little bit.  I mean, we definitely had a lot of black power kind of stuff.  And my mother had, like, the (gesture) [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis thing going on for a while.  But you know, I think in the '70s [1970s], people were also--it was just a different--people were more--especially having a single mom. You know, my mom was a lot more involved with, like, women's rights and--you know what I mean? That kind of '70s [1970s] stuff, as opposed to integration.  And my mom had grown up in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], where a lot of the integration stuff had happened a generation earlier, you know.  So, although my mother has stories about not being--she won a dance class at Art Linkletter [Art Linkletter Totten Dance Studio] here in D.C., and they wouldn't let her take it, because she was black.  You know, she has a couple of those kinds of stories.  But she didn't grow up in the South and it was very foreign to her, like, you know--what it was.  So, I don't really remember her talking very much about the Civil Rights Movement or, you know.  I feel like I learned all of that at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 642216
Speaker 1: We were just talking about the neighborhood and East Memphis [Memphis, Tennessee], and going to school.  Now, now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Central [Central High School]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is the first high school in Memphis [Tennessee], also the first integrated high school in Memphis.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Were there any--well, on the grade school level or the high, or the high school level, were there any special teachers or mentors?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had a lot of--I had a lot of special teachers.  Probably in elementary school [Memphis State University Campus School; University of Memphis Campus School, Memphis, Tennessee] a teacher that I remember most--and I'm blanking on her first name.  Her last name was Miss Moore [Agnes Ann Moore].  And she had been my brother's [Humphrey Jones, Jr.] teacher, and at a certain point in elementary school--as I mentioned--my brother had gone to junior high school.  And he was caught in the whole desegregation thing.  And he actually ended up going to private school.  And because my mother [Claire Antoine Jones] was so concerned about the racial dynamics and him being a boy, there was--at that point and later on in elementary school--there was just a lot of turbulence around race, a lot of animosity, a lot of like ugly kind of racism.  And I remember like at one point like, also, 'Roots' came out, you know, (laughter) and I--
Speaker 1: This is '77 [1977], right?
Speaker 2: And I remember at one point like I had this friend that I used to go to Girl Scouts with, who was white.  And I just stopped being friends with her.  And I was like, I'm not being friends with any more white people, you know.  And I had this teacher who was white who really kind of, you know, took that on with me, you know.  And I explained like why I felt this way.  And I felt like I had justification for feeling this way, you know.  But she really--I mean I'll never forget like her really talking me through that.  Like, well, I'm also white, you know.  So does that mean I'm also a bad person just because I'm white?  You know, you know what I mean.  So, is that the thing that, that makes us who we are, you know, as people?
Speaker 1: So, you're like twelve years old, right?
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Probably not even twelve, about eleven.  And, you know, and that was a really, that was a really important moment in my life, I would say.  And then junior high school, not so much.  That was kind of a blur, you know.  But high school, I had, I had several teachers that were--as I mentioned, this woman, her name was Mrs. Johnson, Francis Johnson [ph.].  And she was definitely the person who, you know, challenged me the most, and also just gave me, fed me like a wealth of literary stuff, in particular, that, you know, really pushed me.  Also, the guidance counselor named Molly Long, who I recently heard passed away.  But she also really held me to some very high standards, which I think, you know, has helped me in my life, you know that she knew that I was capable of a lot, but also, you know, capable of a lot of mischief as well, you know.  So, she really worked with me, I think, and helped me sort of see the bigger picture.  You know, that it wasn't just about high school--even getting into college--or, you know, that there was a bigger story, you know.  So those two in particular: Miss Johnson and Miss Long.

Speaker 1: Oh, I was going to ask you about high school activities, if you were involved in--were you, did you, were you a member of clubs or the--
Speaker 2: I was a member of clubs.  I never played sports.  I play- I like was on the track team for like five minutes.  But I never really played sports.  But I was in clubs.  And we had a big social club scene in Memphis [Tennessee].  You probably know, I mean Memphis is like a--has a very entrenched black middle class.  So there were, there are a lot of--you know, I'd say three high schools in particular that had black middle class populations, that were always in some kind of competition around different stuff.
Speaker 1: Which schools were--?
Speaker 2: Central [Central High School, Memphis, Tennessee], White Station [White Station High School, Memphis, Tennessee], and Hamilton [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  And, also Melrose [Melrose High School, Memphis, Tennessee]--that was another high school there, so those four.  White Station was known more, because they had a really good band, and they had, you know, good sports teams.  Central always had really good sports teams and--but then we also had this whole club thing.  So, we each had these different--a girls club and a boys club.  So, I was very involved with that (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was the name of your club?
Speaker 2: Our club was called Les Dames Jolies [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It's for French, like, the pretty ladies.
Speaker 1: Les Dames Jolies.
Speaker 2: Right, so, the LDJs.  And we used to have like parties, and it was just the whole big scene.  So, that was my main extracurricular activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's--I mean at that time I also did start doing--I started writing at that time, like writing poetry and doing, you know, academic like stuff. Like, for extracurricular academic stuff.  Actually, in my senior year in high school, I started taking classes at Memphis State [Memphis State University, Memphis, Tennessee], which became University of Memphis.  So, I was also very engaged with that, but also very engaged socially.
Story_ID: 642218
Speaker 1: Now what would you write about?  What was your poetry about?
Speaker 2: I wrote a lot about, I wrote a lot about poverty.  I mean, I think growing up in Memphis [Tennessee], you know, it was pretty striking to me, like, how like much of a gulf there was between rich people and poor people, you know.  And having a lot of friends whose families came from Mississippi and spent a lot of time down there--and that was before the casino and all that.  And I mean it was, it was--and sharecropping was kind of on its way out, you know.  That--I mean I had some very intense kind of experiences with just understanding like what sharecropping was, and who was being, you know, marginalized by it and. So, I would write a lot about that.
Speaker 1: Did you--I mean it sounds like you had some firsthand information about it.  I mean, did you go down and witness--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, we would go.  I mean because my friends' grandparents--some of my friends' grandparents lived there, and my godparents who--my godfather--had gone to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] with my dad [Humphrey Jones, Sr.].  And we had all moved to New York [New York] together.  And he was from outside of Memphis, which is why we ended up--part of why we ended up moving down there--because they moved back down there.  And they were from a rural area outside of Memphis that we spent a lot of time at when we were little.  And they weren't poor, but I mean there was a lot of poverty, you know, and it was hardcore.  And I think that was--that would--you know, remains something that I'm very--that, you know, affects my work a lot, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in terms of your career as a filmmaker--I mean, in those days were you thinking about that at all?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't think about that at all until after college, after undergrad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really wanted to be a writer.  I mean, I wanted to be a novelist.  And I thought I would be a novelist and teach at Howard or, you know, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, now, did you ever get involved in any of your mother's [Claire Antoine Jones] activities with the Urban League [National Urban League]?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, we would go to things, but not really, not really.  I mean, she stopped working for the Urban League when I was still in elementary school [Memphis State University Campus School; University of Memphis Campus School, Memphis, Tennessee].  And then she started working for the state, as a social worker.  And that was more--you know, working with families, you know, that were having different kind of issues, basically.  So, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, other than having to go to her office when we didn't have any school, and sit there all day.  That was my involvement (laughter).
Story_ID: 642219
Speaker 1: So, when you were a senior in high school, what kind of advice--now this is, this is 19--what, what are we talking about? Seven- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-six [1986], '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Eight--
Speaker 2: I mean '82 [1982], '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982], '83 [1983], okay.   Okay, Central High School [Memphis, Tennessee], you're a senior.  Now, you got good grades, right?  And so, what did your counselor tell you?
Speaker 2: About college?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, they really pushed me to go to Ivy League schools.  And I really wanted to go to an Ivy League school, until I went to Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] homecoming when I was a senior in high school.  And then that was it for me.  (Laughter) In the summer before my senior year in high school, I'd gone to a summer program at Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana] in New Orleans [Louisiana] that was a science and engineering program.  And I met a girl there that was going up to be a freshman at Howard, and we became friends.  And so, in the fall when she went to Howard and I was back a senior in high school, she invited me to come up.  And my mom [Claire Antoine Jones] let me go, so I could see--you know, that was when I was doing my college visits.  So, my mom let me go, which is kind of inexplicable to me today.  But she let me go, and--
Speaker 1: By yourself, to visit--?
Speaker 2: To visit this other girl.  And stay in the dorm and everything.  And we had some, you know, obviously, family friends in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] that picked me up from the airport and all that kind of stuff.  But I spent the week, homecoming weekend, on campus in the quad.  And I mean, I just, I had to go to Howard.  Morris Day and The Time were like the show (laughter).  I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it.  So--
Speaker 1: Well, those were the days, the early days of Prince and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Morris Day and--
Speaker 2: Right.  And Morris Day and The Time were performing at homecoming.  I mean I went back, and I was done, I was done.  I was like I only need to send out one application now.  But I did apply to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and all these schools.  But I knew, like, that I wanted to go to Howard.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, as a--so what did you do that summer before you went to Howard?
Speaker 2: What did I do that summer?  I don't know.  Nothing, probably--hang out with my friends.  Yeah I don't, I don't know what I did that summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so nothing special?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  And there were a bunch of us that went to Howard.  So, there were like a bunch of people from my high school.  And then I had grown up in a community that wasn't all school related--where our parents were friends and stuff.  And so, a lot of us came here together.  I'd say there were at least twenty people that I knew in my freshman class, including my best friend from high school, who came to Howard.  So, we were all there together.  So, that made it very, like, easy, you know, to transition.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, the social life suited you, you know--we know that.
Story_ID: 642220
Speaker 1: Who were the, some of the teachers and administrators here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: At Howard?
Speaker 1: At Howard when you got there.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember the guy's name that was the, oh, god, that was the chair of the English department when I was there.  He was great.  Eleanor Traylor was there.
Speaker 1: Eleanor Traylor.  Now, yeah, now, she's worth--do you have any stories about Eleanor Traylor?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I knew her.  I, like, I got to know her better later, after I was a student.  But when I was a student, I just thought she was like larger than life. Like I thought she was the most amazing person I'd ever encountered.  I mean, just her whole thing, you know--her presentation, her brilliance, her everything--her personality, you know.  And she, I guess she had just--she wasn't the chair of the English department when I was in the English department.  So, I guess she was kind of emeritus at that point.  But she was around.  And Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown], I think he had just finished teaching, and he was still around.  And so, there was like these luminary people that were still around, you know, which was very exciting.  And I mean by the time I got to Howard, I was pretty--my first year, I kind of majored, I thought I might major in sciences.  But I knew by the end of my freshman year that I was going to be an English major.  And, so the--and I, you know, I knew Sterling Brown's work, and I--you know.  So, it was pretty exciting to be at Howard when those people were still around.
Speaker 1: Right.  The other writer there that wrote 'Marigold' [sic. 'Marigolds'] was she there in the English department then, or--?
Speaker 2: Paula Hirt- Paula [sic. HistoryMaker Eugenia Collier]--
Speaker 1: No.  Gosh, I wish I--we were just, we interviewed her on the last trip.  But she was at Howard, then at Morgan [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], too.  At any rate I can't think of her name, but--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: But yeah. So, Sterling Brown was on his way.  Did you get a chance to talk to him?
Speaker 2: He was not teaching anymore, but he was around.  And the year that, like--not even my freshman year, maybe my sophomore year, there was a big tribute to him that he came to.  And it was--it was amazing.  Like, all of these famous writers were there, and, you know.  I was actually at a conference Friday where they mentioned this thing.  There was some writers from the Black Arts Movement that--and they talked about that gathering of Sterling, for Sterling Brown--that he was so, you know, moved by. [HistoryMaker] Sonia Sanchez was talking about how, like, moved she was by it.  And I remember it so well.  Like, there's a whole--he did 'Strong Men,' like, he, you know, recited that poem.  I'll never forget that.  It was amazing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were there any visiting writers?  I know at times [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti and--
Speaker 2: Haki Madhubuti was around.  I don't know if he was a visiting writer.  But he was definitely--I met him when I was really young at Howard.  And I--because I had been writing poetry, I got to know Ethelbert Miller [HistoryMaker E. Ethelbert Miller] really well when I was probably a freshman, or, definitely by the time I was a sophomore.  And Ethelbert and another one of my professors, Calvin Forbes--do you know--he actually is in Chicago [Illinois].  He ended up teaching for the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  But he was my mentor, like, as a poet.  He wrote a book called 'Blue Monday' which was one of my favorite books of poems.  And then he ended up teaching at Howard, and he became, you know, my first real, I'll say real mentor.  You know what I mean, like, in a formal way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, more than just a good teacher, he was someone who really followed up with you as--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And he--and he connected me to a lot of opportunities.  Calvin Forbes is how I got involved with film, you know.  But that was after college.  But in college, he--you know, just, like, connected me to a lot of opportunities to do readings.  He suggested that I apply for the Larry Neal Writers' Award, which I won, which was--I won probably I was a senior in college.  And, you know, it was unusual for a student to win that.  And actually the year I won, I won with Elizabeth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this in in--I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: The year I won, the other winner was Elizabeth Alexander, who, you know, did the poem ['Praise Song for the Day'] at the inauguration [of HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, I mean, this was a long time ago.  But--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the Larry Neal Award was sponsored by--
Speaker 2: The D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it still exists.  I feel like I heard recently that somebody won that.
Speaker 1: Larry Neal passed, he passed in '81 [1981], I think it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Larry Neal was no longer around when I was at Howard.  I mean, he was no longer alive.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he passed in '81 [1981].  So did Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Black World--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and First World.  So, all right, so, yeah, well respected writer.  So, you won the Larry Neal Award, and then, so you were--
Speaker 2: That was in 1986.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 642221
Speaker 1: Any other stories of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] life?  I mean, or, well, I didn't ask you about the stories of Howard (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You had the social group.  Were you involved in any of--with a social group of Howard, like a sorority or--?
Speaker 2: Not a sorority, no, not really.  I mean I wasn't really involved in any formal activities at Howard, really.  I mean I had started pretty early, like with the poetry and the writing and stuff, and I was involved in that.  But it was--that was almost, you know, outside of school.  I didn't really--I was not in a sorority.  I didn't play any sports.  I didn't--
Speaker 1: Were you in--was there a black student organization or anything at Howard, or--?
Speaker 2: There was, and I went to some of their meetings.  But it was--you know, when I was in college in the mid-'80s [1980s] it was kind of a strange time, politically.  You know, people were--like, right after I graduated was when Ras Baraka came in, and they had that whole exciting thing.  And right before I was there, they had some exciting stuff in the '70s [1970s].  But when I was there, everybody wanted to go to business school and, you know, it was like--very Carlton Banks era, you know.  So, there wasn't a lot.  I mean this guy whose name--I can't remember what his name is now--but his name then was True Mathematics, and he was a Five Percenter kind of guy.
Speaker 1: He was--name was True Mathematics?
Speaker 2: True Mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he became like a really, like, well known, like kind of Nation of Islam kind of guy.  And I see him every now and then on TV.  But he was like a big student leader.  And I was--briefly went to his meetings, because he was cute (laughter).  But that was about the extent of my--and we had like an English department--we had a student group in the English department, and I was very involved in that.  But that was more of a--you know, like we would meet and read our poems and, you know.  But it was not a formal university kind of activity.
Speaker 1: Now it's funny, you just reminded me of a rhetoric from those days--I guess from the late '80s [1980s], at least--where people would rap or read poetry, and they would say they're dropping science on people.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And this man's name being True Mathematics and him being a poet, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, they all had those kind of names, you know.  But yeah, I went to a couple of those meetings.  But I didn't, I didn't join.
Story_ID: 642222
Speaker 1: So, did you have any, any experiences going ov- abroad or anything, for (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Not until after.  I mean when I was growing up, I used to go to Turks and Caicos Islands regularly for the summer.  We used to spend our--every other summer there.  Like, the boys and the girls would alternate--my cousins.  But I didn't--you know, it's funny.  Like, I worked on a series in the early 2000s--like in 2001, about race ['Matters of Race'].  And a big part of it was about immigrants (laughter).  And that was the first time I kind of understood that my parents [Claire Antoine Jones and Humphrey Jones, Sr.] were immigrants (laughter).  Like I never, it never occurred to me that my father was an immigrant.  My father still has a green card.  My father does not have a U.S. passport.  And he doesn't have an accent, though.  I think that's part of it.  But my grandparents all did, except for one, you know.  And it just never--I didn't experience it like that (laughter).  So, now, I realize I had an immigrant upbringing--you know, with the whole summers in the home country and stuff--food and stuff like that.  But I--it didn't, I didn't know until like twenty years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], at least, is the kind of college where you have a lot of people from--I mean it's a diverse student body, I mean in terms of the black colleges [HBCUs] at least, I know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But back then there were some West Indians.  But the West Indians were very--stayed to themselves.  And they were mostly Jamaicans and big West Indian countries.  So, it wasn't like there was a Turks and Caicos Island club, you know.  And then there were a lot of Nigerian students.  And that was the first time I met--really got to know African people, really, you know.  And that, I mean that was positive, you know.  I went to Kenya, right, like, for Crossroads Africa [Operation Crossroads Africa], like right after I graduated from Howard.  And that was the first time, you know, I had traveled anywhere, really, except to the Caribbean and Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, yeah Crossroads, Howard did have a hook up with Crossroads.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 642223
Speaker 1: Well, you were graduating, and you graduated with a degree in English--
Speaker 2: In English.
Speaker 1: --did you figure you were going on to grad school in some other area already?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I thought--you know, I had started publishing my writing; I was a poet.  And I thought I would kind of take a year off and travel, and then go to graduate school.  But what happened was--well, a lot of things happened (laughter).  But my senior year at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] is when 'Eyes on the Prize' came on.  And so, my group, my English student group, we used to watch it together every--I think that it came on Wednesday nights.  Every Wednesday night, we would watch it together.  And it was really the first time I had ever seen anything like that.  A close second would be 'The Africans' ['The Africans: A Triple Heritage'] the series by Ali Mazrui that had come on a year earlier.  And they had a lot of activities on campus around 'The Africans.'  That's when I met Mbye Cham [Mbye B. Cham] and other--
Speaker 1: He was the head of African studies?
Speaker 2: Studies, yeah.  And started--you know what I mean, like being aware of the whole--contemporary Africa, you know. But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, this is--yeah, you're right.  Now, this is something--I was trying to think of the documentaries that were coming out about this time.  And that's right, you're--'The Africans' and--
Speaker 2: And 'Eyes on the Prize.'
Speaker 1: 'Eyes on the Prize.'
Speaker 2: But--and 'The Africans,' we found it really fascinating.  But 'Eyes on the Prize'--like of my closest friends--I mean, he actually went to the lab school in Chicago [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] and then transferred to my Campus School [Memphis State University Campus School; University of Memphis Campus School, Memphis, Tennessee].  His father [Walter L. Walker] was the president of LeMoyne-Owen [LeMoyne-Owen College].  It's a small HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] in Memphis [Tennessee].  And he's been one of my closest friends since then, since we were eight years old.  We were at Howard together, and he--and he was also an English major.  So, we all watched this together, this 'Eyes on the Prize.'  And as a result of 'Eyes on the Prize,' when he graduated from Howard, he like packed up his stuff and moved to Boston [Massachusetts] to, like, try to work for Henry Hampton.  Because he was a--he was a film--he was an English major, but he was also a School of C [School of Communications; Cathy Hughes School of Communications] minor--film and television minor.  So, he--I mean on based on 'Eyes on the Prize,' he just decided like this is what I'm going to do, you know.  I'm going to make these kinds of films.  So, he packed up his stuff and went to Boston.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Noland Walker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was actually also one--sorry, I touched the mic.  (Laughter) He, he was also one of the producers of 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'].  We worked together there.  But, so, he moved to Boston and he became a PA [production assistant] on 'Eyes on the Prize II' ['Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads, 1965-1985'] which went into production right after 'Eyes on the Prize I' ['Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954-1965'] aired.  And so, he got to meet all these black filmmakers.  And that's how I first started being aware of that.  And then Calvin Forbes, who I mentioned, who was my mentor, was on the board of directors of this small kind of tabloid thing that was produced by an editor from The Washington Post, called Black Film Review.  The editor--the guy's name was David Nicholson.  He's still around in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  And he started this--almost--it was basically a newsletter.  And he started it right in, like, maybe 1985, '86 [1986], basically to decry the lack of black characters and themes and, you know, representations in mainstream film.  And now, he's a, he's a writer also, and like a, he worked for Book World--for The Washington Post Book World.  He was an editor of Book World.  And he was basically concerned about the representation of black people in commercial films.  But what hap- but because of the timing of when he started this thing, it was right before 'She's Gotta Have It' came out.  'She's Gotta Have It' also came out when I was a senior in high school--in college.  So, that came out and then 'Eyes on the Prize' came out.  Then all of these things started happening around--
Speaker 1: So, this is nineteen eighty--
Speaker 2: Six [1986].
Speaker 1: Six [1986], okay.
Speaker 2: You know, just really like kind of heating up, around this issue of black people in film and independent film.  And [HistoryMaker] Julie Dash was around.  She hadn't done 'Daughters of the Dust,' but I think 'Daughters' was probably in production.  Haile [Haile Gerima] was doing stuff.  So, it was just like this very kinetic time in terms of black film.  And so David, who had started this t as a newsletter, suddenly was swamped with interest.  You know, like people were sending him articles.  People were, you know, soliciting him for all this stuff.  So, Calvin asked me if I'd be interested in helping David with Black Film Review.  And I think David had gotten a grant or something.  So, he could pay me, like, you know, some amount of money.  And I had just gr- and this is right after I graduated.  So, this is '87 [1987].  So, I started working with David, who was doing this in his basement on 1st [Street] and S Street Northwest, right by campus.  And about a year later when things had really started turning toward black independent film and African film--and things that David wasn't that interested in--he decided he didn't want to do it anymore.  So, he said, "You know, if you want to do it, you can do it.  Otherwise, I'm going to shut it down."  So, I said I would do it.  And then that's what really, you know, got me going on the, in the direction of film.
Story_ID: 642224
Speaker 1: L.A. film rebellion [L.A. Rebellion] or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the Haile [Haile Gerima] thing, the thing Haile (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: L.A. film rebellion--
Speaker 1: With Barbara O. [Barbara O. Jones] and all of that--
Speaker 2: Right, Julie--
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, now you're really involved in film.  You're the editor of the Review, right?
Speaker 2: The Black Film Review, right.
Speaker 1: Black Film Review (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I also had started working with Tony Gittens [Anthony Gittens] here in Washington, D.C., who founded the Washington International Film Festival [Washington, D.C. International Film Festival; Filmfest D.C.].  But he was, at the time, was at UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], and he had a thing called the Black Film Institute, which did screenings and discussion series about black film.  And so, I ended up working with him because the Black Film Institute--the Black Film Review--was associated with the Black Film Institute.  And through that, through working with the Black Film Institute, I got to meet a lot of the independent filmmakers like [HistoryMaker] Julie Dash and [HistoryMaker] Camille Billops and John Akomfrah, you know--just a lot of people. A lot of filmmakers, independent filmmakers.
Speaker 1: Is that about the time you met Floyd Webb of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I met Floyd through 'Daughters of the Dust'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --through Julie.  I had met Julie through, probably through Black Film Institute by then.  But, you know, because of--there was just so much attention and energy around black independent film following Spike Lee and Robert Townsend when he first came out, that there was no other publication like Black Film Review.  So, I got invited, just by virtue of being the editor of Black Film Review, to all of these conferences all over the world, you know.  And I would show up, and they're like, "You're twenty-two years old," you know.  Like, "What do you know about anything?"  But, you know, that's how I met like a lot of the filmmakers and a lot of scholars who then, you know, really mentored me in terms of--in a lot of ways it was a continuation of the work that I'd already been doing--writing around black representation.  It was just in a different kind of way, you know, writing critically about film and popular culture.  And originally that was what I thought I would do, you know--that I would be involved in film, but more as a scholar, as a critic.
Speaker 1: Now, had you--had you written about film, you know, before--
Speaker 2: Before Black Film Review?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  I had written criticism, but literary criticism.  But, you know, I mean it's the same thing. Writing about film and writing about novels is the same kind of work, and it was basically about representation.  So it was the same ideas, you know, that I feel that I had been developing as a student.  But it was just a very different world.  And then I didn't know anything about African film, you know.  So, then I began to learn about African film and independent films, which I had seen because of Haile Gerima.  You know, he made that kind of stuff available to us as students [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Even though I wasn't in his department, I got to go to a lot of screenings; I got to see his work, you know.  I was aware that there was independent film.  But I didn't--had not seen like the work of Ousmane Sembene or, you know, these kind of things.  So, through the Black Film Review I got exposed to just that whole world of black film, you know, global.  And you know, it really, I think it really changed kind of how I thought about what I was going to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, being an English major really helped what you were--I mean it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it helped (laughter).
Speaker 1: It put you in a position to analyze and criticize--
Speaker 2: And write, you know.  I mean, and that was the thing that I really started doing a lot of writing about--you know, what was happening in terms of independent film, especially in the late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s], the fact that I was so young and the filmmakers were so young, you know what I mean?  And it was about sort of, you know, like, with John Singleton.  And I don't know how much you remember about this.  But there were a lot of these films coming out that were kind of like hip hop films.  And they had these very--in my opinion--terrible representations of women, you know.  So, that became kind of the thing that I wrote about most, was how women were viewed through this prism, and how, you know, keeping it real was not helping sisters.  Do you know what I mean?  And that really became what I wrote about, and how I, you know, got--I think, you know, people became aware of me as a writer, as a critic.
Story_ID: 642225
Speaker 1: This period of time seems to be--and I don't know if it's just, you know, if it's really true or not.  But it seems to be like sort of a golden age of black film, independent black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Independent, yeah.
Speaker 1: --filmmakers.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know, there were some before, I know, in the '70s [1970s], you know.  But it seemed as though, you know, Spike Lee, John Singleton, [HistoryMaker] Reginald Hudlin--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Julie Dash--a lot of people--Euzhan Palcy, around this time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --starts making films.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, a lot of people, and also--
Speaker 1: Kasi Lemmons.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I forgot about her, yeah (laughter).  Right, there were a lot of people.  And a lot of interesting films for a little while, you know, before it just all went to hell.  But there, there were a lot of--and people were really accessible.  You know, like people were very open to the conversations around what did it mean.  And people were very independent minded.  And I think what happened later was, you know, it really became about making money.  And then it just, it changed, you know.  I think that it coincided with something else that was happening in American culture anyway, and popular culture.  But, I mean there just isn't that same kind of scene anymore.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a real, it was a place--I mean you could go to a film, black film festival, and meet the filmmakers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And just talk to them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They were there, and they would talk about their films and their struggles to earn money to do them, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --why they did it, and--
Speaker 2: Right.  And I mean in a lot of ways it's great that more opportunities have been opened up to people like Shonda Rhimes.  But on another level, you know, it feels to me like a little bit of a loss, that there isn't a thriving kind of independent voice.  And that's not just African Americans--I think that's in general.
Speaker 1: Do you have an idea of why--you know, this era, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  I mean, I think it's just generally the culture has become more and more corporatized.  You know, that things are just really--there really is a bottom line mentality about everything, including education, including culture, including everything, you know.  So that there isn't a sense of--I mean this is one of the reasons like I became involved in public television.  Optimistically it's that, you know, there isn't, right now to me, like a thriving sense of a public square.  You know, it just doesn't exist.  You know, even with things that are supposed to be about humanitarian causes, you can't--you can't even do it without a celebrity.  You know, like you can't do--can't raise money, you can't do meaningful work unless you're endorsed by a famous person, you know.  And that's in every sector, you know--whether it's food, food aid or HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] or cancer, or whatever.  It's like you cannot mount a successful campaign if you don't have famous people involved.  And I think that's like a pretty--that sums it up pretty neatly like where we are in terms of, in terms of our popular culture, or culture.
Story_ID: 642226
Speaker 1: Your mentor was able to provide the link to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], right?
Speaker 2: The Stanford thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or--?
Speaker 2: No, the Stanford thing grew--so, my friend Nolan [Noland Walker] who went to Blackside [Blackside, Inc.] in Boston [Massachusetts], and started working on 'Eyes on the Prize II' ['Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads, 1965-1985']. So, I went up there and spent some time with him.  And by this time, I had been at Black Film Review for a few years.  You know, we were sort of in, you know, he was at Blackside; I was doing Black Film Review.  But I went up there and spent some time with him.  And I met at Blackside, a guy named Jon Else.  And Jon Else is a very highly respected documentary filmmaker and cinematographer.  And he worked really closely with Henry Hampton.  He was the series producer, I think, on 'Eyes on the Prize' or 'Eyes on the Prize II.'  He was the series producer on one of those shows.  So, I met him.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: His first name is J-O-N.  And then his last name is E-L-S-E.  He now is--although I've heard he's, this is his last year.  But he's the dean of the School of Broadcast Communications [sic. Graduate School of Journalism], or something like that, at Berkeley, at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  But at the time, in the late '80s [1980s], early '90s [1990s]--sorry, he was a professor at Stanford in this program.  And he had gone to this program himself.  So, he--I met him and got to know him.  And he is the one who encouraged me to apply to Stanford, which I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you go to Stanford in--?
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 1: Ninety-three [1993].  Okay, '93 [1993].  And you're working on a degree as a documentary f- in documentary films (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Documentary film.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Master's [degree] then.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 642227
Speaker 1: And so that's, that--those six years between Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I had been, you know, really involved with writing about black film, traveling to all these black film festivals.  And by that time, I had like been ev- all--I had spent a lot of time traveling in Africa and other places.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the more impressive--I know you mentioned Ousmane Sembene, you know.  But what, what impressed you the most, or what was remarkable--up or down, you know?
Speaker 1: In the films or in--?
Speaker 2: In your travels.  You know, what were you surprised to see, and what made a big impression on you?
Speaker 1: Well, the first time I went to Ouagadougou [Burkina Faso], to the Panafrican Film Festival [Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou] there, FESPACO, it was probably '89 [1989].  And the whole thing impressed me.  Like, I didn't--I mean there were dozens of black filmmakers from Europe, from all over Africa, from the Caribbean; and this very rich kind of intellectual discourse going on about what they were doing, and the politics of it, and the money of it.  And you know, and I had no idea this existed.  And this was, I mean FESPACO at that point--this was probably the fifth one.  It was probably ten years old at that point.  And it was just such a vibrant, rich scene.  And everyone just seemed to be extremely brilliant, you know.  Like, everyone that spoke just blew my mind, you know.
Story_ID: 642228
Speaker 1: And I was really lucky in the, in that early and the very beginning to acquire two other mentors (laughter), one of whom--both of whom, are still real important to me in life.  But one of them was Clyde Taylor.  And he was--he was around at the L.A. Rebellion.  He was the person that was sort of chronicling it more than anyone else.  And the other is a guy named Manthia Diawara, who is a professor at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  Manthia, I knew through, through the--what's that thing called--The Eye--you know that?  I had met Manthia when he was a graduate student, and I had just graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Because he also wrote for, you know, the journal Callaloo.  So, we both had been writing for Callaloo.  And we were introduced by Charles Rowell [Charles Henry Rowell], who's the editor of Callaloo, at this literary--it's a big literary gathering, but I can't remember what the name of it is.  Like ILM [ph.], or something.  But it's basically all the English teachers in the country (laughter).  And so, I met Manthia through that.  And then it turned out that he was very involved as a writer, about black film.  So, the three of us became really good friends and colleagues.  And Clyde is much older than us, but like, you know, sort of mentored Manthia, and then in turn, you know--me.
Speaker 2: Is Manthia Diawara an African American, or--
Speaker 1: He's from Mali.
Speaker 2: From Mali.  Okay, he's from Mali, all right.
Speaker 1: From Mali.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he went to AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] undergrad and then he got his Ph.D. at Bloomington in Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].  And Clyde got, went to Howard, but back in the '50s [1950s] or something--'60s [1960s].  Clyde went to Howard with Toni Morrison.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So whenever that was (laughter).
Story_ID: 642229
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you- you're going to all of the festivals.  And so, so I take it you went to Blacklight [Blacklight International Film Festival] in Chicago [Illinois], too, and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I actually never did go to Blacklight in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I went to--there was a lot of stuff in Fran- in Paris [France]; a lot of stuff in Senegal, in Ouagadougou [Burkina Faso].  I probably went to Ouaga every--for a few years, few--probably ten years every time I went.
Speaker 1: Gee, that--I didn't know that festival was that old.  But that's where they give the Golden Stallion award [at the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou], or whatever.
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is--like when I went in '89 [1989], the previous year the president of Burkina Faso [Thomas Sankara] had been murdered, assassinated.  And a lot of people didn't go that year, because there was some political thing about--there was a coup.  So, there was some political thing about who was currently in power in Ouaga.  So, when we went in '89 [1989], it was the first time that everybody had returned.  So, it was a really big, big festival.  And you know, in Ouaga they had a lot--I mean now apparently it's even more developed.  I haven't been probably in ten years.  But they had all these open air movie theaters.  And they had like a lot of movie theaters in Ouaga, as opposed to in other African cities.  So, it just had a very--it was basically developed to be this capital of African filmmaking, you know.  So, that was very much a part of the culture in Ouaga.
Speaker 1: So, they showed the movies outdoors?
Speaker 2: They had outdoor--yeah, I mean, not always.  They had indoor theaters, too.  But they had--I'd never seen like where the outdoor movie--not a drive in--like an outdoor--the amphitheater kind of thing, but for movies.  So, that was cool.  That was good.  I mean it was fun.
Speaker 1: They did that in Detroit [Michigan] for a while.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah?
Speaker 1: In the early '90s [1990s], they had outdoor--
Speaker 2: It was fun.
Speaker 1: --outdoor black film festival.
Speaker 2: It's a great way to see film.  And they did it in New York [New York], but, you know, in the park.  It's not, it's not a theater; it's just an amphitheater where they show films.  But these were actual movie theaters.  They just were, didn't have roofs.
Story_ID: 642230
Speaker 1: What were the--I mean were the- are there certain key principles that you learned about documentary filmmaking at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] that you could share with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean the thing about Stanford was that I hadn't really--there weren't a lot of documentaries that were part of that whole independent black film thing; it was more narrative films.  And so, when I went to Stanford, I knew very little about documentaries.  I mean I had seen 'Eyes on the Prize I' ['Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954-1965'], and by that time II ['Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads, 1965-1985'].  And I think by that time 'The Great Depression' had come on, maybe, and I had seen a few of those series--and, like I said, the Af- Ali Mazrui's 'The Africans' ['The Africans: A Triple Heritage'].  And there had been a couple of documentaries that had come out in the ni- early '90s [1990s].  But--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--I think it was Ken Burns' 'Civil War' ['The Civil War'] came out in '91 [sic. 1990]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which was a big TV--
Speaker 2: It was a big thing, but I didn't see it until later.  I saw it, but not until I started working in public television.  It wasn't really on my radar, you know.  But so, the whole thing was new to me at Stanford, you know, and the history of documentary filmmaking.  And even though a lot of the concepts about filmmaking you understand, that are like--there's a certain, there's a difference between how you see things with your eyes, and how you film them, or how you see them when they're filmed, you know.  And that whole process of really translating things from your perception to--you know, how it ends up, you know, on a TV or in a movie--was really different.  And it--and I think I didn't--I thought that I would go to Stanford and get that degree and learn more about the practicalities of filmmaking.  But I hadn't intended to return to my previous work.  And I had continued to do writing and, you know, be involved, you know, as a speaker about issues around representation.  And I really thought that I would go back to doing that.  But I got really, like, interested in like what it means to translate, you know what I mean--your ideas into a document--like, like a film, you know.  So, when I left Stanford, I really wanted to work on a documentary.  You know, like, I wanted to work in documentary as a--not necessarily forever, but I just wanted to have the experience of working on like an 'Eyes on the Prize' or something like that.  And I met one filmmaker when I was out in Oakland [California] who was one of the pioneers, I think, of PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] black documentaries, named [HistoryMaker] Avon Kirkland.  I worked with him for a while, and that was really fascinating.  And that made me want to, you know, do more.  And so, Jon Else introduced me to [HistoryMaker] Orlando Bagwell who is--was also one of the producers of 'Eyes on the Prize,' and worked very closely with Henry Hampton and ran Blackside [Blackside, Inc.] for a while when Henry Hampton was ill.  And I, you know, begged him for a job for like six months.  Then he finally gave me one.  And that's 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'] (laughter).
Story_ID: 642231
Speaker 1: So African- so well, let's see.  So, you came out of Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] in '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, is there any important teachers at Stanford?
Speaker 2: Jon [Jon Else].
Speaker 1: Jon. Jon, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean--and there was a, there's a woman, Kristine Samuelson, who was the--she became the chair of the department.  She was, she was our main kind of teacher.  You know, we--it was a small program.  There were only twelve students per year in the program.  And we had basically Kris; another woman, Jan Krawitz; Jon, and then the sort of academic chair, this guy Henry Breitrose.  And that was it, you know (laughter).  I did meet--there was a professor, James Gibbs [HistoryMaker James Lowell Gibbs, Jr.]--Jim Gibbs, who is an anthropologist, who I had met earlier at the Black Film Review.  And I was able to TA [teacher's assistant] for him, you know, because he used film a lot in his courses.  And I got to work with, you know, for him when I was at Stanford, which was great.  And what's her name was still there when I was there, who's now--oh, what's her name?  The playwright? The--with three names.  What's her name?  'Fires in the Mirror' ['Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other Identities,' Anna Deavere Smith].  What is this woman's name?
Speaker 1: I can't--I'm--
Speaker 2: Do you know who I'm talking about?  Tall. And she does like, she does all these real things and then turns them into plays.  Like, she does several characters.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know, I know exactly who you're talking about.  But I can't think of her name.  But I know, I know, yeah, I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: She was there when I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Condoleezza Rice was there when I was there (laughter).  And Tiger Woods was there when I was there.  So, it was kind of a funny--you know, it was a good time to be out there.  It was interesting, it was interesting.  But there was a lot of black student protests about Condoleezza Rice.  And I remember--having been a Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] student--thinking like why did you go to a school like this, if you don't, you know what I mean, if you're like so into being black?  Why wouldn't you go to an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities]?  I didn't get it, you know (laughter).  But--
Speaker 1: Now, is this before Condoleezza Rice got involved in the administration of George Bush [President George Walker Bush]. This is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  She was a provost at Stanford.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they hated her, because she did something.  I don't know what she did, but the black students couldn't stand her.  I don't remember what she did, but she provoked a lot of protests.  I was--you know, I mean as a graduate student, you know, you're not that involved in the life of the university. It was a little bit separate.  And the film school was like three floors underground.  So, we hardly ever even saw the light of day, (laughter) much less, you know, got involved in student protests.  So, but it was, it was--I loved Stanford.  It was a great experience for me.
Story_ID: 642232
Speaker 1: So, what did you do immediately after--?
Speaker 2: I went to work on 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'] immediately (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I moved from there, to there, to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you know, they mentioned--there are a couple of fellowships that are mentioned in your bio.  Did they take place immediately after grad school?  The Revson Fellowship [Charles H. Revson Fellowship]?
Speaker 2: That was recently.  That was maybe--
Speaker 1: Oh, just recently, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe six years ago.
Speaker 1: So, you went to work on 'Eyes on the Prize II' ['Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads, 1965-1985'] then? Okay?
Speaker 2: No, on 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'].
Speaker 1: 'Africans in America,' that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Africans in America.'  So, tell us what it was about and what your role was.
Speaker 2: Well, it was about, it was going to be a first major history of slavery for PBS [Public Broadcasting Service], a multipart series.  It was being produced at WGBH Boston [WGBH-TV, Boston, Massachusetts].  And I heard about it and I just thought, like, this is perfect for me.  You know, like I was an African American studies minor at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I knew a lot of the history of slavery.  And then I felt like given the time I spent at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], you know, learning about documentary film--and all the time I had spent before that, you know what I mean--really thinking about what it means, what this history means today--that I just thought, you know, this is perfect for me.  So, I like wrote [HistoryMaker] Orlando Bagwell a letter, and he never replied.  And I met him.  He came to Stanford to show 'Malcolm X: Make it Plain,' which was one of his films.  And then I convinced him to come and see my student film, and he really liked my student film.  And then we had some conversations after that.  And he ended up hiring me originally as an associate producer, but then within, you know, a few months I became a producer on the series.  And what the series was--at the time it was one of the most--had the most intense primary research of anything like it.  Because there had been very little--there had been a lot of scholarly research about slavery, obviously.  But there hadn't been anything that was really looking for images and primary sources, on the scale we were looking for then.  And we had complete access to like all the libraries at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], all the libraries pretty much everywhere.  And we spent half the production time doing research, like original research, with primary source material.  And it was intense.  It was, I mean it was a really--it was four years I think in production, which is an extraordinary amount of time for any documentary film.  But it was, you know, definitely a life changing experience I think for everybody that worked on that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the series, there was a series--it was what, four parts?
Speaker 2: Four ninety minute shows.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Six hours.
Speaker 1: So, was it difficult--I mean, so it was already scripted out when you started, right?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  There was just--I mean people--basically, the shows were roughly divided up into time periods.  So, the first show was pre-Amer- you know, the U.S., was kind of the beginning--Jamestown [Virginia] up to when the Revolutionary thing started taking off.  And then the second show was really about the Revolutionary period [Revolutionary War].  The third show, which is the show that I produced, went from '93 [1793]--basically the Haitian Revolution--after, you know, after the Declaration of Independence, after the [U.S.] Constitution, and after the war.  You know, starting, with the events in '93 [1793] 'til abolitionism really began in the 1830s--you know, formally began.  So, and then that show was basically abolitionist era--so from the '30s [1830s] to the '60s [1860s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's really all we had to go on, was like, your time period.  And then within those time periods we had to find, you know what I mean--sort of the meaningful threads that we thought illustrated the time.  I mean, obviously in my show, [President] Thomas Jefferson was the obvious major character.  In that Revolutionary show, [President] George Washington--you know, there were some people like that, Frederick Douglass, and William Lloyd Garrison in the last show.  But, you know, a lot of it was stuff that we had to figure out.  And that's why it took a long time to really figure out what went beyond the history that people knew--you know, into stories that hadn't been widely known, like Solomon Northup.  You know, that was not a story that most people knew before, you know.   And since 'Africans,' there have been other documentaries about slavery.  But that was the first big one, you know.
Story_ID: 642233
Speaker 1: I know we were talking about the--
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE: (Unclear) about the documentary (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'].
Speaker 2: --documentary histories on the Africans.-'Africans in America,' yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Africans in America', yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Africans in America,' right.  So, so were you fairly satisfied with your segment?  You had to deal with the colonials, right?
Speaker 1: I dealt with--
Speaker 2: [President] George Washington and Jefferson [President Thomas Jefferson]--
Speaker 1: I dealt with, like, from the Haitian Revolution up to basically Nat Turner, was the end of my show.  And Nat Turner in the beginning of the real, the formal abolitionist movement, that people, you know, are familiar with.  Yeah, I mean I was, I was--I mean happy with it.  I was satisfied with it.  I thought, you know, it conveyed what, you know, I was trying to say at that time.  It was just a very intense experience, you know, to really kind of live with that history for that long and really--I mean we spent--like I was saying, we spent so much time in the primary sources, and we just read all this terrible stuff, you know.  And like, I mean slavery was both worse than I thought it was and better than I thought it was, you know.  I mean, on the one hand I felt like I learned so much more about the humanity of the people that were enslaved.  And I understood so much more about like how, why people did survive and why, you know, we have the kind of rich African American culture we have today.  But then on the other hand, just the level of violence and brutality and depravity was just astounding.  You know what I mean--just shocking to read about it from people's firsthand experience.  So, it was real- it was difficult, you know.  And like we were talking about 'Twelve Years a Slave,' and in the first like twenty minutes, I really wasn't sure I could sit through it.  Because I, you just--I started having flashbacks from--do you know what I mean? Going through that process of living with those narratives.  And I mean, I wasn't a mother then, but I remember very viv- like very viscerally, like the, that, telling the story of the woman being separated from her children, which is told in the film, the Elisa [Eliza Harris] story.  It was in my 'Africans in America' film and, you know, it was so wrenching to me then, you know, just to--how this would happen, that you--you'll never see your child again.  You know, just how casually that that could happen.  So you know, it's hard to describe it, as I was happy with it, but it was definitely like a really meaningful experience on all, every level.  You know, like as an African American, as a filmmaker.

Speaker 1: One thing I remember--you mentioned it, went from the Haitian Revolution, 1791, all the way through--and the--I think it was the first time I heard, outside of my friends discussing it, the insertion of the Haitian Revolution into the story of African Americans here.  And it played--the Haitian Revolution played a big role in shaping how we were going to be treated in this country.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did--was that surprising to you, and did that make you feel differently about being a Haitian, or did it change your--I mean or--
Speaker 2: Did it make me be more proud to be (laughter)?  Well, it definitely explained a lot about Haiti, you know what I mean, and why the United States has had such a contemptuous relationship with Haiti.  But I mean that's one of those cases where, like the [President] Thomas Jefferson role in the Haitian Revolution is--I mean it's so calculated and so terrible. You know what I mean?  Just that--I mean, for someone of Jefferson's sort of intellectual depth, you know what I mean, to be so kind of petty about, you know what I mean, other people's freedoms. You know, it's one of those things about American history that you just--that's hard to reconcile, you know.  And I don't even think that's being a black person.  I just think like as an American, if you look at the, you know, the good things and the bad things, it's hard sometimes to make that story go together, you know, that--
Speaker 1: Now, did you find in the research, stories of white people who were--who we never lionized--who are deserving of that?
Speaker 2: I think there a lot of white people that were--I mean I think the majority of white people were decent people.  You know, just like in any group of people, I think the majority of people are going to be decent, good, people.  And there were a lot of people who resisted like the sort of intimate brutality of slavery. You know what I mean? That didn't go out of their way to hurt people or separate people from their children or beat them, or whatever.  They might have benefitted from kind of the free labor, but they weren't, you know, brutal.  And I think that was probably the majority of slave owners.  I think the people that were the Thomas Jeffersons, frankly, of the world--I think were a minority, you know.  And I think that what surprised me about the Thomas Jefferson intervention in Haiti is that he took it so personally--you know. That he really made it his mission to shut that thing down, you know.  And being the father of, you know, liberty and, you know equality of all men--it's just, you know, it's just ironic.  It's one of those, like, fundamental American ironies that you just have to accept as a part of who we are.
Story_ID: 642235
Speaker 1: Now, were there any stories that--in the process of making this documentary ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'], are there any stories that you--well, were, was the whole subject matter new to you, or was it--I mean you were a history (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I had--having been an African American studies minor at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I knew a lot about slavery already.  But I didn't, I mean I hadn't ever gone in depth in the stories in the same kind of way, you know.  So, I mean there were just a lot of fascinating things.  Like I'm from, I grew up in Memphis [Tennessee], right.  So, I knew very little about the history of that region, which is a very interesting (laughter) history.  Because Mississippi--like the part of Mississippi that's like Tunica--that part, you know, was originally like this very Bohemian kind of place where there's like lot of permissiveness, a kind of a free love commune--was the main thing happening there, you know.  And the two main founders of Memphis were both connected to this story of this weird little episode in American history (laughter) which--not which I ever, you know, had heard of or would ever have known.  And it was kind of fascinating and funny, but isolated, you know.  I mean it wasn't the norm.  It wasn't even--it didn't make into the film, but it was one of those stories that you learn.  It's like, that's interesting, that explains a lot about--you know what I mean--the blues, (laughter) because it was definitely out there, an outlier.  Because it was the farthest reaches of humanity, you know, of Western civilization, as far as the colonists knew.  You know, when you got out to Mississippi, you might as well have been, you know, at the edge of the earth.  So, people went there to escape, you know, sort of conventionality, and your typical mores of the time, you know.  So--
Story_ID: 642236
Speaker 1: Who were the historical consultants on your segment?
Speaker 2: In my show?  David Blight; this historian Norrece Jones, who was at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], who was really, really helpful in a lot of ways--
Speaker 1: Right he's from South Carolina, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  He was one of our interviewees, and he was very articulate about like black men in particular.  Because we had a focus on fathers, you know, and just how fathers weren't really considered, you know, part of the slave family as mothers and children.  Like, nobody talks about separating fathers from their children, you know.  And Norrece had done a lot around that.  And then I had all the--you know, rebellions happen during my time--like, all the thwarted rebellions like Denmark Vesey, Gabriel [Gabriel Prosser], and then Nat Turner.  So, you know, Norrece was really good about those.  And he was just really supportive of the project.  Like, he's one of our scholars that was just very fun to be with.  Margaret Washington was one.  She was great.  And then I had some specific ones around--I had a story on Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, I had this guy Jeffrey Leath who used to be the pastor of Richard Allen's church.  He's now in Nashville [Tennessee].  I just ran into him recently.  But he now is a pastor in Nashville.  But he talked about Richard Allen, you know, from a--and I had a dece- one of the descendants of Jefferson's [President Thomas Jefferson] slaves, who has a really brief but powerful appearance, you know, in the film.  Who am I leaving out?  Julius, Julius Dunne [sic. Julius Scott]?  There was a scholar. Julius--I can't remember his name.  He was one of the Haiti scholars.  He was really good about Haiti.  John Edgar Wideman, I interviewed.  One thing I was really fascinated by, in my particular time period, was technology.  And I read in one of the books about Philadelphia that in 1793, this French aeronaut, who had like been a pioneer in ballooning, had his first voyage to the United States.  And he went from Philly--like downtown Philly--somewhere out, out of the city.  And I just became very fascinated about like--what this would be like if you were like a farmer outside of Philly, and you saw this. (Laughter) Like, what you would think?  You know, because you have no frame of reference for man's space flight, you know what I mean.  If you saw this guy in this big basket flying by--and like how that must have been just a moment where people thought, oh, my god, like what's going to happen next?  Like the iPhone, you know.  Like, oh, my god, you can do this with your phone?  And then that really--so many things happened: like the cotton gin, photography, the train, the steam locomotion.  Like, so many things were happening so rapidly that people's sense of what was possible and what, you know, meant to--like, you know, where human history was going, you know, was just so erratically, you know, shaken up.  I mean it's very similar to now, with the Internet and then mobile and--you know, like, you just don't know what's going to happen next.  And I think there was that sense in the early 19th century that--like I mean, yeah, early--right, 19th century--that (laughter) that anything could happen, you know, anything was possible. Which I think gave a lot of hope to a lot of enslaved people and a lot of oppressed people. And like gave a lot of hope to the Haitians, you know, that they could in fact do this thing that had never been done, you know, and throw off like this imperial overlord, even though they had no money, no weapons, no, you know.  They just had the people and the desire.

Speaker 1: 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'] aired--?
Speaker 2: In '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: In '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: Ninety-nine [1999].
Speaker 1: Ninety-nine [1999], okay.  And now, in '99 [1999], you worked for, you went to work for--now, you didn't stay with--
Speaker 2: With Pete- with Orlando [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell]?
Speaker 1: With Orlando, yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  I ended up going back.  I ended up working with him again, but I left.  Immediately after 'Africans' I went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] for about ten months.
Speaker 1: Is this when you worked for Smash Advertising?
Speaker 2: No, that was after.
Speaker 1: Oh, that was after, okay.
Speaker 2: That was to work on a project with Robert Townsend.  That was, you know, it was 1999.  So, everybody was doing 20th century projects.  Like, you know, the end of 20th century kind of thing.  So, Disney [The Walt Disney Company] and Showtime did a series called 'The 20th Century' that had feature filmmakers partnered with documentary filmmakers to make documentaries about different topics--humor, I don't--ours was about sex--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the 20th century.  There--you know, I think there were ten of them.  One was visions of the future in the 20th century ['Future in the 20th Century: Yesterday's Tomorrows'; 'The 20th Century: Yesterday's Tomorrows'].
Speaker 1: And these were aired on--?
Speaker 2: Showtime.
Speaker 1: Showtime, right, right.  I remember that series, yeah, yeah. Okay.  So this is the first series of documentaries you made that had--didn't have anything to do with African Americans per se?
Speaker 2: Well, it was only second documentary (laughter) I really worked on.  I mean, I worked on one ['Street Soldiers'] with [HistoryMaker] Avon Kirkland about [HistoryMaker] Joe Marshall, who was this guy who started the thing called the Omega Boys Club in Oakland [California] that was--that intervened with young boys and helped them go to college and stuff.  But I was a PA [production assistant] on that in graduate school [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And other than that, the only other thing I had really worked on was 'Africans in America.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I produced my own student films, obviously.  But, so, this was the second thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Robert thing.  But yeah, it was the first.  I mean, he--you know he's black obviously.  And he--and at the time he had a very successful sitcom.  And he had like a--his production company was pretty notable in the sense that he employed a lot of really talented black people--a lot, that, you know.  And a lot of other shows that were being produced that were African American themed--even with the creators--didn't necessarily have, I think, that level of depth in terms of the talent pool, you know, that he did.  His--the woman that I worked directly for is now the head of BET [Black Entertainment Television]. Like the head of TV for BET.  And she worked with him for like a long time, and she was my boss when I was out there.  It was an interesting experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay, so this is 'Sex in the 20th Century' ['From Behind Closed Doors: Sex in the 20th Century'], and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Story_ID: 642238
Speaker 1: And then I worked for Smash Advertising, The History Channel [History] after that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And well what kind of work did you produce for them?
Speaker 1: They--The History Channel was just starting to do their international sort of stuff.  And so, they wanted to have a, essentially, a branding campaign of short films about important moments in world history.  So, I produced a series of short films about world history for them.
Speaker 2: For instance, what were the--?
Speaker 1: One was about the University of Timbuktu [Timbuktu, Mali].  One was about the plague in Eastern Europe and how--it was probably the most interesting one to me--was like all these churches started constructing their altars out of human remains, out of bones.  Like the altar, the cross--the everything.  It was really, there were several of these in Eastern Europe.  And the clerics did it as a way to remember, you know, sort of the frailty of human life, the importance of--you know what I mean--like maintaining the spirit so you would have an afterlife.  But it was very creepy and weird.  And the fact that they were still maintained was even weirder, you know.  So, that was the first time I went to Eastern Europe.  And--
Speaker 2: So where did you go to?
Speaker 1: To the Czech Republic.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we also did one about the Hungarian Revolution, so we went to Budapest [Hungary].
Speaker 2: Now, the revolution of '56 [1956]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we did one about Kwame Nkrumah.  We did one about Josephine Baker, and World War II [WWII].  We did one about Mao's wife [Jiang Qing], but we didn't go to China (laughter).
Speaker 2: Is that the wife who is the actress?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, one of the Gang of Four?
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And we did one about the Panama Canal.  It was right when the Panama Canal was about to change hands.  Yeah, and they, they were really fascinating.  It was probably the best job I ever had, I mean, just in terms of what it was, you know.  It was really fun and interesting, and we got to travel all over the world and, you know.  And they were very cool to work with, The History Channel people.
Story_ID: 642239
Speaker 1: So, working on a project like that, what, what are your days like?  I mean what do you--?
Speaker 2: Well, varied, because if we were--I mean we spent a lot of time prod- you know, like doing research and development on the shows.  And we had to pitch--like, say we did--I think we did end up doing ten or twelve of these shows, right.  So, we probably pitched thirty.  And then The History Channel [History] said who they wanted, and which stories they wanted.  And then we wrote scripts for those and we got those.  You know, so it had that whole level of pre-production before we went into the field.  And then there's a lot of archival research on that, because we could only really go forward on things where we have the archival assets, and not everything does.  Some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you had to have enough photos and enough--
Speaker 2: Right, footage.  And they didn't want a lot of photos, they wanted footage, you know.  Because cable--PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] will tolerate a lot of stills, but cable, you know, wants it to be a little bit more--
Speaker 1: So, when you take a story like the University of Timbuktu [Timbuktu, Mali], you know, how would you--would you have to go there and shoot footage?
Speaker 2: So, we went there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we shot--yeah, because that's a place where obviously there's no archival footage (laughter).  So, and that was, I mean an amazing experience, you know.  And we shot in Bamako [Mali] also, because all the experts were from Bamako.  But then, you know, we would spend--we would go--I worked with an associate producer, and we would travel together.  And then we would pick up crews everywhere we went.  So, we had like a German crew in--for Munich [Germany].  We did the Munich Olympics story [1972 Summer Olympics, Munich, Germany].  And then, you know, we took that crew with us to the Czech Republic.  And then we flew to Ghana and picked up a crew there.  And then we flew to Mali and picked up a crew there, you know.
Speaker 1: So, these were half hour shows, right? That's what you're saying?
Speaker 2: No, they were short.  They were like maybe ten minutes.  They were, they were short.  But they were--they were really to give the channel an identity, you know, because it was just starting to get people interested.  And they had done a series through the same advertising company [Smash Advertising].  That's why I ended up going through this advertising company.  Of one minute shorts with Sam Waterston, where he would tell a one minute story about some- something from history that was just very fascinating.  So, they were building on that concept with this longer interstitial series.  And it didn't have like a huge budget.  It wasn't like, you know, we were flying around first class, you know, doing this lavishly.  But it was just fun to be able to get--meet and work with people from the place where we were shooting and, you know, who had, you know, understood sort of how to get things done.
Speaker 1: How much, what was the budget for the typical show, I guess, around--?
Speaker 2: I don't remember because I--I mean that was the only reason it was good--is that it was a good experience--is that was probably the only time that I didn't, that I wasn't, I didn't have to keep track of that.  I mean obviously we had to come in on our budget.  But I didn't have to manage that part of the production (laughter).  So--because that's a, you know, big part of filmmaking, and it's not the fun part.  You know, it's really managing scarce resources.
Story_ID: 642240
Speaker 1: At some point you started working with the National Civil Rights Museum [Memphis, Tennessee], right?  Was this after you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's when--so, I did the thing ['Behind Closed Doors: Sex in the 20th Century'] with Robert Townsend.  And then I did the thing [for The History Channel] with Smash [Smash Advertising].  And then I went back to working with Orlando, because he had started developing a new series called 'Matters of Race.'  And he moved his office from Boston [Massachusetts] to New York [New York], which is where I had moved by that time.  So, we started working--you know, I started working for him again.  And the aspiration of the production company was to really work in public television, work for museums--basically work on a variety of different kinds of program, programming, that spoke to, you know, sort of social justice, African American--the kind of issues that Orlando's work had been about.  I ended up working for him, or with him, on and off for about ten years.  And I mean the thing that he really like I think impressed upon me, you know, was this idea of why it was so important to have non-commercial media--you know, to have media that really was a document of history and culture and experience that wasn't mediated by money, you know, the marketplace.  I learned a lot working with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so, in--and so you were--[HistoryMaker] Orlando Bagwell's project in 2000, is that--?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think we started probably working on it the very end of '99 [1999].  And then that, 'Matters of Race,' aired in 2003 at the civil rights museum.  I think we completed it in 2002.
Speaker 1: All right.  What was the scope of 'Matters of Race'?  What was the--?
Speaker 2: It was four one hour shows about like contemp- it was also like the other side of 'The 20th Century' project where--the 21st century looking forward.  Like, what is the United States going to look like?  So, a lot of it was about changing demographics in Los Angeles [California], in North Carolina, and among native people.  How are things looking different, you know, going forward than they had been?  And then the final show looked at--sort of gave a platform to different youth voices.  One about mixed race, one about native identities, and one about the census, you know, like how meaningful that was as a tool (laughter). Or not.  But it was really an identity, like looking at American identity at the beginning of the 21st century.
Speaker 1: Did you feel at the time--now this is the turn of the century.  Did you feel like in 2000 that things were changing in some way that--you know, or there was a--that this was actually marking some kind of change, going forward from what had been?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean there's some stories--like the story in North Carolina.  And this is the series I mentioned--where I realized like oh, I'm an immigrant.  Like, I'm a first generation American.  You know, because a lot of the stories were about--like the North Carolina story was in the South, obviously, where--in a community that had formerly been half black and half white, which was now a third Latina, and was dealing with issues around language and other cultures where people--they had never entertained these ideas before. About people who came from El Salvador or people who came from--not Mexico--but another Spanish speaking American, you know, place.  And so, it really--it wasn't so much like--I mean I guess it wasn't so binary, about like are things different?  It was more like, things have changed for sure since the Civil Rights Movement, and we haven't really talked about the ways that they've changed.  You know, we're still talking about things as though it's 1970 when, you know, the language that we use needs to change, and the frame that we're looking at it through needs to change.  So, it was interesting.  I mean it was definitely interesting.  But, you know, right in the middle of our production, 9/11 [September, 11, 2001] happened.  So, then that changed it even more.  You know what I mean--it changed sort of the nature of even like how we were thinking about what we were doing.  I mean, we were all on the road shooting when 9/11 happened.
Story_ID: 642241
Speaker 1: All right, so 9/11 [September 11, 2001], tell us about that.  It seems to me you have a story about 9/11.
Speaker 2: Well, I--I do have a story about 9/11.  I was--I had met my--the guy who is now my husband [Grant Clark], in 2001 in South Africa.  And I went back to South Africa for the racism conference [World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance].  I don't know if you remember.  The UN [United Nations] had a big racism conference in September of 2011 [sic. 2001].  And it was big here, because the United States walked out on the conference, the delegation.  And so, I had been at this thing.  And I had come home on September 10.  I had flown into JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York], taken a taxi from JFK to LaGuardia [LaGuardia Airport, New York, New York], and then flown to South Dakota.  I hadn't even gone home.  I lived in New York [New York] then, but I hadn't even gone home.  I'd gone straight to South Dakota because we were going to start filming on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation the next day, on 9/11.  So, I had been traveling, you know, for like thirty-five hours by the time I got to Nebraska.  And I just went to sleep in a small hotel right outside Pine Ridge, and got up in the morning to call Orlando [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell] to say, "I'm here," and, you know, "we're going to get started."  And I went in to get a cup of coffee and this thing was unfolding on TV.  And there were people in, you know, in the little hotels where the little breakfast room.  So, I went there to get coffee, and there were people just, you know, with their mouths hanging open watching TV.  And it was impossible to make out what was happening by looking at the TV, you know what I mean--it just none of it made sense.  And then the people starting explaining to me what was going on.  And of course, our office was in New York at this time.  A lot of my relatives were in New York.  And the ones that weren't in New York were in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], with the exception of my dad [Humphrey Jones, Sr.].  So, it was just--and we're on this Native American reservation, you know.  It was just a very surreal moment, you know.  So, I called Orlando.  I called ROJA [ROJA Productions], like, the company, you know, the office.  And where our office was in Harlem--you know Harlem is the most elevated part of Manhattan [New York].  So, they were going up and down from the roof, because they could see the World Trade Center [New York, New York].  And they saw like the tower, the second tower fall, you know.  And everybody is describing this.  And I mean it was just--like it was, I mean I'm sure you remember.  But it was impossible to assimilate this information.  You know, so we're kind of stunned and then we're not sure what to do, you know.  But at first, you know, it was like this shocking thing had happened.  Like, I guess we should still go do these interviews we're going to do.  I mean, we really didn't know what to do.  So we went, and of course, everybody was, you know, just kind of--there was this really like deep sense of what was happening in the context of American history, you know what I mean.  Because you're at Wounded Knee [South Dakota], you know, and then this thing is happening.  And it just all was--it was a very overwhelming kind of thing.  We end up just, you know, "Hey, we got to--everybody just go back to the hotel."  And, you know, that's all, just regroup.  And that's when we really started to understand what had happened, you know, and how significant, you know, it was.   And we couldn't, we couldn't leave South Dakota for five days, you know.  And then to come back home and go across the 125th Street bridge [Harlem River Lift Bridge, New York, New York], and all you see coming from the bottom of Manhattan is smoke, you know.  It was like--and having just come from this racism conference where, you know, it was just like (gesture) it was crazy.  It took a while to recover from that.  I mean I think it took everybody a while to recover from that.
Story_ID: 642242
Speaker 1: Right after you finished the project for Orlando [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell], you worked with the National Civil Rights Museum [Memphis, Tennessee] on a piece?
Speaker 2: Well, actually we were doing both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At the same time?
Speaker 2: --at the same time.  Yeah, we were doing both at the same time.  I think the civil rights museum might have actually gone into production first.
Speaker 1: So, what was the project at the National Civil Rights Museum?
Speaker 2: They, at that time they had just acquired the boarding house where they think James Earl Ray fired the shots across the street to the Lorraine.  So, they were expanding the museum to encompass the boarding house.  And they wanted the boarding house part of the museum to really focus on what had happened since '68 [1968].  So, there was a lot about sort of the legacy of--you know, the legacy of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], not just the Civil Rights Movement.  And so, there's a big part of it about South Africa, which was why I went to the racism conference [World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance].  But so, redid, we redid a lot of media in the old part of the museum, so that it would connect.  Because previously, like, when you got to the room that was King was staying in--I don't know if you've been to the museum--but when you get to the room where he staying in at the Lorraine--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the old Lorraine Motel [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Right.  That's the end of the experience at the museum.  But because with the expansion that continued, they had to redo all the media, you know. Because the rhythm of the story that they were telling was different when they added this other chapter.  So, we redid some of the existing exhibits, and then we created several new exhibits for the new space, and a new introductory video that set up the bigger experience, and stuff like that.  So, it was good.  It was a really good project.
Speaker 1: So, this is--correct me if I'm wrong.  But you're like producing--it's almost like when you do an exhibit--it's almost like producing a documentary, except it's multimedia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were several short documentaries.  There was short--most of them were videos.  And then there were a couple that were only audio.  Like, there was one where there's a tunnel that connects the Lorraine to the boarding house.  So, in that tunnel, it's multimedia.  Like, there's stills on the wall; and then there's audio and there's some music.  And you move through time, because you move from '68 [1968], you know.  So, that one was more of a conceptual multimedia.  But a lot of the installations were videos, were short documentaries.
Story_ID: 642243
Speaker 1: When these two projects are up--now, is that when you go to the National Black Programming Consortium [Black Public Media]?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I hadn't--I mean the executive director of the National Black Programming Consortium, Mable Haddock, who also had become kind of a mentor to me and a very good friend. They were--the National Black Programming Consortium was the funder of 'Matters of Race.'  They were the--they along with the other minority consortia--the Native American [Vision Maker Media], Latino [Latino Public Broadcasting], Pacific Islander [Pacific Islanders in Communications] and Asia American [Center for Asian American Media]--they brought that project to PBS [Public Broadcasting Service].  So, I got to know Mable even, you know, better through that project.  I had known her previously through the independent film scene and Black Film Review, but then got to know her better through 'Matters of Race.'  But I, you know, when I finished 'Matters of Race,' I moved to South Africa, and I was there for three years.  And then when I--I came back because Mable was leaving the NBPC, and they were looking for a new executive director.  And so, I applied for that job, and got that job.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you doing in South Africa for three years?
Speaker 2: I--you know, hanging out. No (laughter).  I mean, I got married--
Speaker 1: Now, this is right after, this is--now, your husband [Grant Clark] is from South Africa?
Speaker 2: He's South African, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, when I met him, he was living in South Africa.  And you know, I felt like I wanted a break, you know.  I mean, I think those were like pretty intense years following 9/11 [September 11, 2001], and especially with the kind of work we were doing.  And, you know, I just--it was a good time for me to leave.  You know, we had obviously a lot of conversations about how it was going to work.  You know, whether he was going to move here, or I was going to move there.  And--
Speaker 1: South Africa--I think--now Nelson Mandela had stepped down as president?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was no longer president.  Thabo Mbeki was president (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thabo Mbeki, yeah.
Speaker 2: And so I ended up moving there, originally to Johannesburg [South Africa], and then we moved to Durban [South Africa].  I worked--I worked, did a lot of work for--I still did some work with Orlando [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell] while I was there. Because I actually moved there at the end of 2002.  So, the show aired in the spring of 2003.  Even though it was done, there was, you know, there was always little stuff to do.  And then I did some work with [HistoryMaker] Stanley Nelson, who's another documentary filmmaker, a big documentary filmmaker for PBS.  You know, just writing scripts and writing treatments and proposals, and stuff like that.  And then I did some producing of films, like more line producing--like really producing, not the creative direction, but you know, managing the crew and--
Speaker 1: Resources and stuff?
Speaker 2: Right, finding locations, making sure everything stays on track.  I did some of that.  I worked on a series called 'Ten' [ph.] that was about, you know, ten years after '94 [1994]--oh, that's my stomach--in South Africa.  You know, just a lot of little things, you know.  And then my daughter [Ayana Clark] was born there.
Story_ID: 642244
Speaker 1: And the--and actually when I--well, right before she--like right before she [Jones' daughter, Ayana Clark] was born, I started working with a guy who--there's a big international film festival in Durban [South Africa], which is where we ended up living.  And we were trying to see one of the films in the festival.  And it was no longer showing in the main festival, but they were having these community screenings.  So, we went to one of the screenings.  I can't remember which film it was.  But we went to the screening.  It was in the township right outside Durban.  And it turned out that this township was the only township that had like a real theatre.  Like, they have a thirty-five millimeter projector; they have a thick seat theater, which no townships, at least then had.  And I started talking to the guy who ran this--it was--the theater was part of a cultural arts center.  So, I started talking to this guy about having a film festival at his thing, because there was--you know, they had these little community screenings in townships.  But otherwise, you had to go into city centers to see any kind of black films or, you know, documentaries, or things that would be relevant to the communities in the townships.  And so, this guy Edmund Mhlongo, he was really very entrepreneurial as an artist, you know.  So, he was totally into this idea, and he thought of it already.  And so, I started working with him to produce this festival, which we did the first one in December of 2004.  And then it's still going on today.  And it was, and we brought in filmmakers--black filmmakers, from Europe, from the states.  And NBPC [National Black Programming Consortium; Black Public Media] was one--supplied--helped us with a lot of the programming.  And that was one of the ways I re-connected with NBPC.  And it was great, it was really fantastic.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the festival?
Speaker 1: It was called--KwaMashu [South Africa] is the name of the township.  So, it was called KwaMashu--
Speaker 2: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 1: It's K-W-A and then capital M, A-S-H-U, but one word.
Speaker 2: KwaMashu film festival.
Speaker 1: KwaMashu, it was called KwaMashu Black Documentary Film Festival [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But then they changed it to KwaMashu African Film Festival.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's still going on today?
Speaker 1: It's still going on.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So and we--like, NBPC, we worked with that--Edmund's--the KwaMashu art center [Ekhaya Multi Arts Centre, KwaMashu, South Africa] on a few projects.  Because, as I said, he's just very forward thinking, the guy that runs it.  So, he like also had this whole digital thing built, you know, there.  So, we worked with them.  Because a lot of the work we've done at NBPC lately has been really exploring digital media and what's the future of that and, you know.  So, we've done little projects with him over the last five years still.
Story_ID: 642245
Speaker 1: So, is it 2005 that you, that you come back to the states?
Speaker 2: Two thousand five [2005], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so did you come back to work with NBPC [National Black Programming Consortium; Black Public Media] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) NBPC, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did your husband [Grant Clark] come back with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so what was your position at NBPC when you came back?
Speaker 2: Executive director.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a good reason to come back, to be the executive director (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: So was it, was it--I mean did--how did you get the job?  Did they offer it to you, or--
Speaker 2: Well, I knew Mable.  And you know, Mable let me know she was stepping down and she would, you know--
Speaker 1: This is Mable--?
Speaker 2: Mable Haddock.
Speaker 1: Okay. Mable Haddock (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was the founding executive director.  So, she had been executive director for twenty-five years.  And, you know, she was ready to step down.  So, she reached out to me and asked me, you know, if I would be interested.  And you know, we talked about it, and I applied.  I mean I wasn't--like they didn't offer it to me, like, you know, on a platter.  But I applied, and went through a pretty rigorous process.  And then--I mean, I think there was some stiff competition, so.  And then, yeah, got the job eventually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 642246
Speaker 1: Now one of the first things that I think that happened when you got there, was Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], right?
Speaker 2: Right, right, at the end.  I started August 1, 2005 and Katrina happened on the 28th I think.
Speaker 1: It was a big hurricane, for those watching this in the future that don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right after.
Speaker 1: We had a huge hurricane that hit New Orleans [Louisiana], the Gulf Coast.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then, and that's sort of how we started with the digital media thing, is that we felt like there's going to be--I mean the real thing I felt was that there's going to be the need for a lot of archival footage from this.  And if you remember watching the news at that time was really frustrating.  Because you didn't get the sense of like how ordinary people--you know, like the voices of ordinary people.  It was very mediated by Anderson Cooper, and you know, like people--news personalities.  And then a lot of famous people got involved as, you know, humanitarians.  And you just didn't get a sense of the people--you know, overwhelmingly black--who were really being impacted.  Like, you didn't get a sense of their voice.  You got a sense of what was happening to them through the perspective of other people.  So, you know, we were trying to facilitate--well, how do we like get the actual archival material from the people themselves, that's not mediated, so that we have an archive for later?  Because we know people are going to make films about this.  It's going to be part of American history.  It's a big thing.  And we started trying to figure out how to make that happen, using sort of available digital media, you know, which had just become available.  I think YouTube just launched that year or something.  And that's really how we started trying to figure out for black public media, how to make this work digitally.
Speaker 1: That's amazing, to think that YouTube launched in 2005.  I never--you know, seems like it's been there forever--
Speaker 2: I know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you think about it.
Speaker 2: I know.  And I think it was later.  I don't even know if it had happened.  Maybe it had happened, but it hadn't really--nobody had heard of it yet.  But it happened maybe that summer or something--earlier.  And Facebook had not happened.  I mean, there were a lot of things that had not happened yet (laughter) that rule the world now.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So, but you know, we learned, like, just through the project of trying to--so, what we tried to do was get this guy who's a filmmaker--but like kind of a novice--partner him with somebody who is more experienced, but in New York [New York], and have him send us media over the Internet.  Because remember it was very hard to get stuff in and out of New Orleans.  And so, we started trying to do this using this video--you know, over the web interfaces and--but what we learned was like it wasn't really ready yet.  At that time, it was hard to do.  But we started getting really interested in like how to do this, you know.  And we got--one of the first people we hired when I started there was this young guy from--who just graduated from NYU [New York University, New York, New York], who is like one of the, you know, a digital native.  Like, he's thirty-one or something now.  But we had him right after NYU, right away.  And he turned out to be a genius, (laughter) and really sort of shaped like the way that we responded to digital in a way that I think, you know, helped us be a leader, you know, in terms of public television making that turn.
Story_ID: 642247
Speaker 1: Right, right.  This is just before, now--I think it was in 2008 that all of the--that analog was officially stopped.  And they started--
Speaker 2: Something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) digital television.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when they were doing the--
Speaker 1: The FCC [Federal Communications Commission], yeah, required it.
Speaker 2: I mean, I think that's less important for consumers, you know.  I think that was an equipment issue, not really a content issue.  I mean what's been more profound, I think for content, is that--the fact that this means of production is so cheap and available, and the platforms to get it out are also free and available--that it's kind of undermined the professional craft of documentary filmmaking.  It's very hard now to be like an (gesture) independent documentary filmmaker, because there's no grant making that really supports that.  Or, public television really doesn't support it in the same way.  And films like--I mean, say, something like 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'], even 'Matters of Race,' which requires traveling and time and relationship building--I mean these things cost money, unless you're rich and you can do it, you can pay for it yourself.  And there's increasingly less money available to do that kind of work, you know.  So, it's been kind of like a catch-22 for filmmakers.  Again, one way, it's raised the profile of a lot of different kind of work.  But in another way, it's made it harder to do the work.
Story_ID: 642248
Speaker 1: Tell us about the New Media Institute.
Speaker 2: So New Media Institute is what really grew out of the Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] project.  And it was like we were like, oh my god, we don't know anything about this.  Like, how do we learn about this?  And so, we started doing research on technologists.  And it turns out there are a lot of black pioneers of the technology.  Like the person who--one of the authors of Flash [Adobe Flash], you know, the Flash platform, is an African American from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And so, we--and there are a lot of people that have been involved from the beginning, trying to understand this kind of media technology.  So, we thought we should bring these people together with our--the black documentary filmmakers we support, and leaders in public television to say like, well, how are we going to--as public television, or as people of color on public television, how are we going to respond to this?  And what are the opportunities, and what are the challenges?  And so, we did it for five years.  We had this annual gathering of leaders as well as content makers to explore different ways to use digital media in our work.
Speaker 1: So, this is, this just ended.  I mean you just stopped doing this in 2011.
Speaker 2: We stopped doing it in, was it 2011?
Speaker 1: Or two thousand--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened in 2000, after 2008, actually, is we transitioned the New Media Institute into the Public Media Corps, which was supposed to take those ideas and kind of operationalize them.  So, train young people who can act as intermediaries between public television and the public in using digital media tools and, you know what I mean--becoming part of the conversation.  So, the last couple of years we still had the gathering, but it was in the context of Public Media Corps.  And now they just end, yeah.  And then that actually transitioned into something else, which is still ongoing, which is using the--
Speaker 1: What's the new one called?
Speaker 2: Well, it's still called Public Media Corps, but it's like now focused on using the same kind of tools and the same idea, but focused on education.
Story_ID: 642249
Speaker 1: The Public Media Corps then--I mean when it was initia- when it was initially formed, was to train not-for-profits and individuals to produce public interest media?
Speaker 2: Well, when it was really--I mean the real, the real idea was to sort of have--let me back up.  One of the challenges we've had, like NBPC [National Black Programming Consortium; Black Public Media] has had, is that we're funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to support diversity in public media, but really, public television.  And that's challenging, because neither the public nor PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] is really that interested in, in that, you know what I mean.  Like the, (laughter) like the African American public is not like banging at the door of PBS to get included.  And PBS doesn't really think there's anything wrong with what they're already doing. You know what I mean?  So, you know, this has always been a challenge, of how this organization is situated.  And it's not just NBPC.  There's also Latino Public Broadcasting, and Center for Asian American Media, and the Pacific Islanders in Communications, the Vision Maker Media, who represents Native Americans, you know.  And there's--I mean people agree that, yes, public media should be diverse.  But that, you know, that's as far as it goes, you know what I mean.  So, our job is kind of to create demand for this, as well as provide the content, you know.
Speaker 1: So, this is a serious issue, then? Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a huge issue, and one that I, you know, I've really banged my head against the wall for many years now, trying to figure out a way to make it work better.  Because you know, what people, I think, fail to like really take seriously is that--like, you know, you mentioned 'The Civil War,' the Ken Burns show; there's 'Eyes on the Prize'; there's 'The Great Depression'; and there's, you know, any number of things.  And they really form the--an important document about American history--like what's important, who's important, what's happened, you know.  And by not being a part of that, you know, you're leaving yourself out of your own legacy, you know.  But because nobody watches public television, they don't, you know, they don't--the dots don't connect in the way that I think that they should.  So, it's a problem, it's a big problem.
Story_ID: 642250
Speaker 1: Now, you've served as a executive producer for a number of productions, PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] productions, like 'Promised Land,' 'Soul Food Junkies,' 'When the Drum is Beating.'  But you're kind of the overarching (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  I mean, we're, you know, we're the executive producer, in terms of like marshalling some of the resources and the funding, and advocating for the work, you know, within public television.  But we don't creatively have input on that work.  I mean, those films were produced by independent filmmakers who completely controlled the content and the copyright of those films.
Speaker 1: So, if I'm the independent filmmaker and I have an idea, I come to you and pitch it, and you have funds from public broadcasting to help me produce--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  We have funds to help, to help facilitate this content getting done, and getting made available to the public.  And we do that in a variety of different ways.  I mean sometimes we do that by giving grants to independent filmmakers like Byron Hurt, who made 'Soul Food Junkies,' and also made 'Hip Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes.'  Like, we've supported all his films.  And we also do that through a series that we present on public television.  Not through PBS, but through American Public Television and WGBH World, called 'AfroPoP: The Ultimate Cultural Exchange.'  And those films are mostly films we acquire.  They might require some editing.  But we executive produced a series that packages and curates those films.  And in rare cases we do directly produce content, like '180 Days: A Year Inside of an American High School' [sic. '180 Days: A Year Inside an American High School'] which we produced as a response to an initiative at CPB [Corporation for Public Broadcasting] called American Graduate, that was looking at the drop out crisis that obviously disproportionately affects African Americans and Latinos.  But we wanted to pitch a show that really took a really in depth look at one school through the perspective of the people--you know, the teachers, the kids, the families that made up the community of that school--so, without any experts, without any mediation, just to hear from the people themselves about, you know, what the challenges were, what the opportunities were, what the--you know, what the nature of the community was.  So, that was just recently this year.
Speaker 1: '180 Days,' right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: And we were also able to bring on a lot of young filmmakers, and to work in different capacities as a way for them to really learn, you know what I mean, like on the job training, which when I first worked with Orlando [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell], that was the way things worked.  You know, that people worked on the big series, and you maybe came in as a PA [production assistant] or an associate producer, and were able to really learn why you do it.  But because now everything is smaller and shorter, there aren't as many opportunities for young people to learn, you know.  So, we created that with an idea of like having a franchise.  We could bring people in at different levels and help them move to the next level.
Story_ID: 642251
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about the Peabody Award [George Foster Peabody Award].  Did--?
Speaker 2: That was for 'Africans in America' ['Africans in America: America's Journey through Slavery'].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's way back in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This would have been in two--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That was in two thousand and--I mean 19--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-nine [1999].
Speaker 1: Nine [1999], right, okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: All right.  I had it here, but I didn't have it attached to anything.  So, all right, so, we're past that.  But that's, that's significant.  So, this problem that we have in terms of popular culture being so pervasive--and there's so many choices on cable nowadays that people--I mean you can watch cartoons all day if you wanted to, into the night, twenty-four hours a day.  But in terms of our community, you say we don't watch public television as such, not like we should or we could.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I think like public television was at one point a time--like a place where there's a lot of experimentation.  There was a lot of, you know, a lot of independent filmmakers got their start in public television.  There's a lot of, you know, risk taking with form as well as content and subject matter.  And I think because of how public television's positioned, you know, with public funding and with--you know, especially over the last few years serious attacks, you know, from one political party--that it's becoming a lot more conservative.  And I think it's been like, become a lot less willing to take certain kinds of risks.  And one of the risks is simply allowing--giving unknown, untested people a lot of resources, you know what I mean.  If you invest a million dollars in an historical documentary, you need to know it's going to get finished, and it's going to be something that can be broadcast.  Otherwise, you're wasting taxpayer money, you know what I mean.  And nobody can take a chance in doing that.  So, it just means that the opportunities--I mean both for content makers or people who might have something to say--but also in terms of what gets talked about, you know.  Like, the opportunities have just dramatically collapsed, so that you just, you don't have--I mean you have two kinds of stalwarts on public television: 'POV' and 'Independent Lens,' which showcase independent documentaries.  They share the same timeslot, so you're talking about one hour a week for this kind of content, you know.  And otherwise, it's all big franchises that are mostly produced by big stations like WGBH [WGBH-TV, Boston, Massachusetts] and WNET [WNET-TV, New York, New York], and very little space, for, you know, for independent voices of any kind.  So, I think the kind of subject matter distances the audience, who doesn't see themselves or their interests reflected.  So, they're not invested, you know.  And because they're not invested, they're not counted, you know.  When the decision makers look at the stakeholders, they're not counted, because they're not invested.  You know what I mean? It's like a vicious cycle.
Speaker 1: You know, we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Jennifer Lawson, you know, of public television, and we were lamenting the, the loss of shows like 'Soul!' and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'Black Journal' and other shows that used to be on public television.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And we talked--we celebrated a lot of other things that come along that a lot of people didn't see--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For one reason or another, so--
Speaker 2: Right.  Like, her series on African, the, her African series ['Africa'] was I thought really powerful.  But very few people, you know, know about it today, you know.  I mean and they're doing, they're actually doing a film about soul.  I was just at a meeting on Friday about it.  I think I mentioned like [HistoryMaker] Sonia Sanchez and The Last Poets.  Did I mention that to you?  And it was such a, it was so amazing like to be in the room with all those people who are so important, you know, culturally, and hear about all the ways that we're using art and culture to really speak to people and what Ellis Haizlip did and--I mean it was so inspiring on one level and so depressing on another level.  Because I can't look right now at anything that is comparable, you know.  I think that there are things that people are trying to do that we want to support, you know what I mean.  And we want to help find a scale for them.  But right now, it's just--it's a weird transitional time between one kind of media and another kind of media.  And I think those voices will always be there.  I mean, I don't think that we lack the vision or the creativity or the, you know, the desire.  It's, there's just a disconnect between the platforms right now and the, the content.  You know, like matching the two up and figuring out a new model to support meaningful content.  We're just in the middle of figuring that out right now.  I mean, I don't think anybody has got it figured out.
Story_ID: 642252
Speaker 1: What are your future plans with National Black Programming Consortium [Black Public Media], or do you see yourself moving on to something else, or?
Speaker 2: Well, I think this question that we're talking about is really something that, it takes up a lot of time for me.  I really want to figure out a way to support young content creators. Not even young--like, content creators.  I feel like I got so much support, you know, when I was becoming a filmmaker--you know, becoming a storyteller, becoming a writer.  And I don't feel like the same structures are there to support the generation that's sort of coming into their own now.  And I think as a result, I think we're losing a lot of important voices.  And I think there is a way to connect these dots.  I just think that it's gotta be somebody's actual job to do that, you know.  I don't think any of--you know, this isn't public television's problem to solve, frankly, you know.  And I think we have to prioritize it as a, as what we're doing, in order to get somewhere with it.  It can't be something we're also doing in addition to the work that we do at NBPC--the primary core work we do, which is to support documentary film.  So, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about like what I'm going to do next in that context, you know.  So, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: So, do you think that we have the resources in our community to really support the kind of programming that we need?
Speaker 2: I do.  I think we have the resources in our community.  And I also think that it is a, it should be a primary function of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  I think it is something that should be supported by the public to some degree.  And I think it's just that we're living with an outdated structure that doesn't, that unfortunately, doesn't engage enough people, you know.  So, I think we have--we have the resources in our community, we have the resources in our country, and we have the resources culturally.  We just have to put everything together somehow.  And I think that's just the struggle right now: that so much has changed and things haven't really settled, you know.  And some people have been grasping at straws and trying to create things on the fly.  And I think now we're reaching a point where we really have to start institutionalizing things that work, you know, so that they can have a bigger impact.
Speaker 1: Is there any project that you've been a part of, you think that had--what project have you been a part of, you think, that has had the biggest impact on the general public, you know, in terms of our community?
Speaker 2: I mean the biggest--it's hard.  I mean, that's a hard question to answer, because I think that the work that we're doing now is going to have the biggest impact.  I just don't think we're going to see the fruit of it now, you know what I mean.  I think it's, I mean, one thing I feel really feel really good at- about at NBPC, I think we've laid a lot of important foundations.  But now, it's like we gotta build on the foundations to have an impact.  But I think what we're doing now will have the biggest impact, you know.  I mean, because I think it's bigger than a particular film, or a particular piece of work.  It's really about how we, you know, shape our response to history and storytelling and culture for this generation, you know.  I mean, I feel like I was the beneficiary of the Henry Hamptons and the Orlandos [HistoryMaker Orlando Bagwell], you know, of all that work that went into Blackside [Blackside, Inc.] and into creating those relationships with public television.  And now I think we have to do that same work for, you know, these people that are coming up now, you know--to really support them, so that we have another generation of people who are able to do what we were able to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I was thinking--because you were talking about [HistoryMaker] William Greaves and William Miles, and other people who--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean Bill Greaves, absolutely.  I mean, you know, I mean Bill Greaves is in--well, he's older than Henry even (laughter).  But yeah, I mean that's all--like, you know, Bill Greaves gave birth to, you know, the Orlandos in a real way, you know what I mean.  It's like Bill Miles, all those guys, it's like they paved the way.  And I think we gotta be--make sure we're still paving the way and we're not like, "Oh, we're here now."  You know what I mean?  "We don't need to build any more roads, we're at our destination."  I think we're always going to be paving the way forward.  I mean, we always should be doing that, you know.  And I guess now I'm sort of in that transition, to like I've got to start taking that seriously, and I gotta help pave that way.  You know what I mean--we've been trying to do that, but you know I think we have to like do it in a more focused way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'm impressed with your enthusiasm, and I think you--you know, I'm glad you're willing to keep working on it (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 642253
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could change it?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Major thing?  No. No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are you glad your life took this direction?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you hadn't planned to be a film- you know, to be a filmmaker.
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  Yeah, but I mean I feel like, I feel like the work is the same work that I planned to do.  It's just in a different form.  Like, I don't--I mean I feel very--like I've been very lucky, you know, that my life has taken me to all these interesting places.  I've gotten to meet all these amazing people and have these great experiences, you know.  I feel very lucky the way things have turned out.  I mean of course, there have been challenges but, it's like, in general, I feel very grateful.

Speaker 1: When you look back again at everything you've done to this point, is there any--what today would you consider, I guess, your legacy in this, this field?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't have one yet.  I need about fifteen more years for that.  I mean, I think, I mean I think that because--because of the timing in the last eight years I think that what we're doing now and how--like I said--I mean that will be the most, have the greatest impact, far more than like the actual work I've authored, you know what I mean, as a--up to now.  I think--are these sort of structures that we've sort of started to create, around the future of public media?  I hope, you know, that that will continue to ferment, and that that will be, you know, the thing that, that gives meaning to, you know, to my legacy.

Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family.  Now, you've, you got a daughter [Ayana Clark], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Laughter) She's nine.  She's very bright and very confident. Very, very confident (laughter).  So, she's fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're on the boards of Integrated Media and--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not on the board of Integrated Media Association anymore--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because we just merged with another organization and we relinquished our charter to them.  And that organization is called Greater Public.  And they're still doing the work, but it's, it's integrated into like a more diverse kind of--diverse from a business model standpoint.
Speaker 1: So, it's Greater Public Media?
Speaker 2: It's just called Greater Public.
Speaker 1: Greater Public, okay.
Speaker 2: It's another, it's a non-profit, but we relinquished our charter to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are you still working on the board of WHUT [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, do the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] students produce content for WHUT?
Speaker 2: Not much.  I mean there is a student program called Spotlight [Spotlight Network], but they don't produce--mostly for air.
Speaker 1: Now, I was kind of chagrined by that, because I think in the past they did.  Didn't they?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they ever really did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Some content for--
Speaker 2: I don't really--I don't really understand the relationship between the station and the school.  I mean we used a lot of interns from there. Like on '180 Days' ['180 Days: A Year Inside an American High School'] we did.  And I know the education department does.  And I think they intern a lot on productions.  But there isn't a lot of, (cough) excuse me, there's not a lot of original production at the station right now.  So, it's mostly, you know, acquisitions and.  So, there's not that much for students to do.  But I think they use students in every way that they can.  But the students produce for like the on campus channel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They produce a news show and they produce specials around homecoming and, you know, like things of interest on the campus.
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't discussed before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, I don't know.  Did I answer your question about my daughter? I didn't feel like--or my husband [Grant Clark]? Or--I mean--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what does your husband do?
Speaker 2: He's a journalist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He works for Al Jazeera.
Speaker 1: Does he like the United States?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he does, he does, he does.  I mean, he lived in England before, too.  So, he's also like a global soul, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's strange.  Al Jazeera now seems to be okay to say.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: At one time it was considered to be almost like part of the, you know, Al-Qaeda or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some people still think that. Some people still think that.  Like somebody was just recently telling me that they, their sister has a top secret clearance--that she refuses to turn on that channel because she's afraid, you know, of any repercussions.  I know it's very weird.

Speaker 1: Is there anything else we haven't talked about? Because I have one last question.
Speaker 2: Okay. Uh-oh, is it a whammy (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy; it's just a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be--that's a scary question.  I think that--I mean when I think about--I mean like the--yeah, it is similar to my answer to the last one--all the places that my work has taken me, like I feel like it's all connected by the same impulse.  You know--which is to kind of honor and give voice to I think a very complex and rich history that we have as black, like as African Americans, but also as black people and also as people.  And I think that I would like to be remembered as somebody who really took that seriously, you know, and really tried to be an advocate for that in any way that I could.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Is that good (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That's good, that's good.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
