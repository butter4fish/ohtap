Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The origin, no it's Egyptian.  The origin is Egyptian, and it is actually a nickname.  That's not my given name, but that's how everyone in New York [New York] knows me because I was studying Egyptology about thirty years ago and helping a friend at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] with her master's thesis, and she saw that I was reading this and she picked that name out of the Egyptian 'Book of the Dead,' and she started calling me that as a nickname.  I was playing music at the time with a twelve-piece band and the guys would come over for rehearsal and they heard her calling me that, and they picked it up and then she and her husband introduced me to a producer here in New York City as Khephra, and he flew me to New York to Channel 13 [WNET-TV], I went to work there, that's a whole story.  But he knew me as Khephra and introduced me to everyone in New York as Khephra, it stuck, even my parents [Treneta Davis Burns and HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] call me Khephra.

Story_ID: 506322
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother and your mother's side of the family.  So what was your mother's name, and if you could spell it out for me (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother's name was Treneta Burns, Treneta Cecelia Burns, actually my mother's name was, I believe on her birth certificate, Cecelia Treneta Burns, but she doesn't go by Cecelia even though her family, her siblings call her that occasionally.  But it's T-R-E-N-E-T-A, I believe also that that is my grandmother's name, Cecelia Treneta Burns [sic. Cecelia Treneta Landry Davis], so that's where the name comes from, her mother.
Speaker 1: Where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Los Angeles [California], her family, her parents were also born in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Where did your mother grow up?  Did she also grow up in Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about your mother, and by that I mean what stories do you remember her sharing with you about her childhood?
Speaker 2: That, well about her childhood, you know, our parents, our generation of parents were poor.  My mother's family did reasonably well but still, they were poor, living in Los Angeles, my grandfather had a car, my grandfather was a sanitation worker.
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Sylvester Scott Davis.  He was a garbage man, that's what he did and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is your mother's father?
Speaker 2: This is my mother's father, and all of us kids, my siblings and, and my cousins, we all remember him as this guy with big huge muscles, you know?  Bald head, my--as a matter of fact, my mother hardly remembers, she, we have no pictures of him with hair, (laughter), you know?  But, she said she remembers when he did have hair when she was a very little girl, and he would let her braid it, you know?  Let her braid his hair, I have pictures of him, he was in the [U.S.] Navy, I believe, you know, a cook, that's all you could be was a cook or a janitor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what year--
Speaker 2: --or something.
Speaker 1: --was your mother's father born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--I'm not sure, it was the turn of the century, it was probably like 1900, between 1900 and 1905, I'll have to check on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said he was in the Navy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: World War I [WWI].
Speaker 1: World War I.  Okay what, share experiences he talked with you about World War I?
Speaker 2: He, we never, I only know that from my mother.  I don't think I ever talked to my grandfather about the war, I was still a very young man when he died.  I was probably, I don't know what, maybe just twenty or so, so, you know, early twenties at most, and I don't recall us ever having a conversation about that, that's the kind of thing I would have had a conversation about with him if I had been older and more mature and realized that he wouldn't have been around to answer a bunch of questions that I would have later when I got older and started to be curious about those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So he, after World War I, he returned to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: He, I'm sure he moved to Los Angeles, I don't think he was in Los Angeles at the time he went into the service, because he was from New Orleans.  So, I'm not quite sure how he got to L.A. after the war, I'd have to ask my mother about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well let me just get a description of him, what did he look like?  He was born in New Orleans, so I'm trying to get a feel for, was he Creole, was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he was brown skinned, he was probably, he was probably a little bit fairer complexion than you.  But, 'cause my uncle, his oldest son is your complexion, so I remember him as being brown skinned.  I have pictures of my mother's family, and they kind of range from, you know, between the five siblings, range from your complexion, my uncle, who's still alive, to my mother's complexion, which is, you know, a little darker than me, well about my complexion, you know?  Yeah, she's out in California, where it's sunny all the time, so she's got a tan, that's why she's darker than me, you know?
Speaker 1: So your grandfather moves to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?  At what point did he meet your grandmother and what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Cecelia Treneta Burns, I'm not sure how they met, I remember that she was very ambitious.  She had a job at the, it was probably a utilities company, I started to say the phone company, but it wasn't the phone company, it was a utilities company and she was probably, you know, domestic service or something there, you know, the janitorials, I'm not quite sure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you don't know the name--
Speaker 2: --but it was like an electric com--Pacific Gas and Electric [Pacific Gas and Electric Company], I think, you know?  But she had a job there.
Story_ID: 506323
Speaker 1: How many children did they [Burns' maternal grandparents, Cecelia Treneta Landry Davis and Sylvester Davis] have?
Speaker 2: They had five children.
Speaker 1: And do you know those five children's names in the order in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you?  Just when you get to your mother [Treneta Davis Burns]?
Speaker 2: Sylvester Scott Davis [Sylvester Davis, Jr.], who the family calls Dave.
Speaker 1: And what did Dave end up doing in life?
Speaker 2: Worked for Lockheed Martin, he also went into the--
Speaker 1: As an engineer?
Speaker 2: --service in the [U.S.] Navy.  No, I don't think he was an engineer, but I'm not quite sure what he did for Lockheed Martin--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --but he wasn't an engineer, he, we didn't have those kind of jobs in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, the next one?
Speaker 2: Was Louise [Louise Davis], and I don't know Aunt Louise's middle name.
Speaker 1: And what did Aunt Louise end up doing for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I'd have to ask my mother, she probably worked in Los Angeles [California] for, you know, something like the phone company or something, I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: The third sibling?
Speaker 2: Now see if I had known you were going to ask me all these questions I would have asked someone so that (laughter), so that I could answer them.  The third one was Bettie Davis, and she's also still alive and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they name her after Bette Davis?  No?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then Landry Davis, whose name comes from my grandmother's maiden name, her side of the family were Landrys from New Orleans [Louisiana], so his name was Landry Davis, he passed a few years ago and--
Speaker 1: So your mother was the youngest?
Speaker 2: My mother was the youngest, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what do, so that was your mother's side of the family, so now we're gonna talk about your mother, your mother was the youngest child?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where did your mother, what was?  Where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to school in Los Angeles.  I think she might have gone to Jordan [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], Jordan or Jefferson [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California], I forget which now, but--
Speaker 1: And what neighborhood was this school?
Speaker 2: --this was in Los Angeles, it wasn't Southeast L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I'm not quite sure but it was pretty close, the--I know, what I remember her telling me is that because the family didn't always have enough money to support the five kids which was, you know, the situation on both my mother and father's [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] side.  My mother stayed for a time with her grandmother, and then she also spent a lot of time with a neighbor nearby in the same neighborhood as my grandparents, who I guess, well no she wasn't her godmother because she's my godmother, but we call her Aunt Cora [ph.], and she was my godmother, but she was no relationship, she's just a neighbor that kept my mother when, when her mother couldn't afford to take care of her.  So, and then I don't know, my mother says, you know, she and Aunt Cora grew so close and Aunt Cora wanted to adopt her and then my mother took her back, you know?  But yeah, for many years, my mother lived with my Aunt Cora.  And then, and as I said, this was no relation to us, but then, when I was old--after I moved out of the house, Aunt Cora became senile and my--I guess she got Alzheimer's and my parents took her in, and kept her until she passed, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did your mother ever talk about what L.A. was like in those days?  Because I'm imagining it to be the Wild West, although I know it wasn't.  But why would they, why would your grandfather leave New Orleans and travel so far west?
Speaker 2: Part of the mass migration from New Orleans west for an environment that was less oppressive.  There was mass migrations out of the South and, and folks in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas, instead of coming north, a lot of them went, went west to California, and so, he, I'm sure he was part of that mass migration--
Story_ID: 506324
Speaker 1: I know more about it, my father tells the stories about how he and his family came out west, but yeah, they came out in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's hear about your father's story then, about how they came out west just to--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: What was, what were his stories (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I think my [paternal] grandmother [Nona Bertrand Burns], after she and my [paternal] grandfather separated, my grandmother came out to California from New Orleans [Louisiana] to visit with, I think, one of her brothers who was already out here.  And then she--in the meantime, I think she was writing letters back to my grandfather, perhaps they hadn't split up then yet, I'm getting this fuzzy now, but, she came back eventually and brought the kids out one at a time or sent for, starting with the youngest, starting with my father's youngest sister and brought her out, and then worked, and my father was the last one of his five siblings.  She didn't come back for him, she just had relatives in New Orleans or Biloxi, Mississippi, put him on the train and he was about thirteen years old and I think that was 1938, '39 [1939], something like that and he came out to California.  He was just telling me the other day about that trip on the train when he got to Arizona, and he had never seen that kind of wide open expanse, and a desert and the colors, and he said that made a tremendous impression on him, yeah.
Speaker 2: Let's, I wanna make some connections.  But first, I wanna get your father's, your grandfather on your father's side, your paternal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, we're kind of jumping around now--
Speaker 2: We are jumping--
Speaker 1: You're gonna get back to--
Speaker 2: --around--
Speaker 1: --my mom [Treneta Davis Burns] and school--
Speaker 2: --but we are gonna get back to your mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yes, my father is Isham Albert Burns, Jr. [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns], his father was Isham Albert Burns, Sr. [Isham Burns, Sr.], my father never liked that name, and when he went into the [U.S. military] service he acquired a nickname, which is Rusty, and he's been known as Rusty since he was eighteen years old.
Speaker 2: But what I wanted to kind of establish is that both sets of your grandparents left New Orleans to travel west?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And the both sets have five children?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Did they, did you ever hear stories about what they were leaving in New Orleans?  What was it about New Orleans that led them to wanna move out west?  What did they hear about what the west was offering about what New Orleans, was not offering that caused this migration for them?
Speaker 1: Well, I think from folks who left the South to go to California, they probably wrote back that it was a far less oppressive, in terms of racial discrimination and prejudice for black folks, than the situation was in New Orleans.  My father growing up in New Orleans told me that black folks weren't allowed in the French Quarter [New Orleans, Louisiana], 'cause, Essence has a music festival there every year and we had a family reunion and we would go down and my family, I mean, my father showed us all the places he lived in New Orleans, they were very poor.  Every time, apparently every time the rent came due, you know, after two, three months of not being able to pay the rent, they just moved and, you know, 'cause they didn't have any money.  But, I'm sure they moved out because when you get to a certain point on the train, then you don't have to sit in the Jim Crow car anymore, and my mother says that when she was growing up in Los Angeles, the schools were integrated.  She, I had, she has pictures from her high school yearbooks where it was totally mixed.  There were black students, Hispanic, lots of Asians, and, you know, white folks, white kids all going to the same high school.
Story_ID: 506325
Speaker 1: And what years did your mother [Treneta Davis Burns] go to high school?  Do you--can you figure that out--?
Speaker 2: Oh well let's see that would be, she was born in 1931, so '41 [1941]?  Back up a couple of years, that would be '39 [1939], I guess she graduated in thirty- must have been '38 [1938], or '39 [1939], probably '38 [1938], she graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the high school that she went to, that was integrated?
Speaker 2: I think it was Jordan, I think it was Jordan High School [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], yeah.
Speaker 1: So she completed high school, did she go onto college, your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: --went to Pepperdine College [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California], she didn't complete, I think that's where she met my father [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns], was at Pepperdine, and introduced by a very good friend of theirs who is now living here in New York City and is a famous designer, he's my sister's godfather, his name is James Daugherty.  But he introduced my parents, took 'em out for a date for doubles at, you know, playing tennis or something, or badminton or whatever.
Speaker 1: Did your mom, did they play tennis?
Speaker 2: I think they probably, that's what kids did in those days, it was probably more like badminton, if I remember, tennis sounds (laughter) you know, a bit expensive.  But, I know they played badminton.
Speaker 1: Can you give me some idea of what Los Angeles [California] was like in your mother's era, in your mother's day?  Like, perhaps where would her and your father have gone out for a night on the town?  Where would they have gone to a movie, what did they do socially, just what was this, what was Los Angeles like in the '40s [1940s], for black people?
Speaker 2: I know that they, they went out and danced because I was surprised, I don't know, maybe ten, fifteen years ago when I was visiting them and we had music on, and they got up and danced, you know, swing, and we had never, us siblings had never seen them do that before, it was kind of amusing but it was cute, they had some moves, you know, that they remembered from all those years, you know, that was fun.  But I remember them talking about going to nightclubs on Central Avenue to hear Nat King Cole and others.  My father liked piano music, he's a piano player and he liked jazz, he especially liked Nat King Cole and admired his piano playing, he had, I inherited from him a whole collection of old 78s, I mean what's left of them 'cause they were made of shellac and they're very brittle, and you know, you'd look at them and they'd chip and break, but yeah, they used to go out and hear music.
Speaker 1: Central Avenue was what, in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Central Avenue ran all the way from, at least it ran through Compton [California] and it ran all the way through Watts [Los Angeles, California], it probably ran out toward, Redondo [Redondo Beach California] and--
Speaker 1: So is--
Speaker 2: --Long Beach [California].
Speaker 1: --Central Avenue say, the main street--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --for black--
Speaker 2: --and this was--
Speaker 1: --people at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was a black area, yeah, as a matter of fact it reminds me that at that time, the bands and the clubs were not integrated, even though the, the high school my mom went to obviously was.  But, the bands were not integrated and I know this because there was an R&B singer and producer when I was growing up named Johnny Otis, I think Johnny's still alive, he had 'Willie and the Hand Jive' and he produced Little Esther Phillips and Etta James, and Johnny eventually ended up marrying a sister and becoming a preacher in Watts in a Baptist church and everybody, black folks knew that Johnny Otis was black.  But Johnny Otis was not black, his parents were Greek, but he grew up in a black community in Sacramento, California, and black culture was all he knew, so and he used to, you know, play with the old blues musicians, I asked Big Joe Turner and T-Bone Walker before they passed about Johnny Otis and they told me, as far as they knew, Johnny Otis was black and they played with him.  But Johnny Otis' heritage was Greek, he was olive-skinned, but, and if anybody had known that, he would have gotten credit for being the first musician to integrate a black band in Los Angeles at the, I think it was the Lincoln Theater [Los Angeles, California] on Central Avenue, you know?  But, who knew (laughter), so, I'm saying that, I'm saying all that to say that at the time when they were going to these clubs, they were not, the bands and the clubs were not integrated, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a great story and that's the kind of history that we want to record.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: So Johnny--can you talk to me about, I mean give me just a sense of the Lincoln Theater?
Speaker 2: I, the Lincoln Theater I think was gone by the time I was coming up, I don't, I don't ever recall seeing the Lincoln Theater on Central Avenue.  That was in the '40s [1940s], and it was probably gone by, I don't know, maybe '52 [1952], '54 [1954], or something like that.
Story_ID: 506326
Speaker 1: So let's just talk about your father for a little bit, can you give me his name again?
Speaker 2: His given name?
Speaker 1: His given name.
Speaker 2: Ishan--Isham, I-S-H-A-M, Albert Burns, Jr. [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns].
Speaker 1: Now what is the origin of that name Isham?
Speaker 2: I don't know, it's probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is it a biblical name?
Speaker 2: --from, yeah, it's probably from the Bible.  Yeah, it's probably from the Bible.
Speaker 1: Your father's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Is July 24, 1925.
Speaker 1: And did your father, was your father able to go to school as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went to school and he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In California?
Speaker 2: --and my mother [Treneta Davis Burns], yeah, he went to school first in New Orleans [Louisiana] and then he, about the time of junior high school or high school he moved to Los Angeles [California] and went to Jordan [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], I believe, and then right out of high school, that very summer out of high school he joined the service.  When he got out of the service he went to Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California] for a few years and I think that's where he met my mother.  So, yeah, my father--
Speaker 1: Now did he complete Pepperdine?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he did not either.  But, what he did do was, interestingly enough, he tells me just about what kind of things were available then in Los Angeles that were not available where he came from in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In high school, let's say this is around 1940, he, there was a class he said that one of his teachers, and he credits this teacher [Mr. Cosgrove (ph.)] at the high school, and I don't remember the teacher's name, I've got it somewhere in an oral history interview that he did.  He, this teacher brought in or taught a class for anybody who was interested about aviation and aerodynamics and, and this I believe was a white teacher who knew that the government was going to possibly provide opportunities for black kids to learn how to fly, because now we're getting into the war [World War II, WWII], you know?  This is after 19, between 1938, and 1940, and my father had always been interested in flying, I mean, you know, from a kid, he built model airplanes, that was his passion, he would build model airplanes, which is something that he taught me to do when I was a little boy, and that leads into a whole other story.  But, so they, you know, my father just absorbed this, and there came a time when you could go down somewhere in Los Angeles and take this test that would qualify you for the [U.S.] military, looking at you, I guess to get into the service.  What's coming up is this, this Civilian Training Program [Civilian Pilot Training Program], and that's not the whole name of it, but where the U.S. Army put together a program in Tuskegee [Alabama], and that's where the Tuskegee Airmen come from.  Well, there were out of that class, there were maybe three African American students who passed that test, my father passed it, 'cause, I mean, he had gone to the library, and he just loved flying, so he wanted to know everything about it.  My father passed the test and, you know, there's possibly this opportunity that he would get to learn how to fly, he was so focused, he didn't wanna know about anything else, he didn't wanna know about girls or nothing, you know?  Just flying, so he became a Tuskegee Airman, out of the three guys that went into the program, he was the only one that didn't, from Los Angeles, that didn't wash out, the other two guys washed out, and he became a Tuskegee Airman.  So, that was, and now that puts him back down south again in Tuskegee, Alabama, and we still have relatives down there and some of the stuff that he tells me is just, I mean, you know, he left there when he was thirteen and now he's eighteen and has graduated from the program and has on a uniform, and white people were killing black people in uniforms, I mean really resented it in the South back then.  He'd watch, he went to visit his aunt there in Mississippi, I believe and was standing on her steps knocking on the door, nobody apparently was home, but there was a little juke joint right across the street, and this was evening, dusk or whatever, and he turned and saw a pickup truck pull up to the juke joint and it was a black neighborhood, black juke joint, and three or four white guys get out, go into the club, drag a brother out and beat him to death in the street, you know, I guess he was, my father didn't even know, 'cause he hid behind this post, 'cause if they had seen him watching this, they would have killed him also, you know?  And nobody in the juke joint did anything because he says, there's nothing you could do.  What the sheriffs do on Friday night is deputize a bunch of their friends and they have a few beers and go out and, and beat up black folks for sport, he said, "This is the kind of stuff that went on," so, you know.  He didn't, you know, he just, I mean he feels helpless and bad that there was nothing he could do, but nobody in the juke joint came out and did anything either, because I mean they had guns and, you know, that's how you get killed.
Story_ID: 506327
Speaker 1: Your father's [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] behind a post watching another, so was it a soldier that was being killed, because he was in uniform (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, this was just a, this was just a black, you know, man from the neighborhood, no.  So, I mean, and I would hear at the annual Tuskegee Airmen conventions, these guys had all these stories, I mean, you know, they were not allowed in the officers' club, even though they were officers and even though German prisoners of war were allowed, if they were officers, were allowed in the white American officers club.  They used to joke that they would have the German prisoners of war repairing the Tuskegee Airmen's airplanes, (laughter), you know?  But I, my dad said, "No that's not true, those guys are just, you know, they're joking."
Speaker 1: So, what are some, what is the story of triumph for the airmen?  Did they ever share any like hero stories, like?
Speaker 2: Oh, those yeah, those guys were, I mean, they did things that nobody else did.  They were the 99th Pursuit Squadron that my father was, he was a, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you said that your father was the youngest?
Speaker 2: --he was one of the very youngest of those guys, you know, 'cause he went in--
Speaker 1: At eighteen.
Speaker 2: He tried to go in at seventeen, they sent him back, they said, "You have to wait," so he went in on his eighteenth birthday, you know, the very day, you know that's how anxious he was.  So, he was very young, I mean, you know, you've got an eighteen-year-old kid, immature, that they've given this, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of flying equipment and, you know, he was not mature enough to be very responsible, but he was a very good pilot, you know.  Everything they said don't do, he went and did it, they said, "Don't go fly under the bridge," and he went and flew under the bridge, "Don't buzz the town," he buzzed the town.  So, he was getting in, he got in trouble a lot, but they like him so he, he didn't wash out.
Speaker 1: Any heroic stories that your father shared with you?
Speaker 2: No, he, you know he didn't get overseas because as he graduated [from the Civilian Pilot Training Program] the war [World War II, WWII] ended and he and his guys in his class were very disappointed about that.  They thought they were gonna--they were promised that they would be moved to the Pacific Theater, and, you know, to be able to fight over there and I don't know what happened, the, you know, a whole bunch of bureaucracy and procrastination and they didn't get moved over there to fight so, you know, then he, after the war, he thought he'd go back and reenlist so he could get to, you know, go fight someplace else in Korea or whatever, but when he went down, you know, you have to face a white recruiting officer and, you know, when he told them that, you know, he had been in the [U.S. military] service and he was a pilot and everything, and the guys, you know, they just ignored him, they said, "We'll call you," and they never called, and he'd go back and so finally he just gave up.  What he did was, he started his own flying service [Rusty's Flying Service] on a little small municipal airport in Compton [California], Compton Airport [Compton/Woodley Airport] and there were about, there were two other black businesses there and this was in the, I'd say probably starting at around 1958, and as a matter of fact, one of his, one of his roommates from the Tuskegee Airmen, his name was Anderson, Paul Anderson, he had the first business there, and I think Paul got onto the airport because he looked white, he could pass for white, and he was there for maybe a year or so and he brought my father into the business, and the business became known as B&A Air Service [ph.], and then, my father got his own hangar, two doors down, and started his own business, and then subsequently there was another brother that got a little smaller hangar next door to ours, so there was three black businesses, and all of them were about the business of teaching, you know, people how to fly.
Speaker 1: Anybody or black people?
Speaker 2: Primarily black people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were a couple, there were a few, I mean, later on, you know, in the '60s [1960s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, but in the early days, why, I mean who were the black people that were coming to your father to learn how to fly?  And where were they getting the--like, who were these people?
Speaker 2: Well first of all the, the, you know, guys who used to fly in the service, you know, or who wanted to fly in the service and washed out, they would come by, and then also it wasn't just, I mean, once they were on the airport, other people, even white people would hear of the reputation and they would come by, so there were a few white people there.  There was a guy, Jewish guy named Harve Bennett who became a big movie producer and he was one of the first white guys that came, he had a single-engine Navion, and he would park his airplane at my father's hangar and he would fly, and then, you know.  So, my dad taught people how to fly, I grew up on that airport, from the time I was in kindergarten, every day after school, I would walk from school to, up until I was about fifteen, when he gave up the business, I would walk from school to the airport and I'd have to sweep up the hangar and wash airplanes and do all of that, and later I got to help repair and build airplanes, I learned how to fly before I was old enough to get a driver's license.
Story_ID: 506328
Speaker 1: So I grew up on an airport [Compton/Woodley Airport, Compton, California], I was there seven days a week, the only day I got off, sometimes, was Sunday, so I was there working with him [Burns' father, HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And why were off on Sundays, did you go, did your family go to church?
Speaker 1: Well, the siblings went to church, you know, or my mother [Treneta Davis Burns] might take us when we were younger, but then they just sent us after a while, you know?  Yeah.  And then, but if we got real busy then I'd, you know, I'd be there working at the airport with him even on Sunday.
Speaker 2: I want to come back to your childhood but, I just wanna talk a little bit about your father's parents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 2: --before we move on.  And you've given me their names before, but if you can give me your--
Speaker 1: My--
Speaker 2: --father's mother.
Speaker 1: --father's mother was Nona Mae Bertrand, Nona Mae Bertrand.  She became--
Speaker 2: Can you spell that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nona, N-O-N-A, Mae, M-A-E, Bertrand, B-E-R-T-R-A-N-D, Bertrand family in New Orleans [Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Were they French (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The name was French, I mean, you know, New Orleans, it's that, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay so it's just that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, somewhere, yeah, well, I'll show you pictures of them, but--
Speaker 2: So Nona Mae--
Speaker 1: Yeah, somebody, I mean, their grandparents were like Francois Bertrand and you know, so yeah, they, there was definitely some French in there.  But, I don't know, as far back as I know, which is like to Francois and his brother Joseph Bertrand [Joseph Bertrand, Sr.], they were not white, you know, they were, you know, Creole, so, I don't know who, maybe, you know, one of their parents was white or something.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, Nona Mae?
Speaker 1: --Nona Mae Bertrand.
Speaker 2: Did you meet, did you ever--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I knew--
Speaker 2: --you knew--
Speaker 1: I knew my grandmother well.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, what was she like?
Speaker 1: Well, when I was growing up, she was a very strict disciplinarian, I thought she was mean, but she really wasn't, she was a sweetheart.  But, and she loved to cook, a very well spoken, I mean, she had a southern accent, but she was a very genteel southern woman, you know?  And, in retrospect, I'm wondering if it was not something that women and men of her generation really affected and took pains to develop in themselves in order to get respect from white people, you know what I mean?  Very mannerly, very proper, attempted to speak correct English, you know, that sort of thing.  And she, and I have her gumbo recipe, we were talking about that the, the other day, who has grandmother's gumbo recipe?  I have it and I wrote it down, 'cause I asked her for it before she passed.  So, and she, and my father's father--
Speaker 2: Now but just what did Nona Mae do for a living?
Speaker 1: She was a--
Speaker 2: Housewife?
Speaker 1: No.  Well, yeah.  Well, she was a domestic.  She cleaned up white folks' houses.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In New Orleans.
Speaker 2: And then your grandfather?
Speaker 1: My grandfather--
Speaker 2: His name?
Speaker 1: Isham Albert Burns, Sr. [Isham Burns, Sr.].  I'm not sure what my grandfather did, I know once he came out to the West Coast, he worked in a cannery, my father found him, I think in, maybe he worked in a cannery in Louisiana, and then, like a fish cannery or something and then, what happened, that story, and my father, when you interview him, he can tell it better than I can, but, my grandfather had a nervous breakdown when my father was about five years old and his youngest sibling, my Aunt Gerri [Geraldine Burns], was about, was just one year old, or, you know, not even.  And so, he went back to live with his mother who took care of him, and he--
Speaker 2: And what was her name?
Speaker 1: I think that was Mama Rosie [ph.], that's what my grand- my, what my father called her, Mama Rosie.  So, he went to stay with her, she had a little shack, you know, adjacent to the house, and he just lived there, he had this nervous breakdown so--
Speaker 2: And so he left the West Coast to move back to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No--
Speaker 2: --New Orleans?
Speaker 1: --this was still when they were--
Speaker 2: It's still--
Speaker 1: --in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: --New Orleans--
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: --okay--
Speaker 1: --still when they were in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: --so, he's living with her in the little shack--
Speaker 1: --He's living with her, and it was subsequent to that, that my grandmother, sometime later, went to visit her brother in Los Angeles and then gradually, she came back, she took back, my Aunt Gerri, and maybe my Uncle Kermit [Kermit Burns].
Story_ID: 506329
Speaker 1: I didn't give you the siblings.  My father's [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] the oldest, then my Aunt Beverly [Beverly Burns]--
Speaker 2: What does Beverly do?  What does she do?
Speaker 1: She lives in Kentucky in Louisville, Kentucky, she's retired--
Speaker 2: What did she retire from?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  She was probably just a housewife I think, I think she was just a housewife.  And then my Aunt Clara [Clara Burns], who's living in Los Angeles [California], and my Uncle Kermit [Kermit Burns] who moved from Los Angeles back to Kentucky, near my Aunt Beverly and my Aunt Gerri [Geraldine Burns], who lives in Los Angeles also, those are the four siblings in that order, Gerri is Geraldine.  So, one by one my grandmother [Nona Bertrand Burns] brought them to California and my father was the last, she had left him staying with relatives there, as a matter of fact, even when they there, my grandmother couldn't really afford to keep all of them together, so my father would stay with, you know, aunts or something, or our uncle out in Biloxi [Mississippi], and my Uncle Kermit would stay with other relatives and, you know, they were all kind of split up with family members who could take on one or the of them, you know 'cause folks were poor, so eventually, they all got to California.
Speaker 2: Did they ever talk about having grown up in the Depression [Great Depression] era?
Speaker 1: Well yeah, he did, my father talks about it all the time about, you know, going down to the canals and the creeks and the, and you know, and fishing for, for crawfish or whatever they could for, get for dinner.  About, I asked him, we grew up, we had beans and rice every Monday, and apparently, this is a New Orleans [Louisiana] tradition and I asked my father where this came from.  I don't know if this is apocryphal or if he made this up, but he said, "Monday is wash day, and you could put a pot on to boil and put enough water in where you didn't have to wash it, and it was a way to prepare a cheap meal while you're doing the wash," you know?  So, that's when that, so he still has beans and rice and pigtails or whatever he can get every, every Monday, that's his ritual.  But, you know, you can go down to the meat packing or the cannery or whatever and get, he was talking about this the other day, you could get enough scraps for five cents to make a meal, you know?  And make soup, you could get soup bones, you know?  You could get soup bones, you could get a loaf of bread for five cents and whatever else, I don't know, some vegetables and whatnot, and you know, after he added all of this up, you know, some vegetables and the soup bones and all that, he said you cou- they, they fed their family on a dime, on ten cents, you know?  And then, you know, if he was lucky enough to catch some crawfish or something, you know, down at the canal, or Lake Pontchartrain or where ever they fished for this stuff, that's, you know, that's what he would do.  But he, being the oldest, he was in charge of taking care of the younger siblings and watching over them and making sure they did their chores and all that, while my grandmother was out, you know, scrubbing floors of homes for, you know, white patrons or whatever.
Story_ID: 506330
Speaker 1: Let's talk about you growing up around your father's [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] hangar.  So, you got out of school every day, you came to the hangar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Every day I walked, I don't know how far was it, it was probably about a mile, I walked to the airport [Compton/Woodley Airport, Compton, California] and changed my clothes, I--
Speaker 1: What street did you live on at that time?
Speaker 2: I lived, I lived on--
Speaker 1: What did the family live on?
Speaker 2: The family in Compton [California]?  We lived on a street called Tajauta [Avenue], I remember the address it was 14117 Tajauta.  As a matter of fact, my cousin--
Speaker 1: Can you spell Tajauta?
Speaker 2: It was an Indian word--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was T-A-J-A-U-T-A.
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, your cousin?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my cousin eventually bought that house from my parents and I believe she still lives there today, my cousin lived not far from me, just about a block away, family, you know, all of our family lived probably, well, if not in walking distance, I could ride to, and if, with my bicycle, you know?  They lived that close.
Speaker 1: What was the street like?  Tajauta Street?
Speaker 2: Tajauta was, it was a neighborhood, I mean, Compton was, it wasn't as bad as the movies and stuff make it out to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, let's give this a date that we're talking about, we're talking about Compton in 19--
Speaker 2: I moved, we moved into this house, we're talking about, I remember walking down the street when they were building these houses and it, I believe it was 1954, with my father and my [paternal] grandmother [Nona Bertrand Burns] and my mother [Treneta Davis Burns], I think, it's a really vague memory, but walking down this street, and I remember seeing carpenters on the street, I mean on the house that became my neighbor's house, right across the street from ours.  There's a memory I have that it was stick built, and they were building this house, that's the only memory I have of it, but, but I guess we were going to see these houses.  And I don't remember where I lived before then, I mean, my parents know we lived in Los Angeles [California], but there was an opportunity, these houses cost ten thousand dollars, and between a thousand dollar loan from my mother's parents [Cecelia Treneta Landry Davis and Sylvester Davis] and the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], my father was able to get this house and I think the mortgage was like fifty or eighty dollars a month, you know?  So, and sometimes that was a struggle, you know?  And it took him a long, long time, years to pay back that loan to my mother's, you know, the thousand dollar loan to her, and he worked three jobs, two full time jobs and a part-time job, and then there was, he worked another thing on weekends, 'cause I don't remember what the third job was.  But he worked at the post office 'cause that was the only job you can get even out of the [U.S. military] service and with a college degree, or, and he didn't have a college degree at two years at Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California].  He worked there full-time and then he would leave there and go to another job, because he had a motorcycle, I remember that, and he would race to the other job on his motorcycle, and then the third job actually was the part-time job when he started the business at the airport, and then on weekends, he would bartend, he would tend bar for parties in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and, I remember he always told the story and it turned up in this movie on the Reagans, that was on TV, 'cause you know, people tell stories and they'd, you know, my father says, he was tending bar at this party for Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] and Yorty [Sam Yorty], and I forget who else, he named a whole bunch of 'em who were the power brokers in Los Angeles at that time.  And, they were sitting there discussing what they were gonna do about these black people as if he wasn't even there, but, I mean, you know, we're like, Ralph Ellison said, he was the invisible man, you know, he was just a bartender and he didn't mean, you know, he had no significance.  So well, you know, his humanity was invisible, so they could sit there in his face while he's serving them drinks and discussing what they were gonna do about black people.  Reagan had no love for black people all the way in the '50s [1950s], you know?  So, and he, and then, sit watching this movie on television about the Reagans, that you know, of course, the Reagan family, the Republicans protested, they had that very scene in the movie and my father of course, called up everybody and, you know, vindication for him right (laughter)?  So, but these are the things that he did to make money, to be able to pay that eighty dollars a month mortgage on that house.  And then you know, we had like, I just thought, we kids thought it was great that we would have, you know, sugar sandwiches, you know, butter and sugar for sometimes for dinner (laughter), you know, we thought that was a treat, 'cause you spread some butter and you know, some brown sugar and cinnamon, you know, that was really dessert, but that was all that, or a can of beans with some wieners or something, you know, hot dogs.  And it was like, you know, I mean, that's how poor folks lived, but for kids it was just, you know that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was just another day.
Speaker 2: --it was cool, yeah.
Story_ID: 506331
Speaker 1: What else can you remember about Compton [California]?  Like, can you give me a, like if we were doing a movie can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a neighborhood.
Speaker 1: --you describe the whole neighborhood, who were the players?
Speaker 2: It was a neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Well what, was there a barbershop?  Was there a beauty shop?  Was there--
Speaker 2: We went to Green's--
Speaker 1: --a pool hall?
Speaker 2: --Green's Barbershop and it was in--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the barbershop?
Speaker 2: --Green's.
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: And that you gotta ask my dad [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns].
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: It was in South Central, Los Angeles [California], it was in Watts [Los Angeles, California] and we would sit up there, it was a black barbershop and they would discuss sports, of course, and politics and, you know, I would go there as a, I remember going there as a kid, so, that's all I can tell you about that.  But the neighborhood was, it was a neighborhood, with, you know, with houses and all of the kids in my neighborhood were born in Los Angeles, Compton, and you know, in the metropolitan area, but all of our parents were from the South, you know, my next door neighbors, their parents were from Arkansas, our doctor who lived next door to us--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: --James Whitmore, he was a doctor, he lived right next door to us, but you know, in those days, you didn't have a choice, everybody lived together.  Just because he was a doctor, he couldn't live in the white neighborhood, you know?  So, he lived right next door to us, and I remember he had a pink Cadillac (laughter) with big fins, you know, probably one of those, like a 1958 or '9 [1959] or something like that so, I mean, you know, we thought we were really highfalutin, 'cause we liv- 'cause the pink Cadillac was parked next door in the driveway, you know, our next door neighbor, our doctor had a Cadillac (laughter), you know?  So, and what else was good about that was when our dog got hit by a car, Dr. Whitmore, instead of us having to have the dog put to sleep or whatnot, 'cause his leg was all messed up man, the leg was all messed up, and Dr. Whitmore set the little bones and everything and wrapped it up, you know, in the little bandage and, you know, the leg got better, the dog would limp around on it, after, like if you yelled at it or something, but other than that, he used that leg just fine, (laughter).  So, you know Dr. Whitmore saved our dog, you know?
Speaker 1: Who were some of the community leaders, where did the community look for leadership?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know, you'd have to ask my parents, man, I was young--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, I was young, I remember the kids in the neighborhood and in the summertime, we would play in the dark, you know?  We would play hide and seek and, 'cause, you know, we were all about the same age, you know, I mean, it ranged from, you know, my age, I was like one of the oldest, to, my sister's age who was like six years younger than me, but we had a lot of fun.  And I guess we all have, 'cause somebody was asking me recently about my accent, and I said, "You know, I'm from California," they said, "that's not a California accent," I said, "no, it's a southern accent, I got it from my parents," and it was reinforced in the street with all my friends who got their southern accents from their parents, even though we were all from California.  So, there was the rough side also.
Speaker 1: What was the rough side?
Speaker 2: I mean, drugs came in.
Speaker 1: What year did the drugs come in?
Speaker 2: I remember first seeing, you know, reefer, when maybe I was about eleven or twelve, somewhere around in there.
Speaker 1: So that's the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  My, yes, early '60s [1960s], my friend, you know, one of my close friends, Dwayne [ph.], who was a year older than me, lived on my block, he got killed when he was about twelve, I mean, we came home from school and, you know, there was like all this hubbub and there was blood, he got blown away right on the front yard by some other kids with a shotgun, and, and then my next door neighbor Mike [ph.], who was a year younger than me, he got killed, he got shot when he was about nineteen, and then, you know--
Speaker 1: Was Compton a place that people were trying to get out of?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't?  Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was a neighborhood.  The other side was, everybody on the block knew everybody and just like, you know, when people talk about neighborhoods in those days, you couldn't get away with anything, you know, if we were out there, we knew that other people, the other grownups were looking out the window at us and if any, we did anything, our parents would hear about it before we got home, you know?  And if we said anything or sassed 'em, they'd whip our behinds, and then we'd get another whipping when we got home, you know, from our parents, you know?  So, I mean, you know, when my mother [Treneta Davis Burns] was, when I was young and she was working also at the phone company, she was like an operator at the phone company which is with another job that black women could get, a job at the phone company.  I would come home and stay with the neighbors across the street, who would keep me until, you know, until my parents got home, you know, later on that evening.  So, there was that side, you know, we always had grownups looking out for us, you know, if cars came racing down the street, folks would, grownups would come and running out the house yelling at 'em, there's kids around here, and you know, you know, so it was a community, it was the village, that was supposed to be responsible for raising the children?  That's what we had, you know?
Story_ID: 506332
Speaker 1: What year did you go to elementary school and where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well first I went to a public school, which was McKinley Grammar School [McKinley Elementary School, Compton, California], and that was in 1955, and I went there until, let me see, 1955, well I went to kindergarten in 1955 I guess, so first grade in 1956, and then fourth grade would have been 1959.
Speaker 1: Did you meet any teachers during those '54 [1954] through '59 [1959], that had an impression on you and what you would do later in life?  Did anyone stand out?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, I remember some of their names, I remember some of their names, my kindergarten teacher was named Miss Cunningham [ph.], and--
Speaker 1: Was she black?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were all black.
Speaker 1: They were all black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, unlike, it's interesting, I'm talking to my wife [HistoryMaker Susan Taylor], who grew up in Harlem [New York, New York], who didn't have black teachers, almost all of my teachers throughout high sch- grammar school and high school were black.  I had, when I got to high school, I had two white teachers, but I'll get to that in a moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But grammar school, all my teachers were black, so I went there until the fourth grade, and in the fifth grade, my parents [Treneta Davis Burns and HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] and my cousin also who lived about a block away from me, who's my same age, our parents took us out of the public schools we were in, and put us in a Catholic school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: St. Albert the Great [St. Albert the Great Elementary School, Compton, California].
Speaker 1: Was it Jesuits?
Speaker 2: Was it Jesuits?  No, it wasn't Jesuits, I think it was Franciscans--
Speaker 1: Franciscans?
Speaker 2: --I think.  But, so my folks had to buy uniforms now for us, 'cause we had to wear uniforms, and they had to pay tuition, so what I remember is, my father made $125 a week, and out of that, he had to pay that mortgage, and--
Speaker 1: Which was eighty dollars.
Speaker 2: Which was eighty dollars a month, and also twenty dollars a month for each of four kids to go to this school tuition, so that's another eighty dollars a month for us to go to this Catholic school, you know?  So, I mean, (laughter) that's like $160 out of his, out of his what, five hundred dollars a month (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 506333
Speaker 1: The question I do want to ask before is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --why did your father [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] choose to send you to a private school [St. Albert the Great Elementary School, Compton, California] after you'd gone to public school [McKinley Elementary School, Compton, California] for four years?
Speaker 2: Because he wanted the best education for me and for my siblings that we could get and he believed that in the Catholic school we would get basics, I mean academics, as opposed to my counterparts in my neighborhood, my, you know, my guys, my homeboys who continued to go to public school and later on got classes like woodshop and metal shop and you know, and that sort of thing, where they groom you to take over a trade, you know?  He wanted us to get, to have an academic education, and I think he also thought the discipline there was better.  And I wasn't like a great student as I recall and I think he thought that my reading would improve and, you know, those sort of things, if I was in a situation where there was more discipline and, I don't know, I, you might ask him about that.  But the thing is--
Speaker 1: But you, one thing you said--
Speaker 2: --the net result is--
Speaker 1: --the net result, go ahead.
Speaker 2: --was that we did see a difference between us in school and our friends who were in public school--
Speaker 1: And you said collectively, black people at the time thought, the way to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to, yeah, to better your condition was education--
Speaker 1: So it starts, they just start--
Speaker 2: --was education--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so, everybody--
Speaker 1: --but how did they express that to you, how did your parents express to you that--
Speaker 2: Oh they, you mean?
Speaker 1: --they just said it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh no they--
Speaker 1: That you're black, and you, to get ahead you got--
Speaker 2: --you've got to get an education, that was drummed into us.  Now, I thought you meant what did they say about moving me to the Catholic school?  They didn't say anything, they just said, "Come on, let's go," and they took us, they took me and my cousin there and my sister and enrolled us and that was that, you know?  We're--old friends gone and meet your new friends (laughter).
Speaker 1: So were you, so you went to that school from, to the--
Speaker 2: From the--
Speaker 1: --fifth grade to--
Speaker 2: --fifth grade to through eighth grade graduation, and then I went to, that was co-educational and then from there, the boys and girls were split up and I went to an all-boys catholic school [Verbum Dei High School] in Watts [Los Angeles, California], 111th [Street] and Central Avenue in Watts, and that was an all-boys school from the ninth through the first part of my senior year.
Speaker 1: And what year was that, 19--
Speaker 2: That was 1960--1967, when I left there, 1967.
Story_ID: 506334
Speaker 1: What year did the Watts riots happen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Do you remember that at all?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you gotta tell me that story.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay, 1965 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) I remember the Watts riots, I mean it was summertime--
Speaker 1: Okay, and you know what?  I'm sad to say, but, I don't even, okay just tell me the story, I can't remember why the riots in Watts [Los Angeles, California] happened.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember myself.
Speaker 1: Was there a specific reason?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was, it had something to do with police brutality as, as always, and I'd have to go back and check on that because I've forgotten now.  I was fourteen or fifteen years old, I think I was actually, for part of that summer, I was for a couple of weeks, I was staying with my cousin out in San Fernando Valley [California], we came back and I remember that, I don't remember now whether I came back and the riots were going on, or the riots started and after the riots were going on for a while, my father [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] shipped me out to my cousin's house, I don't actually remember how that went.  But, I do remember riding in the car with my father going back and forth to the airport [Compton/Woodley Airport, Compton, California] and there were National Guard, I mean, you know, buildings were on fire, and burned out and every some of them already, and on Central Avenue and Rosecrans Avenue, at that intersection, there was a strip mall there and I remember seeing the National Guard troops in uniforms with guns there at the trash dumpsters, if I recall, they were at the trash dumpsters, you know waiting to shoot looters or anybody.  It was a very nervous making time as I recall, even for my father, because my father got a pistol and, you didn't know who was gonna shoot you, you know what I mean?  The National Guard were there with the guns and they were doing the shooting, but if bullets start flying, you don't know where they're coming from, you know?
Speaker 1: Were people killed during the Watts riots?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, people were killed during the Watts riots.  There was a lot of looting, you know, that's what I remember about the Watts riots, I mean I'm just looking at these guys, the troops, you know, we were an occupied community, so and it was one of those, as has happened with all of these riots, you know, there comes a breaking point where the straw that breaks the camel's back when black folks just can't, you know, they're not gonna stand for it anymore.
Speaker 1: So as a fourteen-year-old, what were your feelings about, did you say, right on, or we shouldn't be doing this, or how did you feel?
Speaker 2: It was none of that, it was just a curiosity and it was a, I think, you know, I was curious in a voyeuristic kind of way, you know, I would watch it on TV, I would go out, you know, I'd, my parents were keeping a close watch on me, but when I could get out with my friends, over my friend's house and we'd see stuff that, folks had looted and whatnot, and you know, "Look what I got," and this sort of stuff.  But, I, you know, moving around with my folks, I think a lot of what I felt, I absorbed as an impression from my mother [Treneta Davis Burns] and father who were, you know, keeping a wary eye out for the National Guard, the troops there who had these rifles and were shooting black folks, and also for any black folks with guns who might be shooting black folks, you know?  So, or folks that they thought weren't black folks, like, you know (laughter)?
Speaker 1: How many days did the riots go on?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know maybe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A number more than one day, two days?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, definitely more than one day--
Speaker 1: So what--
Speaker 2: --it, you know-
Speaker 1: --was the result of--
Speaker 2: --it seems like it was, it was a week, ten days, something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the result of that happening?
Speaker 2: Oh, Watts was burned out man, it was, it took years for Watts to recover, for South Central, Los Angeles [California] to recover.  I remember, you know, going back years later, as an adult, and there were still parts of, you know, South Central, L.A. that had never been--that was still burned out, I think it's mostly been cleaned up now, but, I'd say, you know, ten, fifteen years ago, there were still lots that had not been rebuilt, so, it's changed now.
Speaker 1: So that was 1967 you said?
Speaker 2: No, '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 506335
Speaker 1: Were there other elements of racial tension that had developed that you noticed at that time in California, or in the country?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or was this--oh yeah?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, when, well--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were aware of racial tensions?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--well, I mean, you know, my high school, I mean, my high school, I mean, my high school and my grammar school [McKinley Elementary School, Compton, California], were I would say 90 percent black, it was the rare one or two white kids in, you know, who were poor, in our schools, you know?
Speaker 1: How were they treated?
Speaker 2: Like anybody else--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --you know, just, you know, played sports, I mean they were there in the environment, and you know, they were just another classmate.  I remember going out, this was in high school, going out, probably 1964, going out to a sports event, it was a basketball game or a football game or something, to with one of the white schools, like Inglewood [Inglewood High School, Inglewood, California], or someplace, I don't know, they were, you know, that was white at that time, and we left the stadium or arena about three of us during a break, you know, like halftime or something, and went out to look for a grocery store or something where we could get some soda pops, right?  And, we walked through this park and a gang of white kids attacked us, you know?  I mean they surrounded us and challenged us and it was just the three of us you know?  And, me and two other guys and we stood our ground--
Speaker 1: Did you have to fight 'em?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to fight 'em.  I mean, you know, so we went back, I mean it wasn't a really, you know, one of the guys came up and 'cause there was a bunch of 'em man, there must have been about a least a dozen of these guys and--guys and girls, you know?  White kids, hanging out in the park and they especially chose a friend of mine, Orlando [ph.], you know?  So, and the guy, you know was, was gone fight him but you know we stood right there by Orlando and he was, all of 'em were gonna have to fight the three of us or he was gonna have to fight the three of us.  So anyway, they let us get outta there, we went back to the stadium, we came back with the whole school, I mean, with, you know, all of our guys from our school, all-boys, all black high school from Watts [Los Angeles, California], who were there at the game, we came back and we had a big riot in the park, oh yeah man, we had a big time riot in the park with those white kids and then helicopters, the police flew in, and helicopters were shining lights down there and everybody scattered and then when we got back to school, the next day, of course, everybody got in trouble because of that.  And so I think, we were in trouble with the school, with our school, for quite some time because of that?  You know, like privileges, you know, revoked and all of that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 506336
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate high school?
Speaker 2: I actually had to leave Verbum Dei [Verbum Dei High School, Los Angeles, California], which was the name of the high school in Watts [Los Angeles, California], in the middle of my senior year, so I didn't get to graduate with them.  My folks [Treneta Davis Burns and HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] moved to the suburbs to Simi Valley [California] of all places, you know, Rodney King trial fame later.  Simi Valley, it was, you know, it used to be farm community and then it became, they started to developing there and putting up nice houses, and my father had gotten some work with Rockwell [North American Rockwell Corporation] or someplace and they were paying him more money than he had ever, they had discovered him because he was--not only flew, but built airplanes, and was a, you know, knew all about building airplanes and everything, they needed some help on a project because they had this big contract and their folks weren't able to execute.  So, through some contacts my father was brought in, and whoever gave them the contract, a big contract, you know?  Said, you know, to work on these government helicopters, said, "We will give you, keep the contract with you as you long as you keep Rusty," and my father brought in, you know, one of his guys, keep them on the project.  So, now they're paying my dad all this money in like an emergency 'cause they needed stuff done, so now they're paying him more money than he had ever imagined he would make.  I mean, today, it wouldn't be any big money, but it was big money to him, and it was enough that my mom said, told him, "It's time for us to get out of Compton [California], 'cause, you know, 'cause, your son is getting into trouble with fights," and you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The riot--
Speaker 2: --this is right--
Speaker 1: --I mean--
Speaker 2: After the riots [Watts riots] and, not right after but, you know, a couple of years after the riots, and stuff started to get, you know, they started to worry.  So, they went looking for this house and they found this house that they could afford and it was, well they thought they could afford it, for thirty thousand dollars, and it was really a stretch for them, but they decided to do it, and man, this was, at first this seemed like a dream come true to us, 'cause for the kids, 'cause each of us got our own bedroom, we each had our own room, I didn't have to share my room with my brother [Michael Burns] and sleep in the bed with him anymore and, you know, so we all had our own bedroom.  So, this is great, and then my sister and I discovered that we were the only two black students in the whole school, the whole, the entire high school.
Speaker 1: So you went from a school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All black--
Speaker 1: --where there were only two white kids, to a school where there were only two black kids?
Speaker 2: Right.  And a school where all my teachers were except for, 'cause in high school I had, you know, we had different classes, so my science teacher was this German priest named Father Schigo [ph.], and then I had another, a math teacher, also German, named Father Heffler [ph.], and those were my two white teachers in my career, in my high school, my whole schooling career, until I got to college, or until actually I got to Simi Valley High School [Simi Valley, California] and then all my teachers were white and of course, when I came in, in the middle of the school year, being from Watts, California, I don't think they even bothered to look at my transcripts or if they did, they just ignored them and immediately what they did was put me in remedial English and you know, those kind of things, and it took them about two weeks to discover that I didn't belong there, I belonged in advanced placement, you know?  I had come from a school where we had already studied in our, 'cause religion class, you know, they do the indoctrination in the catholic school, but part of that, we also had to study such philosophers as Kant [Immanuel Kant] and Hegel [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel] and Kierkegaard [Soren Kierkegaard] and Descartes [Rene Descartes] and you know, so we had all of that stuff in high school, you know, so, which was stuff that they weren't even getting in the public schools, those are college courses, you know?  So, they discovered and admitted that they had made a mistake and they took me out of remedial and put me in the advanced English literature class and, et cetera.  So, anyway, I mean, I got through that, it was a traumatic year for me, I never really got close to any of those kids, I went to school, I came home, I stayed in my room with my brand new room, which was mine, all mine, and I practiced my music, you know?
Speaker 1: What do you mean, practiced your music?
Speaker 2: I'd, before I, when I was still in Watts, my friend started a band, and I got a flute and I, you know, started playing music, so we had a little jazz band, and we would play and I subsequently picked up the saxophone, so, I had, matter of fact, a friend of mine who is older than me, his father was an old blues man, and he gave me his father's old saxophone, which I still have and so I, you know, I would just come home from school and, you know put on my records, and play jazz, and, you know, for hours, and stayed in my room, and that's what I did throughout that whole year until I graduated and then went to a junior college [Moorpark College, Moorpark, California].
Story_ID: 506337
Speaker 1: Which junior college did you go to?
Speaker 2: Moorpark College [Moorpark, California], it was, which was not far from there, a little community college, but they had black students coming in there from Oxnard [California] and from other black communities which I wasn't even aware of in Ventura County [California], so, you know, I kind of opened up a little bit more.
Speaker 1: When did your professional career start, what year?
Speaker 2: As a writer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And take--
Speaker 2: As a writer?
Speaker 1: As a writer, the early stages of--how did you become a writer, I should ask?
Speaker 2: Okay, it, well, I, in college, let me start there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In college, I was never a good test taker and I realized that, so I had a kind of a little scam going, I would be sick or miss the test, or, 'cause there's a skill to taking tests, and I was never taught it, didn't learn how to do it, but I could write and I could research, and so I would miss the test and ask if I could do a makeup paper, and usually I got away with it.  So, I developed my skills, you know, further, 'cause we had to write papers when I--at Verbum Dei [Verbum Dei High School, Los Angeles, California], and in high school, so I did that in college, and it was one of those things where, I said, "Oh, I got a good, good scam going here, you know, I can write these papers, and get good grades, and not have to flunk these tests," you know?  So, I did pretty good with that, and I tried writing a little bit of poetry and wrote something for the school paper and, you know, some articles on music and that sort of thing, and you get a little bit of recognition for that.  But it, I had no intention of being a writer really, I had no idea of what I was gonna do, my whole plan and my parents' [Treneta Davis Burns and HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] plan for me, from the time I was a kid was to integrate the western--I mean, the airlines, the commercial carriers because there were no black pilots, you know?  When my father got out of the [U.S. military] service, even with all his flying time and everything, they weren't gonna let him be, so his dream was for his son.  There was an airline operating in California, in those days called Western Airlines and they had no black pilots, so my father figured that I would be the first black pilot, you know, for a commercial carrier.  What happened was, I have a congenital condition in one eye, it's just a prolapsed pupil, it didn't affect my vision at all, but any excuse they could use to disqualify you, you know, especially if you're black, they would, it's very rigorous anyway, the physical, so, and because I'm black, there was just no way that I was gonna be a pilot for a commercial carrier.  So anyway, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, but you knew how to fly because you've been flying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --before you were driving.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So, you know, I got interested in music, so, by the time I got out of college, that was my interest, was playing music, I left and I went to a junior college and, and I taught, it was Santa Barbara, 'cause I went to school at UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California] after Moorpark, at my junior year I transferred to University of California, Santa Barbara campus, graduated from there with a degree in English and drama, went to Santa Barbara City College [Santa Barbara, California], lectured in a course in the black studies department on the history of black music in America, and I ran a, or supervised six tutors in the English tutorial lab there for students who needed help with English.
Story_ID: 506338
Speaker 1: So, I did that for about a year and a half, and then left [Santa Barbara City College, Santa Barbara, California], and moved north to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area], to Oakland [California], Berkeley [California], San Francisco [California] and didn't, still didn't know what I was gonna do, you know, joined a band up there, course couldn't support myself doing that, a jazz band.  A friend of mine up there that I had known since I was a kid, as a matter of fact, his father and--his uncle and my father [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] had been roommates at--in the [U.S. military] service, you know?  They were Tuskegee Airmen together, so he worked for a black insurance company called Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company [Los Angeles, California], famous black insurance company started by the Houstons, so I needed a job, I needed some money, 'cause I had gotten this, with my little bit of money I had, I got an apartment, a little studio apartment, and he was up there, he got me this job, you know, selling insurance to black folks and, you know, that paid the rent and it was pretty decent, I only worked two days a week, I was working in the black community with black folks and the company was black and it gave me a lot of time to continue to play music.  I got tired of that eventually and left there, and then you know, didn't know what I was gonna do, played music for a little bit, but still, you know, I was gonna run out of money, had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you stayed, you were still in the Compton [California] area?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.  I'm talking about up in the Bay Area--
Speaker 2: So you--
Speaker 1: Oakland, San Francisco.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I left Compton when my folks moved to Simi Valley [California], from there I moved, when I graduated from Moorpark College [Moorpark, California] with an A.A., I left there and went to Santa Barbara, California, I was at UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California], student at UCSB.
Speaker 2: So, but when you got the apartment, you were in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was, I had--
Speaker 2: --Oakland area?
Speaker 1: --Yeah, I had moved from Santa Barbara to Oakland, California.
Speaker 2: Now Oakland was a hotbed of political activity with Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] and the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party]--
Speaker 1: I went up there because when I was in college, the Panthers were my heroes, Bobby Seale, and Huey Newton, you know?  So, that was one of the reasons why I went up there, to look for them and to join the Panthers and, you know, and that movement and to see what we could do about, you know, community, and, you know, stuff.
Speaker 2: So, you were an idealist, or, no--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah but man, I was, this was the '60s [1960s], you know?
Speaker 2: I know, but so tell me about what your dream--what were you gonna do, you--
Speaker 1: Ah man, this is, I mean this is what was going on back then, I mean, you know they were killing black folks, they had killed, they had killed all these students at Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], you know, when I was still at UCSB--
Speaker 2: What year was that Kent State, that those students were shot--
Speaker 1: Oh man I'm drawing--
Speaker 2: --on campus?
Speaker 1: --actually that was like 1970, I think, it was '69 [1969], or '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 506339
Speaker 1: I left there--when I went up to Santa Barbara [California], oh man, I mean there was stuff, there was stuff going on all over the place, even in Santa Barbara, it was pretty repressive, there's a student community right adjacent to the campus [of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California] called Isla Vista [California] where there's lots of student housing, and there was a guy on the police force that because there was a lot of activism there, and as there was in Berkeley [California], and there was a guy on the police force named Captain Hunney [ph.], and this guy, you know, all whites (unclear), this guy actually carried around a medieval mace, you know the ball with spikes on it, on the end of the chain and the stick and stuff to intimidate folks, they were dragging students out of student housing, you know?  You know, going in, searches for marijuana, whatever, dragging students out, making them lay down in the street, you know, they had, with guns pointed at you and everything, this is the kind of stuff that was going on.  When I got up there, the summer before my junior year, there was a big riot in Isla Vista, and you know, they burned down the Bank of America, for they pushed a burning trash bin, I was out there, through the glass doors because of the Bank of America's involvement in Vietnam [Vietnam War], you know?  And, so there was that kind of stuff going on, I'm standing out in front of my apartment, 'cause there, there was an alley behind the apartment also, my cousin, who I stayed with during the Watts riots, we grew up together, my cousin now and his friend, are coming up to visit me in Santa Barbara, you know, in his friend's little MG sports car.  So, I'm giving them directions and I know, you know, as I'm giving it to 'em, and I'm trying to explain it to them over the phone, that and the--there're no cell phones in these days, I mean, you know, this is 1970, so, you know, I said, "You know what Scott's [ph.] gonna do, is he's gonna drive right past here and make the turn up here, and then he's gonna be, you know, lost, so I'm gonna stand out here, 'cause he's gonna miss the turn to come and park in the alley, you know, where my apartment is."  And sure enough, I see him and Keith [ph.] go by and so, I run from the front of the building back to the back, up the stairs where my apartment is, grab my keys, run down to get in my car, because I knew where he was going, so I was gonna go catch him.  By the time I get down to the alley, there's a motorcycle cop at one end, he's off his motorcycle with his gun pointed at me, there's a car at the other end, there's another cop with his gun pointed at me, two cars, I'm, you know, I'm looking at, and then two cars screech up to the front of the building 'cause I can see straight out to the street, an unmarked car, and a patrol car, and these guys come running out, you know, one guy in uniform, the other guy in plainclothes, and they said, what are you running from?  I'm nineteen years old man, and I'm trying to explain to them because I'm nervous now 'cause these guys have guns, and you know, I know what's going on and you, plus, I'm like, I'm in my army fatigue jacket, and my jeans and stuff, you know, this is what we wore in those days.  I had a big afro, you know?  So, you know, they're looking at me and seeing me running, he wanted to know what am I running from and I'm trying to ex- stuttering and trying to explain to him, you know, about my cousin and whatever, and you know, he wasn't hearing none of that and he said, he said something like, "Boy don't f--- with us, we will kill you," and then they left, you know?  So, I mean, like I was really sho- I was shaken up man, you know?  So, I didn't, I went back upstairs I didn't even go try to find my cousin, man, you know, at first 'cause I didn't know what to do, you know, I was afraid to go out in my car, 'cause I didn't know if these guys were watching me and what they were gonna do or anything like that.  Anyway, my cousin finally found the apartment, and we hung out for the weekend, but that, that was the kind of stuff that was going on.  So anyway, I left Santa Barbara after, a year and half after graduation, and moved up to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] to see what was going on.
Speaker 2: To seek out the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].
Speaker 1: Seek out the Black Panthers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What kind of--
Speaker 1: --but also to look for a job, maybe something at a college in education, 'cause, I mean, you know, you still gotta support yourself, and I wasn't clear about what it was yet that I was gonna do in life.  I really didn't believe that I was gonna make money playing the kind of jazz that I wanted to play.
Story_ID: 506340
Speaker 1: So, when I was in college, you know, there was a lot of student protest and most of the students were very left leaning at that point, you know?  And we were inspired by the Panthers [Black Panther Party], we were inspired by the student protest movements in Berkeley [California], you know, outraged and enraged by the shooting of, of students at Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], so, you know, we got all our information from left wing publications, like Mother Jones and Scanlan's [Scanlan's Monthly] and, and of course we were reading Amiri Baraka, he was LeRoi Jones at the time.  So, I had heard and read about the Panthers and what Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] and Bobby Seale were doing up in Oakland [California], I mean things like, they'd, one of the things that I'm recalling, 'cause this stuff is just coming to me off the top of my head, they actually had recruitment posters as I recall, in the South to recruit southerners to come up to join the police force in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California].  Now see, you know, you're talking about community policing and folks that don't live in the community, they're recruiting from the South to bring white southerners up to come and police black folks in West Oakland, you know?  Huey and Bobby were in college up in the Bay Area, and decided to start this, you know, out of their discussions about what the, the police were doing and the brutality in the community, this started, they formed the Black Panthers to police the police, and at that time it was not illegal for you to carry arms and these guys carried rifles, and they would follow around in their cars behind the police cars to watch and see whenever the police would stop black people, and just to bear witness that there was no police brutality and that sort of thing and they were very effective in that way and very intimidating, you know, to the police also (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that is a recipe for disaster.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well you would think--
Speaker 2: These black men--
Speaker 1: --but it was so--
Speaker 2: --following these white--
Speaker 1: --unknown--
Speaker 2: --men around with guns--
Speaker 1: --today it would be.  Today it would be.  And they passed the law that you, you know, subsequently because of the Panthers, that you know, you can't get away with that anymore.  But this was, but at the time, legally, and they would tell the police, you know, they would recite, the law, these guys were, Huey Newton was a law student, I think Bob- I know he was a law, a law student, I think Bobby might have been also, but they knew the law and could quote it from memory back to the police, you know, we have the right to bear arms and whatnot, and they, and the police, they probably knew it better than the police, and the police had no answer to that, you know?  And then plus, what are they gonna do?  These guys have guns right here, what are you gonna do?  Try to draw on them or something?  You know?  So they had to go back to the police force, and to the legislature and say, "What are we gonna do about these guys?"  You know?  That was very inspiring to us, you know, to us students.
Story_ID: 506341
Speaker 1: So, I went up there looking for these guys (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was inspiring because King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was so nonviolent and you had come up in an era when you are supposed to turn the other cheek?  Or that was so inspiring because--
Speaker 1: At the time, at the time we thought that nonviolence, and this is as a student, remember I'm talking about, what year is this?  I've left UCSB, I graduated from UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California] in 1972, I stayed around until sometime in 1973, or even early '74 [1974], which is when I finally went up to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California].  So, King has already been assassinated, years before, and even when we were still in school, we could see that nonviolence had ceased, in our eyes, to work.  As to engage the sympathy and the allegiance of outraged white folks who would, you know, see black, nonviolent black protesters protesting.
Speaker 2: Say that again for me?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I know, that was--what happened, what we thought is that there came a point where the marches, the nonviolent protest, a lot of students felt, ceased to be effective, you know?  When King went up to Illinois, I'm trying to think, was it Cairo, Illinois, or somewhere up there and, and those white folks had no, they did not care that this was a nonviolent group of black folks, they threw bottles and rocks, hit King upside the head, you know?  It was, it was terrible, you know?  And chased him out of there, they were not gonna have any marches to desegregate those racist enclaves of Illinois, you know?  So, I mean, you know, students beginning to see this kind of thing, just said, this is not effective anymore, and plus with police brutality in communities, like they were seeing up in Oakland [California], the Panthers [Black Panther Party] said, you know, we can't have this.  Not that they were gonna go out and engage in armed conflict, but we are going to defend ourselves, we're not just gonna let people just bludgeon us, we're gonna defend ourselves, you know?  You've got a march on the one hand, and the cameras are on you and everything, but the cameras aren't on you, and you're not organizing marching when you're just out in your community going about your business, and you're get beat up by the police and who's there to see, you know?  And if there are some there, people there to see, then you know, if people are fed up enough and it erupts into a riot.  So, what the Panthers said was, "Defend yourself," and this is--the Panthers are coming after Malcolm [Malcolm X] also who said, you know, defend yourself by any means necessary, we not gonna sit around and let people beat on us.  So, the Panthers, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] knew the law, at least that much of the law, and they armed themselves, started the Black Panther Party, and what they would do is just organize at first, and follow around to observe the police in their duty and let the police see them with their arms and let them know that they were there, just so they knew somebody was watching and they were not gonna let black people be abused, you know?  You know who you should talk to, who's also in New York [New York] is Jamal Joseph, Jamal is a writer also, a television and screenwriter, but Jamal was a Panther and he was in the thick of it, so he can give you a lot of that history.  As a matter of fact, Jamal, I think spent ten years in Leavenworth [United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Leavenworth, Kansas], for giving refuge to one of the guys from the Brink's truck robbery, you know?
Speaker 2: What was the Brink's truck?
Speaker 1: The Brink's truck, the Brink's breakout, when they tried to break John Jackson out of Attica [sic.], you know?  So, Jamal's got a lot of that history.  Very bright, very loving gentle brother, but he can give you all of that history on, on the Panthers, you know?
Speaker 2: So I'll get his name in a minute?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But so, I went up there you know, looking to join this movement but by that time, talking 1974, it had fallen into disorganization and this as I recall was, was prior to Elaine Brown coming in and really taking over and organizing, reorganizing the Panthers.  But that wasn't all that the Panthers did, in addition to, you know, monitoring the police and making sure that they weren't beating up on black folks, the Panthers had school lunch programs, and they had all these after school programs and they provided food and shelter and clothing drives.  All of this stuff they did for their communities, not just in Oakland, but in Chicago [Illinois], wherever the Black Panthers were organized, and of course nobody ever talked about any of that stuff, they only talked about the sensational part, you know, with these black men in berets and leather jackets, you know, confronting the police with carbines, you know? So, there's--that story needs to be told more broadly.
Story_ID: 506342
Speaker 1: Can you quickly sum up for me how, I mean, I know we're jumping forward in time, but how did all of that end with the Panthers?  How did it end for the Black Panther Party?
Speaker 2: I think it probably, it probably, it didn't end, because--
Speaker 1: But they're, they don't exist anymore.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Panthers do exist.
Speaker 1: They do?
Speaker 2: They do--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Panthers do exist, it transitioned and it transformed, it transformed, they're still involved in working in communities, you know?  But they're not, there isn't the flamboyance that there was in those early days in the late '60s [1960s], and early '70s [1970s], I mean these guys are not walking around monitoring the police with these rifles anymore.
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you this?  How did you escape going to the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: I was in school, I was in school, you had a school deferment and after I got out of the, out of school, it, they didn't end the draft until 1976, I graduated in 1972 [from University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California], but by that time, I didn't care, I wasn't gonna go anyway.  I didn't know what I was gonna do if I was called up, I didn't think that I was gonna go to Canada or anything, I, you know, that didn't interest me, I was just gonna tell them, I wasn't gonna go and fight it, you know?
Speaker 1: What did you think when Muhammad Ali was--
Speaker 2: When he refused to go?
Speaker 1: When he refused to go?
Speaker 2: That he was one of my heroes.  He was one of my heroes, yeah, Muhammad Ali said, that, you know, no Vietnamese ever called him a nigger, you know?  So, we had no reason to be over there fighting those folks.  And plus, I mean, you know, a lot of us in the student movement knew we had no business being over there anyway, this is just another of America's imperialist ventures.  And it wasn't just us, there were, there is a former CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] agent named McGehee, Ralph McGehee, who wrote a book, of course, the CIA tried to keep it out of print and threatened him and everything, eventually what they did, was they went through with a black marker and marked up, you know, blacked out whole passages of the book, and he published it just like that, with their black marks, he didn't try to edit it or anything.  So, you're reading along, he's telling you stuff and then all of a sudden you come to a black marker and, you then, you have to pick up somewhere along the line where the CIA didn't want you to read stuff.  But, essentially what he says is that, what we saw on TV when we saw Vietnamese fleeing south, was that the CIA had gone in, you know, 'cause he was there and he was part of it, and told them America is gonna begin bombing here in forty-eight hours, and you need to get south, you know, you need to get out of the way.  So, once that was done, then the media are invited in to show all of these people fleeing communism, which was a lie, you know?  And that, those are the things that we saw on TV that was, that got the country to get behind us going in, America going in to protect all these people fleeing communism.  It was a big lie, you know?  So, anyway, a lot of us knew that and so, like I said, at that point, after I was, after I had graduated, even though I was no longer a student and was eligible for a draft, I had just made up my mind, I wasn't going.
Speaker 1: And did--
Speaker 2: I was never called.
Speaker 1: And you were never called which is a--we, I won't beat this horse but, I just wanna know what in your mind, what were you gonna do, had they called you?  I mean--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, I was young and I hadn't thought of it that much, I think probably and I wondered, I thought about it at the time, and I think I probably hoped maybe they won't call me, if they do call me, what are you gonna do?  Maybe I'll, try to get conscientious objector status, maybe I'll just tell 'em that I am not going and see what happens after that, you know?  I didn't, I knew I wasn't gonna run and go hide in Canada or, you know, try to--I--that just didn't interest me, you know?
Story_ID: 506343
Speaker 1: So moving forward, you got a job at the black insurance agency, you were working within a black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were playing music?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What years were, what year?
Speaker 2: I moved up there to Oakland [California] in 1974, temporarily I got a job teaching senior English at Oakland Tech High School [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California], that only lasted a little while, there was a strike going on, and they needed teachers, you know, somebody to come in, so I did that.  And, but then I wasn't really cut out to teach high school, it was pretty rough in there man, oh man, those students, they needed like a big guy who could give 'em some discipline, they needed a warden, you know?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, anyway I said, "No, this is not gonna work for me."  Teaching college was--I was teaching adults, you know, at Santa Barbara City College [Santa Barbara, California], young adults and adults and people who were there and they wanted to, you know, they were there for the information, teaching high school kids was something that I discovered that I wasn't really cut out for, you know?  So, I'll leave that to some folks who are very good at that, and I love them for it, 'cause somebody's gotta do it, you know?  So, I got the job at Golden State Mutual Life Insurance [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company] and I probably did that for a year and a half, two years, maybe two years, stopped doing that, in all of this time while I'm up there, in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], you know, at Golden State Mutual Life Insurance, playing music, I met two people who were influential in me being here now.  One of them was a writer whom a friend of mine's sister who was also an agent at Golden State Mutual, she introduced me to him, his name was Michael Butler.
Story_ID: 506344
Speaker 1: Michael [Michael Butler] was probably--I don't know if Michael ever went to college, if he did, he didn't finish, he probably, he might have gone to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] for a year or something.  But Michael was probably the most well read, most encyclopedic brother that I've ever met, including all the Ph.D.s that I know, and, you know, Michael lived for books, his apartment was floor to ceiling books on every wall, except for where there was a window, and we would sit up 'til all hours of the morning, you know, all night long, three, four o'clock in the morning, five o'clock in the morning discussing everything.  Michael could talk about anything, it might be the new subatomic physics, Harlem Renaissance, the, you know, Pushkin [Alexander Pushkin], or Dumas [Alexandre Dumas], the French Revolution, any, you know, black literature, Russian literature, French literature, Baudelaire [Charles Baudelaire], it didn't make any difference, Michael could, jazz, whatever, you know, it's, the guy was encyclopedic, you know?  And, that really captured my imagination and thirst, and I would go there and he would lend me books, and I already have a degree, you know, in English and which I, you know, at least gave me enough to be able to talk to him about literature and some history and that, you know?  But, I think that was the beginning of my real education, that was the beginning of my real education, and still to this day, I mean, Michael is still there, last I spoke with him he was teaching himself Russian (laughter), but the thing is, the guy is amazing and, and he wrote poetry.  So, we would write and exchange, you know, things, ideas, trying to develop a poetic voice and, so he was a real, a mentor and an inspiration to me and then I stayed with him when I ran out of money and I couldn't afford to pay my rent anymore, I stayed with him maybe for about six months.
Speaker 2: Where did he live?
Speaker 1: In Oakland [California].
Speaker 2: In Oakland.
Speaker 1: In Oakland, and then I got, I got another, I got work from someplace, anyway, I got my own apartment and when I got my own apartment it was, you know they have these big houses in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], they have like Victorians, of course are famous, but there's another famous architect named Maybeck [Bernard Maybeck], huge house in Oakland, and another guy I met, his name was Ilunga Adell, Ilunga and his wife had the entire downstairs, that was one apartment, and I had the upstairs, and I shortly after moving in, I would see him in the window downstairs at a typewriter in the lamplight, I think at the time he smoked and you know, it was one of those things you see in the movies with the smoke curling up through the lamplight and him at the typewriter and so we met and, you know, subsequently, and, and I said, "Yeah man," I said, "I saw you, you look like a writer," so he said, "yeah, I'm a writer," I said, "yeah me too," of course (laughter), you know, I hadn't written anything, maybe a couple of poems, I had an article published in college or whatever, you know, some skits, but Ilunga was a real writer, he at the time he was a television writer, he was the head writer for 'Sanford and Son' at the time and had written for some other TV comedy, you know, comedy was his specialty, had -written a couple screenplays, he was trying to get produced, so, you know, at that point, I didn't have anything to say (laughter).  But what I did do, was, I took up a subject that I was interested from some books that my friend Michael had given me about Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen of New Orleans [Louisiana] and priest of a Civil War New Orleans society, did some research, took me about six, nine months, and I wrote a treatment for a screenplay, about forty pages, just a narrative, you know?  To show Ilunga and to impress him, you know?  I let it collect a little dust and blow it off like it had been sitting around, just as I'm showing him this thing, he's going out of town for (laughter) a couple of weeks and he says, but a friend of his is gonna come in and stay at his apartment while he's gone, and he said, you know, show it to him.
Story_ID: 506345
Speaker 1: Turns out his friend was Ellis Haizlip, who was a producer in New York [New York] at Channel 13 [WNET-TV] here in New York.  Ellis, back in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], Ellis produced a famous series for PBS [Public Broadcasting Service], a weekly show called 'Soul!,' introduced black culture to the nation through this public television show on NET, Channel 13.
Speaker 2: What date, what's the date?
Speaker 1: This was back in the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], you know?  But a lot of folks who, people of the world had never heard of, they first saw them on television on 'Soul!,' you know?  Jazz musicians who you never saw on television, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni, Anna Horsford [Anna Maria Horsford], who was associate producer at the time, she went out and did some TV and she's in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] now, Anna was working there with us, I mean just, Ashford and Simpson [Nick Ashford and HistoryMaker Valerie Simpson], first time you ever saw them on TV.  But just--Amiri Baraka, Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], just black folks, anybody, who's who in the arts or in politics that you had never ever seen on television, you saw them on 'Soul!' for the very first time, you know?  So, it was really a revolutionary groundbreaking program, so that's who came to stay in the house, and Ellis saw the treatment I had written, took it back to New York, I heard back from him a couple of weeks later, people at Channel 13 loved it, he wanted to fly me to New York, to meet with people at Channel 13 to talk about producing this and, you know, it turned into this TV miniseries, and everybody loved it.  The only problem was, 'cause I didn't know what I was doing, you know, I was just writing a story, only problem was, there's things that dictate whether or not you can get a project done, and I didn't know any of that.  I was very naive, I had a cast of thousands, it was a period piece with costumes and you know, location shots and this stuff is very expensive, Tammy, Tammy, oh what's Tammy's last name, Tammy Brown [ph.]?  Ah, Tammy, I forget, she's still at Channel 13, I believe, but Tammy was program director at Channel 13, said, "You know, we all love this, there's only one problem," and Tammy's black, she can level with me, she said, "we totaled this up and this is about an $11 million project," now, we're talking 1978?  Nineteen seventy-eight [1978], she said you know it cost them that much to do the Adams chronicles, which was a, you know, a series about the Adams and, you know, Quincy Adams [President John Quincy Adams] and, you know, the presidents and stuff, it cost them that much, said, "They're not gonna put that kind of money into a black project," I mean, you know, and she said that this is the reality of it, you know, she's just letting me know.  And they didn't, and, but subsequently, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte picked the option up on it for, 'cause he wanted to do it and he thought he could get money from NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities], and later, I think [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones had it for a while, it never got produced.  But enough people paid me the option on it sequentially that, you know, I was able to stick around in New York while I was trying to get work and I became a writer and associate producer at Channel 13 in Ellis' unit, a production unit and, you know, gradually built a career for myself here in New York.
Story_ID: 506346
Speaker 1: Came here with forty dollars in my pocket to New York City [New York, New York], that's how naive I was, I was twenty-seven years old, I had come in '77 [1977], for two weeks the year before 1977, for a writers conference.  Ellis [Ellis Haizlip], 'cause it must have been '76 [1976] or '77 [1977], when I first met Ellis in Oakland [California], so in '77 [1977], the summer of '77 [1977], I came here for a writers conference, met all these writers and poets up in Tarrytown, New York and, you know we did poetry and, you know, we wrote, and made a lot of friends here.  They liked my work and so then I went back to Oakland waiting to hear from Channel 13 [WNET-TV, New York, New York] and whether or not they were gonna produce my teleplay.
Speaker 2: So when you were at thirteen, what shows were you the associate producer and writer?  What?
Speaker 1: We, we did some shows for a, a community arts program called 'Skyline,' it was called 'Skyline' at the time, we did, and my interest of course was music, so we had music and interviews with like the World Saxophone Quartet, and who else did we do?  Oh shucks, I'm forgetting now, but yeah all the things that I was interested in was jazz, trying to get jazz on television, you know?  I also at the, when I was there at Channel 13, with Yvonne Smith, who was a producer also at Channel 13, but she wasn't in Ellis' unit, she was black but she was in another production unit there.  We together did, and this is back in '79 [1979], I think, we did what we believe was the very first series of televised salutes to African Americans during Black History Month, it was Black History Week back then, but in 1979, I think we were the first ones to do that and subsequently now, you know, every Black History Month you see, you know, different stations come on, and they give you like thirty seconds on somebody and, you know, whatever station salutes, you know, so-and-so in tribute to Black History Month, and that's all over the country and in all the networks now.  But I think that we at Channel 13 were actually the first ones to do this and we had Romare Bearden's salute, Edmonia Lewis, Honi Coles' [Charles Coles] salute, tap dancing, Constance Baker Motley salute, Ralph Bunche, I'm trying to think of what else, we did a whole bunch of those and I met all of those people, worked with them, you know, wrote the scripts and then we filmed them too, you know, we put them on tape and we ran that and I'm pretty certain both of us are, that that was the first time that that had been done.  So, that was in 1979, but I was, what I was saying was I, I was brought here by Ellis subsequently while I'm waiting for Channel 13 to decide to do this, Ellis wrote me or he called me up, he said, "Look, you know, you could do it in New York but you can't do it from Oakland [California], you've gotta come here and take your chances, you know?"  A friend of mine who was on Broadway, and you know, they all know each other, Ellis, Laurie Carlos, Ntozake [HistoryMaker Ntozake Shange], I knew from Oakland, 'cause she had 'Colored Girls' running on Broadway at the time that I got here but I knew her from Oakland, a lot of folks who were coming at the same time.  A friend of mine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the full title of that play, 'Colored Girls'?
Speaker 1: 'for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf.'  So she did that and brought that here as a workshop and finally it got to Broadway, Jessica Hagedorn came out about the same time, Cyn Zarco, a bunch of us were coming out from the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], Jules Allen [Jules T. Allen], a photographer from Oakland, good friend of mine, he came out about six months after me, David Murray [ph.] came out, a musician, jazz musician, timp [timpani] player from Oakland, he came out a little bit before me, but there was a bunch of us all, 'cause New York is the mecca, you know?  If you're in the arts everybody has to come to New York.  So, I came out.  Laurie who was in 'Colored Girls,' Laurie Carlos had, had an extra room in her apartment in Harlem [New York, New York], she and her boyfriend were living up there and they said that I could stay in that room, so I came, I had forty bucks, they sent, Ellis sent me a ticket, Laurie said I could stay in, you know, in the, in her apartment, I had a round trip ticket, so they said if you can't hang, you can always go back home, but you know, it wasn't, I was here for about two weeks before I had cashed in that ticket, gave Laurie some money and gave the, you know, and soon after that I think, I probably got a check from [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte and, you know, so anyway that kind of brings us up to date.
Story_ID: 506347
Speaker 1: Okay, you asked how I got from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) PBS [Public Broadcasting Service], and you were at--
Speaker 1: PBS, to Essence.
Speaker 2: --PBS as an associate producer?
Speaker 1: Let me try to sum up, I have been pretty much, I haven't had a real full-time job since my--the summer of my junior year in high school, I think, or my senior year in high school, I've been a freelancer.  When I worked for the insurance company [Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company], I knew that was two days a week I had to be in the office, so my time was my own, at PBS, it was on a per project basis, so I've really been freelance all my life.  After I left Channel 13 [WNET-TV, New York, New York] probably like around in '79 [1979] or '80 [1980], or I might have been working concurrently with a, with an organization called RTP, it was a CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] funded program called--
Speaker 2: What funded?
Speaker 1: --CETA, C-E-T-A, it was a program, a government program that provided money, and we called, RTP was called the Recruiting and Training Program [Recruitment and Training Programs Inc.], and what it did was train African Americans and give them some skills to give them lucrative paying jobs in trades, you know?  But I wrote speeches for the executive director and I wrote reports and stuff for them, but one of the significant things that did come out of that for me, and again, you know, my time was my own, you know, I'd go to the office or not depending on, 'cause all I had to do was produce.  But at that time I got to write speeches for Bayard Rustin, who was a board member of RTP, and called up and asked the director, Bill Ross [William Ross], is that I need a speech, is there, do you have any speech writers, and he said yes and they had me write this, so I got on the phone with Bayard Rustin, subsequently met him, and this was in 1979, or '80 [1980], and I was writing speeches for Bayard Rustin, and he liked the first one I did, and you know, called back and had me do another one, so, and I never even thought about that until talking to Michael Eric Dyson, recently and Bayard Rustin's name came up and I said, "Yeah, I used to write speeches for him," and Michael says, "What?  You used to write speeches for Bayard Rustin?"  (Laughter) And you know, I had just never thought about it.  Yes, yeah, I guess I did, you know?  So anyway, so how did I get from PBS to, I mean, even when I'm there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You don't have access--
Speaker 1: --this isn't like eight to five--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's freelance.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is freelance, these are projects, you know?  So, and I've been able to survive that way.  So anyway, Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] came in and cut all CETA funded programing so all of that stuff went out the window and I just freelanced around New York [New York].
Story_ID: 506348
Speaker 1: I came to Essence, subsequently, I was writing around for magazines, whatever I could write, you know, different programs and stuff.  But I came to Essence after a college friend of mine came to New York [New York], Tony Thompson [ph.], and I also drew, I, you know, I, you know, I drew, illustrated, did art and that sort of thing and I said, "You know something, maybe I can make some money as an illustrator for Essence magazine, I think I'll go down there and take some of these drawings and stuff, you know, to the art director," and I--and my friend Tony, who I went to school with at UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California], he came and he didn't have any, so he was staying with me at my apartment, said, "My cousin works at Essence, come on I'll introduce you to her," so, he calls down and talks to his cousin--
Speaker 2: What was his cousin's name?
Speaker 1: Her name was Pat Ramsay, there's a connection here, Pat Ramsay, which will bring us right up to date.  So, it's how I got to Essence, how I met my wife, all of that.  Tony says, calls down to Essence, says, "You know, me and my friend wanna come up and visit and can you introduce him to the art director there?"  And she says, yeah, sure, so we go and I take some drawings I had done and we show it to the art director and he likes the drawings but he wants to see some more and how soon can I, you know, and I remember it taking me hours to draw these drawings, you know, and he thought they were very good, but I wasn't thinking about putting that much work into something that'd take that long, I needed some money.  So anyway, while we're, I met with him, he saw the drawings, asked me to go back and do some more, we go and talk to his cousin Pat Ramsey, we're on our way out, say, "Oh, would you like to meet [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor?"  And we say, yeah sure, so, she takes me and Tony to the door of Susan's office and, says, "This is my cousin Tony Thompson and this is his friend [HistoryMaker] Khephra Burns," and we say hi, and she says hi, and that's pretty much it, you know?  (Laughter) So, subsequently, I was writing a program for the eleventh annual convention of the Tuskegee Airmen that was held at the World Trade Center [New York, New York], and Susan was on the program, so I'm writing script for all these people who have to speak and make presentations and stuff, Susan was one of them, and I had written something that I thought was just fabulous and she messed it up and stumbled all over it, and I'm saying to myself, who is this Susan Taylor person?  You know?  So, that was the--and then subsequently we would see each other around at different events, like at the, at the CEBA awards, Communications Excellence to Black Audiences, 'cause I wrote that program a couple times I think and I once got a CEBA award, but black tie events, and we would see one another and say hi.  A friend of mine, Terrie Williams [HistoryMaker Terrie Williams], subsequently founded the Terrie Williams Agency [New York, New York], worked for Essence at the time, and Terrie and I would talk on the phone all the time, and I saw Terrie at one of these events with Susan and you know, I said, "You know, I saw you guys there, and you know?  She's always smiling, I mean, she seems like a nice person, is that who she is?"  And, you know, she says, "Yeah, she's pretty much that's who she is."  So, Ellis [Ellis Haizlip] took us all out to dinner one time, Ellis used to have big dinner parties at these restaurants, and he always had an agenda but he invited Susan this time, so it's all of us from Channel 13 [WNET-TV, New York, New York], me and Anna Horsford [Anna Maria Horsford], Bertha Hammon, Ilunga Adell and Ellis and Susan and her boyfriend, and I don't know who else, but some point the conversation came up, Susan said, "Well you know I'm always looking for, you know, new writers for the magazine," and Ellis said, "Well here's two writers right here," talking about me and Ilunga, trying to get us some work, (laughter), you know?  So, 'cause I'm looking for work and I reminded her that we had met when I came up there and brought some drawings and all of that, 'cause, she said, "Well send me something," and I sent her something that I had written for a magazine or something, I don't know, I don't think she was impressed, I never heard from her, a music magazine I had written something, you know, probably an article on Bootsy Collins or something, (laughter), you know, so I never heard from her.  But I saw her after that dinner at Sweetwater's [New York, New York] which is no longer there, we were both there to hear [HistoryMaker] Gloria Lynne, I said, well you know, I said, well maybe we'll go, I didn't know she was into jazz and that surprised me, I said, "Well maybe we'll go hear some music sometime," and you know, we're just making small talk, 'cause I'm waiting for my friends to show up, she's waiting for her friends to show up, we were there early.  And, you know, I said, "Yeah, yeah, let's do that sometime," just making small talk, that's what people say, you know, we'll do lunch or whatever, but I told Terrie that, she said, "Well did you ever ask her on a date?"  I said no.  I mean, you know, we were just saying stuff, and she said, "You should call her up and ask her on a date," Terrie's working at Essence, I didn't pay that any mind, went on about my business, but Terrie called me up one morning probably after I'd been up all night writing something for the Schomburg Center [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] or whatever and said, "Susan's in her office and her assistant isn't there yet, call her up and ask her on a date."  I said, "Get outta here," (laughter) you know, she said, "Call her up, call her up," and so, I didn't and, "did you call her?"  She calls me, I said, "No I didn't call her," so I said, "Terrie I don't even know where to take her, I don't know what's going on," and so Terrie looks in the paper and she says, Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] is at McHale's [New York, New York] and I know Wynton, I, you know, was writing stuff for George Butler who was vice president of jazz and progressive music at Columbia [Columbia Records, New York, New York], this is before it became Sony [Sony Music Entertainment], and you know, I had met Wynton up there at George's office, 'cause I wrote speeches for George and you know, copy for album liner notes and stuff like that.

Speaker 1: I called up George [George Butler], I said, "Man, I heard Wynton's [Wynton Marsalis] at McHale's [New York, New York], can you put my name on the list," so he said, no problem, 'cause he had me and plus one, so Susan [HistoryMaker Susan Taylor] had to meet somebody, but she met me up there and that was our first date and so, you know, subsequently, writing some stuff for her, she asked if I'd be interested in writing some stuff for the Essence television show ['Essence: The Television Program'], the weekly show and that's how I ended up writing the one that we did on Wynton, 'cause she knew that I, you know, knew jazz well and that I knew Wynton already.  And so, we went to New Orleans [Louisiana] and we did that show for the Essence television show, and I think that was, that might have been the first one that I had written for Essence television show, yeah.
Speaker 2: And then you also worked on one, 'Black Men In Dance'?
Speaker 1: That was a two-part series.
Speaker 2: Can you remember any of the black men that were in dance at the time?
Speaker 1: Ah man, we did everybody.  We did Michael Peters, we did the Nicholas brothers [HistoryMaker Fayard Nicholas and Harold Nicholas], Honi Coles [Charles Coles], I mean, we got, you know, archival footage on Bojangles [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson], just anybody who's anybody in black dance, we, we got all of them, Alvin Ailey of course, someplace probably at my house in Long Island [New York], I have those tapes from that two part series, I haven't seen them in years but I know they're in the library.  Yeah, that was a two part and that was great, and I did that with Gene Davis who was a producer at Essence, for Essence television at the time and did subsequently, but Gene left Essence, Gene and I and some others worked on a four-part series for NBC or CBS, I forget which one it was called, African Americans, no, 'Images and Realities: African American' ['Images and Realities: African American Men']--anyway the title is there or something what is that, you know?
Speaker 2: So, let me--'Images and Realities,' yeah, 'Images and Realities: African American Men.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Images and African American family.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: African American women, African American children.
Speaker 1: Yeah that was, and each of them were two hours and they were prime time specials so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you had the opportunity also in '92 [1992], to work with BET [Black Entertainment Television]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I'm not quite sure how that came to me, somebody called me up, I don't know what the connection was, but somebody, I was probably referred by somebody, maybe Gene Davis or somebody else, I don't know, but somebody who knew my work, told BET to call me, because I knew music, you know?  And I was a writer, and they called me up and they interviewed me and they asked me if I was interested in doing a black music game show like the old 'Name That Tune'?  And I said, "Oh yeah, that would be fun."  So, you know, we spent some weeks doing some research, and we put together these questions and we would play these tunes and people would have to name that tune, you know?  Who was it?  And that, some of that and then sometimes we just asked trivia questions about music and about the artist and that sort of thing.  So, it was a lot of fun, but it only lasted one season, you know?
Story_ID: 506350
Speaker 1: How did you get into documentary filmmaking and what year did that come about?
Speaker 2: Again, just New York [New York] is such that you meet people at various functions and whatnot, there's a well-known filmmaker, Bill Miles, William Miles, who did 'I Remember Harlem,' 'Different Drummer' ['The Different Drummer: Blacks in the Military'], and some others, we did 'Black Champions' together, and which was a three hour series, documentary on black athletes, it covered all the sports.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh man, I don't know, is it on the resume, does it say, it was in the '80s [1980s], it might have been '86 [1986]?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It might have been 1986, I think, when we did 'Black Champions,' and subsequently, I think a couple of years later, maybe in 1989 [sic. 1990], we did 'Black Stars in Orbit,' about the black astronauts at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and also the black scientists there working behind the scenes at NASA, and also, you know, African Americans in aviation that inspired those astronauts and that, you know, brought us up to that like the Tuskegee Airmen.  So, that's, and that was a, I think that that documentary might have been two hours, you know?  So, I did those two documentaries with Bill Miles.
Speaker 1: And a spinoff from that documentary led you into?
Speaker 2: Well some kind of way, I guess people at Harcourt, Brace and Company [Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich] saw the documentary, 'Black Stars in Orbit' and asked me if I would be willing to write a children's book based on that documentary, taking that same information that we, that we gave in the documentary, using stills and text to communicate this to children, you know, like around twelve-year-old kind of age, I guess, was the target or somewhere in there, you know?  So, and I said, sure, so I did that and they liked it a lot.
Story_ID: 506351
Speaker 1: They [Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich] liked my writing and thought that I should write children's books and they asked me and I said, well, I wasn't really interested and, but they kept on me and they pitched, you know, several stories and they pitched one about Mansa Musa, the grandson [sic. grandnephew] of Sundiata [Sundiata Keita] in Mali.  Mansa Musa was the king of Mali, and he led this legendary caravan all the way from Mali across the Sahara Desert to Egypt and then to Mecca [Saudi Arabia] and gave away so much gold along the way that it completely depressed the gold market in Egypt for like a decade, and even people in Europe knew who Mansa Musa was, matter of fact there's maps from the Middle Ages with a big drawing of Mansa Musa, they thought he was the king of all of Africa, you know?  That's what I said, the king of Africa, you know?  (Laughter) So, I said, "Now this is kind of interesting," so I said, "okay, I'll do this," and I, you know, did a lot of research and wrote them the book ['Mansa Musa: The Lion of Mali,' Khephra Burns] and it was illustrated by Leo [Leo Dillon] and Diane Dillon, top two illustrators in children's books, and I think it did well, you know?
Speaker 2: While we're talking about books, I should have you mention your other four books, or three books, or is it three books, two or three books (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No there's, well, there's one I'm working on now, another children's book with Harcourt, Brace and Company, but I did an anthology with, that I co-wrote and co-edited with my wife, [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor, it's called 'Confirmation: The Spiritual Wisdom That Has Shaped Our Lives,' Anchor [Anchor Books], Doubleday [Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, New York, New York], actually came to my wife, or to my wife, to our agent, my wife's agent, one of my agents, [HistoryMaker] Marie Brown, and they wanted her, they wanted to pitch this idea to Susan, an anthology, because Susan had already done a compilation of her editorials for her column, In the Spirit, so she put together a book of those, called, 'In the Spirit[: The Inspirational Writings,' Susan L. Taylor] and it did very well, and they were excited, and now they wanted a book of, of her sources, her inspirations, you know, the things that she's read that's inspired her.  And Marie said, "Well you know, really that's a book that her husband would do better," you know what I mean?  "You should really pitch that book to him," because, you know, that was my library and my interest and they said, well, what if we pitch that to them to do together, and so they did and so we did this together and we, Susan pulled from her sources, I pulled from mine, we fought throughout the whole process (laughter) but we made it through and, oh boy, collaborating with a spouse, is a trip.
Speaker 2: Now she, we should just mention whether, where she works, what she does--
Speaker 1: Susan L. Taylor is, was for twenty years, or for nineteen years, at least, the editor-in-chief of Essence magazine.  Before that for ten years, she was the fashion and beauty editor or something, she came in the very first year that Essence published, which was 1970 or '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: And what is she doing now?
Speaker 1: She's now editorial director, which means she's over all editorial, she got tired of being editor-in-chief and invented a position above editor-in-chief, and promoted herself to it, and found somebody else to be editor-in-chief, 'cause she was tired of reading manuscripts all night long.  So now there's another editor-in-chief, but she works just as hard, she thought she would work less, but she filled this gap, the space with other work, you know so, she still works, I don't know when we're ever gonna slow down, but that is my wife.  Her column, In the Spirit, in the magazine is incredibly popular, you know that she had to write an editorial being editor-in-chief, and even when she stopped being editor-in-chief, they wouldn't let her stop writing the column, so she still has to write it.  So, it was that, that became the book, 'In the Spirit,' and the book, 'In the Spirit,' led Doubleday to ask Anchor Books which is an imprint of Doubleday, to ask if she would do this other book, and our editor, Marie Brown suggested that I should do it, and so we ended up doing it together.  And it's an anthology of inspirational writings from all religious traditions, from philosophers, from poets, from anybody that has inspired us, and we divided it up into chapters like love, forgiveness, patience, you know, that sort of thing, we wrote long introductions and commentary on all of the material, and then just, you know, gave you the passages, quoted the passages.
Story_ID: 506352
Speaker 1: So, have you always been a playwright?  Or is this playwriting a new venture for you?
Speaker 2: Well no, I haven't always been a playwright, but no, it's not my first play.  After Marie Laveau, Belafonte, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte commissioned me to write a stage play with music on the legendary folk hero, Stagger Lee [Lee Shelton].  So--
Speaker 1: Who is Stagger Lee?
Speaker 2: Stagger Lee is a legendary bad man who shot Billy Lyons, Lloyd Price had a record back in the '50s [1950s], or '60s [1960s], about him, you know, "Stagger Lee, shot Billy, oh he shot that po' boy so bad, 'til the bullet went through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass," anyway, you know, they're gambling, and Stagger Lee threw a seven and Billy swore he threw a eight and so he went--Billy went home and, you know, Stagger Lee went home and got his gun and shot Billy, it says, it goes back, it's old black folklore, you know, that became a song and it goes way, way back probably to the 19th century, you know, the mid late 1800s.
Speaker 1: So that was your first play?
Speaker 2: That was the first play, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then the 'Tall Horse' [Khephra Burns] is your most recent endeavor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Tall Horse' is most recent, and there's a connection there because Alicia Adams, who is program director at the Kennedy Center [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.] was Harry Belafonte's assistant in the early '80s [1980s], when I was working with Harry, when Harry asked me, you know, when he bought the option on the Marie Laveau and asked me to write Stagger Lee, Alicia Adams was his, you know, right hand, she was his main assistant, so we got to know each other ve- I mean we had met when she was working with Alvin Ailey, and everything, because I was a member of the board of the friends, young friends of Alvin Ailey and that sort of thing, but we really got to know each other when we both were working with Harry Belafonte.  She subsequently became director, program director or assistant program director at the Kennedy Center, brought me down to write things for the Kennedy Center, she calls me up one day and pitches this idea to me, what she did, there's a book ['Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story from Deep in Africa to the Heart of Paris'] by a guy named Michael Allin and then there's some other sources also, but that was the most recent work on it, but there's a story about a gift of a giraffe that the viceroy of Egypt gives to the king of France in 1827, and the journey of this giraffe, and how it changes the entire culture of France.  Nobody had seen a giraffe in eighteen centuries, they didn't even know what a giraffe was, they didn't know if it breathed fire, if it was carnivorous and it ate people, you know, any of that stuff, but, so Alicia Adams called me up, pitched this story to me, what she had done was bring together alumni of the Kennedy Center.  I had written programs for the Kennedy Center, Koffi Koko, a choreographer who's from Benin, but he lives in Paris [France], famous choreographer, she brought, he had done stuff, and so she brought him in, Handspring Puppet Company from South Africa, had performed at the Kennedy Center, as has Sogolon Puppet Company from Mali, a brother from Brooklyn [New York], a composer, had done some things, and another South African director, she brought us all together at the Kennedy Center to collaborate on putting this thing together.  Unfortunately, the Kennedy Center lost some of its funding and couldn't afford to carry through with the project, so we were all, you know, and by that time, I had already, I was halfway into the second act of the play, two-act play, so we were all very, you know, disappointed but what could we do, it was dead in the water.  But, a few months later, Handspring, the two guys from Handspring Puppet Company called me up and said, "We got funding from AngloGold Ashanti [Johannesburg, South Africa] in South Africa, they're willing to fund this through to completion, are you still interested?"  I said, "Of course," so they flew me to Cape Town [South Africa] and, you know, for a week and, we brainstormed with a new director, they got a new director from down there and, we, in a week we kind of whipped all this stuff, because before, what we had was like this epic, it was more like a miniseries than a play, but with the director, over a week, we pared it down, combined scenes, and we really got it to the first form that we could really see it, it could be a stage drama.  So, we worked on it, I went back with the new layout, rewrote everything, and I went back and forth to South Africa several times, and finally it debuted a year ago, I think it was last September 10, 2004, and, in Cape Town, got great response, great reviews, so I was there for that, then it went to Pretoria [South Africa], got good reviews, went to Johannesburg [South Africa], got good reviews and then there was a hiatus, it went back to Cape Town, and then it went to Stuttgart, Germany, and now it's on its way to the U.S., so it will--
Speaker 1: To?
Speaker 2: --it, well it'll be to New York [New York], to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where it will open the New Wave Festival this year, on October 4th, and it'll run from the fourth through the ninth.
Story_ID: 506353
Speaker 1: Now is it ['Tall Horse,' Khephra Burns] a children's play?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's just done with puppets--
Speaker 2: I mean, see people bring their children, but it's really an adult play, it's a spectacle, the puppets are larger than life size for it's kind of like 'The Lion King' in that respect.  It takes two guys on stilts to work the giraffe, the giraffe is eighteen feet tall, the pasha, is probably eight or ten feet tall, and would fill most of this dining room, you know?  It takes five guys, you know, to work the pasha, one for each of its arms, one for his head, and, yeah, you know, it takes a lot of folks to work the pasha, so it's a spectacle and its historical and it's about the journey of this giraffe, and this is the ostensible story, from the Sudan, down the Nile [Nile River], you know, to Alexandria [Egypt], from there across the Mediterranean [Mediterranean Sea] to Marseille [France], and then walking from Marseille to Paris [France].  The difficulty of getting this infant giraffe from the Sudan down the Nile to Alexandria, and how are they gonna ship it across the Mediterranean, and then walk it from Marseille to Paris where it changes, there's just giraffe mania takes over all of France.  I've read about this giraffe, and I didn't remember this, but in books about Dumas [Alexandre Dumas] and Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte], and certain periods of history, they all mention this, some mention in there about this giraffe, you know, 'cause it was on plates, it was on jewelry, all the inns and taverns changed their name to La Giraffe, the giraffe prints and fashions, hairdos, longer necklines, people went berserk, you know?  It changed the language, they had expressions, like to comb the giraffe meant something, you know, like a difficult task or something, that was part of the French language, so, and, the kicker, and this is what sold me on it, when Alicia [Alicia Adams] told me that Gustave Eiffel saw this giraffe and modeled the Eiffel Tower [Paris, France] on this giraffe, that's what the giraffe is, it's a, I mean the Eiffel Tower is an iconic real tribute to this giraffe.  So, with the, you know, the four legs the long neck the little head at the top, so I said, "Okay, I'm in," and then, the more intimate story is just the relationship between the giraffe's African handler who's a former slave from Mali and a French scientist who joins him on the journey in Marseille, in walking this giraffe from, he's a French Enlightenment scientist, Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, from Marseille to Paris to ensure, you know, that the king's giraffe arrived safely, and plus it gives him an opportunity to study this rare creature and, you know, and it doesn't make a sound.  So, I mean we get a chance to do a send up of French mannerisms and culture, and we have a lot of fun with it, you know?
Story_ID: 506354
Speaker 1: One thing I want you to wrap up is just any last comments about the tall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About the 'Tall Horse' [Khephra Burns]--
Speaker 1: --horse.
Speaker 2: --what it did, besides the relationship between the Malian from Africa, former slave, the French Enlightenment scientist [Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire], and the giraffe, what we were trying to deal with were Europe's perceptions of Africa at that time, which influence Europe's and the West's perceptions of Africa to this very day, and also Africa's perceptions of Europe.  So, those were the things we were dealing with, this giraffe actually was the beginning of opening up that along with Napoleon's [Napoleon Bonaparte] conquest of Egypt, the beginning of opening up Europe's interest in Africa and after this giraffe caused such a sensation, you know, anything coming out of Africa became of interest to Europe.  So subsequently, you've got Picasso's [Pablo Picasso] interest in Cubism, later you've got Josephine Baker and jazz coming in so, it was really the beginning of the modernist movement in Europe in art and culture and this giraffe was, was really the beginning of all that--
Story_ID: 506355
Speaker 1: So from there I want you to talk about clubs or organizations that you are a member of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --are you a member of Links [The Links, Incorporated]?
Speaker 2: No, Links is a woman's organization.
Speaker 1: Links is women's, and Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] is for children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: What's the comparable organization to Links for men?  Is there one?
Speaker 2: It would probably be the Boule.  Yeah, and I'm a member of the Boule, Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, and of the Guardsmen [National Association of Guardsmen], and I don't know, there might be some others but I can't recall now.  There are too many organizations, you know?  But I am, in the Boule I am the grand graptor, which is the editor and publisher of their publication, the Boule Journal, so and I've been doing that unofficially since about 1992, but officially as the grand graptor since 2000, I think, or 1999 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I--
Speaker 2: --somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: --I'll ask you questions and you answer what you can.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When was it founded--
Speaker 2: It was founded--
Speaker 1: --and for what purpose--
Speaker 2: --in 1904, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] by six black men of the medical profession.  One was a pharmacist, one was a dentist, and the other four were doctors, and it was founded to--because black folks weren't invited into the professional and social and civic organizations of the mainstream back then.  So this was an opportunity for college educated men to gather together among themselves, not to distance themselves from the community, but just to gather among themselves, and to talk about the kind of things that they could not talk about with their less educated brothers and sisters.  And also--
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: --just, you know just intellectual conversations, you know?  The organization, this is the organization to which W.E.B. Du Bois was referring when he coined the term, the Talented Tenth.  Du Bois was a member of the Boule as was Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew], James Weldon Johnson, Carter G. Woodson, you know, going back in our history as African Americans, any black man who was anybody just about, was a member of this organization working behind the scenes to affect policy, to do what they could to lift up the community, these guys founded Mercy Hospital [Mercy Philadelphia Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the founders of the--because they weren't, black folks weren't getting treated in the white hospitals, so, and they did that all over the country, you know?  Not just founding hospitals but other kinds of organizations, whatever they could to do to uplift black people in their communities.  But, they were a secret organization because they did not, if they were public, then you've got people who are actively always trying to scuttle any kind of forward progress of black people.  And if they knew you were there doing this, then people would put up roadblocks, they figured working secretly behind the scenes, it could be much more effective than if they were in the public.  So, it's only recently within the last couple of years that they've decided to become more public about the kind of things, you know, that they do.  I publish and edit their journal.
Speaker 1: Why the name Boule?  What does Boule mean?
Speaker 2: Boule was the name of, in ancient Greece, in Athens, it was the name of a political body, you know?  And, it essentially, I think literally it translates the group or the gathering, or that sort of thing.  But it was the name of a political body of noblemen who advised the king at that time in ancient Greece.  And they, like all other black and/or white Greek letter organizations, this isn't a college fraternity by the way, it's a fraternity for college educated, university educated black men who have already accomplished something in their careers, and, you know, of note, and also done something demonstrably to give back to the community.  So, that's how, and you can't join, you get invited, you know?  So, but, like they, like our country, the founders of our country, they admired the Greek ideals of democracy, and so they, you know, they founded a Greek letter organization and it was the first, it's the oldest of the black Greek letter organizations--it came before any of the college Greek letter fraternities.
Story_ID: 506356
Speaker 1: Do you have any hopes for the black community moving forward?
Speaker 2: Oh always, you have to have hope--
Speaker 1: What are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you have to have, otherwise, you know, you get despair and stop trying.
Speaker 1: What are your hopes?  You hope that we do what?
Speaker 2: I hope, you know, I hope that more and more people, more and more of us begin to organize and work together to lift up those of us who cannot, who are most vulnerable and cannot do for ourselves.  One of the things that the founders said in the preamble, was that, what they were trying to do was bind together men of like qualities, taste and attainments, meaning educational attainments, but also to do by concerted action, those things that seemed best for the community that can't be done by individuals alone.  Working together we can be more effective in, you know, in helping our brothers and sisters than we can just by ourselves, you know?  At that time, there were a lot fewer college educated black men, you know?  So when one found another, you know?  They would gravitate and, you know, another they'd introduce him to, you know, say look, we need to get together and see what we can do together and, and so that's how it began to evolve from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], then to Chicago [Illinois], then to Baltimore [Maryland] and you know.
Story_ID: 506357
Speaker 1: I mean, and you're young still but, just to sum it all up, what is it you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Oh man, I would like to, I think one of the things, one of the reasons I write and most of what I write is nonfiction, it's essays, like the editorials I do for the journal [Boule Journal], and in everything I write, whether it's TV, I'm always, 'cause, you know, there's only a certain amount of things you can get on TV, I'm still very left (laughter), but I'm always trying to slip stuff in there.  What I want to do, what I try to do is to make an impact, to reach as many people as I can, and influence them to make a change.  One of the things that I get to do with my editorials with the Boule Journal, there're only about five thousand members of this organization [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], but they're very powerful influential black men, you know, they're in cabinet positions in the government, you know?  Former members of Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] cabinet, some of them are even in the Republican cabinet in George Bush's [President George Walker Bush], you know, government administration, they're all the college HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] presidents, they are CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and they read, you know, the things that I put in the journal, and they read my editorials, I, you know, I hear back from them all the time.  So, I get an opportunity to say some things to them, and they are powerful people, they get a chance to change policy.
Speaker 1: What are you gonna say to them about what's happening or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm writing that editorial about [Hurricane Katrina], in New Orleans [Louisiana] right now, as a matter of fact, I just had a meeting and we are organizing to try to send money down there to help folks on the ground, you know, to, we've gotta do something and we just had a meeting this past weekend, so, you know, it still has to go to the full committee.
Speaker 1: And you've been a member since when?
Speaker 2: I've been a member since 1995.  I actually started working, you know, editing the journal before I was a member they just brought me in and hired me 'cause the guy who was doing it needed some help.
Story_ID: 506358
Speaker 1: What was your editorial on the 2000 elections?
Speaker 2: On the, oh God, on the 2000 elections.
Speaker 1: You know, with--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't remember 'cause I've written so many of them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, with Florida, with the black voters in Florida?
Speaker 2: Well, what I said was that they had been disenfranchised.  One of the things I brought 'em there's a lot of stuff going around on the Internet about the expiration of the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] which does not, our right to vote does not end, what the Voting Rights Act did, was it authorized the federal government to go in and enforce our right to vote, which we got with the 14th and 15th Amendments, you know?  But the federal government, because black folks were denied the right to vote in certain sections of the country, the federal government passed the Voting Rights Act which authorized them to send in troops to guarantee our right, you know to vote against people in certain states barring us from voting with poll tax, or just barring blacks from the door, that sort of thing.  The idea is that, at this time, you know, this day and age, that's not needed anymore, but too many black folks were disenfranchised in Florida, I mean they threw away, they blocked folks from voting in Florida, they discounted black votes in Florida, probably it's been estimated a half a million black votes did not get counted and others were not even allowed to vote in Florida, and, I mean, that was a mess, you know?  The woman who was in charge of making those decisions, Harris [Katherine Harris], was part of Bush's [President George Walker Bush] campaign committee, I mean there's just so much that was wrong going on down there, so those are some of the kind of things that I pointed out.
Speaker 1: Although, you were not writing an editorial for Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] then, but what would have been your opinion on Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill?
Speaker 2: Well, I happen to know Anita Hill, and then I know people who know her even more intimately, and who know Clarence Thomas and I was not at all happy even though some black folks thought once Clarence Thomas got in and became a member of the [U.S.] Supreme Court, that he would come back home, you know?  He would, you know, he grew up, he's a black man, certainly he's not gonna forget from whence he came.  I had no such illusions, you know?  I didn't believe it then, and, you know--
Speaker 1: Is he a Boule member?
Speaker 2: No, no.  No way.  (Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: Well you said some were Republicans some were, so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I mean, no.  Clarence Thomas has not been invited to our membership.  And, I mean, we know too many people who know both Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas and even people who are friends of Clarence Thomas have confided, confided in, in us that whatever Anita Hill said he did, he did, you know?  And plus, I mean, beyond that, just looking at his, his record, and I mean, he's an embarrassment to me, I'm sorry, I saying that to camera, I probably shouldn't be (laughter), but he means black people no good.

Speaker 1: Very last question.  What is it, and I mean, you're too young for this question but, I'm gonna ask you anyway.  What would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered for having made some kind of an impact through the things that I have written, you know?  Something, inspired some folks, some changes, that's, for me, that's why I do what I do, to try to make some changes and along the way, you know, if somebody admires a turn of phrase, or something I do with language, then that's nice too, I don't mind that.  But I think that's the main thing, you know, trying to make an impact.  I would like to, I would love to write a novel, I haven't gotten there yet, just, you know, been writing nonfiction for so long, and one thing that I would really like to do, I would really like to write one, at least one really, really good poem.  I mean, I write poetry, everybody writes poetry, but I have an appreciation for really good poetry, and most poetry that I see in people is, you know, it's just not--I mean, I would like to write a Paul Laurence Dunbar, you know, I'd like to write a great poem.  So, if I ever write one that I think even approaches something like that, I might put it out there.  But yeah it's a hard thing to do.

Speaker 1: This is a photograph of my mother's [Treneta Davis Burns] family, apparently, evidently when she was quite young she probably looks to be twenty or so when this picture was taken.  From left to right sitting on the floor is my Aunt Bettie [Bettie Davis], and in the center is my mother, who's the youngest of the siblings, and her sister to the right, Aunt Louise [Louise Davis], my Aunt Louise, and sitting on the couch behind them, my Uncle Landry [Landry Davis], then my grandfather, Sylvester Scott Davis, and my grandmother, Cecelia Treneta Davis [Cecelia Treneta Landry Davis] and my uncle the oldest of the siblings Sylvester Scott Davis II, who we all know as Dave, who's still alive actually, Uncle Dave is eighty-two, and still lifts weights in his garage and rides his bicycle on long rides.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a photograph, it's a bit far back, but it's a photograph of my father [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] as a young Tuskegee Airman, I'm sure he was probably only 19, 18, 19 years old at the time.  And this is one of the planes that he few as a Tuskegee Airman.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Oh God, this must be, I would guess, if he was born in 1925, '45 [1945], he would have been twenty, so back up a couple of years, this is probably like 1942, '43 [1943]?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: This is my--yeah.  This is my great-grandmother, her name was Mama Clara [ph.], that's what, that's the name I've known her 'cause that's what my father always refers to her as, but it is my father's grandmother, my father's mother's mother, her name was Mama Clara and they were all, that whole family was from New Orleans and Biloxi, New Orleans, Louisiana and Biloxi, Mississippi, sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: This is my grandfather, my father's father, Isham Albert Burns, Sr. [Isham Burns, Sr.].  I don't know, I guess he looks to be about fifty years old or so here, in his fifties, probably after he had moved out west to, actually he was in Las Vegas [Nevada] when my father and uncle found him again as adults and brought him home to live with us in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Next one.
Speaker 2: Is my grandmother, my father's mother, Nona Mae Burns [Nona Bertrand Burns], and this gentleman, I don't remember his name, but my father said this was my mother's boyfriend for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Not your mother's boyfriend.
Speaker 2: I mean my, yes, I'm sorry, this was my grandmother's, my grandmother's boyfriend for a number of years, and my father, and who really took care of my father, and my dad said, growing up, after he left New Orleans, this gentleman really was the only father figure he had in his life for, for many years.
Speaker 1: Names?
Speaker 2: Nona Mae Burns and his name I don't recall, my father will give you that.
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother and her siblings and I'm not gonna get the names right but third from the left or second from the right is Nona Mae Burns, my grandmother, the others are Aunt Rosie [ph.], Aunt Mert (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Start right here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I do, no, I don't know which, which are which.
Speaker 2: Oh, you don't know which are?
Speaker 1: No, which are which.  I just know their names, you know?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, somewhere in there is Aunt Rosie, somewhere is Aunt Mert [ph.] and shucks, Aunt Sybil [ph.], I forgot, excuse me, that's it for them.
Speaker 2: This is my mother's father in the hat, Sylvester Scott Davis, and his mother, Louise [Louise Spriggs Davis], what was her last name?  I think it was Ritz, no don't quote me on that, I'd have to look.  You know something?  And I have it written down over there in that information, I forgot her last name now.  Well, let's see, it's his mother, it has to be Davis, I'm thinking, I'm trying to remember what her maiden name was, but, but his mother, she would be Davis, Louise Davis and, my fath- my grandfather's sister in the center, Aunt Jane [ph.].
Speaker 1: Spriggs was her maiden name, that's what it was, Spriggs was her maiden name but she married and became Davis.  That is my great-grandfather on my father's side, that is my father's grandfather, James Burns, who had a law degree I understand, was a lawyer in either New Orleans or Biloxi, Mississippi, around the turn of the century.  I don't think for a long time, he was able, he was allowed to practice law there, so he became a principal of a high school and those women sitting there are some of his students.  Later I think he actually was allowed to practice law or he moved out of the South, I don't remember which.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my Aunt Clara [Clara Burns], my father's younger sister on the left with my grandmother, Nona Mae Burns in the center and my Aunt Beverly [Beverly Burns], my father's other younger sister on the right.  Actually my father was the oldest, Aunt Beverly, who's on the right, is the second oldest and Aunt Clara was the third oldest and in that order.
Speaker 1: These are, oh, I'm sorry.  These are my grandmother's family, they had big families in those days, it was a, that's all her brothers and sisters.  There's eight of them, I don't even know if that's all of them, but my grandmother is sitting on the ground on the left and those are her sisters, to the right of her and her brothers standing above her and I don't remember all their names, my father calls 'em Big Joe [ph.] and Lesker [ph.] and J.G. [ph.] and I, I don't know who all of them are.
Speaker 2: That's my grandfather, my father's, I mean my mother's father in his younger days.  I, I love how black men used to dress, he was a garbage man, but look at him, he's clean.  He's got on a hat and a bow tie and a scarf in his coat, you know?  Love it.
Speaker 1: And that is his father, his name was Scott, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: No go ahead.
Speaker 1: His name was Scott Davis, and I think he was actually either from New York [New York] or lived in New York and subsequently moved down to New Orleans which is where my grandfather was born and that's my great-grandfather, my mother's grandfather.
Speaker 2: And that is my, am I going too fast?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That was my mother's mother in her younger days, Cecelia Treneta Burns, and that's her as a younger woman.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: This is, this is Susan [HistoryMaker Susan Taylor] and I with the Mandelas in Soweto [Johannesburg, South Africa] at Nelson [Nelson Mandela] and Winnie Mandela's home, in the backyard in Soweto, this was about two days after Nelson was released from prison.  We watched it on television in New York and then caught a plane, flew up to Boston [Massachusetts], hooked up with Zenani [Zenani Mandela-Dlamini], Nelson's, one of Nelson's daughters and Muzi Dlamini [Thumbumuzi Dlamini], Prince Muzi Dlamini, and which is Zenani's husband and their children, and we flew to South Africa to Johannesburg and walked right in to--that day was amazing, media was there from all over the world, they had taken over Soweto.  They had satellite trucks, they had rented the people's houses, and their house is on a corner so behind us is the fence, it comes to a corner.  All along that fence people with cameras were bunched up and trying to take pictures from all over the world, it was amazing.
Speaker 1: This is a party probably down in Winston-Salem [North Carolina], it might have been Dr. Maya Angelou's [HistoryMaker Maya Angelou] birthday party, one of her big birthday celebrations that Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] has done for her, like the seventieth birthday and the seventy-fifth, it might have been her seventy-fifth birthday party and we were all down there, me, Susan, Oprah, a lot of folks were down there, I think that's, who is that, I forgot now, but.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Susan, that's Susan and I, I don't know what we're doing, we're actually having a candlelight dinner or something, somewhere it was probably a birthday celebration, you know, maybe my birthday or hers, I don't know.
Speaker 2: How many minutes do we have?
Speaker 1: Pat Ramsay, one of Susan's oldest friends, Pat is from Jamaica, has known Susan since she was probably twenty years old and is still a very good friend of ours.  Pat's cousin Tony Thompson [ph.] was my school mate at UCSB [University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California] and Pat introduced me to Susan when Tony took me down to Essence, when I was trying to get a job as an illustrator.  Pat is holding our granddaughter, Amina, Amina Suzanne King, who lives in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: That's me--
Speaker 1: Hold on just a second.  This is the last one?  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That's Amina and I, she was much younger, Mina's seven years old now, I don't know, she looks to be about two or three here, I don't know where we are but you can see proud grandpapa (laughter) with his baby, you know?  That's my, that's my heart.
