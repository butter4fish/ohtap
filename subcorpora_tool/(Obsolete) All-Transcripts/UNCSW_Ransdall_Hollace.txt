Mary Frederickson: First of all, I wanted to ask just a little bit about your background. You weren't from the South originally, were you? Ransdall: No.  I was born in Colorado. I went to Colorado College. I was born in Colorado Springs. I came east when I was about 20 years. . . 18 or 19 somewhere along in there. After I got through Colorado College I went to Chicago and worked for a while in Chicago. I took a few classes at the University of Chicago in the evening when I had a secretarial job there. And then I went to M.F.: What had you studied in college? Ransdall: Romance languages, [laughter.] I took Latin in high school. I had four years of Latin and so I thought I should use that. I was just an ignorant little girl. Nobody gave me any good advice. I didn't know what I wanted. M.F.: What did your parents do? Ransdall: They just let me do what I want to. They didn't give me any advice on the matter. My father was in another part of the country. They were separated at the time I went to school, so I didn't have any advice from any source except friends I knew who didn't know what kind of advice to give me. I liked my Latin teachers. I suppose a lot of children do silly things like that. They like some teachers so they .... She was such a nice person and she took such an. ... I was rather bright, unfortunately. So she encouraged me, you see. I was pretty good in Latin. page 2 I got A in the first freshman Latin. So it was her encouragement that got me to spend my four years. . . take four years of Latin in high school. I had a choice of taking German or Latin and I took Latin. I could have taken French, too, but I spent all my language time in high school on Latin. So then I carried on when I went to college. Then I found a very fine English teacher. Leonard went to the                                    univer- sity in Middletown, Conn. He was a very learned man. He was a graduate of Williams College. He had just what I needed, but I didn't discover it until my sophomore year.  So that's when I switched over.  I took all the English I could get under him.  18th, 19th, 20th century. Everything he had I took. Dexter Woodbridge. Homer E. Woodbridge. He later left Colorado College and went to Connecticut. . . . First he went to the University of Illinois and then he went to Wesleyan College in Middletown, Conn. M.F.: Did your mother have a career? Did you plan a career? Ransdall: No, I'm the only one in my family ever went to college. She was very proud of me, but she didn't know what I was doing. She couldn't give me any advice. But I had good advice later, after I met this professor Woodbridge. He gave me some very good advice except I didn't take it. He thought I should teach school for a while and I had sworn that one thing I wasn't going to do was teach school. I just didn't like it. I didn't want to teach school. I wanted to write. He used to encourage me to write, too. I wrote short stories for him and he thought they were very good. He read them in class. He had great tact because I remember in high school I wrote a story. The teacher asked me to get up and read it to the class. She didn't know what it was. And I wouldn't do it. I was ashamed. Embarrassed. And so I refused. So she said "Well, page 3 we'll just sit here until you read it." She scared me to death.  I still wouldn't read it and so finally, in exasperation, she took it out of my hand and she read it. And the class laughed.  It was supposed to laugh. It was supposed to be funny. But I nearly went through the floor I was so mortified. I said they're making fun of me, they're laughing. They're laughing at me.  So then when she got through she said "That was excellent. Why didn't you want to read it?" So they gave it to the annual and it was put in the annual when I graduated. But I was always shy and embarrassed and so forth. And Woodbridge knew just how to handle me. He never made me read my things. He read them aloud. He not only read them, he didn't tell who wrote them. M.F.: So you could be completely anonymous. Ransdall: Yes, uhhuh.  So I did some very good stories for him. He said they were good. I've never seen them since so I don't know whether they are or not.  So anyway, I went. . . ended up in New York and took a degree in journalism for a year. I didn't learn anything in there. Columbia University School of Journalism. I registered there for a year. And then I switched over and took a master's degree in economics of all things. That's how I ran into the Southern Summer School. It was through Lois MacDonald who was head. . . Louise Leonard. M.F.: Is that how you met her? At Columbia. She has an |f,, from there, too, in economics. Ransdall: Yeah, but she wasn't the same time. ... I met her somehow.  I forget.  I met her through Lois, I guess.  Or Lois through same her. I don't know. I met them both at the/time. Lois was going to New York University when I was taking my master's at Columbia. I didn't have any classes with Louise, but somehow. . . I forget how I met them.  But page 4  anyhow I met them and they began inviting me out. Louise tried to find some place for me in the Southern Summer School. And this mish-mash of education I had, there really wasn't any place for me. Lois was economics teacher. And I hadn't had much economics and I didn't take any more than I had to when I took my master's. The reason I took it was I was interested in the labor movement. M.F.: When did you first get interested in the labor movement? Ransdall: At the University of Chicago. There was a teacher there that recommended some things that I read. This was evening class. . . no it wasn't evening, it was late afternoon. I've even forgotten his name now. I only took this one class under him. And I got to read some things; I went to some lectures.  I was pretty alone in Chicago and I met some peor&amp;gt;le who took me to some lectures and somehow. . . I ran across a copy in the library there of a magazine called The Masses. Have you heard about that? Something in that attracted me so I went to New York and tried to see Max Eastman who was the editor. He had an office right off Union Square. I was an ignorant little girl who didn't know anything. And this funny little elevator went up. It was a rickety thing. I thought it was going to drop any minute. So I moved over so when he got off there would be room for him. And I looked up and it was Max Eastman. He was handsome. His picture had been in the magazine a dozen times.  I had seen pictures of him. No, I never heard him lecture. Anyway. . . he put his arms out because he thought I was going to fall off, you know. They didn't have any door. It was just a rickety old thing. And he said "Watch out, dear." And put his arms out. And I nearly fainted. I looked up and saw who it was and I couldn't talk. I was going up to his office! This scared me so much I waited until he got off and I page 5 went backdown again. I never did get to see him. I wasn't going to see him particularly. I was going to the office of the New Masses. But I never expected to run into him. Anyway, I never got to the office, but I did read the magazine. M.F.: Were you going to try to work for them? Ransdall: Yes, I guess so.  I did some volunteer work.  I wrote some stories for the labor movement. I forget what. . . this was years and years ago, dear. M.F.: I know. Did you end up writing anything for them ever? Ransdall: Yes.  Yes, I wrote a lot of things for them. I covered the Passaic    strike.  I wrote a pamphlet called "Ten Questions that have never been answered." And I raised about $10,000 for the Pasayick strikers who were thrown in jail at the end of the strike. I came in at the end. This was 1926. I think I worked for them after the strike was over. They left a lot of people in prison. For shooting off fire-crackers at the doors of strikers. They said they had dynamite in them and they got them on the clause. . . there's a law that says if you shoot dynamite you get a five year sentence. These big fire crackers had a little dynamite in them. These were all farm workers that couldn't speak English. They were underpaid and they worked to. . . . This was the very bad days of the textile. ... I forget how long the strike had been going on. I wasn't over there until after the strike was . . . until it was over. They killed it. It failed. The leaders of it, so-called leaders, went off and these people were left in jail. There were about six of them. And somebody. . . there was a                        club in New York.  I had a lot of friends. I would meet peqie at lectures and parties and so forth. So I was asked to do some volunteer work. The minute you agree to it, then you're Anyway, I wrote this pamphlet. "Ten Questions that were never Answered." . page 6 Just a little thing. I was overcome, because I got this flood of mail. The money just poured in! I thought I'd get a few dollars, you know, to keep the office open or something like that. And I got enough to pay the. . . . There were five of them. These widows. . . not widows, wives, had children who were young. Their husbands were thrown into jail. They had no money to live on. So I took this money and parcelled it out. Gave them something like $10 a week a piece. Had five families on my hands. M.F.:    This office you were running,   it was like the   Passaic   Relief Office? Ransdall: No.  Yes, it was under. . . it was in the same office as the relief, but I didn't have anything to do. . . . I was with the Civil Liberties Union, on a volunteer basis. I wasn't employed there. But they set up a committeeAid the Passaic Strikers Committee I believe it was calledand the American Civil Liberties Union and the International labor Defense, which was accused of being communist dominated. I don't know if you need to get into that business at all. M.F.: Do you have a copy of the pamphlet? Ransdall: Yes, but I don't know where it is. I haven't any idea. I can't get up any more to look it up. You can get it at the American Civil Liberties Union. They must have it in their files. Oh, I don't know whether they'd have the "Ten Questions that have never been answered." They asked me later, when I was with the Southern Summer School. . . this was very interesting. This was some years later. Anyway, the strike was broken. I got some lawyers to handle cases and we had trials in Hacken-sack, in Passaic. trying to get these men out of jail. As I recall there were five of them who finally got quite long sentences. Ultimately they page 7 must have gotten out. One trial, a trial in Hackensack. . . I'll never forget this. Sheriff. . . I think his name was Numo. Anyway, he decided that I was a dangerous woman. This was years ago and I was just a young sprout. I didn't know. . . I didn't even know what I was getting into, I was so ignorant, youse. I just wanted to help out. He had me followed. He treated me as though I had bombs in my pocket. And when the trial was going on in the court he'd sit across the room, court room, and glare at me. So finally he interrupted the proceedings and said. . . he went up to the judge and said. ... He was the sheriff in the county, see, and he had the right to speak out in the court. And he said "I want that woman arrested. She's trying to influence the prisoners." I'll never forget it, the judge, Judge Siffert, looked down at me and said "Were you trying to influence the prisoners?" I said "No, your honor, I was just smiling at him because the poor man is scared to death and he hasn't got a friend in court. I just wanted him to know somebody was his friend. So I just smiled at him." That was all. The judge didn't say a word. He just went on with the trial. He just ignored the sheriff. Anyway, he didn't arrest me or throw me out of court. M.F.: Did you work with some of the other cases? Were you with the Saco-Vanzetti case at all? Ransdall: No, that was before my time. This was later. The Van-zetti case, they were executed before this happened. I knew about it. I was in New York when it happened.  I helped edit the letters. The letters were printed. And I raised money. . . . Yes, I was on that committee, too. I forget. What was it called? I don't remember the name of the committee but the purpose of it was to get the Saco-Vanzetti letters published. So I had a corner of an office in New York down 5th Avenue and. . . the same      . ..  i :    u page 8 building, right next to the Civil Liberties Union building. I forget the number. I think it was 100 5th Ave. Something like that. They gave me that desk in the corner and I wrote some things, did some publicity and raised some money to help publish the letters. But that was after they were already killed. I was not aware of things when the case was going on. I read about it, knew about it, and was active in the aftermath.  But I didn't have anything to do with trying to get them freed or anything like that. I read about those tremendous demonstrations they had in Massachusetts and I have a whole lot of friends who took part in it. But I didn't know about it until later. I guess I was in Chicago in those days.  I don't know where I was. M.F.: What about the Scottsboro case? Ransdall: Yes, well, that has a connection with the Southern Summer School because after Louise got me to go down South at the school. . . . I used to go down there for six weeks in the summer. I still had friends with the Civil Liberties Union because of the work I'd done at Passaic So the Scottsboro case came up and was just beginning. They wired me and said when you're coming home from the summer school will you stop off in Alabama and see what's going on about that.  So that's the most exciting time of my life! I was happy. I stepped in to a red hot situation. And knowing nothing, except that I was going in to see why nine Negroes had been sentenced to be hung after a short trial. The trial lasted less than an hour, or something like that. Anyway, it was a very short trial. In Scottsboro.  So I went down there, all innocence. And I asked to see the judge and the sheriff and all the officials of the town. And I said the Civil Liberties Union had sent me down to find out why these Negroes had been tried and. . . . That's the thing you can get at the Civil Liberties Union.  I made this report. The Civil Liberties Union report on the Scotts-  page 9 boro case. That was in 1931, I believe. There's a book on that that's just written. M.F.: Have you seen it? Dan Carter's book? Ransdall: Yeah. M.F.: Do you agree with his account? Ransdall: Well, I'd have to agree with it. He took practically everything I said in the report in there. He did give me credit for it, but he quoted it.  So yes, what he quoted is correct. M.F.: No, but I mean about his whole interpretation. Ransdall: Well, no, he didn't get the. ... He did a very nice job, yes. Yes, I think I approved of it. But it isn't as though he were there, had the feel of it, you see. But it's a very reliable and sincere* and honest study from the documents. But it's not like being there and getting threatened and being told you'd be killed that night if you didn't get out of town and so forth. And that makes a little bit of difference. M.F.: I was going to ask. . . . You said when you were involved in 1 the Passaic thing the sheriff told you to get out of town. ... I mean when he told the judge to arrest you. . . . I    Ransdall: And the judge was very nice to me. Of course the sheriff later went crazy. I thought there was something wrong with him. I didn't drive him crazy. He apparently was already rather along the way. [laughter.] M.F.: What happened along that line when you went down to investigate the Scottsboro thing? Ransdall: Well, I went to Alabama first. And you know who Walter White is? Well, I had a letter from the Civil Liberties Union. The director was then a man named Forest Bailey who was a personal friend of    . page 10 mine. I had met him in New York. He was just a personal friend and we used totalk and so forth. He was very interested in helping me. . .or listening to me tell about the Passaic strike and so forth. So he knew my interest in things. He also knew I was at the Southern Summer School. And so, as the director of the Civil Liberties Union. . . here was a case involving civil liberties, certainly. Nine young boys being sentenced to be executed with a short trial. So, because he knew me and knew my interest and knew I was in the South. So it was a very superficial thing. I mean it was done in a very casual manner. Very casually.  So he wired me at the Southern Summer School. Said on your way home do you mind stopping by and that's how the whole thing started.  When I left the Southern Summer School, when the six weeks were over, I stopped by. Forest had given me recommendations to Walter White, who was head of the NAACP. He was the director then. So I was to meet him at this hotel in Birmingham. Which I did. Walter was a Negro in blood, but he was white. And he got such a kick out of this because he said they would lynch me if they knew. . . he took me out to dinner that night and told me the whole background of the case and so forth and gave me all my start. And he got such a chuckle out of it. He kept laughing.  What a joke this was on these people in the hotel! Invited me up to his room and we had a little conference in his room. Everyonce in a while he would interrupt. . . it gave him a big kick. He had that kind of a sardonic humor. He stopped to laugh. He was entertaining a white woman in his hotel room! What they wouldn't do to him if they found. . . [laughter.] Well, I found him a little disconcerting. [laughter.] He was a very gallant gentleman and had a lot of money and he insisted on taking taxis and taking me to the most expensive restaurants in town. Oh, he just treated me as though I were Queen Elizabeth. *&amp;gt; '                                               .." '   J:  , page 11 And I wasn't used to being Queen Elizabeth.  I was a little bit on my guard against him, you know. He acted as though. ... I suppose he thought this was flattering to pretend he was attracted to me, you know, and all this sort of monkey business, which I had never run in to before in connection with my work. I shouldn't be saying this, because he's a very serious man. This was before he got involved in some cases and before. . . . His wife is still very active in the newspaper world. She wrote a cook book. Her name was. . . .  Yes, I heard her on the air.  Yes, a very famous cook book. What was her name? She was very well known. She runs a column in some newspaper.  Well, it's just as well I don't remember her name. Anyway, this was before he was married. He was young. And I thought he. . . I was very serious about this.  I thought he was a little frivolous. Later I decided I was wrong. But I can understand. I didn't understand properly. You see, he was taking a. . . maybe this was his way of whistling in the dark, or something like that. Because he was in danger. Course nobody knew. He was as white as you are or as I am. Nobody knew that he was. . . he wasn't passing, but he could pass for white any time. He never did pass for white. His whole life was spent in the Negro movement, you know. The NAACP.  So I was just a little. . . . This was all very new to me and I was a little shy and I was a little afraid of him. [laughter.] So he told me where the trial was and helped me get my ticket up to Scotfeboro and I started off on my own. I was all right then, you know, when I was running it. When he was trying to help me out and taking me out to dinner and entertaining me in his hotel room and all this sort of business, I was out of my element. But when I was on my own after I got up to Scottsboro, then I knew what I was doing. Inquiring, going around asking the people who should know.  I interviewed the judge and the sheriff and the page 12 mayor of the town. So finally they all got together and in this meeting there was the judge of the trial, the doctor who examined the girlyou know what the case was about. So they invited me into this room to, presumably, to answer any questions that I had. And they shut the door and two policemen stood on each side of the door and the policemen came and guarded the room all around. I sat in the chair. . . M.F.: You were alone? Ransdall: Yes, I was alone.  I wasn't afraid.  I'm not afraid of things like that. It never occured to me.  I was just startled.  I was surprised. After all, I knew they weren't going to shoot me on the spot. They couldn't get away with that!  But it never occurred to me to be afraid. I was very sincere about this. I took this awfully seriously. One of these boys was thirteen years old and this seemed to me a terrible thing and there must be some reason. And these were southern gentlemen. They said "We're very surprised.  We'd like to know what organization sent you down here. No respectable organization would send a white woman down to ask about a lot of niggers." That was their attitude, you see. That I wasn't respectable. There was something wrong.  I must be straight from Moscow or something like that. And they were puzzled because I didn't look like somebody from Moscow. I didn't act like I had a bomb in my pocket. I looked like a perfectly scaredno, I wasn't scared. I looked like a harmless little school teacher. They used to think I was a school teacher. So this inconsistency and this treating me as though I was a dangerous criminal and at the same time. . . this conflict. This was a very interesting                                        wanted to write a book about it. Because this conflict, you see, between the fact that this whole. . . they were doing this whole thing in the name of purity of American womanhood. These two girls. . . didn't matter what they were. . . they were American  page 13 c___ women and they should be protected.  Southern women. And these were southern gentlemen protecting southern womanhood. These poor little girls were prostitutes, you know, and they hadn't had any chance. They were textile workers. They lived in the Negro section of town. They had the most miserable kind of lives. They were harmless, as I was in a different kind of way. It wasn't their fault that they had to try to make money. And they were caught on this train, you know, with these Negro boys and they all came from the same class. They didn't have any particular antagonism except when the law enforcement officers got into it. That's all you need to have lynched all of them right on the spot was to say two white girls were riding on a train with nine Negroes. Negroes.  Why of course they were raped. That just stood to be. . . there was no question about it. It was just a matter of fact. That's what those niggers did. That's all they were interested in in life. Natural thing they started out with.  Well, here I come down in my innocent way and asking them all these questions about the legality of this and so on. I wasn't a southern woman but.... They asked me where I was born and so forth and I told them I was born in Colorado. And I said "but my grandmother was born in Kentucky. My family came from Kentucky." Well, this sort of put them back a little bit. This scared me a little        say I was a southern woman. [laughter.] So this went on for a little while. They didn't answer any of my questions except the doctor did. I think he. . . I came with very good recommendations. I had a lot of friends who were social service workers in Montgomery, in Birmingham and so forth. I had letters M.F.: Who were these people? Ransdall: They were my friends! That I'd met in New York. And I think I didn't do them any good service, you know, by this. But they didn't mind. They were good sports. But they gave me my contact with the social service page 14 work.  So that's how I got in to see the two women.  I was the only one. . . the first one who really thought it was worth while to ask the two women who were supposed to be the victims of this. And that's when I discovered the whole business.  One of them . . . you know, they were told to say that the Negroes had mistreated them.  But they hadn't.  Later they admitted. . . one of them admitted later that. . . .  Well, they just had a little rough talk, you know. This was just part of their lives. This was nothing unusual. The only thing is that [boys?] got in a fight with the white boys and the white boys were kicked off the train or jumped off the train. And they went and told the sheriff, you see, that these two white girls were riding on the train with these nine Negroes. That's what started the whole business.  Was a fight between the white boys and the black boys. I don't know what went on on the train. That was the point. One of them was only 13 years old and the oldest one was only 19. M.F.: You were in this room.  What happened? Ransdall: Yes.  Well, they answered my questions when I asked them just with stern faces as though they were the judges. You know, I saw St. Joan on the stage.  You know when St Joan was being questioned before they burned her at the stake? Well, that was more or less the attitude towards me and I guess I was just as simple as Joan was. I still believed in truth and justice. So I took this all in my stride. I never was scared. It never occurred to me to be scared. These men were very nice looking white haired gentlemen. They treated me with great courtesy. M.F.: I was going to ask, did they treat you sort of like you were their daughter who had. . . . Ransdall: No, they treated me as though I was a misguided school teacher who didn't really know what she was doing. No, that isn't exactly right either.  Well, how ... I don't think they knew how. . . they had page 15 no intention of harming  [End of side of tape.] They answered the questions I asked.  I asked them about the trial.  I forget now. I studied up on the case. I knew what I was asking, so I asked pertinent questions and they answered them, truthfully. Then they said "Well, you are a very foolish woman.  We advise you to get out of town.  We won't be responsible for your safety if you're not out of town within the next hour." They offered to take me down to the train and put me on the train. I said no, I could take care of myself, thank you. So I strolled through the streets. The people were very nice.  Scottsboro is a lovely little town. The people on the streets would speak to me. They didn't know who I was.  I was just somebody. Friendly little southern town. They'd say "Howdy!" when they'd pass me.  I'd say "Howdy." I looked all through the town. There wasn't anything I could do there. M.F.: How long had you been there when this happened? Ransdall: Oh, I got in that morning! And I was only there one day. They didn't have any hotel in town. I couldn't stay at the hotel. They didn't have one.  So I just looked the town over to see what it was like. M.F.: But you'd already been out and talked to the girls? Ransdall: Oh no, no. That all came later. This was the beginning of the thing. The girls lived in Huntsville. The Negro boys were in jail. . . just like part of the courthouse, just a room in the courthouse in the basement or something like that.  It wasn't really any jail. Just a small country town without any hotel or anything. It was a nice day and I enjoyed my walk and I enjoyed the nice friendly people.  So finally when I saw there wasn't anything I could do except get the flavor of the town, I went up to buy my ticket at the railroad station.  I said to the lady from whom I bought my ticketshe was nice, friendly.  She greeted me. page 16 Everybody was very friendly. They were such nice people. The contrast, the thinking. . . here they have these nine young Negroes in prison all waiting to be executed and all these nice people. . . they didn't know what it was. They made a sort of Sunday school picnic out of it, you know, while the trial was going on. The crowds came and they had the band play and they hooted and they bought ice cream cones. This was an event, you know, this business. These were just little monsters, in their eyes, who were being. . . had been rightly caught. And so there was just rejoicing in the town.  I wasn't there for this part of it. This went on the week before I got there. I read that in the local papers, you know, how the people gathered and played music and ate sandwiches, made a picnic out of the trial and the execution and the sentence.  I started to tell you about when I bought my ticket. I thought I'd talk to some of the townspeople.  So I said to this lady who sold me my ticket "You've had some trouble here." She said "Oh, those niggers. Oh, wasn't that terrible? One of them chewed the breasts off that white girl." Her whole face changed. That was the end of any feeling of. . . . They were very nice people but they were just plain. Their minds were just poisoned on this subject. Well, I didn't know all this when I went up there. This was an education. More education than I ever got in all my eight years in college. I said "Oh, I don't think that's true." She said "Oh yes." And then she began to elaborate some more of the terrible things that these Negroes had done to the white girls. So I decided at that moment that I'd go down and see the white girls. The next town was Huntsville. That's where they lived. That was a bigger town. That was a textile town. That's quite well known, it's been in recent news.  So I got a room at the Huntsville hotel.  I didn't have to give any reason why I was there. And then I used these contacts which my friends had given me with the social service workers in page 1? Huntsville who worked among these textile workers, you know. M.F.: Were these women, the social service workers? Ransdall: Oh sure. M.F.: Did they have any contact with the Southern Summer School people at all? Ransdall: No, no, no, dear. These were just friends of friends of mine. I didn't know them. But one of my best friends lived in Montgomery and she was at the child welfare bureau.  So she gave me these contacts. She knew some social service workers who were working among the textile workers in Huntsville. M.F.: Was that Ruth Scandrew? Ransdall:  Yes, that was Ruth Scandrew.  She was a child welfare official there.  She was a good sport. She never blamed me for this. I could have gotten her into a lot of trouble, you know.  But Ruth more or less had my attitude, you know. You expected people to be nice and they were. Except when you came into some of these horrible racial prejudice things. That's what was behind all this. Anyway, they knew where these two girls lived and I went and interviewed the girls, as a social worker. I didn't tell. . . they didn't ask who I was, but presumably they thought I was a social worker because this social worker took me along. She just took me and introduced me and then she left, you see. They were on welfare. The family.  One. . . the younger girl, Ruby, lived with her mother. There were a lot of younger brothers and sisters playing out in the street with little Negro boys. Negroes lived next door. And this seemed so ironic to me. This business of here she and her brothers and sisters were friends with the Negro. They didn't have any of this race prejudice as far as playing with them was concerned. She thought she was talking to a social page 18 worker. She was a scared little girl, Ruby was. She was only about 18 years old, 17, 18.  I asked her questions, if the Negroes harmed her. And shesaid "no, no. We just had a fight" you see, and so forth. She spoke very bitterly of them but she said she didn't have any relations with them or anything like that. I didn't ask her that outright. You know, I pussy footed around a little bit. I didn't say did they attack you? I was supposed to be a social service worker who had some dignity and didn't mention such things, you know.  I just didn't want to hurt her feelings. I gathered that she knew what I was trying to ask her if they had attacked her and she said no, they hadn't. They'd had fights with the white boys and they'd done a lot of quarreling and squabbling and stuff like that. Her interest was more in the fight between the boys, you know. The white boys and the colored boys.  She didn't want to go into any. . . because she was caught on the horns of a dilemma, you see. The sheriff people had told her what to say.  She had been primed, what to say in court.  She didn't want to get herself in Dutch.  Be accused of lying to one side or the other. So in her simple little way, she was a little careful what she said to me. She didn't say no they didn't. She just .... Anyway, she said they hadn't hurt her and I could see that.  She was a pink little face, you know. She looked very, surprisingly healthy considering the horrible diet they had. That was all. Then I went down to see a lawyer in Birmingham and told him that I'd been sent down by the Civil Liberties Union. He listened to me for about a half an hour and I told him the whole story of having been to Scottsboro and so forth. He was a member of the Civil Liberties Union. He was my contact in Birmingham. That Walter White had given to me and the Civil Liberties Union. And all he did. He didn't say a word. He got up and gave me a chair and was very courteous. Sat down, page 19 listened to me. And then he got up and went to the door and opened it and he said "Get out. I order you out of my office. You're not respectable. No white woman with any respect would ever come down and ask me questions like that about niggers." That was the end of that. So I got up and walked out. That was the Civil Liberties representative in Birmingham!  What could you say? I just got up and left. That's all.  I said "Goodbye." He didn't offer me any violence or anything. He showed me the door in a very gentlemanly way. M.F.: He was from the South though. . . Ransdall: Of course, naturally. He was a Birmingham lawyer. M.F.: Thet\ you went back and made your report to. . . Ransdall: Oh, there's a lot more to it but I can't tell you that. I'd be talking for a week. This is only a drop in the bucket. But I think you could get ahold of it and read the report which the Civil Liberties Union I'm sure will have in their files. They didn't quite believe me. This was such a spectacular story. My friend, Forest Baily.the director, believed me. But this caused a fight among the Civil Liberties Union. They didn't even want to publish this, you see. They thought this was such a scandalous story I was telling of what was going on. So there were two factions. This lovely Quaker ladyshe's dead f\nr&amp;gt;CL Davis was one of the members.  She was on the board of the Civil Liberties Union. She stuck up for me and she had a lot of money. She was a multimillionaire. She gave money. Hadn't been for her, I doubt if they ever would have published this report. But she was for publishing it and she said "I believe in Miss Ransdall." I can't tell you how I felt. I had a friend in need! I wasn't mad exactly. I was just sort of. . . I wasn't even indi* ( g&amp;ent. I can't tell you. A strange frame of mind. It was a mixture of page 20 being puzzled and I was sort of sure these people. . . if I could just make them understand, they would know what I was talking about.  You see, I was very serious minded about this whole business and somehow it bothered me that I couldn't make them understand what this was all about.  But you just couldn't do that.  You have to re-educate these people. It was too big a job.  I wasn't able. . . except to write what happened as plainly and as truthfully as I could. Anna Davis was a lovely little. . . I'll never forget her.  She had white hair. She was about 80 years old. And all these big, so-called intellectual men who thought they knew it all, they were all against publishing it. They couldn't defy her because they needed money. All those organizations are always short on money.  So the person who helps, gives money has the, sometimes, predominant \jar&amp;  to say. Anyway, they published it but they didn't circulate it. They mimeographed it; they didn't print it. And they put it in the files.  I got a copy of it of course and then some other people in the office. This began. . . it was such a sensational story finally the newspapers got ahold of it. Graphic printed it. So the story was out. Then I was invited to talk on the air and I was invited to write articles for all the magazines and oh, I was just made. . . by the, you know, the liberals. The kind people who take an interest in things like that.  So I made friends and enemies.  Some people said I was lying, I exaggerated. A hysterical Hearst reporter type thing I'd done on this! M.F.: Where were you living at the time? Ransdall: Oh, I was living on. . . where was I living? I lived in New York.  I've lived so many places I can't. . . M.F.: Were you in Louisville then? page 21 Ransdall: No, dear.  I lived in New York.  I never lived in Louisville. M.F.: I read somewhere that while you were doing this you were in Louisville and free lance writing, writing for magazines. Ransdall: No, I lived in New York. No, I never lived in Louisville.  I had a room in various places.  Several apartments in New York. I was living on W 19th Street, I believe, when I worked for the Passaic people and I think I lived on E 10th Street when I went to Alabama for the Civil Liberties Union. M.F.: But you weren't living in the South Ransdall: I never lived in the South. No, except I went down there every summer for ten years with Louise for the Southern Summer School. This had nothing to do with the Southern Summer School. M.F.: I'm going to ask you a few questions about the Southern Summer School.  You taught labor dramatics, eventually Ransdall: Yes. I should have stuck toyou get me.on the Scottsboro case and I'm likely to talk forever and that really has nothing to do with . . . M.F.: No, I wanted to hear about that also. Ransdall: Well, as I started to tell you, then I got switched off by your questions about Scottsboro, about Miriam Bonner    who was teaching English. She was supposed to put on a play, you know, in which we invited the outside people to come in and give a little publicity for the work of the Southern Summer School. Miriam had taught in North Carolina College for Women, didn't she? She was a graduate of the University of North Carolina, I think, in Chapel Hill, and then she taught later at this women's college. Louise had hired her for the English teacher.  Louise wanted her to put on a play and teach the students, page 22 you know, to do a little dramatics and so forth. Miriam is my friend. We went to Europe together, so I don't mean this to sound condescending of her.  She meant well and she did her very best.  But she didn't have the feel of the textile workers.  She tried to teach them to put on a Paul Green play and they had to [learn?] it. Well, you know. . . and she couldn't. . . . These textile workers couldn't learn things. They couldn't learn speech. And she had a terrible time and she was just weeping and tearing her hair. Because she said "Holly, they cannot learn. They can't learn their speeches." She was just desperate.  She said "I can't teach them. They can't get any speech right." She was ready to leave the school.  She was in a very desperate frame of mind. So Louise said. . . .  She was a very good friend of mine so I tried to help her out a little bit and I said "Well, you can't expect them to learn a speech and become a trained actress, Miriam. Let them. . . just give them a plot." Miriam didn't even know what I was talking about.  So Louise said "Well, Holly, you think you know it all. Go ahead and see." So I got the girls together and I did this outline. . . I just outlined what could happen. And asked their advice. A little plot running through it, you know. We'd have a strike meeting and the sheriff would hear about it and send these men out. . . you know, trick them and so on. And they just fell into this and knew just what I was talking about. So we didn't learn any speechI think I was the first, pioneer in impromptu acting. I didn't know what I was doing. I hadn't got any dramatic background. But I knew, I understood these little textile girls. I knew they couldn't learn speeches and I knew what. . . . I just talked to them informally and so forth and they just responded and it was just the most startling thing. To see their response. They just came alive. They just knew what it meant. And so we put on this play. page 23 And one of them was so successful that some. . . this was at Henderson^ ville, I think. They weren't quite so dramatic to begin with, but we had such success with those we got more and more dramatic. We didn't have any stage setting. We just. . . takes a little thing like a branch of a tree to imply that there was a forest or a tree, you know. We put a few rocks around that this was a road through the woods and so forth. Just enough, just a touch, just one little thing. And instead of having a room, we'd just have a table and so forth. We didn't attempt to have any stage setting at all. Miriam did give one of these plays in which she got some of the students who could learn and they spent a lot of time setting the stage.  You know, getting furniture and everything. We didn't waste any time on that. We didn't waste any time learning. We just got up and did things, a story. It got so rambunctious they overdid it. And it really frightened some of the people. And this one we did in Rendersonville, when the sheriff is supposed to come. ... I've forgotten what it is now. I never wrote this one down. They just loved to play the sheriff and they shouted and cussed the way the sheriff did. Very realistic! A little shocking to some of our. . . . We had some religious people who used to come and social service workers. Louise was trying to advertise the school. And she thought this was fine! But the thing that she did that nearly drove me nuts. ... I got a reputation, you see, for this kind of thing so she'd have these people. . ."Oh, you must meet my dramatics director. Oh, she's doing marvelous things." And she'd get them all together and she'd say "Now, Holly, you must explain your method. Tell them your method." I didn't have any method! She embarrassed me to death! I said "Louise, I can't do that." She wanted me to get up and make a page 24 speech in which I'd tell them my 'method,' you know, like actors do. What's that method school in New York? Where real actors learn certain things, you know, philosophical things, all kinds. . . . She thought I could get this down. Her academic way of looking at it. That was the only pain I had. As far as the girls were concerned, we got along beautifully. They just loved. . . they looked forward to this, you know. They also had such ideas! Ran away with the plot. They had a very dramatic sense. Much more than intellectual people have. M.F.: Well, a lot of them had been in situations Ransdall:  Yes, yes. Sure, they were reproducing. They knew what they were doing.  I suppose if you live through that, you have a feeling for it.  Well, I don't know whether I've done very. . . sort of rambled around. M.F.: Didn't you go down to Mobile, Alabama, one year and run a workshop in a community with this sort of thing? Ransdall: No, no, that was another. ...  Yes, I did go to Mobile. I just had classes, that was all. I didn't do any dramatics. No. What was her name? Bessie. . . I've forgotten the rest of her name. MF.: Eden? Ransdall:  Yes.  She's probably dead now.  She was an elderly woman. She must have been in her sixties then. She was a very. . . she was one of my good actresses in the plays, you know. She knew a whole lot and had a lot of feeling. So she did very nice acting jobs. Yes, I got all tangled up with the superintendent of schools in Texas. They all wanted to take control, you know. They all wanted to put this into channels and formulate it, you see. And I didn't work that way. So I had an awful time trying to explain things.  It's like a child planting. He gets curious and he digs it up to see if the seed is growing. That's page 25 -what they were trying to do with me.    Always digging in to see what wa; happening.    And they killed it.    Because this thing had to grow naturally.    And all I did was just bring it out of the girls themselves, the students.    But anyway.   .   . M.F.:    [interrupted.]
