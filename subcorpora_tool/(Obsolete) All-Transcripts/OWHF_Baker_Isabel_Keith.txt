 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Friday, January 25, 2008, and I am in Tahlequah,  Oklahoma interviewing Dr. Isabel Keith Baker. This interview is being  conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame Oral History Project. Dr. Baker was inducted into the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame in 1997. A retired university professor and long-time  educator, she served on the OSU A M Board of Regents from 1991  until 1999. Through the years, Dr. Baker has received many honors,  including being named    Oklahoma Mother of the Year    in 1978. In  addition, she was also inducted into Oklahoma State University   s  College of Education Hall of Fame in 2005. Thank you for joining us  today.  It   s my pleasure.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Could you start  with where you grew up, and give us a little background on your early  life?  I was the daughter of teachers, and my mother and dad taught together  for ten years and then he went into the construction business later. And I  grew up basically in the Tahlequah area. We lived in another rural  community, but we would come to Tahlequah every summer so she  could go to summer school. Then we moved here permanently when I  was about ten, and it   s been a wonderful place to grow up.  Well, if you can, run through some of the schools you attended as a  young child.  As a young child, I went to school to my mother for a couple of years in  a rural school in Cherokee County, and then basically Tahlequah Public  Schools. I attended   Northeastern State University has a laboratory  school, and I thought that I had the best of both worlds because I was  5  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  being taught by college professors and interns. I graduated when I was  sixteen from high school because every time we   d turn around, they  would come in and say,    We need someone to take Algebra I    or    We  need someone to take English I or II for our student teachers. Can you  go August extension, Isabel?    or    Can you do this?    and first thing you  know, I had enough to go on to college and so it was somewhat different  and interesting going to a laboratory school.  Now having parents that were also educators, you couldn   t get away  with a whole lot, could you?  No, and besides that, those were the days when we were all so poor that  back in the Depression days and there wasn   t much you could get in.  You didn   t have the money to get into any kind of trouble and we had a  close-knit family, a very religious family. We spent a lot of time in  church and activities like that. And they were wonderful parents   good,  great parenting skills.  Now what were some of your favorite subjects?  I liked anything that had to do with English   literature, grammar. I liked  history. I loved those classes, and those were my favorite classes. I loved  to read and get lost in books. We didn   t have the money to travel or do  anything like that, so I traveled through books, and I loved that.  When you were younger, did you ever think that you would go on and  become a teacher, or did you have other aspirations?  I   m almost ashamed to say what my real aspirations were, but I read  some of those stories as a young teenager about lady detectives, and I  thought,    Oh, if I could be a lady detective and solve all these crimes,  that would be such an exciting life,    but that was a young girl   s fantasy.  It didn   t take me long when I went into college to see that my ambition  and my talents would be in teaching, so I got into the teaching  profession.  And my mother was quite liberal, but on this particular subject, she  wasn   t that liberal because she said,    Well, I think it   s fine for you to go  on to college, but you know, you need to get a home economics degree  so you   ll be a better wife and a better mother,    and I said,    Well, but, I  don   t know   I, you know.    She said,    Well, you already know how to  cook, and you need to learn how to sew and   ,    la-tee-dah. So, to please  her, I do have a home economics degree, and I did rather well in it, but I  didn   t like it and so instead I got   well, I had three or four majors. I  received a speech and drama degree, and in education, and home  economics, and then I later became a reading specialist.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  But everywhere I went to teach, the superintendent and principals would  look over my transcript and they would say,    Ah, you have a home  economics degree. Would you teach a couple of home economics  classes?    I actually wanted to get it taken off my transcript because I  did not want to do that, and even though I love to cook now. I don   t like  teaching things like that so I was a speech and drama, debate coach     lots of fun doing that. We took several people to state.  By the way, have you ever heard of Dr. Doug Dollar? He lives in  Stillwater. He   s a General, and he grew up out here in the Cookson  Hills, and I remembered he came when I was inducted into the OSU  College of Education Hall of Fame. He came to see me do that. He was  one of my high school students, and I took this one-act play to state at  Norman way back in the sixties, and he was the lead actor, and now he   s  a General. And I told him,    Doug Dollar, I never thought you had it in  you to be a General (Laughs) when you were such a good actor.     Well, when you were younger, what types of activities did you do for  fun?  I liked to ride horses. We didn   t have that much time to do   we didn   t  have the money or the time to do fun. The fun was mostly surrounded  around our church. My mother played the piano at church, and we had  singing conventions, and we would travel with singing conventions. In  my family, we were all singers. My mother sang alto, I sang soprano, my  dad sang bass, and then my sister sang alto and my other brother sang  high tenor, so we were kind of    The Travelling Keith   s    as a young girl.  So we practiced a lot on those songs and then you would win prizes and  awards and that was something that was fun to do. A real treat would be  to get to go to a movie on a Saturday. You could pay a nickel and you  could go in and out as many times as you wanted to. So I would go  early, about nine o   clock on Saturday morning and I would stay all day.  I   d go out just long enough to maybe get a hamburger, and then I   d go  back because it was such a treat to see those westerns. I loved Roy  Rogers and Gene Autry and all those westerns.  Now going back to the    The Travelling Keith   s,    did you travel around  different Oklahoma cities?  Yes, yes. It was strictly   well, sometimes we would go to Arkansas. In  fact, my mother has a couple of songs that are in songbooks, and she did  quite a bit of composing. She was a very good musician. She was born  in 1901 in Indian territory, and my dad was born in 1900 in Indian  Territory. Her folks ran a hotel and so she was the entertainer there on  the organ for the people who came to the hotel in Indian Territory. Isn   t  that interesting?  7  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  That is.  And so that was, I guess, our recreation. And then I can remember as a  little girl they would say,    Now if Ms. Keith will come and play for  us   ,    and then it would be our turn to do our special song. I don   t know  how that worked, but you would get ribbons and certificates. I guess you  would have judges, but I was pretty young when we were doing that. I   m  not sure how the judging took place, but I know we had a lot of awards  and certificates. My daddy was a great bass singer and it was, you  know, religious music, lots of religious music.  Well, tell me about some of your role models   people you looked up to  during this time when you were younger.  My mother and I were very close, and we were very poor, and a lot of  hardship. The state of Oklahoma during the Depression went broke and I  mean, really broke   and so the teachers would get their paycheck, but  you couldn   t cash it because there was no money. I can remember  traveling with her around to different places to try to get people to buy  her check   her warrant   for profit, you know, for interest   until the  state gets the money.  I know she heard of one time, she was teaching in Cherokee County here  near Tahlequah, and she got word that there was a fella over in  Southwest City, Missouri, which is just over the line that had a hardware  store that would buy her warrant. So we made that trip over there and it  was before Christmas. I remember she said, now I was about six years  old, and she said,    Isabel, let   s don   t show any emotion. When we go in  there, if he says,    No,    well, let   s just be sweet and nice and say    thank  you    and leave. We   re not going to cry or anything. We   ll wait till we  get to the car to do that,    and I said,    Okay.    And so I remember him. He  had his sleeves puffed up in those things that you tied around your  sleeves, and he had this cap on   this visor cap   and she told him what  she wanted. He said,    Yes, I think I can do that,    and so she got the  money and she said,    Thank you.    We got outside and she said,     Hallelujah, we can have Christmas. Praise the Lord.     She bought us all little gifts and went to the grocery store and got us all  good things to eat. See, I was born in    29 and this would have been  about    35 when things were just really hard. And the nice thing about  that though was everybody else was poor, too. You know, it wasn   t just  us. It wasn   t like that everybody was rich and we were poor. Everybody  was poor, and we had to turn our crops over because there were too  many crops, and they thought that was the problem with the Depression.  And we had to get rid of our hogs because they thought there were too  many hogs. And I remember seeing my mother stand out with her apron  8  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  crying because she said,    Those hogs could have been given to poor  people instead of killing them.     And so I guess my mother would be the one that I admire most for her  character, her tenacity, her will or positiveness. I could not believe how  positive she would be, singing in the kitchen. I remember one morning  she got up and she told my older brother    You know, we don   t have any  food at all,    and she said,    It   s drizzling rain. If you feel like it, why  don   t you go out and try to kill some squirrels,    and she said,    because  the squirrels come out when it   s drizzling,    and we waited. And she said,     Oh, I heard that shot. I hope he got one,    and here he comes back in  about an hour and he has three squirrels   one was an older one and two  were for frying. She made the best squirrel dumplings and the best fried  squirrel, and we just ate like kings. And while she was fixing that, she  was singing in the kitchen. But you know, there were a lot of great  women that I admired in history, Helen Keller, just, oh, so many  wonderful women in this world that have had hard battles to fight but I  think she would be my hero   heroine, I guess you   d say.  Now you lived on a farm when you were growing up?  Yes, most of the time. My dad was gone a lot of the time because he had  to work away to try to make a living, to send money back because he  couldn   t make it on the farm, especially after they had to turn the crops  over. I mean, after he had to turn the corn and the potatoes and  everything over, and then he knew there was nothing   he had to do  something. He had stopped teaching to work in the construction  business, and so he thought he could make more money away so it was  just us, and it made it pretty hard for our family.  I milked two cows every day. In fact, when my husband got back from  the war   I didn   t even know him before then   but his dad said,    You  need to pass by that Keith place. I   m telling you that little girl that lives  down there, is the    milking-est    girl I have ever seen. She   s out there  with a lantern every morning and every night milking those cows and  then she walks to school.    So anyway that was my claim to fame. I was  a good cow-milker. (Laughs) Oh, goodness.  What were some of your other chores on the farm?  Well, killing the chickens to fry. I could wring a chicken   s head     (Laughs) that sounds gross now, but I learned early how to wring a  chicken   s neck. I wouldn   t even think of doing that now. It   s just  repulsive to me to think that anybody else would. But mother would say,     The preacher and his family are coming for dinner. We need to have at  least three chickens, and if you don   t mind, get out there and get them.     9  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  So I would get out there and get them, and we   d get them ready.  Those were different times, but they were fun times in many ways. You  become a closer-knit family during hard times. I think probably because  of that is one reason, maybe, I   ve overly indulged my own children  (Laughs) through the years   probably more indulgent of material things  than maybe would be necessary. Of course, they say,    Mother and dad, I  can   t believe   we never felt deprived   never, ever did we feel deprived.  We didn   t have everything we wanted. We had everything, more than  what we needed, and how did you do that on teachers    salaries?    And  it   s just different.  Well we spoke a little bit about your mother. Tell me about the rest of  your family.  Well, I had a sister who was five years older. She   s passed away. I had a  brother who was three years older. They were both teachers. He was  superintendent of schools in the Kenai Borough in Alaska. My husband  and I, before he passed away in May of 2005, we made a trip to Alaska.  My brother had already died, but we went to visit the Kenai Borough  and the school where he was superintendent of schools for several years.  It was a lovely, lovely experience.  And then my sister was a county home demonstration agent, but at that  time they wouldn   t let you marry and be a county agent. She was in  Haskell County in Stigler, and they said,    Absolutely.    She called OSU  and she said,    I   ve married and I just didn   t want to cheat in any way,     and they said,    Well, you can   t have your position and be married.    Of  course, the men could be married and be county agents, but the women  couldn   t. So she had to give up her job. I said,    Don   t let them know  about it. They   re not going to come down here and check.    She said,     Oh, no, that would be cheating. I wouldn   t want to do that.    So she let  them know that and so she gave up her job and took an elementary  principal   s position. Then about three years later, they changed that rule  and called her and told her they wanted her to come back, but she said,     Oh, no. I   m happy with my principalship and my teaching, and I won   t  go back.     But, you know, women have been discriminated through the years. I  think I   ve been discriminated against less than probably anyone. The  only time I really felt discriminated against was   there was a rule at all  the state colleges that you could go to college if you were pregnant, but  you could not do your interning. You couldn   t work with students if you  were pregnant. I never knew what the philosophy was of that. Why  would that be? Maybe they thought that if the kids saw you looking like  that, that they would all want to run out and get pregnant and look the  10  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  same way. I don   t know what their thinking was. But I did a little  differently than my sister, I hid my pregnancy.  I was to graduate in May and my son was to be born in August. I was  doing my interning and my supervisor kept coming in and saying,    Ms.  Isabel, it   s very unprofessional to be wearing your jacket,    and    Aren   t  you hot here in May? This is hot.    I   d say,    Thank you, doctor,    you  know,    Thank you for telling me.    Then she   d come back again and I  would just try to hide. I just was not going to let them win and knock me  out of graduating over my pregnancy. And so, sure enough, I got  through and was it really fun after May 25th to be able to let it all hang  out. So you don   t have to hide your pregnancy anymore, then they  changed that rule later, too. You know, I wondered,    Why didn   t they go  after the men? The impregnators? They didn   t punish them for getting  anybody pregnant.     What makes me mad about it though is that I wasn   t mad. I wasn   t  incensed over it. I didn   t like it, but now if that would happen, I   d march  and I would get all kinds of people to carry signs, and we   d protest. A lot  of times I don   t understand why I didn   t stand up more. I know when the  superintendent one time came into our classroom   or a faculty  meeting   and he said,    All the breadwinners are going to get a raise.     My husband looked at me, and I said,    Huh,    and he said,    You know  my money is your money, honey,    and I said,    And your point?    I said,     That   s not the point,    but he got a  500 raise and I was proud for him.  It wasn   t that I didn   t want them to get it, but I couldn   t believe that we  had the same amount of education, doing the same job and he   s getting   500 more. But I didn   t march and I   m mad that I didn   t. (Laughs) Oh,  goodness.  So how did you meet your husband?  Well, my husband lived down the road on a farm close to ours, and we  both had small acreages. His mother was a teacher, so we had quite a lot  in common. I didn   t know him because he   s four years older than I am  and he went to war, and he came back and started college as a freshman,  because he   d been gone to war for four years. We had an English class  together. Actually we were enrolling and he said,    What classes are you  taking?    and I said,    Well, I don   t know,    and we just didn   t have much  to say. Then one Saturday I was riding my horse down by his place and  he pulls up in his car and honks his horn. It was like in April   or, I   ve  forgotten what, it was cold I know, it was chilly   and the horse hadn   t  been ridden that much. The horse kind of bucked and he said,    Hey, I   m  sorry. I didn   t know that you couldn   t ride,    and of course I took off and  didn   t say anything.  11  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  I was so furious, and I went home and told my mother. I said,    Well, you  can tell the Baker boys are back in town. He   s already tried to kill me on  my horse,    and so forth. Then he called and I told my mother, I said,    I  don   t want to talk to him. If he   s the last person on earth, I wouldn   t go  out with him. I don   t want his apology,    so that   s history. (Laughs) The  rest is history. So then he took classes that I took   every class that I  took, he took, and so we were in the same classes. Finally, he said,    Just  one date. Just one time.    He said,    I think you think I   m a bad person,  and I   m not. Just one time,    and I said,    Okay, one time,    and as I say,  the rest is history.  Well, that   s very nice. Now how many children do you have?  Three children, three sons. Two are attorneys and one is an entrepreneur.  He   s on the tribal council and just was re-elected to the Cherokee Tribal  Council for another six years and that   s a big entity, the Cherokee  nation. They have many millions of dollars budgets, do a lot of housing  and education and health for the people   very, very good group.  And grandchildren?  I have fifteen grandchildren   about fifteen. I have some biological and  some not, but I count them all. I have fifteen grandchildren and fifteen  great-grandchildren.  Wow.  And when we have a big family gathering   that   s the reason I have this  extra lot over here. We can have all this outside activity and cookouts  and things   have lots of room for all of them.  So family   s pretty important in your life?  Very important   very, very. We   re a very, very    clannish    family.  Now did you always have your sights on attending NSU or were you  looking at other colleges?  No other college at that time would have been an option because I  wouldn   t have had the money to have gone. I didn   t have the money.  There were no loans back then, and I knew my parents   it would be all  that we could do and I was working at a restaurant, I was working at the  movie theater taking up tickets, I was doing everything that I could to try  to make enough money for enrollment. And then I didn   t have the  money to do the books, I just didn   t have the money. It was a little easier  back then though because a lot of times those same books, if you got  12  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  there early, were in the library which you can forget that now because  everything   s better, it   s on computer and all that. It   s easier now to do  without the books, but back then the book was everything. And I had too  much pride, I guess false pride, to tell the professor that I didn   t have the  books   and sometimes, they would say,    Isabel, you could have done  better than this. You only made a    B    or something,    and I said,    Well,  I   ll do better next time,    and I didn   t tell them,    Well, I don   t have the  book,    and I didn   t want to tell them. I didn   t want the pity or anyone to  say,    Well, you know, you don   t have the books.    I mean, I just didn   t  want attention drawn to me.  And then when I married my husband, he got his books free so I started  taking his classes, and I had introduction to industrial arts on my  transcript because back then you could do more electives   you could do  a lot more electives. Now you can hardly do electives, it   s everything  you can do to do your required. But back then you could take about  twenty hours of electives and so I didn   t want to miss out on hours. I  think it took 126 back then to graduate, I believe. So I took all of those,  and that agriculture class and stuff that he took. Several of my friends  and superintendents have looked on my transcript and said,    We   ve  never seen such a diversified transcript. (Laughs) You have agriculture.  You have introduction to shop, woodworking. You have all this stuff,     and I wouldn   t tell them the reason I did that.  Were there a lot of women, say in your industrial arts class or     No.  Were you the only one?  I was, probably in most of them, the only one.  Did the instructor do a double-take or     A little bit, but the worst class that he got me into, because I didn   t have  the book, was chemistry, a five-hour chemistry class. Oh, that was so  hard, and I was pregnant and we did all these, all kinds of experiments  and the smell just oh, just took my breath away. But anyway, we made it  through.  Now what was campus like back in the late forties, early fifties  compared to now?  Well, you had this influx of veterans who had come back, and it was  more serious. Now my husband was a fraternity member   a Phi Lambda  Chi   but I was so busy with my school and cooking and cleaning and  13  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  having babies that I hardly had a chance to even look or notice. And see,  after I graduated from Northeastern, then I went to Oklahoma State  University and got my master   s. I got that when I was, I believe,  twenty-two, and I already had three kids by the time I was twenty-two.  And so I teased my friends and husband and say,    That   s the reason I  haven   t been worth anything since. I burned out before I was twenty-two.     The campus didn   t mean that much to me. What it meant was my  ticket out of poverty, and the quicker I could get out of it and get a job  and make things better for my kids and my husband, I wanted to do it.  And I knew that it was gonna take both of us to do that because times  were still pretty hard, even after the war, and salaries were low and  things were high and so     Now did you go straight to OSU or did you enter the workforce?  I entered the workforce and started taking night classes. We would travel  to Stillwater and also they were offering some classes in Okmulgee out  of Stillwater. The professors would drive down to Okmulgee, so that  made it less distance. So I started taking that way and then we could just  go in the summer and   a couple of summers   and finish up. That   s the  way I did it, and it was very interesting. I loved my work at Stillwater,  and it was just lots of fun seeing different professors because most of the  professors at Northeastern I   d had all through high school, and so I knew  them. I   d gone to the laboratory school and they knew me and I knew  them.  Why go on and get a master   s? What was your goal?  The money. I knew that if I got my master   s that I would get so much  extra every month, and I was determined that my kids weren   t going to  have to be as poor. My husband was determined as I was that we were  going to provide a good home for them. We knew the ticket was to get  your master   s and then, too, I loved to learn. I have always loved to  learn. In fact, if I had my way, it wouldn   t bother me at all to set in right  now and go to college with a new major, and that   s the reason I take  these trips to Europe. I take a lot of these educational trips. My husband  and I have been to Paris and Germany. Phi Delta Kappa offers  educational trips, and I   ve enjoyed some of them   trips, cruises, trips to  Alaska. I love to learn new things, and so it was exciting to me to get  different professors at Stillwater and I fell in love with the place.  Now after you received your master   s in 1954, where did life take you?  We were busy, busy teaching. My husband and I taught together. He was  a wrestling coach and a vocational teacher and later became a principal  and later a superintendent of schools, so I mean that was kind of the path  14  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  that we followed. I was busy raising my kids, teaching, doing three or  four plays a year, contest work, debates, active in the church, active in  Little League with my kids, active in Cub Scouts. My boys, two of my  boys are Eagle Scouts. My husband was an Eagle Scout, so he was busy  with coaching and helping them with scouting and just mostly raising  the family and in my teaching.  Now where were some of the places you taught?  We taught in Shidler, Oklahoma, and I believe we were there for five  years, and then we went to Sapulpa. I believe we were there two or three  years. Then we needed to come back to Tahlequah because my  husband   s dad was getting older and we needed to come back, and we  got the opportunity to come back to Tahlequah. Then we stayed here  until we went away to work on the degrees and went to Morehead State  University.  Now at Morehead State, what did you teach there?  Well, that was somewhat of an interesting story. See, my husband had  gone to OSU and was getting a   what is that degree right after the  master   s   a specialist? He had gotten a specialist degree and then he  was gonna go on and get his doctorate, but before he could finish they  wanted him to come to Morehead State University. So we went to  Morehead State University for an interview and during the interview  process they asked me,    What do you do?    and I said,    Well, I   m a  teacher, and I   m a reading specialist.    He said,    Well, what degrees do  you have?    and I said,    I have a master   s,    and he said,    Well, how  many hours do you have above the master   s?    and I said,    One.    He  said,    Well, our reading instructor wants to go away and finish his  doctorate. I think you would be ideal to run our reading clinic.    Then  they offered me this very good salary   more than double my salary here  in Oklahoma   so I said,    Good deal.     So that was my entrance into higher education, and they were so  wonderful there. We loved it. We were there three years and then they  gave us sabbaticals to come back to Oklahoma to finish the doctorates,  which is what we did. And we just had a wonderful time, and then we  had to go back to Kentucky to pay them back, after they had spent all  that money on us. Well, we had to promise we   d go back for three years  and we did. Then we came back to Oklahoma, and I taught at Oklahoma  State University, was project coordinator for the OSU Teacher Corps  Project which the Shawnee Project was wonderful. That Teacher Corps  Project did so much good, and I was just thrilled to death to work with  Dr. Pete Troxell there in the College of Education at OSU. And then I  got the opportunity to come back to Tahlequah, and so I came back here  15  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  and finished out my career at NSU.  What was it like returning to your alma mater now as a professor?  That was different. Well, I was not a professor, I was assistant professor.  But a lot of them there, you know, I had known pretty well and they  were fun people. They were my mentors, so I enjoyed them, but it was  different. We had a really nice dean there, Dean Robinson   wonderful  guy. You know how tales will flourish about different administrators and  I don   t know if it   s true or not, but the rumor was that if he got mad at  you, that he would say,    Let   s go over       He loved to go over across  the street at the center and have pecan caramel ice cream. So if you got  invited to go have some pecan caramel ice cream, you were in deep  trouble.  I laughed and said,    I never got invited to go to get caramel ice cream,  except when I resigned.    He called me and said,    How would I like to  have some pecan caramel ice cream?    and I thought,    Oh, no.    But  anyway   and he told me, he said,    Dr. Baker, is there any way that we  could get you to change your mind about leaving us?    It made me feel  so good because I thought he was going to bawl me out or something  and say,    Why are you leaving?    and, you know, lah-tee-da, but he was  so sweet, and I really appreciated it.  Now in between being an educator, you developed a great spark in the  political arena.  Absolutely.  There was a quote I read   in    82 about the ERA   and it said,    I will not  rest until my four granddaughters have the same opportunity as my five  grandsons.    What was that time like?  I   m still disappointed in that. I haven   t lost my passion that we still     things are getting better, but my granddaughters don   t have equal rights  that my grandsons have. Not only in salaries   they   re still a ways  behind on the amount of money they make, and in so many other ways,  they are discriminated against. And I   m happy, and I applaud those who  are stepping up and making it better, but we have a long way to go. I just  don   t understand how one could be that discriminated against because of  their gender   if that is the reason.  I don   t want to be a whiner, but it has bothered me through the years, not  so much for myself, because higher education has a lot better track  record of equity, actually. I mean, I never felt at OSU. In fact, they came  from Washington to OSU and to NSU and interviewed women and said,  16  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker     What is your salary? How long have you been here? What is your  education?    and they absolutely made them divvy up if we were getting  less. So, I mean, a lot has been done, but I   m so biased. I   m not a good  one to ask on some of these political issues (Laughs) because my biases  come through.  Well, you also made a very ambitious run for Congress in the eighties.  Very dumb. (Laughs)  How did that come about?  Well, I went to a political meeting, and a gentleman stood up and said,     I   m running for Congress. I am a blue dog democrat.    And I thought,     What is a blue dog democrat?    and some of us asked him,    What   s a  blue dog democrat?    and    What are your plans? What are your goals?     and I didn   t like any of his answers. I mean, he didn   t seem  knowledgeable in the educational questions, health care, Social  Security   things that, you know, mean a lot to most of us   he didn   t  come up with any answers. I thought,    And you   re running for Congress  and you can   t even answer these basic questions?    So I came home and I  thought about it a long time and I prayed about it and I thought,    I know  that I could be a better Congresswoman than he would be.     I had had cancer surgery like in January, and this was in the spring, and I  still didn   t have all my strength back, and I thought,    You know, I can   t  do this,    but there was just something that was just pulling me to try to  do that. I suppose you could say each person in his or her life has one  time to really foul up (Laughs) and I guess that was probably mine.  However, it was fun to run. I loved visiting with all the people, and I  was not ashamed of   even though I didn   t win   I certainly was not  ashamed of the race that I ran and the votes that I got. I mean, I was just  thrilled to death. I carried Muskogee County and I carried Nowata  County, Craig County   lots of counties, big counties I carried.  My husband and I laughed. We did real well where they didn   t know me  (Laughs) too well, but where they knew me real well, didn   t do very  well. But I didn   t carry my home county which I really hated that. One  of my sons, it was close, but one of my sons said,    Mother, when you  have sons who are lawyers, do you realize that every time we go to  court, half of the people love us and half of the people hate us?    So they  tried to make me feel good by saying that,    It wasn   t you, mother, it was  your rotten sons,    or something. I knew that wasn   t the case, but some  people probably thought that I was too liberal. Others probably thought I  was, maybe because I was a woman   I   d hate to think that would be the  case. I don   t know why. I don   t know why.  17  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  I wanted to ask,    Why don   t you love me?    (Laughs) but I didn   t. I had  promised my husband I certainly wouldn   t sell the family farm to run  this race and the other person had quite a bit of money and outspent me  and had a lot of money to do the television ads and then of course he lost  in the fall to a real popular republican, Tom Coburn. If I   d have made  my nomination, I wouldn   t have made it in November because Mr.  Coburn, you know, was a multi-millionaire and a doctor   a medical  doctor   and very well liked. So I wouldn   t have had a chance, but it was  an interesting experience.  Why do you think it   s important for us, especially women, to be  knowledgeable about what   s going on in government locally, statewide  and on a national level?  Well, what is it they say,    the hand that rocks the cradle.    I mean, I just  think that it   s just so important for not only women but for all of us to  know what   s going on. I think that we can   t put our heads in the sand  and just let someone else do it or let someone else decide what   s going  to happen to our future. I just think that we have to step out and be  heard. And one of my sons said,    Mother, how many causes do you  have? Every time I turn around, you have a cause.    I work with Habitat  for Humanity and the Relay for Life. I walk with them and I do all these  walks and carry these signs and walk in the parades and do different  things   and I said,    I don   t know, but I   m almost getting too old. I   m  going to have to cut back on my causes because as I get older, my  health   s not as good and I don   t quite have the energy.     Now you were named to the OSU A M Board of Regents and later  served as chairwoman a couple of times.  Yes.  Tell me about this experience and what it meant to you.  Being a member of the OSU A M Board of Regents meant the world to  me. For the first time, I felt that I could use my education and  background in education to volunteer for this service. You know, some  women and men when they retire, they spend time at the hospital and  volunteer and they carry Meals on Wheels. I felt like those nine years  was just wonderful   eight years   was just wonderful for me to be able  to volunteer my services in something that I knew something about. It  was an opportunity that I just couldn   t have dreamed that I would have  ever had and it was very shocking to me when I was appointed.  I had my master   s from OSU and my doctorate from OSU, and I was a  Governor Walters    appointee. And when he called   and I don   t even  18  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  know who nominated me   I didn   t ask for it, I didn   t even know there  was one up or anything about it   and called me and said,    We have  heard from several people that we think you would be wonderful, and  we   re trying to find more women, more active women and so forth.  Would you accept?    and I was just thrilled. They have a gentleman,  Doug Wilson, who is the Executive Director of OSU A M Regents,  who is a wonderful guide and teacher, who gives wonderful  introductions to being a Regent, helps you so much, that none of us  could make it without him because he shows you the rules, the  guidelines, sends the information to you, gives you thumbs up on  different issues, and made it easy.  If it had not been for having a good executive director at the Regents, it  would have been very hard. And the people on the Board were all   the  ones that I worked with   were all dedicated, cared, loved OSU, cared  about kids, wanted to move this state forward and wanted to move OSU  forward. It was a wonderful experience. I just couldn   t ask for a better  experience. I loved working with the presidents of the universities, with  the heads of the departments, with the athletic people. It was just a great  experience. I just couldn   t have dreamed that I could have had such a  wonderful experience.  Now sometimes you have to make the tough decisions and something hit  me earlier in this interview. You mentioned that your husband coached  wrestling, and I remember reading something during your time with the  Regents where one of the schools   I   m not sure which one   had to close  down their wrestling program and I remember reading a quote from you  saying you know,    This is such a tragedy.    Was that because you had  that personal connection to wrestling or     Well, I think anytime you have to shut down a program, it   s not just that  program but it   s the kids that have scholarships. It   s the dreams that are  lost by the students. It   s the coaches    families that are displaced. I think  you think long and hard before you shut down a program. You don   t  take shutting down programs lightly.  Did you find it difficult to make those tough decisions?  It was, but of course we   re only a recommending body. Actually the  decisions are made by the administration, and we tried not to ever micro-manage.  We gave our input but ultimately the decisions were left to the  administration on those issues, but the administrators in the OSU A M  college system   very sensitive to what the Regents think and kept us  very well informed on any hot topic. I appreciated that because we  weren   t blindsided ever by or very   not say ever, but very rarely were  we ever blindsided with a certain issue. It just worked out very well. The  19  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  relationship that the Regents had with the administration was great. And  then at OSU, you have a really strong faculty group that are very vocal,  and I admire them a lot.  Now as a Regent, did you also help spur growth within the system?  We worked on growth and we made decisions about issues like that, and  we were apprised   we were very interested in getting a lot of scholars  and raising our standards, but we also wanted to make sure we kept our  mission, the mission of the land grant college, and that   s much different  than other universities, say, the one to our south. Their mission is very  different. Whereas way back in Abraham Lincoln   s day, we   re to spread  to the masses   to educate the masses   and we never wanted to get so  exclusive and raise our standards so high that we had to knock a lot of  people out. I had a little bit of conflict with some of that. I mean, I really  like excellence, and I liked raising the standards and the ACT scores, but  also   you can   t always tell by an ACT score how well a student can do.  So I was involved in helping with the alternative program where   okay,  you can   t go to OSU because you don   t have a high enough ACT, but  you can go somewhere else, and if you make your grades one semester,  then you can transfer. I loved that plan, whereas before they weren   t  doing that. If they proved themselves   like for instance, if you can   t go  to OSU in the fall because you didn   t have a high enough ACT, if you  go to summer school somewhere and you make really good grades, even  as much as just a    B    average, they   ll accept you. I think that was a  smart thing to do. Some people just don   t test out well. They just don   t  test out well and for whatever reason, they make great grades. I know, I  had one grandson that didn   t test out well on his ACT, but he   s a senior  in law school graduating cum laude, you know. You just can   t always  tell just from a test. To me, I think that should only be one indicator and  not the whole ball of wax like we   ve done it quite a bit in the past.  Are you a big believer still in the land grant mission, even to this day?  Absolutely, absolutely. I just think that Oklahoma is a rural state, and I  know the family farm is not the same and I know that we   ve had to do  lots of technology advances in different areas, but I still think that basic  mission is important and as alive as ever. But I   m so proud of the other  great programs that we have at OSU. Engineering   I   m so proud of that.  Vet Medicine   I mean, absolutely the best in the nation. Our  Engineering program is, as I said, the best in the nation. We just have so  many wonderful programs there. I   m real proud of our College of  Education. When I was on the Regents, the first thing right off the bat     NCATE came and didn   t pass the College of Education   the accrediting  group   and I put in a lot of effort trying to find out why we didn   t pass  20  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  because it worried me a lot. Why did we not pass? Because I know it   s a  great school. I know the teachers are wonderful. What happened? And  the number one reason was that we had twenty-five programs scattered  all over campus, that there was no centrally located place for the dean  and all the faculty and all the heads of the departments.  We didn   t have a spot. I mean, it drove the committee crazy going all  over campus to the different people under the different departments  under the College of Education. So we set in immediately to restore  Willard and that was one of the best things that we   ve ever done. Now  we have most everything right there in Willard, and I   m so proud of that.  I didn   t stay in the dorm when I was there because I just went to work on  my master   s, but I   m told that it was a girls    dorm and it was called the     WOW Girls   Women of Willard      and that, you know      I live in  WOW         Women of Willard.    If you   ve been in there, you see those  beautiful marble floors, and OSU did a great job of restoring that. I   m so  proud of Willard and the job that the College of Education   s doing now,  and they   ve passed NCATE every time since they had their building and  they   re just doing great.  Yeah, Willard is an amazing facility.  Oh, it is. I love it. I was down there not long ago to a meeting.  And you did play a very key role in that development.  Well, I did the best I could toward that. I   m proud of getting that done  with the other good Regents.  Now we learn the background we need for our careers in different  places. Sometimes it   s in the classroom and sometimes it   s on the job.  Describe for me some of the most important places where you learned  the background for your career.  You know, that is a hard question. I just   I don   t know. I loved being a  mother and I loved teaching children. And I think my mother being a  teacher, I think I learned how you treat parents and how you treat  teachers, your colleagues and how you treat students through her. A  neighbor would drop by and talk about a problem with her son or  something that was in school or something   I don   t know   that   s kind  of a difficult question. I had really good teachers that I wanted to  emulate. I had some really great teachers at the laboratory school     caring and smart and inspiring. I can remember one teacher called me in  and she said,    Miss Isabel, it   s been ten days since you   ve checked out a  book in the library.    You know, that might not sound like much, but  that meant the world to me that she was monitoring and was interested in  21  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  me in that way. And she said,    And we have a couple of new books that  I thought you would like.    I was probably thirteen or something like that  and so I said,    Okay,    and then she said,    Now when you bring these  back, well then you know I   ve got these others,    and so we just  developed a bond. I think that she was providing some attention, special  attention that I needed. And then, too, we   ve had some good pastors that  have been very good and that   s basically it.  Can you go into detail about a key moment in your career that you  consider one of your biggest highlights?  Well, one of my biggest highlights was when I was lucky enough to pass  all my tests and get my doctorate because I never had aspirations for  that. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would ever have a  doctorate or ever pursue one. It was just one of those things that I just  kind of fell into. I needed to double my salary so I went to Morehead  State, and then without applying for it, I get this letter,    If you   ll go back  and do your doctorate, we can pay you half-pay sabbatical.    My  husband got the EPDA fellowship plus half-pay, so I mean we looked on  that as being rich. And so I got caught. I had to go. I had to leave and go,  and I didn   t even want to. I just didn   t have aspirations to do that, but I  knew that I could do it, but I just would rather think about my family  and do things with them, and I was perfectly satisfied.  I remember one of my first professors there had a long beard and he  rubbed his beard like this and he says,    Half of you people in here are  not going to make it through this doctoral program.    Well, I went home  and I was stretched across the bed crying, and my husband came home  and he said,    What   s the matter?    and I said,    Oh, Dr. so-and-so doesn   t  want us to do well and he says half of us aren   t gonna make it.    My  husband said,    Honey, it   s a joke  He was trying to intimidate you.  You   re smart. You   re a good student. Don   t let him intimidate you.    I  said,    Well, I don   t want to go to a class to someone who doesn   t want  me to do well,    and he says,    Well, don   t quit. You   re not gonna quit,     and I didn   t and I did fine, but I mean it was just different.  So I guess the doctorate was maybe the highlight of being able to get it  finished and done because it was a lot of work, and writing your  dissertation and doing all the work that you have to do to finish it. The  class work was a piece of cake, anybody can do that, but the dissertation  was really difficult. Then coming up with the money to run it all on that  big computer and all that   to compile your data   so I guess probably  that. But I   ve received more than my share of so many honors in this  world, you know, just so many honors. I mean, I just kind of   I think,     Oh, my. This is wonderful.    I don   t know how they come about, but  nice honors.  22  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Well speaking of honors, when you were notified that you were going to  be inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, what was going  through your head at that time?  What was going through my head was even though I had a hard time as  a child, I never washed clothes on a board. I never did all that hard     hard things like some of the pioneer women and that there are all kinds  of wonderful pioneer women that deserve that more than I do. However,  I   m honored, but I never, I thought,    What is it that would cause them to  give that to me?    I was just surprised.  Do you remember who presented you at the ceremony?  President Halligan. They had asked him to present it, and he did a very  nice job. He was the President of OSU at that time, and he did a very  nice job. There were lots of people. My family was all there. My  husband was very proud of me, and it was a very nice event.  What does this type of honor mean to you?  I don   t know. I   m flattered. I   m pleased, but as I say, I think that there     and I   m not just trying to be modest   but I really think that there are a  lot of wonderful, wonderful women that would deserve it more than I  did, but I   m still thankful and glad that I got it.  Well how do you feel that now people look at you as that role model?  They   re in deep trouble. (Laughter) They   re in very deep trouble. Oh, I  don   t know. Some of my granddaughters say that I   m their role model  and that pleases me. It pleases me when I   m down somewhere and a  former student says,    Oh, Ms. Baker, you were my best teacher I ever  had.    That   s the thing that I really enjoy, things that I don   t even  remember. Or a former college student that said,    Oh, I never will forget  you   you saved my life when you helped me with this or that or   ,    and  those type things are the real rewards. When I get a card or letter from a  former student, or I see someone and, you know, they   ll send me  pictures of their family at Christmas and   or saying to me that maybe  that I touched their life in some very small way   it pleases me.  Would you like to say anything about the people who have helped play  an important role in your life? I know we spoke about your mother.  I think that my teachers and my husband, because I was only seventeen  when we married. I was already in college, I   d graduated from high  school when I was sixteen but back during that time you grew up faster.  It was different. It was a different world but my mother just threw a fit  23  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  when we told her that we were going to marry. She said,    She won   t get  an education. She   s smart. She needs an education.    He said,    Ms.  Keith, I promise you that I will help her get whatever she ever wants to  be,    and he kept his promise. He never, ever was anything but  encouraging. We   d go to school. He   d go half a day. I   d go half a day.  He   d keep the babies. I   d keep the babies, and then as soon as we   d get  through, he would go off and work till midnight sometimes doing  carpentry work trying to get us through to make a living and make it  better for our boys.  I think that my mom and my husband   because he was just so  supportive and helpful   I mean, he would rock the babies. He was good  about helping put the dishes away and help cook or whatever. He was  just   he was an ideal supporter and it made it easier when you had  someone that was right there to help you and support you. I couldn   t  have done it without him. And then of course my mom was always that     atta-girl    personality, you know      I   ve got the smartest, sweetest  daughter in the whole world,    and lah-tee-da and,    What can I do to help  you?    and that type thing. So I suppose   and my good teachers. Those  were the ones that really   I think everybody needs good teachers, and I  don   t think that we as teachers realize what an impact we have.  If you could give any piece of advice to your fellow Oklahomans, what  would you tell them?  Probably the advice that I would give is be so proud of our wonderful  state, but do not look at it with rose-colored glasses. We have a long way  to go in several areas, that we need to make things better, leave the wood  pile a little bit higher than what we found it, and stay informed, and be  sure and go vote. (Laughs)  Definitely.  Definitely.  Now turning toward women, what   s your advice to women who plan to  follow in your footsteps and take that education route   become  educators and maybe even a little bit of a political activism on the side?  I would say take it a little bit slower, a little bit easier, don   t burn  yourself out too early because it makes it a little bit hard when you do so  much so early and try to do too much, it affects you. But always keep  your goals in mind   your short-term goals and your long-term goals.  Well in retirement you   ve been keeping pretty busy.  24  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  I have.  Tell me a little bit about what you   re doing nowadays.  Well, I   m on the board of directors of my bank, and I   m on the loan  committee, and I   m very busy with the banking business. And I   m vice  chair of our hospital foundation. We   re just building two new clinics in  Fort Gibson   a dental clinic and an urgent care center. We just went  yesterday to do the groundbreaking   very cold out there   and I   m  active in Soroptimists, which is a women   s organization where we  further women   s scholarships and things like that. I   m also active in the  American Association of University of Women, which also tries to help  girls and further their education, scholarships and what have you. I   m  active in my church. I   m on the Pastor Parrish Relations Committee,  which is a busy, busy committee. I am active in my party, my political  party, and I actively and financially support candidates that I think  would be good for Oklahoma. I usually go very closely   you know,     What do you believe about this? What do you believe about that?     before I pick a candidate, and then when I do, well I stick with them all  the way. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose, but I   m in there for the  long haul.  And then I have a big family. We have lots of family events, and   a  highlight, I guess, lately in my life has been I was able to take all of my  family on a trip to California. There were forty-five of us who went to  Disneyland and we stayed at the Anaheim Marriott, which is right next  to Disneyland, so you could just walk practically there. Plus you could  go to all those trips   Huntington Beach and all those different places,  the San Diego Zoo and everything from there. It was so much fun to  have all of my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren take that  trip. My husband and I had planned to do that for them but he passed  away and I thought,    Well, I   m still going to do this,    so I paid for all  their trip and we flew out and flew back. We were out there five or six  days, and it was a wonderful trip. We bonded, re-bonded   the cousins  became closer, the little kids played together and we had everything  from two-year-olds clear on up. We had two-year-old twins that were  quite active on the trip, but we just loved them all and enjoyed it. That  was a wonderful kind of a highlight that   s happened lately. I love to be  around family.  Well what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, if you   re an Okie   before you can understand that, you almost  have to be an Oklahoman. You know, I loved Kentucky, but I just could  not get used to not being able to see the open sky, the open spaces. I did  not realize that I was so attuned to the open spaces. Morehead State  25  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  University is a college about the size of Northeastern University, but it   s  kind of like Tahlequah, it   s kind of down low. But here you can look out  and you can see the sunrise and the sunset. Well there, you had to look  straight up   you know, it   s so mountainous and all the trees   and I love  trees   but I couldn   t get used to just the    There was something about  that that when we would come back on vacations to Oklahoma, there  was just something exhilarating about the open spaces.  So that   s one factor, but I think that we   re the friendliest, kindest people  in the whole world. I think I got an e-mail or something that said,    Only  in Oklahoma will someone at Wal-Mart say,    Can I help you find that?     and them not be an employee    (Laughs) and so I mean, I think that   or  that only in Oklahoma will you speak to everyone even though you  don   t even know them. And so, I mean, we   re a friendly people. We   re a  young state. We   re such a young state   1907   and my mother was born  in Indian Territory, my dad was   1901   1900, 1901. Missouri is an old  state, Arkansas, Kansas, all these older states and the culture is much  different there. I mean this is the wild west, where the west was won.  And another thing is, we have so much cultural diversity. We have all of  these Indian tribes, these Native American tribes: the Five Civilized  Tribes and you know the Cherokees right here in Tahlequah and then we  have the Creeks, Chickasaws and Seminoles and all the different  tribes   and there   s a special bond among those tribes and we have so  much culture here. My husband   s great-great-grandmother came on the  Trail of Tears, and her mother and father died of pneumonia on the trail.  She was twelve years old and was brought here to Cherokee County  with another family, and that history is really something. The people  around here don   t like Andrew Jackson. They hate Andrew Jackson  because he ordered the move for the tribes to come back to Oklahoma  here, and I love that. I love that in a classroom, you would have children  from all different tribes. Some of them English not their first language,  and I loved teaching them. I worked on a lot of federal projects where  we did some special work with students, and many of them didn   t speak  English very well and did some immersion programs and so forth. But  it   s just a wonderful state. It   s a young state but I think we   re moving  forward. I think we   ve done very well to be as young as we are.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Oh, my. I would like for them to say that she got up every morning and  did the very best that she could do   that she tried to help her fellow man  and that she tried to think less of herself and more of others.  Well is there anything you would like to add that we have not spoken  about today?  26  Baker  Nykolaiszyn  Baker  I can   t think of a thing. I think you   ve been a great interviewer.
