 Lemons  We   ll just have each of you starting with you just state your name, and if you  don   t mind tell us your birthday, or at least where you were born.  Sally   s fine.  Sally Parker  I was born January 19, 1924 in Wichita, Kansas.  You just had a birthday.  I did.  If you still celebrate those I guess, you just had a birthday   I do because I had a great grandson born on my birthday two years ago.  Well that   s all right. Where were you born?  Wichita, Kansas.  Okay. I guess you get to be next.  I   m Tressie Hathaway, and I was born in the country here in 1914; I   m ten  years older than you.  Virginia Wise, I was born in Kenton, Oklahoma on January 26, 1927.  We went out to Kenton yesterday; I   d never been out there, that   s pretty yeah.  It   s real pretty.  It   s real surprising isn   t it?  Yeah, it is. I told Steve that this doesn   t even look like the same country.    How  can these be right next to each other, it doesn   t make any sense.    Well we   ll  just kinda start real general, a typical day, you might want to start with where  you lived, was it on a farm or in town and then just what was your typical day  like in the 1930   s or around the dust bowl. Just whoever wants to can go first?  5  Parker  Kite  Parker  Kite  Lemons  Kite  Lemons  Parker  Lemons  Parker  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  My folks had a variety store here. My sister was here yesterday.  Oh yeah.  We lived in the back room, which wasn   t near as big as this area, and what we  played with was the boxes that merchandise came in, we made houses and they  had great big boxes then and we skated because there was concrete in front of  the store a of course we walked to school and walked home and some of the  games that you asked us that we played, I remember one of them that I really  liked was kick the can and run, and then we played    Black Man    and    Red  Rover Red Rover Come Over.     I   m trying to remember any stories that she told on you. (All laugh)  Now would be your chance then to get her back.  Yeah, she told some good ones. (All laugh) Surely you   ll have to tell us some.  You   ll have to tell us something.  Well my mother taught music lessons, taught piano, and so we couldn   t stay in  that room very much, we had to go outside or go into the store and, well of  course, when the dirt was blowing we didn   t stay out a lot. Even at school we  didn   t, we stayed inside.  Sounds familiar to you two I guess?  I can remember when I was in grade school we were having quite a dirt storm  and I had to go over to the high school for something and there was a barbed  wire fence around the high school and I ran into the fence and I had scars.  What was a typical day like for you? What would have been the first thing you  did when you got up in the morning?  Well when I was a kid we lived in the dugout, when I was a baby, you know  when I was a little girl, I think I was about   I don   t know, maybe six, my  folks built an adobe house, and so when we lived in this dugout, I had three  brothers and me and then I had a baby sister, and I know the kid told me, or  my uncle teased me said my mother had a little black baby and they couldn   t  get me to go down in the dugout cause I didn   t want to go see that black baby.  So this is when your little sister was born?  Yes.  Oh my God.  Well I was pretty young then, I was 4 years older than her. (Laughs) But  anyway, we lived in that    til I was about 6 or 8 maybe and then we moved in to  6  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  the adobe house which was a really nice house cause we lived in that dugout  so long, and the folks, the Mexicans made the adobes for us and then they laid  them and then we had a carpenter to finish the work on the inside, and we just  lived there and my mother had a garden, and my dad raised broomcorn and  maize and they had to do all their farm work with horses. We had some really  nice big horses and we went to a country school. We had a school which was,  one time it was about a mile north of our house and they moved it over  southwest of us about two miles and a half, and we walked to school in nice  weather and my dad finally got a model-T truck and so when the weather was  bad he   d take us to school in a model-T truck. Things went along pretty  smooth until, well my dad had a good crop every year and we got along just  fine and then when the draught struck why then we couldn   t raise anything, it  just wouldn   t rain, wouldn   t rain. My mother had a garden out by the well  where she could water it, and even that, the sand blowed and it wasn   t too  successful.  You mentioned a little bit earlier that your dad had hired hands helping with  the broomcorn?  Yes.  When the broomcorn business was going, how many hands did he have  working for him?  Oh, we had about ten probably.  So several.  Yeah, we had to room and board em you know, and had to cook for em. I  helped my mother cook when I was there and when I was in school, she had a  hired girl to help her; she usually got a Mexican girl to help her, well once she  had some other girl to help her cook for the hired hands and anyway there was  a lot of dishes to wash too  I got in on some of that too. (Laughs)  Did you have to wash or dry or put away? Those were the three at our house,  that would be the three separations and nobody wanted to put away.  I   d have to do it, and then we had a separator, we had the separator milk you  know; churn your butter and all that junk. Then after the dirt started blowing  why they didn   t have anything for the cows to eat, we had to sell our cows, and  some of them died you know. It was just hard times I   ll tell ya. After I started  high school, I had to work for my room and board in town so I could go to  school. Then when I was a senior, it was 1932, I got married that year and  moved to town with my in-laws.  And how was that?  Well it wasn   t very good because they had a bunch of kids, and then I started  having a family too, and I had a couple of children while we lived up there.  7  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Parker  Hathaway  Lemons  Wise  Kite  Wise  Lemons  Kite  Wise  Kite  Oh goodness.  And oh, it was pretty rough, it didn   t seem like we worried much, we had  parties, play parties, and we   d have card parties, we   d play Pinochle and Pitch  and it didn   t seem to worry me much about the groceries and stuff then, we   d  clean dirt everyday.  (Laughs) Yeah. I   ve heard people talk about you had to take a paintbrush to  clean the dirt out of the windows?  Yeah.  What kind of tools did you guys use to clean it out?  Well you know my dad, I think he bought one of the first, it was an Electrolux  sweeper to clean the store with, the bins in the store, and we   d at the house too,  but that was probably in about 1936, I think.  We just swept and then we   d dust you know and I remember after Bob was  born, my second baby, I got up one morning and cleaned dirt from out behind  my bed and I had a water bucket, and I had about that much dirt in my bucket.  (Laughs) Oh it was terrible.  Well how about you Miss Wise, what was it?  Well I   ll start with Kenton cause that   s where I was born. That one dust storm  that hit, the very first one, we really thought it was the end of the world. It was  just a rolling over the Black Mesa and we had Miss Cochran and Miss Collins,  the lot of them, you know Miss Freeman, all of em, we all prayed. Of course,  us kids we were small and we thought, Okay, everybody was lighting candles  and crying, so we really thought that was the end of all of us.  That   s funny cause when I saw Kenton for the first time; I thought    it    was the  end of the world.  And I loved it cause that   s where I was raised.  It   s beautiful there.  I   ve got a question, when I saw Kenton, it was about    87 I think when I first  drove through there, I thought    Who in there right minds would start a town  right here?    What was the main business in the town, do you remember what,  when it first started up, was it ranching?  Mainly.  Yeah, you can   t farm out there.  8  Parker  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  Fairchild  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Lemons  It was the county seat at one time.  Yes it was, and then a lot of them would work on the road with the mules, they  didn   t even have anything to work with machinery or anything. And then Mr.  Grinned owned these mules and grated the road. I don   t remember how they  done it, but I remember that.  When did you move to Boise City?  In    36 I think. And that   s when it really started getting bad.  And how come, why did you move from Kenton to Boise city?  I   m Louise Fairchild.  It goes way back: my grandpa owned a little house there and it was kind of like  a farm, buy it was in town, and we had a well with our own water, and he had  horses and two milk cows that I can remember and chickens and all that, and  like she said, after it got pretty bad, we wouldn   t get no rain or anything. From  what I hear Sally   I don   t know if this is true or not   the government came in  and I remember they shot one of our cows.  Shot what?  Shot one of our cows.  Yes.  Because there was no grass, well nothing you know to feed it, and I remember  we all cried over that cow. And the dust storms started right in.  Right at that time.  Went to school, my brother and I, and he protected me. Benny   hadn   t of been  for him, I wouldn   t have made it, cause I cried all the time. He   d just take me  under his coat, and then lead me to the school and back, and I remember  mother when I got home, putting wet towels on the windows for the dirt was  that thick coming in and I don   t know how many times she   d clean off the  table before we could sit down to eat. It was that black dirt; it was pretty rough  for us.  They would wet sheets to put over the windows too.  Yes, Momma done that too.  And hung it up like a curtain.  Mrs. Fairchild, you   re getting in right at the right time; good time for you.  9  Fairchild  Lemons  Kite  Fairchild  Lemons  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Lemons  Fairchild  Wise  Lemons  Fairchild  Lemons  Fairchild  Well let   s see, you look so familiar, do I know you from way back when or   ?  Well I don   t think so, I don   t know.  You ever watch    America   s Most Wanted?     (Everyone laughs a lot)  Well I   ll tell you at our house my TV was kind of on the blink and I was just  real sad and that gal brought me through, were she   d go to?  She probably went back to the front.  Well anyway, went over started it up and she   s doing okay.  She worked on your television, huh?  Yes, I   m very un-mechanical. Some people are mechanical, I   m un-mechanical.  Well they all already had to do this, say their name and their birthday and  where they were born, so we   ll let you do that, okay?  Well my name was Margaret Louise Web, and then my married name is  Fairchild.  I didn   t even give them my maiden name.  You don   t want us to know, do you?  And I was born between here and Guymon, about 45miles, and in about a mile  and a half, down in a, well it   s a pasture now. That   s were I was born, on  February 4, 1919. And I was number eleven of our family, but two had passed  away in infancy. Our folks, they were the kind of people that didn   t dwell  much on the bad; there   s always some good around you know. So I remember  after we would get through with the supper, I would do the dishes and I would  hurry through and go and have what we called the    Day Bed.    You can tell  them about the day bed can   t you? Which was a couch deal in the living room  and I   d I crawl over behind and crawl underneath an Indian blanket and boy,  by the time those dishes were ready; everybody knew I was just sound asleep,  but I really wasn   t  (All laugh)  You were playing possum.  I was playing possum. Well we had a fellow from Arkansas, we called him,  what did we call him, anyway? Oh, he had to tell some of us all sorts of  stories, some of them scary and some of them just right or funny and one  night, see the men would come in and they would sit around until bed time and  then these hard men all slept out in the garage, I think, I   m not right sure on  10  Hathaway  Lemons  Fairchild  Lemons  Wise  Hathaway  Lemons  Wise  Kite  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  Wise  that, but anyway, the guy from Arkansas told a real funny story and I laughed.  And needless to say that was the end of getting out of helping with the dishes.  Possum got woke up, didn   t it?  That   s right.  And we have in our family, the place where my folks filed on when they came  from Virginia and then the place where they bought and moved to later, both  places are still in the family.  Well Mrs. Wise, you were saying that you were really scared and crying and  your brother was taking care of you, was that because you were scared of the  dust?  Right.  That   s kind of scary to see something like this.  Yes it is.  Oh you should have seen it in Kenton, that was over that Black Mesa, we  really thought that was it. And then one time I was   well several times, but  this one time Benny and I, we thought it was going to be a real beautiful day,  started out that way, and then when we got out of school it was one of the  worst ones I ever did see, and we were going by this house, Momma   s  neighbor. Her name was Mrs. Wright and she was caring for her husband, he  was real sick, it was a tin house, do you remember that?  And the roof was tin and so was the siding. Some of that roof blew off and it  went over my head, just barely missed me, so that was worse on me, Benny  had to drag me home almost. (All laugh) And he told Momma that she almost  got hit by this tin roof, so we really did go through a lot of those dust storms.  I was just trying, I was looking at when you were born, you would have been 7  or 8, 6, 7, 8 and that   s pretty young to have all that going on.  Oh yeah, I didn   t think I   d ever   I cried all the time cause I was scared to  death of them dust storms.  Yeah, did you ever have nightmares or anything about dust?  Well I got up a lot at night, Momma said, and cried, but that didn   t mean  nothing cause that   s the way I always did. (Laughs)  Yeah, you did it anyway.  I didn   t want to go to school in the dust storms, but Benny would say    I   ll take  care of you    and he did, he   d wait for me after school, he never left my side or  11  Hathaway  Wise  Lemons  Parker  Hathaway  Fairchild  Lemons  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  I   d never made it without him.  He   s my neighbor now.  I know, but he really took care of me.  Well so would you say that you lived in   I   ll pose this to each of you   in the  country or in town?  I lived in town.  I lived about 7    miles east, or well 8 miles northwest.  I lived in the country and then when I started to high school I   d go into town  and stay in a rooming house and then home on the weekends. I had a lot of fun  in high school; our housemother didn   t have very much fun I don   t think   So what were you doing for fun in high school Mrs. Fairchild?  Oh we would, I   ll just try to think some of the things, the college girls, see  there were high school girls and college girls in the same rooming house, and  the women that had the house had a daughter. So we high school kids, we   d  make a lot of noise; we would sing, some of us could sing, I couldn   t, but  some of em could sing pretty good, and so she would come to the top of the  stairs and say,    Sadie come home,      that was her daughter      and the rest of  you girls be quiet. The college girls are trying to study     And so anyway, years  later I came out here as a home demonstration agent and I thought at that time  you were supposed to be, at least act like you was grown. (All laugh) Four of  those college girls were out at Felt and I know them to this day and they   re  nice people but anyway I   ll never forget,    You girls be quiet, the college girls  are trying to study.    We had enough time at school that we could do our  studying.  You went to Goodwell?  Goodwell high school, it was down where the high school is now, not at the  college. But my sisters that were older, they went up when it was at the  college, and someone else that went there that you know is Grover Smith, and  Mary, I called her Mary Mag, she laughed one time and said,    You   re the only  person that puts that    Mag    on there, said    I   m just Mary to everybody else.     But she didn   t seem to object.  What were some of the things that you did for fun, to entertain yourselves?  You mean like games we played? I was like Sally, we used to play,    Black  Man   ,    Tag   , and    Crack the Whip   .  Oh, I   ve heard of that game.  12  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Parker  Wise  Hathaway  Fairchild  Hathaway  Lemons  Wise  Fairchild  Wise  Fairchild  Fairchild  Hathaway  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Parker  And that was fun, but I got hurt.  I bet you did  (Laugh)  And then I started crying again.  And you were that last one.  They called me    cry baby    all the time, like I said, if it hadn   t been for my  brother I   d have never made it.  When we were teenagers we had play parties.  Oh those play parties, that   s right.  We had fun doing that.  What did you do there?  Well we just played; we   d sing a game, play party games.     Skip, skip to my Lou, skip, skip, skip to my Lou    (Singing)  Oh I remember, now that was when Margaret was, I remember Margaret  coming in singing, sang a lot of songs, that was my sister.  Now in our family, there was different standards for the boys and the girls.  Now we could go to the play parties, but we couldn   t go to the square dances,  that   s the girls, but the boys could go to the square dancing.  Was it that way in yours?  No, we all just did what we wanted, what one did the rest of them did.  When we   d have Halloween parties at the gym, I think, everybody would  make like so many gallons of hot chocolate, others brought the apples in big  tubs, dipped the apples in there, what   d you call that Shelly? You   d get in there  and try to bite the apples?  It   s like bobbing  Yeah, bobbing for apples, but there were our parents right after us, you know,  and like the boys and girls get together   we were like twelve or thirteen   we  really had to, we   d go up to the drugstore have a coke or something but our  parents had to see where we were at all times. My mother and daddy were real  strict so I didn   t get to date till I was 17. I did go to the show but I had to be  home at a certain time.  We used to go out to the hills on picnics lots of times on Sunday after church,  13  Lemons  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  Lemons  Parker  Kite  Parker  Wise  Parker  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Wise  that was one of the highlights that we got to do. Or sometimes we   d have a  cookout out in the country.  What   d you fix for your cookout?  Oh they   d have steak and potatoes, good stuff.  Got a little better there.  (All laugh)  That was about it, I think.  At the end of school we   d go on picnics and some of the parents would take us  out to Cy Strong   s ranch   we thought that was great   took a sack lunch, and  we   d get to wade in the water and we thought that was great. That was our  entertainment.  That was a big place where at the end of school everybody went on picnics.  I see.  It   s about 12 miles or so north, just straight north of town.  What made it so neat?  It had a little river.  Water  (All laugh) We got to see a little water there.  Now I have a question. Can you still go from Kenton, go down to the dinosaur  path and then go north a little ways toward the river and then get over on the  north side and then go down through Colder   s and through that way and hit the  road north of town?  You can I think.  Why you can still do that.  Hasn   t been too long since I did that.  And then I was going to tell you when Sally said what toys she played with.  Mother, she made me a rag doll and I mean she drew the eyes and everything,  braided with something, put the little braids on the doll, and that   s what we got  for Christmas and we thought that was great, and Danny wanted a little guitar,  that   s my brother, finally we got him one, but at least that was bought, and  mine wasn   t, mine was homemade, she put little booties on my doll and I  thought that was great.  14  Lemons  Wise  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Parker  Wise  Lemons  Parker  Wise  Parker  Lemons  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Fairchild  Do you still have it, did you keep it?  No.  And with my kids I always got both of em something, but I don   t think it was  so much their idea as it was mine.  Well you mentioned you got your doll for Christmas; how did you celebrate  Christmas, did you have a tree? What was Christmas like at that time?  We went to the Methodist Church in Kenton, cause they didn   t have a Catholic  Church there, and they had a big Christmas tree all decorated, and there were  our goodies: oranges, apples, candy and nuts, and we couldn   t wait to go there.  We didn   t have a Christmas tree, and we   d all go there. A lot of the neighbors,  we got all our gifts there. That   s when Momma put my little doll in there.  Okay so she put your doll in with the stuff you were getting at church?  Yes. And I don   t know why they done that but a lot of them there in Kenton  did.  Cause Santa Claus brought it?  Santa Claus, I guess.  What about for you guys?  Well we always, after the folks closed the store on Christmas Eve, we   d go to  my Grandmother   s at Wichita, Kansas, drive all night and they had a big coal  stove and my aunt always had that going so it was warm when we got there.  (Laughs) That   s what I remember.  Now my Grandmother had a stove just like that cause I remember. I think up at  the top, didn   t you keep things warm up there?  Uh-huh. I grew up with chairs like these, only they weren   t painted red.  Well did you guys know people who left when the dust storms started, did you  have friends, or family that moved?  Yeah, a lot of people left.  Oh, there were quite a few of them.  Some of em came back when we got over having dirt storms.  I remember my uncle who had built a lot of houses that are still in good  condition up at Hugoton, times got bad and they decided to go to California  and they came by and spent the night with us. Let   s see, it was my uncle and  15  Hathaway  Parker  Fairchild  Parker  Hathaway  Parker  Lemons  Parker  Hathaway  Fairchild  Hathaway  Wise  Parker  Wise  Fairchild  Wise  Fairchild  aunt, and I believe they had three children, then his son by his first marriage,  and his wife and two children, and they all went to California in one car. I  don   t know how they made it, but they made the move just fine.  Probably touring car.  And there weren   t any motels to stop at.  No, there wasn   t any.  I imagine probably there were 8 or 10 kids out of my class that their folks left  here and some of em went to Colorado and some went to New Mexico, and  several went to California or Oregon   I don   t know of any that went to  Washington.  Some of them went to Arkansas.  Arkansas, yeah that   s right.  Why did you and your family stay? You guys had a store?  Well we did leave for about a year, but then we came back.  I guess because we were farmers and couldn   t leave.  Well that was my family, you had to have something, even in California, you  couldn   t go, just get up and leave. No we just didn   t have enough to ever go.  We couldn   t work on the fruit or anything like people out there did.  It was like that movie; did you see that movie, The Grapes of Wrath? That  brought back memories, didn   t it?  It sure did, brought back   I never liked it.  We weren   t quite that bad off, but pretty near.  I wasn   t very old then and I really didn   t know about things being as bad as  they really were I don   t think. Why we just sought each day, and I remember  Red, that   s my brother that lives in Four Corners, the dirt would come in and  we had an oil cloth table cloth and Red come round and we would take our  finger and make a heart and and then we   d say   Red   s name was Floyd   plus  some girl, that was our way to tease each other about our boyfriends and our  girlfriends, and then I know when we set the table we always cleaned the table  off, but we turned the plates down.  Momma done that too.  And I think we put the silverware underneath the plate, but I   m not sure on  16  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Parker  Hathaway  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Kite  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Hathaway  that, but anyway I was as happy as a lark, everything was fine as far as I was  concerned.  I didn   t worry.  I don   t guess I did either. (Laughs)  I was old enough I should have had sense enough to worry, but I didn   t.  I remember the day of the black dirt storm, we   d been to a matinee that  afternoon and we went home and my brother and a friend of his was gonna go  frog hunting or whatever they did with their BB guns. But the folks saw this  cloud so the boys didn   t leave, but oh boy, it was something. Momma had  played for a funeral that afternoon.  She was at the funeral of the Shaw baby.  Shaw, yes.  Well Mr. Guy was buried that day.  Oh, he was?  The day that the dirt, and they always said that   well you probably heard this  too on that dust storm they showed the picture   they thought sure that was his  face on the clouds, said there was a face of an old man. Well now you know;  of course they were real religious.  It   s probably in this, that picture.  That one you can   t see it that well, you can see it right up there. There is a  better picture of it right up there.  Mr. and Mrs. Guy lived three blocks from where we lived and they   d go right  by our house and he always had a bible in his hand and she did too, she wore a  bonnet and long dress and he read the bible going in to getting his groceries at  the store at Kenton and back, he never did close that bible, and she was right  there with him.  And this is the man that had died on the day.  Yes, he died that day.  That day that we had that black dirt storm. Our daughter had the Whooping  cough and we took her up to Dr. Ward, he was over at the    Yeah, anyway,  when we came down it was just a nice sunshiny, and we looked over in the  north and there was that black cloud. We went down there about where the car  wash is, and back up to the corner to the drug store and went in and that stuff  had hit, and you couldn   t see anything, it was black, and there was a whole  17  Wise  Hathaway  Parker  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Fairchild  Wise  Fairchild  Parker  Hathaway  Fairchild  Lemons  Fairchild  Hathaway  Fairchild  Hathaway  bunch of people in that drugstore; we got to shooting paper wads, got to acting  silly. I guess it   s a good thing.  Might as well.  We didn   t worry that way so much. (Laughing)  And it lasted up into the night, it was about four o   clock probably when it quit.  Oh yes, see we didn   t have electricity, we just had coal oil lamps.  We didn   t go home 'til it let up a little.  And we lit all them candles, of course like I said we   re Catholic, we believed  in, every one of us, kneeled down and said prayers and held hands. I can   t  remember, two of the neighbors came over but they wasn   t Miss Cockeren, it  was somebody else, I can   t recall her name, I forgot, and they joined us in  prayer. Because there I was, crying of course, and it was scary, terrible.  I guess I   m kind of hard shelled or something; it didn   t scare me.  It did, well see it was a black, you can imagine over at Black Mesa the clouds  were all there.  I was in the back end of a truck and we had a blanket, we stuck our heads  under it and it was black. Now the guy that . . .  You couldn   t see nothing at all, it was just like night.  I sat next to a guy that had on a shirt, a white shirt. Oh you couldn   t even see  the color of his shirt for awhile.  It was probably gray after that dirt.  There used to be a tattle tail barn in back of the truck.  Yes, that   s right, back of the car; we   d been on a rabbit drive, now that   s  another story.  Yes, tell me about the rabbit drive.  Oh, to me, that rabbit drive wasn   t too     I didn   t like that; I went to one of them.  I didn   t like it either. What it was, they thought that the rabbits were eating up  all the grass, and they needed it for the livestock.  Oh they were thick.  18  Fairchild  Hathaway  Fairchild  Fairchild  Hathaway  Fairchild  Hathaway  Fairchild  Hathaway  Lemons  Fairchild  Hathaway  Fairchild  Lemons  Fairchild  Lemons  Parker  Wise  And they would build a fence in one corner of the field with wire that rabbits  couldn   t get through, and then they would take and go drive all the rabbits to  that way, and then when you got there, got them in there, you just took a     A club.  A club and clubbed them.  And I think if you took their ears; didn   t we get 20 cents for each pair?  I think it was a nickel. (Laughs)  A nickel; was it a nickel, that   s probably about right, but you know that was a  social thing to go on that rabbit hunt, especially if you had a boyfriend.  That   s right. I went, but I didn   t go again, that one time was enough.  I think once or twice is all I went.  Club them rabbits.  Did you guys participate or just watch?  I just watched.  I did too, I didn   t club any rabbits.  I did too, just watched; it was them boys mostly that did the clubbing.  You said it was a big deal to go if you had a boyfriend. Were you cheering him  on?  Oh well, you   d go off with your boyfriend and you   d talk, and oh, you know  (laughing) but anyway I don   t know, sometimes I had a boyfriend, sometimes I  didn   t, usually I didn   t. (All laugh) But I was kind of unique, I had two  brothers that were near my age and anytime I wanted to go anywhere and they  had a date, well I just went along with them so I didn   t have to stay at home  because I didn   t have a boyfriend but some of the girls did that didn   t have any  brothers in the house.  Well changing our subject a little bit, and we heard some people talk about  tramps and hobos that came through town. Anybody have any remembrances  of that, coming by your house and knocking on the door or anything?  I can remember when the gypsies would come to town.  Oh, that   s what I was going to say, I was in on some of that, gypsies at Kenton.  My grandpa would have a big garden and mother said that my grandma felt  19  Parker  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  Lemons  Parker  Wise  Parker  Lemons  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  sorry for the women cause they were in there trying to sell all the pottery or  jewelry they had and she   d fix like home made bread, she always made that,  and different things she would give em to eat. And while the women where in  there, the men would go to the garden and clean out, just clean the garden up,  they just stole everything. (Laughs) They   d just load up and take all the  vegetables and whatever they had.  I know my folks if they heard the gypsies were coming they   d close the store.  Yeah.  But my grandmother, she was just kind hearted, she didn   t have the heart to,  cause the little kids would beg for bread or something. But that was because  the men were busy stealing out of the garden. And there were quite a few  gypsies that came, but I was afraid of them, they   d wear big old earrings and  the men looked kind of scary.  How did they travel?  In covered wagons.  Yeah.  Or that   s the way I     That   s the way I remember it, too.  Forgot about that, I was scared of them.  Did your parents ever tell you stories to    stay away    from the gypsies, to try  to scare you, or didn   t need to huh?  Not me.  I was already scared.  But I figured that if they were locking up the store I   d better stay in.  See I had never thought about gypsies being in the panhandle of Oklahoma.  Well they did hit Kenton pretty bad, cause you could see them in the wagons.  Well they wouldn   t get caught out there.  Huh?  They wouldn   t get caught up there, by the police.  That   s right; there wasn   t nothing there but a few houses.  20  Hathaway  Wise  Lemons  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Parker  Hathaway  Lemons  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  Hathaway  Parker  Hathaway  I remember one time maybe there was some gypsies, there was some people in  covered wagon, parked, just camped out by our gate at home and Momma give  them chicken to eat once in a while. I don   t know how long they stayed there,  maybe a week. But as far as them stealing anything, I don   t remember them  ever stealing anything.  Well that   s what my mother told me, that they   of course my grandma would  give them food cause she felt sorry for them, but then the men would get out  and go in the garden and steal all the cuts.  Yeah, did you all have gardens?  Not when the dirt storms, we couldn   t.  We had a well (laughs) and my grandpa used to take buckets and that   s all he  did is take buckets of water, and water a small garden, it wasn   t a very big one,  you know   well a few tomatoes, I can   t really remember, onions and just a  small garden. But I remember, we didn   t have hoses in those days, did we?  Cause I remember them big wooden buckets he would carry and water the  garden, and I don   t remember the well going dry; maybe it did, we had a well.  We had a well but we never did, well we just couldn   t raise a garden, dirt  blowed, you know.  Covered things up.  Yeah.  Did you ever have anything you lost in the dirt? I've heard people talking  about how their washtubs would get buried in the dirt, and had to wait    til the  wind blew the dust off for them to find it.  Well I know the fences were all covered with dirt.  Covered, I remember that, I think I brought pictures of some of them.  Yes.  They were just up to the top.  Of yes, weeds would blow up; tumbleweeds catch in the fences and dirt.  The dirt would catch it in.  We used to go fishing up at Two Buttes, this is after that was through, and the  dirt was over the fences you know, well out here about, I guess eight miles  west. My brother had a field and the dirt was piled up in the fence rows and he  dug that fence rows out and there was about three or four fences one on top of  21  Kite  Hathaway  Lemons  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  Fairchild  Lemons  the other out there under that dirt, of course he bought the land after the dirt  storms. But that was really a job.  Instead of uncovering the fences they just built ones on top?  They just built one on top.  (Laughs) That   s funny.  I know out where our farm is there was a dispute one time as to who owned     the difference between the two quarters, and so they got to looking in and one  fellow had after the dirt storm and all he had, had a machine, this tractor or  something that could take all that dirt away, so that was the deal that goes  where the fence line was. Where he took all that dirt away, that was the line.  Line.  That was the line and it   s that way to this day. You just kind of have to have  something because all of what you find out down at the courthouse is not  always the way it has to be. (All laugh)  So you remember participating in or helping with any sort of service  organizations in town, maybe to collect food or clothing for people in need?  My mother used to work in the courthouse basement and they sewed, they had  about four or five machines and she sewed for a lot, I mean made dresses and  blouses and shirts for the needy, and there was quite a few there that worked  for them.  Anybody else remember?  Well I was in college at that time and of course we had our sewing machines  for the regular class and then we sewed for the ones at the western state  hospital   you know where that is? The older ones do I   m sure, and my job  since I   d had some sewing, I was more or less the teacher. (Laughs) I   ll tell  you some of those girls were not interested in making shirts for anybody. And  one day we had one girl and she just always, she entertained, she   d tell us all  stories, and the president of the college   Morrison was his name   he was  bringing a group in from somewhere and she was up telling one of her stories  and I was supposed to be more or less the teacher, and here came the president  of the college with these and he was showing them all over the campus. He  was so proud of all the things that they were doing over there then, and I never  will forget that, and I turned around and there, boy I got off of that table. (All  laugh) Then years later, when I was going to Stillwater with the 4-H, President  Morrison always ate at the Union   his wife had passed away, and he was  always alone eating, and he would nod at us as we went by his table.  You think of anything that you were able to do being young girls, young  women at that time, that you were able to do because of the situation of the  22  Hathaway  Parker  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Parker  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Hathaway  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  Fairchild  dust bowl and the depression that you wouldn   t have been able to do  otherwise? If there was anything that like, you know the restriction on girls  being changed because of that? You said you couldn   t go to the dances but you  could go to the play parties.  Well there really wasn   t much going on except play parties and square dancing  and dance; well we really, yeah we did dance too.  Showalter had that dance hall out there.  Yeah, I couldn   t go, I was younger.  And then later didn   t it have a swimming pool out there?  We went to movies. The theater was, well I was an usher there for a while and  I went with my brother Benny and walked me home. But we had to be home at  a certain time, and that was my entertainment was the movies. I mean they   d  have matinees too. That Will Rogers and Gene Autry, and     Shirley Temple.  Shirley Temple.  And you had to pay a dime to see it.  A dime.  Well my mother gave the Orum girls music lessons and so we got in free. (All  laugh)  Well like I was telling her, I ushered in there so I got in free, Mr. Phillips     Momma gave lots of piano lessons in exchange for eggs or cream or whatever.  Yeah.  When I was in Kenton, I never was too tall anyway, but mother decided she  wanted to give me some music lessons from Miss Eddie, that owned the  drugstore in Kenton, so the way she paid her was two dozen eggs a week.  In exchange for your music lessons.  Yes, that   s the way I got my music, but I didn   t continue. When I moved to  Boise City I didn   t.  What would you say would be your fondest memory then when you think back?  Now after they started having pioneer day over at Guymon, they had it on May  2, that was in celebration of when the panhandle really became a part of  23  Wise  Fairchild  Hathaway  Wise  Parker  Fairchild  Wise  Fairchild  Wise  Fairchild  Lemons  Fairchild  Oklahoma. It wasn   t, it was and they had it a long time, and regardless what  day of the week May 2 was you went to Pioneer Day. Then it got  commercialized.  And then the Boosters would come into Boise City and they   d have a little  dance around the square, I remember that advertisement in Guymon because it  was a good celebration.  I haven   t had time to go over there for several years. I can   t think too much  about what it is now.  It   s not like it used to be.  No, it   s too wild now. (Laughs) Things have changed, the parade   s nice, but     Well I think the thing I remember most is the friends that I still have that I  made at that time.  Well I remember fair time, oh that was something. They had it in one of the  buildings, and the first one I always went to, each county had a plaque on the  wall, oh about as big as the three of those up there, having all of there crops,  you know, the seeds, and then they   d have things down out on the table, and  that fascinated me, but Cimarron County always had the best and that was  Uncle Bill Baker   s idea and so they were always getting number one. Then  when I worked down in the courthouse, low and behold you had a big trophy  and then I guess you got to keep it after three times. Why in that little  storeroom was a trophy of Uncle Bill   s and I don   t know whether it   s still  down there or not. But somewhere it got banged on one side, (Laughs) and  then too when I was agent we had pressure cookers had just come out.  Yes, mother had one of them.  First time I was an agent   I was twice. You could sign up for a cooker and  you could keep it so many days and then you   re supposed to bring it back so  somebody else could use it, and I don   t whether they   re still down there or not.  I don   t know either.  I don   t know who had the key to that little store room. We had it up at the  county clerk   s office then, I believe it was, up on the second floor.  You said they were    supposed to bring it back    kind of like maybe some  people didn   t bring them back. (All laugh)  Well they always, sooner or later they got back and then they had them all over  the county too, and they were heavy, they were big things, and when my sister  in-law, after she passed away, well my kids went over to her house to kind of  straighten things up and find out what they were, and low and behold there  was one of those great big cookers, and they brought it over and sit it in my  24  Parker  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Parker  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Parker  Hathaway  Lemons  Hathaway  garage so if any of them want to know what they looked like, why     It   s still there huh?  Or if you want to can in it, now Sally   s a good canner but she doesn   t think of  herself quite that good. Then another thing I have out there was a one brick of  sod from a sod house that used to be down south of the courthouse and I think  they told me  Lawson   s.  No, it was   I don   t, it was south of the courthouse, south of on down through  Cooleridge and they said that Mayberries, the Foreman   s lived there, some of  the Mayberries, now somebody told me that, now I wouldn   t say it   s true.  Well Lawson   s lived down there in an adobe house; you remember Alison,  Margie, and Lucille.  It might be the same house; maybe it was a little later.  It was just a little, yeah.  Well that   s what my folks built their house out of, adobe   s. They   d have a  form, well they   d put grass roots in the adobe   s so they   d hold together and  they had this form and they put this mud in it and let it dry and then after it   d  get dry they   d put ricks, so it would continue to dry.  My mother and Daddy lived in one when Margaret and Benny were born, I  wasn   t born, and she had dirt floors she remembered telling me. But some how  or other they   d get it wet and sweep it and it just looked real solid, like there  wasn   t dirt on it at all, you know.  Our house had a wooden floor but it was made out of adobe, and it   s still out  there and they put stucco on the outside, my nephew lives in it. Dwain  Hagwood, and it   s still there, been there a long time.  You   d think the big rains, but we don   t get that here so.  We have had.  Well doesn   t seem to, but every once in awhile they would refresh their mud  on the outside, but now he   s got stucco.  Well so what do you think that, living through the dust bowl, how would that  have changed you so something that you carry with you today that you think  came from the having to deal with that in the thirties?  I think you get kind of tight with your money, cause we didn   t have much then  to spend.  25  Parker  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Fairchild  Hathaway  Fairchild  Lemons  Wise  Fairchild  Lemons  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  Hathaway  Lemons  Well I think we feel thankful every day that we aren   t in it.  Yes, we   ve just lived in the lap of luxury.  Just so we don   t see them big dust storms again.  We   re liable to if it doesn   t rain.  Yeah, right.  But we haven   t had any bad dust storms for quite.  No not really.  For quite some time.  I know back in the fifties we had a dirt storm, and they said that the dirt, the  wind was as high as it was in the thirties but the people had learned how to  farm and the dirt wasn   t blowing so bad.  Though one way, one thing that made the dirt blow, I mean it didn   t hold to the  ground, it just kind of mushed it up and then the wind blowed it away.  Let   s see tillage, what did we call it, where they   like you said. Hold on I  can   t think of the term right now.  You had mentioned earlier the coming and killing one of your cows?  I   m pretty sure they did.  Yes, they did.  Do you remember that happening with yourself or with other people that you  knew?  I just remember hearing about them doing it.  See I was old enough to remember that, because we all Benny and I and  Margaret started crying cause, well she was our pet.  Yes, I remember that.  Was that during the depression?  I think the government paid them so much.  Right.  26  Parker  Fairchild  Hathaway  Parker  Hathaway  Lemons  Wise  Lemons  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Lemons  Wise  Hathaway  Fairchild  Hathaway  Fairchild  Wise  Parker  Lemons  Hathaway  Well of course the depression was during the dust storm too, so.  They paid so much but I can   t remember whether I even knew.  They paid em so much for those cows, and then they killed em.  Probably not very much, either.  No, not much.  Do you remember hearing about WPA programs or people who worked for  WPA programs?  Oh yeah, my daddy did  Yeah, and what did he do?  He was working on a road construction, and they would pick him up in this  pickup and then just a canvas over it, about five or four or five men, and they   d  wear these red handkerchiefs because they couldn   t breathe. When Daddy  would get down from there you didn   t even know it was Daddy.  They built that.  The bridge.  That rock wall around the cemetery.  Yeah.  Well Daddy was in on that, too.  Yeah, I don   t know what all.  You remember when they used to have the crews that killed the grasshoppers.  Yeah.  Those too.  Yes, it cleaned out Daddy   s garden one time. (Laughs) We couldn   t grow  flowers or nothing, and grasshoppers were     Jack worked on that, my husband.  I hadn   t heard about the grasshoppers but I have heard people talking about  rats, that there was a rat problem?  I don   t remember that, I didn   t know that.  27  Wise  Fairchild  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Parker  Wise  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Parker  Fairchild  Kite  Parker  Wise  Hathaway  Parker  Kite  Parker  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Here? Hmm.  Prairie dogs.  Prairie dogs yes, especially near the cemetery; they had quite a few of them.  There   s still plenty of them.  I didn   t know anything about the rats.  I don   t either.  But I remember the grasshoppers.  And you know recently, the Lather boy got to playing with some dead prairie  dogs.  He was working.  Was he working?  He was working.  And anyway, Doctor Wheeler diagnosed him and got the right serum for him  and all of that so that was a feather in doctor Wheeler   s wallet too.  What was he doing with Prairie dogs?  He was helping his dad farm; he probably got off of his tractor and did  something with them. (Laughing)  Ominous probably.  They had poisoned the prairie dogs, is that what?  He handled them and     Oh then the poison came to him. How was the grasshopper-killing program  conducted or what was that?  Well they sprayed them.  They also put sawdust around with grasshopper poison on it.  Well didn   t they spray with a spray that   s called DDT or something like that?  Probably.  I remember Daddy spraying around.  28  Hathaway  Wise  Hathaway  Fairchild  Wise  Fairchild  Wise  Hathaway  Fairchild  Wise  Parker  Lemons  Hathaway  Lemons  Kite  Wise  Parker  Wise  I didn   t remember what they had.  And he wouldn   t let us kids around that, but he didn   t have a very good  garden, cause them grasshoppers were bad, and Momma tried to raise a few  flowers and she didn   t have any luck.  I   ll tell you a grasshopper story.  The DDT, you also put it on cattle.  What was that DDT, was that?  Isn   t that right, didn   t they put it on cattle, the DDT?  That   s entered my mind; I know they sprayed.  I don   t know, I never did know of it.  Anyway, you weren   t supposed to use it, and there was some, my husband had  a little sack of it out in the garage, and I was always afraid my kids some way  would get into that, and they never did. (Laughs)  Yeah Momma was too; she didn   t want us kids in it.  Probably their neighbor girls would get them into it. (Laughs)  Miss Hathaway, tell us your grasshopper story.  It wasn   t about this country, it was a long time ago when my grandfather was  young, they were, somewhere up in the north west, kind of up in Montana,  down in there, and the grasshoppers, they had some tents and the grasshoppers  come and they would just, in a black cloud and eat their tents, eat everything  they had, when they, the grasshoppers left they probably didn   t hardly have  any clothes on, they ate everything. (All laugh) I don   t know how they got  away from there, course they had a team and wagon I suppose.  Well I can   t think of, you have any other questions?  No, I think that about wraps it up for me. (All laugh)  I   ve enjoyed this cause it kind of brings some more out of me that I know, if  somebody will remind me of it.  Well you know I feel like that we don   t need to just dwell with our children  and grandchildren but we need to let them know that that is part of our  heritage, and how we made it through. (Laughs)  Oh, I have discussed it with my great grandchildren, and Chancy, he just can   t  29  Parker  Wise  Parker  Wise  Parker  Fairchild  Wise  Hathaway  Wise  Lemons  believe that we went through that, and my granddaughter, Lacy, she said her  daddy was stationed in Dayton, Ohio, right at Patterson Air Force Base, and  she said,    Granny, all of my school wants to know what a tumble weed is   ,  and I said,    Well honey I can   t bring one home on the plane unless your daddy  comes after it.    And now, see, she lives in Altus, Oklahoma, they got  transferred over there, so now she can   t wait to get to Boise City, and take  some tumble weeds home and paint them, she just thought that was.  You know, some of our neighbors at Christmas time fix a big tumbleweed  outside and put lights on it.  But you can today, paint them and put little lights great big tumble weeds, you  put them in a corner and they   re beautiful.  Sprayed it.  Spray them?  Yeah.  Most of you know Mercedes Berry and you know, she was a very good teacher  and in their school over at Keyes. They, something about early day and the  tumble weeds, and the little kids decided it would be real nice, they could  bring some tumble weeds in and they would make their own Christmas tree up.  Well she was pretty stumped they were going to spray them and she was  finished the spray and she laughed and she said,    that was the most expensive  Christmas tree I ever bought.    It took a lot of spray they brought in a great big  one. (All laugh)  Well Lacy took that one book, that was, was it Norma Gene  Butterbaugh  Young  that has that book on the dust bowl?  She has written several books I think so, I don   t know.  She sent one to Jill, my daughter, well Lacy took it to school and she read it to  the whole class and she said they just sat there, didn   t know what to say, so  they asked her some questions, well of course she didn   t know too much, and  so Jill said     Mom when you come out here I want you to go to the school with  me,    so I got to talk to Mr. Beaver about it, her teacher, and they just thought it  was great that she read that book to them.  Well for participating in this interview today each of you will get a copy, a  typed copy of the transcript of the tape of our conversation, and then so each  of you will have that. You   ll have your own copy and then Phyllis Randolph  here at the Museum will have a copy of each of the interviews that we did, and  so that you will have that, and you   ll have a copy, she   ll have a copy, and the  tape and a copy will be at the library at Oklahoma State so that people can  read it and use it, and know what happened.  30  Fairchild  Wise  Lemons  Kite  Parker  Parker  Hathaway  Parker  Lemons  Hathaway  Parker  Wise  My little grandson from California, he   ll be interested in that Cathy   s youngest  one. Grandma Lou, Louise, I forget what she calls me,    she grew up a way  way out in the country.    (All laugh)  Now my great grandchildren are boys,    Let   s go to Kenton where Granny was  born, I want to see it.    Well the house isn   t there anymore, but they want to  know all about the black Mesa and all that, so I have to explain to them.  Well if any of you after you get home today, or the next couple weeks, think of  a story that you wish you would of told us but you didn   t, feel free to contact  Phyllis Randolph or Norma Gene Young and they can pass the message to us  and we can call you so you don   t have to pay a long distance call so we can  add that in with the stuff you   ve already given us.  We   ll be happy to call back and talk to you.  Norma Gene and I have always been real good friends, we even were  neighbors, and our Dad   s played clarinets and that   s what, the way they  entertained themselves on Sunday afternoon, a group of them would get  together and my mother played the piano, and we played outside. (Laughs) I  remember all of that and  I remember her mother real well, good friend of my Mom   s and she knows my  mother, or she knew my mother. And I know Tressie   s brother, Frank.  Uh-huh.  And Tressie, and Fairchild, I know them all.  I don   t think I have anything else to ask you.  Thank you.  Thank you for inviting us.  Thank you.  -------  -------
