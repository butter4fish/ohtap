Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell: All right. This is Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell. I am here with Charity Woods at SisterSong, and Charity is the director of&#8212;?        Charity Woods: National policy and advocacy director.        CGD: All right, and we are here today talking about her background and also her work with SisterSong, even though she&#8217;s a relatively new staffer. So I just kind of wanted to start off talking, and I want to make sure that&#8212;and I&#8217;m going to press record on that one too&#8212;find out who you are and where you come from, which is a very broad&#8212;.        CW: [Laughs]        CGD: But I want to make it broad.        CW: Well, I&#8217;m thirty-four. I was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and my dad&#8217;s from Charleston, my mom&#8217;s from middle Georgia, Milledgeville, Georgia. I&#8217;ve been in Georgia since I was about four years old but I spent a lot of time in South Carolina, very close to my dad. I also attended college at St. Augustine&#8217;s College in Raleigh, North Carolina, and came back to Atlanta about nine years ago, and that&#8217;s probably where my activism and involvement really kicked in.         I do come from a very politically active and involved family. My grandfather was head of the NAACP in Charleston and in that area for a really long time. He was heavily involved with labor at one point. He was originally from Ohio so he was really big with labor and municipal and government workers, that sort of thing, the ILA in Charleston, the Longshoremen&#8217;s Association. So he was really involved with that and did a lot, lot, lot of civil rights work, and so by default that&#8217;s how my father became really involved and has a pretty long legacy of involvement on that side. My dad&#8217;s brother, who passed at a young age, was also involved. I was sitting in Congressman Jim Clyburn&#8217;s office a few years ago and his district director pulled out this hardback gorgeous book on the civil rights movement and turns to the first few photos and he said, &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; I looked. I never knew my uncle. I said, &#8220;Well that&#8217;s you,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Oh my God! That&#8217;s my uncle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yep, Orangeburg, South Carolina, 1960,&#8221; so-and-so, when some really hot and heated civil rights actions took place, and so that was kind of cool. Then last year my dad calls me and he says, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m coming out of the post office and this guy calls me to the side and says, &#8220;Do you know your dad&#8217;s in this book I was reading?&#8221; So my dad said, &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; There&#8217;s this book called Lion in the Lobby about Clarence Mitchell, who was a lobbyist for the NAACP and an attorney, and he said, &#8220;Your father is mentioned in the book,&#8221; so I ended up finding it on Amazon and giving a copy to my dad and my brother and I kept one for myself last year.         So I come from a family of people who are really involved. On my mom&#8217;s side her father was in a union, he was a brick mason, he was very active, and my grandmother was a teacher. My mom worked for the state. She worked for the Commission on Women [and] she worked for the Holocaust Commission in Georgia. So I grew up in a home where politics and race was constantly discussed. My parents met at St. Aug, I&#8217;m third generation St. Aug, so I have the HBCU education background, and it&#8217;s a very real conversation. My parents divorced when I was three but they&#8217;re really good friends now so there&#8217;s just sort of this synergy that we always had, and I talk to my parents, like my biggest influences on movement work and social movement, whether it&#8217;s focusing on people of color or women or labor, what have you, I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten a really good foundation and background and understanding from them, and we constantly have these conversations. So it&#8217;s always amazing to me when I talk to other people my age, you know, how do you not know these things, and then you begin to realize that there are a lot of conversations that don&#8217;t take place and a lot of people are just&#8212;. You have to wonder, my parents, coming from the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, how did their counterparts not pass that information and that awareness and that need to be active on to their children?         So, that&#8217;s a lot, huh? You just asked me that one question and I just rambled on. [Laughs]        CGD: No. This is an oral history.        CW: Okay.         CGD: How old are you, Charity?        CW: I&#8217;m thirty-four.        CGD: Okay. So where did you start professionally?        CW: Well, I was an international business major but never wanted to do corporate America. I thought at one point I&#8217;d be a writer for National Geographic at some point. That didn&#8217;t happen. But I actually started out working for the International Visitors Council in Raleigh and I had an opportunity to study Russian one summer at Johnson C. Smith so I started working for their Russian program. Then I went to the North Carolina Center for International Understanding, which is under UNC, and I did a Latino program because I was really into the international thing, but I moved back to Atlanta about nine years ago. I was going through this phase where I just had to get out of Raleigh, it was so conservative, it was this, it was that, and I was so tired of being there that I wanted to come home. My grandmother had just passed. My mom said, just come home. If that&#8217;s what you want to do, come home.         So I came home, didn&#8217;t have a job, and a family friend was running for the state senate. My mom at the time was working for two state senators in the legislature. She said, &#8220;Go on over there and see if she needs some help and just volunteer. It will keep you busy and you&#8217;ll meet some folks.&#8221; I went over there, didn&#8217;t really have that much campaign experience, I knew a little bit just from my parents&#8217; involvement, but I went in there and this person was completely disorganized, no structure, no anything, and it was me just coming in there to volunteer to do whatever, to: &#8220;I need a campaign manager; you can be my campaign manager.&#8221; [Laughs] So, I was like, wow. So I learned a lot, and from that point on I got bit by the bug, and we always get teased because particularly my dad and my brother and I are very politically involved and political-minded, and so the Woods energy started to come forth from that point on. I had a stint in the legislature on the senate side, the senate information, so a lot of communications work there.        CGD: So did your candidate win?        CW: No. She was in a runoff and came very close to winning, and I&#8217;ll just say she didn&#8217;t win because she didn&#8217;t want it badly enough. She didn&#8217;t do her part, but she came very close to winning. She actually holds an office now but I&#8217;m going to keep her name quiet. [Laughs] So, I did that and I started doing a little bit of this, a little bit of that politically and going out and just kind of pushing myself to get involved, and I had some contacts through my mom. Then, I&#8217;m trying to think. When I really, really got involved in activism career wise was probably&#8212;. Well 2005/2006 I was a deputy finance manager for our lieutenant governor&#8217;s bid for governor, and I was the only black and the only female who worked for him raising money.        CGD: And this is in South Carolina?        CW: No, this is here. Most of my work has been concentrated here. That was an eye-opening experience and it wasn&#8217;t really activism but it was very political and this person had fought for a lot of good things that benefited a lot of families, and women as well, but he was running against a woman so he got some flack for that, because there was this natural assumption that I&#8217;m a woman and you should want to support a woman. Well I&#8217;m very clear with people that I don&#8217;t support somebody just because they&#8217;re an African American or because they&#8217;re a woman, and I have my reasons for that.         I went from that into an opportunity where I was doing some organizing&#8212;now this was in South Carolina&#8212;around the presidential primary season in &#8217;07/&#8217;08, and I was the state director for an organization, a nonprofit, that focused on chronic disease awareness and prevention, and that was really interesting. I worked with some conservatives in the community, but I also worked with the Democratic presidential campaigns to push these measures and push the envelope on this chronic disease awareness and prevention, which sort of was, I guess the predecessor to the healthcare piece and the Affordable Healthcare Act. So, South Carolina being a rural, Southern state, a large number of African Americans&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know what those statistics look like now but at one time South Carolina had probably the highest or one of the highest African American populations in the country, so it&#8217;s the stroke belt, high diabetes, blood pressure, the trifecta, all of that, and some environmental justice issues, particularly with the plants and whatnot down there.         So I really started seeing a lot and it was a really good opportunity for me because I had always lived and worked mainly in Georgia most of the time and it was an opportunity for me to connect in a way&#8212;I felt more connected to I guess my dad&#8217;s side and his involvement and the people he knew and the doors he opened up and the civil rights contacts and the political contacts and that sort of thing, because my dad had always helped political campaigns and been a consultant and things like that.         So that was an important experience and then obviously just what I was working on, so when that finished I then moved into a position where I was a state director for Healthcare for America Now, which was an effort under the AFL-CIO and several other groups to push healthcare reform. That was even more so focused on grassroots and advocacy and just good old fashioned hell raising. [Laughs] But in a place like Atlanta you really have an opportunity, as you said&#8212;. Atlanta&#8217;s sort of its own place sometimes. In this vast state Atlanta and the metro area is definitely kind of its own unique place, and so when you grow up in a city like this, an environment like this, where you see so many people of color, particularly black people, who are achieving political and economic goals, just these wonderful things and these achievements, it&#8217;s really an inspiration and you get an opportunity to work with these people, and that was good but when we went outside of the area I got to see&#8212;. And I sort of saw this working for the lieutenant governor&#8217;s campaign, just the two Georgias, the dynamic here in Georgia, the split. So there are pluses about being in your own world. I remember we were doing canvassing for the healthcare reform and me having been pretty much raised and always lived in the city of Atlanta&#8212;. Some people say, I&#8217;m from Atlanta, but they&#8217;re like thirty-five minutes outside of the city. No, I grew up literally in the city of Atlanta.         CGD: Where in Atlanta?        CW: Not too far from here, actually, so sort of near the west end, southwest Atlanta, very urban, minority area. I remember we went out to I think it was Congressman Tom Price&#8217;s district and another Republican congressman north of here, Cobb County&#8212;I&#8217;m sure some people are very familiar with Cobb County&#8212;and I was in shock, and I thought, I didn&#8217;t even know this many people were going to vote for McCain. [Laughs] You&#8217;re in Atlanta and everything was Obama, Obama, Obama, Obama, and then you go out and it&#8217;s like a totally different world, people cussing and yelling and all this because you&#8217;re fighting for healthcare for everyone.         So that was interesting and as I was doing that I was also doing some work with another nonprofit that did a lot of lobbying and organizing around progressive issues in general, so immigration and economic justice and women&#8217;s issues and all of this, so all of this sort of came together in this melting pot. Then Atlanta, particularly for a Southern city, had a little more diversity and things were a little more open so you&#8217;re working with different people, white, black, some Latinos, because that&#8217;s obviously a demographic that&#8217;s increased, young, old, and we were working with the Quakers and ministers and this group and that group, and legislators, so it was a really good opportunity.         I think that&#8217;s where I really started to see the importance of movements working together, and as I observe what&#8217;s going on, on a national level and a state level as well I see the importance of building these relationships because when it comes down to it we&#8217;re all being marginalized and attacked by the same forces and that whole divide and conquer mentality is a mentality that we seem to have such a hard time breaking out of. That is how they do it. It just infuriates me when I hear other people of color talk about this immigration issue and they&#8217;re so nasty and just not understanding what this means and the implications of this and our need to support our brown brothers and sisters, and that it&#8217;s a human rights issue. I&#8217;m not saying let&#8217;s open the borders and we don&#8217;t need reform, but when you&#8217;re talking about basic human rights violations I think it&#8217;s important that we stand behind labor. I think it&#8217;s important that we get behind women. I think it&#8217;s important that we support the LGBT community. So I&#8217;m not a lesbian, I&#8217;m not a union member, I&#8217;m not an immigrant, and those might not be my main causes, but it&#8217;s important that I show solidarity and support, and particularly in the RJ [reproductive justice] movement, which is a little new to me. I feel like it makes sense because I&#8217;m an African American woman and I get this, but because the nature of RJ is to address the intersectionalities of so many different areas it definitely makes sense. We&#8217;ve got the environmental piece and we&#8217;ve got the immigration piece and we&#8217;ve got education and healthcare and all these different things that we&#8217;re tied to, so it&#8217;s so important for us not to operate in silos, and that often happens and it&#8217;s like we start jockeying or something. It&#8217;s like, what are you jockeying for? We&#8217;re all basically in the same position. We&#8217;re all getting screwed [Laughs] by a number of lunatics who really don&#8217;t outnumber us if we put ourselves together and work together, so that&#8217;s probably one of the biggest frustrations and challenges. Everybody wants to out-oppress somebody else. I have this many oppressions! No, I have this many oppressions! Okay, fine. [Laughs] All well and good. What&#8217;s next? Why is this a competition? It&#8217;s taking the focus off the bigger goal.         So that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s very personal to me and going forth in my new position as a policy person and advocacy person here I really want to address some of these other issues, and I&#8217;m limited, obviously, in my capacity, but as I was telling you earlier, trying to figure out what is our priority, or our priorities, and what is something that we can take the lead on? What is something that we can support? How do we go about doing this and working all this out, because the needs are so great and the needs are out there. I think the more we talk and the more we&#8217;re inclusive the better it will be but we&#8217;re in a pressure cooker right now. I think people feel that something&#8217;s going on; I don&#8217;t know how cognizant they are, if that&#8217;s the right word and that makes sense, of what&#8217;s going on. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a real understanding of it.         So people are getting caught up living day to day, they&#8217;re getting stressed out, they&#8217;re getting frustrated; they don&#8217;t think long enough or hard enough or pay enough attention to see the different connections and how everything is related and how it&#8217;s a domino effect and how this happens then this happens then this happens. People don&#8217;t go further than what&#8217;s in front of them sometimes. All of that being said, it&#8217;s so frustrating, and we&#8217;re coming up on another election, so for right now, for the immediate, it feels very shaky. I try not to focus on that, I try to focus on what are the opportunities that are out there, but it&#8217;s hard, but I think that oftentimes in these movements we&#8217;re our own worst enemies.         CGD: How so?        CW: Because we are not working together, because I have to be the issue of the day. I&#8217;m oppressed more than somebody else or my issue is more important, I mean all these different issues, but we&#8217;re all getting attacked by the same people. That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t understand. By and large if we were to come together we would outnumber them, and I think when they look at us&#8212;and I don&#8217;t want to necessarily say Democrats; maybe left-leaning people, progressive people, whatever the term that people are comfortable with&#8212;we just look disjointed and disorganized and no clear mission and all of these things all over the place and not a set of priorities. So we do battle on that side with these things because it is our nature to take in everybody. But on the other side, they&#8217;ve got their stuff together. They have who they&#8217;re beholden to, they have their priorities, they have their messaging, their communication, and that&#8217;s not to say they&#8217;re without their issues, but they&#8217;re so much more organized, and it&#8217;s just like George Bush. It doesn&#8217;t matter necessarily sometimes that what you&#8217;re saying is complete and total BS if you say it with confidence, you say it enough, and you say it in the right place at the right time, and sometimes people will begin to believe that and that gives people a sense of comfort.         But this work in general can be very overwhelming and it can be draining and it can take it&#8217;s toll on you because sometimes the very people you&#8217;re fighting for, you turn around [and they] don&#8217;t have your back when you&#8217;re the one out there on the front lines. It&#8217;s just like with the billboards. When we should have been able to count on some of our brothers out here to stand behind us as black women, they were out here dogging us talking about they didn&#8217;t trust us, or the clergy. So that&#8217;s really disheartening and it&#8217;s frustrating and it makes you angry. So when you&#8217;re dealing with these kinds of issues it&#8217;s easy to get burnt out and it&#8217;s easy to lose focus because it&#8217;s a very emotional thing, it&#8217;s a very personal thing, and you&#8217;re putting out fires and you&#8217;re responding to this and that, so it&#8217;s a lot.         One thing we talk about here at SisterSong that I think is good is the practice of self care, and so like Loretta talks about how in her generation a lot of women were not good about that. I see it with my mom. She smokes a pack of cigarettes a day, she&#8217;s had a heart attack at fifty-three, she doesn&#8217;t eat the way she should, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. She&#8217;s worked these hours, those hours, what have you. They&#8217;ve recognized that but now it&#8217;s almost like, well it&#8217;s too late for me, [Laughs] but learn from us. So we do try to talk about the self care piece and how do we keep a balance in our lives, because we&#8217;re running ourselves crazy, but I do think it&#8217;s important that we do that and that we communicate with one another and that we really see how important it is for us to come together.         One thing that I have noticed that I think is getting worse in a lot of ways, I thought at one point it felt like we were getting better, but that&#8217;s the issue of race. I never thought that under Obama everything was going to get better, in fact I anticipated that things would really kind of get bad, and I&#8217;m really, really [Laughs] fighting, as I sit here and say these words about&#8212;and I believe them&#8212;but about building movements, about working together and looking out for other people other than just us and in our own little circle, but I do find it hard and I do struggle with the race issue a lot and I have a lot of Mississippi Burning moments. [Laughs]        CGD: What do you mean by Mississippi Burning moments?        CW: Where I&#8217;m just honestly, absolutely, completely, and totally disgusted by white people in general, and that&#8217;s me being very honest. As I sit here and you look at me and I&#8217;m pale as I don&#8217;t know what and I have green eyes and what have you, I&#8217;m very well aware of the fact I look like this or how I look like this, so I know that in my background it&#8217;s there, [although] both of my parents are black. But all I know is being black. That&#8217;s all I know and I&#8217;m fine with that. That doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t love people and it doesn&#8217;t meant that I don&#8217;t deal with people on an individual basis, but just in what I&#8217;ve seen, particularly recently, because of Obama&#8217;s election and just the nastiness, not that I thought it ever really went away but I think that people got to a point where maybe they felt bad about saying certain things and maybe people were trying to reevaluate sometimes, and people are never going to change. But now with the extra stress and pressure and being in this pressure cooker environment the whole racial thing really disturbs me and I have a very strong sense that it&#8217;s getting worse and worse and worse. I feel like there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to happen, and I think that part of it&#8212;. It&#8217;s not just because Obama was elected or what have you, but part of it is I think basic karma in this country. It is the fact that this country was supposedly built and based on these wonderful, great ideals but it was complete hypocrisy, right, so we know that, and there&#8217;s been no real reparations or acknowledgment of what happened. It&#8217;s, okay, well slavery doesn&#8217;t exist and that was a couple hundred years ago, whatever, whatever, and let&#8217;s just get over it.         So we as people of color, African Americans specifically, we&#8217;re dealing with our own crap from that, our own mental, physical breakdown, and then we have to turn around and still deal with this stuff out there. But I will say the upside of that is that we are getting to a place now again where I think it&#8217;s bad but then it&#8217;s good in that people, when they&#8217;re not scared and they come out and they say what&#8217;s on their mind, it&#8217;s like, okay, now I know. Now I know. The only thing you need to do is put on a sheet and&#8212;[Laughs] because I&#8217;m to that point now. When they were, all the tap dancing around what they were calling Obama and some of these other black folks&#8212;just call them a nigger and put on a sheet, because that&#8217;s what you basically are anyway, right?         So then I deal with my own, you know, okay, Charity, you got to stay positive, you got to stay this, you can&#8217;t let the anger take you over, so then you start with the whole personal debate of your spirituality, your positivity, and all these other things. But it&#8217;s so hard because for me it&#8217;s gotten worse, so I&#8217;m trying to fight that negativity off, but I just feel like going forward that race is going to continue to be a huge, huge issue, and I can&#8217;t necessarily verbalize exactly what that&#8217;s going to look like.        CGD: Well I mean in some ways, and what I hear you saying is that you&#8217;re kind of in the middle of the pressure cooker and in Georgia and Atlanta you certainly seem to be part of the pressure cooker, I mean particularly if you&#8217;re talking about an anti-abortion opponent, they&#8217;re like Georgia is our battleground. You were here living in Atlanta, in Georgia&#8212;        CW: Oh yeah.        CGD: &#8212;when the billboards and Senate Bill 529 happened.         CW: SB529, mm hmm.        CGD: You weren&#8217;t working at SisterSong. So what was your take and what did you hear about those things?        CW: This is once again where you&#8217;re in a place like Atlanta and so you get a certain level of comfort as a black person and you see these things and you&#8217;re going along like, okay. You know the rest of the state&#8217;s kind of getting screwy and kind of crazy and you see all this stuff, but like I said Atlanta&#8217;s always kind of been its own place, like an island. Then something like this pops up and, as I&#8217;m sure people will tell you who were directly involved, you knew the antis were there, but this take, this approach, this tactic was like out of left field. It just&#8212;what the hell, [Laughs] you know, and to have to come back and respond to that.         Like I said it&#8217;s really frustrating because you&#8217;ve got this battle, we know all of this once again is race. Race, race, race is huge in this. Then you&#8217;re trying to get your own people in your own community to support so you have to battle that, which then gets specifically&#8212;. Specifically lines started to be drawn between gender, right, on top of that, and then the religion thing. There are all these different layers and elements. Then you&#8217;ve got to turn around and deal with the actual antis and then adding the political piece onto it. Now we won, and that was significant, a significant policy victory, but you can&#8217;t be comfortable in that. You can&#8217;t tout that for so long because they&#8217;re still here and they&#8217;re still going to try, and particularly now, like literally this week when we&#8217;ve got our maps popping up for, as I said, our congressional and our legislative districts, and me as a political policy person knowing what that means for 2013 if we can&#8217;t fight it back, or what have you. So we&#8217;re looking at a complete ban on abortion. We&#8217;re looking at not just that but all these other detrimental things.        CGD: So let me just clarify. So looking at a complete ban on abortion, not that abortion&#8217;s the only issue you do, or that SisterSong does.        CW: Yes.        CGD: How could that happen?        CW: Basically in Georgia what you find are bills that pop up on complete ban on abortion. Now obviously there are processes and people can file lawsuits and we do have procedures in place but there&#8217;s no guarantee with anything right now. Some people might say, oh, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re quite that bad, or maybe you&#8217;re being a conspiracy theorist or whatever they want to label it, but say we get a Republican in the White House, and those maps that came out&#8212;when were they?&#8212;last Friday or this Monday, for Georgia, just to use Georgia as an example, those maps hold up. As it stands they have created a super majority. They do not need one Democrat to vote for them. All they need to do is get their party on board and they will push through anything they want to push through. Every year a complete ban on abortion comes up, or just about every year, or it&#8217;s personhood. I mean these things take on, you know, they kind of switch and morph and it doesn&#8217;t work this way so let&#8217;s try this bill, let&#8217;s submit two or three, coming at it from this angle, this angle, what have you.         So I mean it&#8217;s possible. It&#8217;s possible. It&#8217;s possible to&#8212;. We&#8217;ve got people in this state&#8212;. I mean if you read blogs, we&#8217;ve got people in this state, and other states too, who will blatantly say we won&#8217;t be happy until black and brown people are in chains again. We passed one of the most hateful immigration bills outside of Arizona in the country and&#8212;.        CGD: Was that also 529?        CW: No, that was HB87. So what happens now, even though agribusiness, they&#8217;re kind of torn because a lot of them are good ol&#8217; boys but they know they need that labor, so what you have now is the governor talking about, hmm, maybe we&#8217;ll take prisoners and put them in the fields. That&#8217;s a slippery slope, and I don&#8217;t put anything past them. I do not put anything past them because they are the most base, hateful, lowdown group of people that I could ever imagine, and they didn&#8217;t just get this way. The majority of them have been this way. So it&#8217;s hard for me to separate my personal feelings too, you see, so I have very [Laughs] strong feelings about this. What I&#8217;m saying is I always feel like just: Wake up, people! I just keep wanting to say: Wake up, people! All this is connected. All this is connected. Let&#8217;s pay attention. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s going on.         And then you go up to the capitol and you&#8217;re lobbying, and I have a good relationship with a lot of legislators, white and black, and you go up there and you have women or black people up there, you know, they don&#8217;t know crap half the time. You have to educate them. They&#8217;re scared to pull the trigger, some of them. They&#8217;re scared to stand up. They don&#8217;t see the urgency in some things. There are all these different factors that come into play but the bottom line is, like I said, we should take some credit for that, we should be happy for it, we should take that as an example to show other people some things they can do and how they can pull strong advocates and allies together, but at the end of the day we have to keep evolving because they&#8217;re evolving and they&#8217;re gaining momentum.         The other thing, and this is just sort of a side note pet peeve for me, is we have to know the importance and realize the importance of funding our movements too, because at the end of the day in 2011 and 2012 money talks, and you&#8217;d be surprised what you can get done or who will listen to you when you have money. So that&#8217;s not everything&#8212;. What we find is that a lot of older people and grassroots advocates and people from our parents&#8217; generation, which is pretty much Loretta&#8217;s generation, a lot of them don&#8217;t understand. They think you&#8217;re betraying the movement. They think you&#8217;re not connected to the community. They think all these things, you&#8217;re not grassroots and you&#8217;re not a real advocate if all you can think about is money. Well it&#8217;s not all you think about, but let me tell you, that&#8217;s how they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing. We have to have it. We have to have it. We have to learn how to start giving. We&#8217;ve got to create that culture. I mean, our development officer, she and I talk about this all the time. We have to create a giving culture within our own community but then within the larger progressive community and we have to really get behind some of these causes, and people aren&#8217;t going to invest their money if there&#8217;s no strategy, there&#8217;s no clear message, and there&#8217;s no communication, because it&#8217;s still an investment at the end of the day. You can invest in a person, you can invest in a campaign, a company, or a movement. So, yeah, I feel like I&#8217;ve just been like grabbing. [Laughs]        CGD: I think what you&#8217;re talking about, and you&#8217;re trying to make those connections and those connections, you know, it takes a mental leap and it also takes a big job to explain that&#8212;        CW: It&#8217;s not easy. [Laughs]        CGD: &#8212;to other people, and we often have investment in a kind of primary identity, so African American, Democrat, whatever those may be. So do you think there is a space for black progressive organizing in Georgia?        CW: Mm hmm. Yeah, I do. I mean the thing about Georgia, and I don&#8217;t know how this may change with everything that&#8217;s going on, what you do have in general&#8212;. I&#8217;m going to back up a little bit. Some of your best schools, higher learning institutions, are in the South, particularly your HBCUs, so that&#8217;s a plus, and what you find, like when I was in Raleigh we had all these students who were from other places, particularly up north, Midwest, and they came to Raleigh and they were not trying to leave. They didn&#8217;t want to go back to New York. [Laughs] They didn&#8217;t want to go back to these places. So they&#8217;re staying and we&#8217;re sort of seeing this reverse migration, and I think that is a positive. I think that can be a plus, right? So that&#8217;s something I think we can look forward to and I think there&#8217;s a lot of potential there.         Then what we&#8217;re seeing is also the influence of other cultures, particularly the Latino, Latinos coming into places like Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, outside of just Florida, so that&#8217;s adding another element because historically in the South it&#8217;s been black and white and that&#8217;s it. So these are good things and I think there is an opportunity, a real clear opportunity&#8212;I&#8217;ve been saying this since I worked for North Carolina Center for International Understanding&#8212;that Latinos and black people really need to be working together, really need to be working together. I think there&#8217;s a lot that we can learn from one another as well.         So I think that those are some pluses and that there is definitely an opportunity to do more organizing and the face of organizing is changing a little bit, like you referenced. It was sort of like the civil rights and that&#8217;s kind of morphed and changed, and that&#8217;s another thing. As movements we have to respect and honor past movements, or I should say the way movements used to look, and learn from that but we have to be able to evolve and stay current as well. We see like the use of certain technology and Facebook and Twitter and these other things, but our mindset as well, and I think that&#8217;s really, really important.         So I think there are a lot of opportunities still. I&#8217;m still here, trying to hold on. People keep telling me to move to D.C. but this is still my home, and I tell people all the time. You know I had this conversation with somebody the other night. We were talking about a lot of people&#8212;this is not to insult people from up north&#8212;but a lot of people, and I noticed this in college, would come down, and coming down South&#8212;now first of all their parents were probably from the South, or grandparents&#8212;come down South to get an education, you don&#8217;t want to leave the South, but then they want to start talking to you like you&#8217;re an idiot, like you don&#8217;t know anything because you speak a little bit different, or: &#8220;You&#8217;re so country, you&#8217;re so this and that.&#8221; But I make no apologies for being a Southern black female. I love being in the South, right now, even with all its craziness. I&#8217;m not going to New Jersey, I&#8217;m not going to New York, I&#8217;m not going to Philadelphia or wherever; I&#8217;m not. This is my home and what I think we also have to remember is that we helped build this country and that we as black people, we have history. We have legacy. We have a culture. You know what I&#8217;m saying? I think it&#8217;s so funny that even in our own community we don&#8217;t really grasp that sometimes, which is our own fault that we don&#8217;t talk about that, we don&#8217;t share that information. But I grew up in a family where we talked about who was who and looking at pictures on the wall, and my grandmothers and my great, great, great grandfather, who was Irish, and the picture was him in his Confederate uniform, but he had a black wife, well, wife, because he couldn&#8217;t marry her, but he had children with her, he acknowledged them, they lived in his house, and he educated them. So we have a lot of that. Those may not be as popular, those types of stories, with a lot of people but they&#8217;re out there. We weren&#8217;t all products of a lot of that terrible stuff. I mean we were, but you see what I&#8217;m saying, and even that, you know, had an impact in our lived experiences and we bring all that forth and we&#8217;ve helped create that. We&#8217;ve just had an impact and we forget that sometimes and we allow ourselves to forget that, you know, hey, this is my home too. We owned land and we farmed and we did this and we did that, and so the beauty of being here, we helped impact that or we impacted that, so I think that&#8217;s important to remember too.        CGD: So what do you see for the coming year in terms of things you really want to work on in reproductive justice?         CW: Oh, everything. [Laughs]        CGD: It&#8217;s such a broad umbrella that you can park yourself under.        CW: My push right now is 2012. What I mean by that is I think that a lot of work needs to be done in education around what&#8217;s going on in the political landscape, and I don&#8217;t mean that in terms of go vote for Obama, or vote for this person, vote for that person, but it&#8217;s about showing solidarity. It&#8217;s about being organized. It&#8217;s about pushing on our issues and to be aware of really what&#8217;s at stake. A lot of this goes back to&#8212;it always goes back to voting at the end of the day. I don&#8217;t know how we overcome that apathy and that disengagement, but that is something that I&#8217;m so staunchly in support of, is voting, but it takes so much education around that. So you&#8217;re not just voting for somebody but you&#8217;re voting for ideals and issues and things that you want.         So creating some education around just getting involved, and I think that under that we kind of look at some other things that we have at stake. It&#8217;s a clear assault on women, women&#8217;s choice, women&#8217;s bodies, women&#8217;s lives and reproductive health, so I think that&#8217;s definitely a priority. I think that we start talking about education, and this is kind of speaking for me personally right now. Education is huge, and being able to support policies that support mothers and families. We&#8217;ve got an intern and a part time assistant here in the office. They&#8217;re mothers, they&#8217;re trying to go to school full time and trying to work, and they&#8217;re basically being told that in order to receive childcare assistance they have to work thirty hours, so you basically want them to be a full time mother, you want them to work thirty hours, and you want them to go to school full time. Then they said it even goes so far as to push them into a two-year or technical school track versus a four-year traditional school track. There&#8217;s something wrong with that, not to knock a technical track. There&#8217;s something wrong with that. We&#8217;ve got to start looking at these policies and strengthening women and families and the right to parent and the means to parent in a healthy environment.         So I think&#8212;now this does specifically relate to SisterSong. I do think that going forward that&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to see more of for this organization. I think choice is important and the right for a woman to choose. We will defend that to the end. But the other part of RJ in the definition of RJ is the right to have a child and to mother in a healthy environment, and so I think that some of our policies should be focused around that, some of our activism should be focused on that as well, because I do think that if we get too black women heavy and too abortion focused that we&#8217;re going to miss out on some opportunities and lose some support. So I think that&#8217;s something that is super, super important and touches the core of what we do but we&#8217;ve got to be able to, [Laughs] you know, we&#8217;ve got to be able to talk about some other things, because that&#8217;s what RJ is. SisterSong is a women of color organization and women of color obviously face more of these issues than white women do, and that&#8217;s important that we talk about that and keep up with the changing face of the South as a major impact. Even though we&#8217;re a national organization we know the South has a major impact on our work.         CGD: It&#8217;s interesting because you are a women of color organization and we do want to think about the demographics of the South and respond to those and serve women no matter who they are, but at the same time kind of the national discourse has put black women&#8217;s bodies very firmly kind of in the crosshairs. I mean we do see billboards now targeting Latinas, but why do you think black women&#8217;s bodies have become so public?        CW: [Laughs] I think it goes back to just the issue of race, just being in such a racialized society, and traditionally it has been black and white. Just to go back as a side note here, when I talk about the strategy of the Right when it comes to our districting and stuff, what they&#8217;ve done is conceded some majority/minority districts so they&#8217;ve given them to some blacks and they&#8217;ve taken the white Democrats and are forcing them to run in those districts against the blacks. What that does is takes out the white Democrats so now they can say Democrats are a party of black people.         So I just think it&#8217;s just very racialized. I think that it&#8217;s never&#8212;. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t really talked about as much or people noticed it and made those connections as much but I think black women&#8217;s bodies have always been an issue. We&#8217;ve always been subjected to white people and white men in particular and what they wanted to do and using us first as a way to control us, to control the black family. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to stay that way because the demographics are going to change. Well, what I mean, it won&#8217;t just be black women. I think that&#8217;s just we&#8217;re here right now, we are&#8212;probably the perception, which is probably the truth too, that we have, compared to our growing Latino community, right, and our Latino women. I&#8217;m not saying that Latino women haven&#8217;t achieved and done stuff but black women are achieving things in a way now that they&#8217;ve always achieved but just on a different level now, and they&#8217;re taking advantage of certain opportunities, they&#8217;re outpacing the black male, so I think these all are probably factors. Our earning potential going up; we&#8217;re becoming competition for white women now.         So I think all of this plays a role but I think that in addition to the black female what we are going to see now probably next are Latinas persecuted a little bit more, and the family, and that&#8217;s just because obviously with immigration and stuff they&#8217;ve become major targets, so I think that we&#8217;ll see a little bit more of that coming out towards them as well. You mentioned the billboards in California. I could see something like that eventually happening in Georgia but compared to Florida, Southwest, New York, we&#8217;re still kind of behind in our population so it&#8217;s going to take a little time. Like I said mainly we focus on black and white, but it won&#8217;t be that much longer [Laughs] when you look at the demographics. I mean look at our census that just came out, and I know when I lived in North Carolina, North Carolina was here ten years ago. North Carolina was here, Tennessee, so it&#8217;s going to change. It&#8217;s going to change. So I think we&#8217;ll see that instead of just black and white, I think we&#8217;ll see more black, white, Latino as the three. I mean that&#8217;s just my opinion. It&#8217;s just my opinion, which is why I say I feel like there needs to be more cohesiveness between the black and Latino communities in a lot of ways, and that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t have our own separate individual struggles.         CGD: So do you think there&#8212;? You had talked a little bit about healthcare reform efforts and how you had done some work with healthcare reform and trying, I guess, to mobilize people around the idea, so is there still room for healthcare reform that is supportive of comprehensive women&#8217;s healthcare?        CW: Yeah. I think we still have some room to push. It&#8217;s a very complicated issue because we have people who want to scrap it altogether. We have states who want to opt out. We did just have a victory. I don&#8217;t know if you heard about the contraception?        CGD: Go ahead, tell me.        CW: Well, actually the over-the-counter contraception, there&#8217;s a working group that wants to have over-the-counter affordable contraception, but the victory that took place last week or the week before last was that there were some recommendations put forth by the Office of Women&#8217;s Health and some other groups that said contraception needs to be free if you have health insurance. Obviously that doesn&#8217;t help people who don&#8217;t have health insurance but it is a small&#8212;or not even a small, it&#8217;s a pretty big step, when I think about what I pay even with insurance. So that will be part of the affordable healthcare, quote, unquote, plan that&#8217;s going to be put into place, the new healthcare law. I think there is room to push on things like that, addressing disparities and chronic diseases and doing preventative health and things like that. I think we conceded way too much too soon, I really do. My organization was a public option focused organization but&#8212;.        CGD: What do you mean by public option focused?        CW: We always supported the public option. We were not a universal healthcare organization, meaning we believe that there should be a public option. Universal healthcare or Medicare for all believe that was it. It should be completely government run, basically wipe out insurance companies. Personally I would love that to be the case. [Laughs] I didn&#8217;t think it was going to be realistic but I think that would probably be the best way to go and the most financially sound way to go. But even with a public option we started out conceding too much and then the people that we thought were going to have our backs, and the Democrats and whatnot, started with the, oh, I don&#8217;t agree with this, and I don&#8217;t know about this abortion amendment, and I don&#8217;t know about blah, blah, blah, blah, and the pressure started.         I just think that we gave in too much, but I think there are some things that we can do and I&#8217;m particularly focused on women&#8217;s health and the preventive health, which is major for communities of color, major, major, major, because what we&#8217;re finding is seventy-five cents out of every dollar goes to chronic disease care but these are diseases that could be prevented or managed at the very least, but you don&#8217;t have the access because our healthcare system is so screwed up. We don&#8217;t have the access to primary care physicians like that. The number is dwindling, particularly in rural and poor communities. What people want to do now, they come out and they&#8217;re like when I go to medical school so-and-so told me I could make more money as a plastic surgeon, or some sort of specialist, and that&#8217;s what they do. It doesn&#8217;t pay enough and it&#8217;s not sexy enough to be a primary care physician. [Laughs] So that&#8217;s a battle as well, but I think that&#8217;s very important, so I do think there are some things we can do but then we also have to take some responsibility in our communities on our own as well. We do, we really do.         CGD: Now that you&#8217;ve been on the job for a little while what do you think the biggest obstacle is to doing reproductive justice work in Atlanta and Georgia?        CW: Just probably the conservative climate altogether. I would say that&#8217;s probably the major thing, is just&#8212;. On the one hand it creates a lot of work for us but that in itself, those are battles that we have to fight. I think there&#8217;s still a lot of potential here. We do have a lot of active people and active people of color and women involved, but once again what you find is that most of that is concentrated in this metro area, and when you look at Georgia specifically politically even though we were under Democratic control for a long time there&#8217;s always sort of been this divide between north or metro Georgia and the rest of the state and so we&#8217;ve always had to fight that. Now you&#8217;ve got a lot of progressive minded people in other areas and pockets of the state but it&#8217;s become less that way. So it depends. There are people who assume that, oh, just because somebody might be white or they might be a Southerner that they&#8217;re going to be conservative, and that&#8217;s not always the case, and maybe they are conservative and are still Left-leaning. You just don&#8217;t know, so it&#8217;s not as homogenous as some people would think.         So there&#8217;s some room to push but I think that&#8217;s probably the biggest constraint, then the other being that maybe we don&#8217;t push to cross movement build as much. I think it has been getting a little bit better but there&#8217;s still so much work we have to do in working with one another because, as I said, we get in these silos, whether you mean to do it or not. Heck, we get in silos here in this office [Laughs] where you&#8217;re so engrossed and it&#8217;s like, wait a minute, let me step back and reassess what&#8217;s going on and look at maybe what I need to do, and sometimes we forget to ask for help or, hey, you want to help me on this, or I need your help, or how can I help you? What do you need? How do we do this? How do we build these coalitions? But I&#8217;ll tell you what I have noticed is&#8212;. The healthcare stuff I saw it a little bit, a little more increase in activism getting reared up, and maybe this is sort of after Obama got elected and some people were still kind of in that mode, but when that immigration bill came up, HB87, I did notice a surge in activism, a lot more people getting vocal, and I have to give it to the Latino community, especially because so many of them are undocumented that it really literally becomes a threat. This is literally their lives at stake and for them to come out front the way that they did was fascinating. We had this rally here, it was probably maybe two or three weeks after I was hired here, back in March at the capitol, and I was stunned at the turnout, but in a good way. I&#8217;m sitting there like, go, my brown brothers and sisters. Run with it. Go for it. [Laughs] I&#8217;m not mad.         So what I hope&#8212;and this ties into what I feel we can learn from them and they can learn from us&#8212;what I hope is that some of the pitfalls that we have had, some of the breakdowns in our cohesion, that they can avoid, because we&#8217;ve been broken down. We&#8217;ve been divided and conquered in a lot of ways.         CGD: What type of ways?        CW: Well, you know, maybe that&#8217;s just the progression of things. Maybe it&#8217;s just the society, the change, the advancement, but when I hear my parents talk about what it was like in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, I&#8217;m just like, wow. I don&#8217;t feel that same spirit, and maybe it&#8217;s just kind of changed. [Interruption 1:02:02 to 1:02:47]         So I just feel like, oh, like I was saying, that same sort of solidarity isn&#8217;t there anymore. I think we&#8217;ve gotten so comfortable in this whole notion of I&#8217;ve made it or I can pay my bills so I&#8217;m fine and not seeing how things relate. It didn&#8217;t seem like that. When I hear my parents talk about it they talk about how whether you were black&#8212;and of course you had your black folks who were, at the time, but more so back then you had people who might have been a little bit higher up on the economic scale but there was still a certain&#8212;and maybe it was the segregation that sort of leveled a lot of that out and people just seemed to come together more, and I just feel like we just don&#8217;t have that as much, and that&#8217;s a really depressing thing. Maybe I&#8217;m somebody who lives in these eras in my head and I&#8217;m romanticizing it, but my parents are two people who actually believe that there were some pluses to segregation, and if things could have been separate but equal, which was not going to happen, but they do talk about things that were better in a lot of ways, that black people did within their community that sometimes made them a little stronger than what we have now. So I think that&#8212;. I hope when I look at the immigration movement and my Latino brothers and sisters that they kind of hold to that a little bit more, but then I think they can learn from us a lot too because we&#8217;ve kind of been there, done that in so many things. So I think it just depends.        CGD: Well I think that&#8217;s probably a good place to wrap up, so I&#8217;m going to close this interview with Charity. It&#8217;s August 17, 2011. Thank you.        CW: Thank you.
