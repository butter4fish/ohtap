 Nykolaiszyn and also with me is Tanya Finchum.  Today is Friday, March 29, 2013, and we   re in Okeene, Oklahoma  interviewing Anthony Felder. This project is part of the Oklahoma  Centennial Farm Families oral history project. Today, we   re here to  learn more about the Felder Homestead. Thank you so much for joining  us today.  Okay. May I also say there were two Felder homesteads? What it was,  was a father and his son. The son was twenty-one years old, and the son  would have been my grandfather. He homesteaded half a mile further  south than what my great-grandfather  did . The one we   re going to be  talking about is the one my great-grandfather homesteaded.  Okay, wonderful. First, tell us how your family came to Oklahoma.  They came to Oklahoma in a wagon. That   s one of the things that   they  came in a wagon. I always thought they came into the United States on  the East Coast. Joan found out that they didn   t. They came in at New  Orleans. They came up and went up into Kansas. They came to the Run  from Kansas.  Were they farmers?  The great-grandfather was a farmer. The grandfather was a clerk in a  grocery store.  What was the name of your great-grandfather?  Godfrey Felder.  Okay.  5  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  And my grandfather was John L. Felder.  Tell me about the process of them selecting the land in the Run here in  Blaine County.  Well, most of the things that I can talk about   I never met my great-grandfather,  but I was real close to my grandfather, and he told me that  one of the things they suffered in northeastern Kansas was that they  were in low areas and flooding. This really influenced what they run for.  They run for the top of the hill. They wanted a house on top of a hill  where it really would not flood. I think that is reflected in where they  really did stake. This land is fairly close to the border of where the Run  was. In fact, they didn   t run much over a half-mile until they  homesteaded that, the one we   re going to look at, what we   re talking  about.  The other one, he got out of the wagon. My grandfather got out of the  wagon and ran on foot another half-mile to get up higher on the hill. The  truth is, my grandfather probably homesteaded either the sorriest place  in that area out there, or the next to sorriest place. When you get down,  the one we   re going to look at is pretty good land. The funny thing is,  the great-grandfather actually wound up losing this land. My grandfather  bought it out. My grandfather, he accumulated quite a bit of land.  How did he end up losing his land?  Alright, here we go. You know this has got to be a story, because we  already said I never met him. But my grandfather said that he spent more  time   the Ouija board told them that there was gold on this place. They  spent a lot of their time, rather than farming, looking for that gold. They  never found it. So when we go out that way, you might want to kick  around a little, because it   s still out there, if it was out there.  Back in the early days, were they farming the land?  Well, they had to farm forty acres within five years, wasn   t it? They had  to prove it up so they had to farm five acres. Not only did they farm their  land, but they actually took in another family, the great-grandfather. And  there was a second house, or farmstead, on this land. As it progressed  along, they lost enough money to where they needed money so bad that  they sold forty acres of this farm off to a neighbor, to Mike Ziegler, who  owned the quarter on each side which allowed him to kind of connect his  two pieces of land. That land, later, my grandfather bought back and  added it back to the place.  Any idea of the early crops?  6  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  From what my grandfather told me, wheat had to be used   Turkey Red  wheat had to be their main crop. My grandfather said that turnips was  probably their staple, probably the thing they ate the most and used,  because it grew out on that shallow red soil. Turnips would grow pretty  good. We only planted turnips in the fall, but according to him, they   d  plant them in the spring, too. He said they got a lot stronger in the  spring, couldn   t hardly eat them, but they were still something to eat. My  great-grandfather, first thing they did was build a house. First thing my  grandfather built was a dugout. He would go back. The first three years  he was here, my grandfather, he would go back to Kansas and clerk in  that store during the winter. He would come back here and farm. And  the school, which I went to school at, was actually held in his dugout. He  wasn   t in it anyway during the winter so the teacher would live there and  teach there, until they built the school.  How big was that dugout?  Not very big. If they had very many people there, I don   t know how they  got them in it.  You mentioned the dugout and the house. What were some of the other  structures they built up on the property in the early days?  Well, on these deals I   ll show you, it shows that on my great-grandfather   s,  they built a two-room house   about the first thing they  built   and a cow shed. Then hogs also got to be a staple of both places.  Let   s see, they both built their cellars, on both of them. I don   t know  whether the cellar that was built on my great-grandfather   s place was  built early on or whether it was built later. There even may be a date on  it. I don   t remember that. But the one on my grandfather   s cellar, I know  it has a date on it. The one on my grandfather   s looked like it was  probably a lot earlier construction, because it was put together with very  little concrete. They actually stacked the rocks. In order to make the arch  for the roof, they stacked the rocks and let them collapse in to where  they held themselves up. The other one, down on my great-grandfather   s,  is more concreted.  So tell me how the farm started changing through the years from the  time your great-grandfather had it, to your grandfather. Did he make  any changes on the property?  Well, by changes   he probably made very few changes on my great-grandfather   s  property, over his. My grandfather raised a lot of grapes,  made wine and stuff. My grandfather was a very strict, law-abiding  person. If he owed a tax, he wanted to pay it all. He was not going to do  7  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nusz  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  anything to violate a law. I   m not going to speak for my great-grandfather  on that.  Did your great-grandfather have a job outside of the farm?  Never that I know of. My grandfather did. Is it alright if I go both  places? My grandfather sold fencing all over this area. They said that his  wife was a monster   about the size of Jane. She weighed probably 110  pounds or twenty pounds. You   re shaking your head no.   Daughter Jane Nusz joins interview   Weighed less. But that   s okay. She was a very small woman. He   s  correct.  But she took care of the farming while this grandfather was out selling  wire, which everything was horse-done, then. The delivery of the crop at  that time, from what he told me, the first wheat crops that they started  selling and delivering, they delivered to Kingfisher. Hennessey was a  pretty good railhead, as I understood it, but they took their stuff  to  Kingfisher . That was a three-day trip. They   d load their wagon with  their wheat, and they would start. It was a two-day trip getting there, and  then they   d make it back in one day. Kingfisher is what, fifty miles  around. If I had a calculator we could figure how far it would be if they  cut across, but I don   t imagine they cut across in a straight line, either.  They   d have to go to a fording point on the river.  What did your great-grandmother do?  Everything. Oh, my great-grandmother? She was a housewife, I assume.  Did she come with him, or did he meet her here?  The grandfather was a twenty-one-year-old son. So she was with him.  Even in the wagon story   if I may   they told the story. My grandfather  told the story of when they got ready to run   remember, they   re only  running to my great-grandfather   s. They   re only going to run a little over  half a mile. On the line, there was a widow with some children. There is  a row of lots, and you can see them on the map, that ran between the two  strips, and they allowed it to be ran for with this  Run . They didn   t run   for them  when they did the Cherokee one. They didn   t give those strips  away and they put them in with this other Run. They made an agreement  that them was hers. She didn   t have to run for them. Nobody else would  take it, jump across the line and stake this little row of strips. That  became Newman land. The Newmans also homesteaded some other land  right in the area, also.  8  Nusz  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Dad, you said your grandma came with your grandpa, but what about  your great-grandma?  That   s the one I   m talking about. The great-grandma came. The  grandfather didn   t come  married . They married later.  So tell me your grandfather   s name. We know Godfrey.  John L. Felder.  So at what point did Godfrey   s land come into John   s hands?  As near as I can tell, probably thirty years later. Twenty-five to thirty  years later. It came by purchase, not by inheritance.  And John married     Lena Whop. She was also from Kansas, but I don   t think she was even  from the part of Kansas they were from, the way I remember. I truthfully  don   t know how they met.  How many kids did they have?  You   re getting into something I really can   t answer. They had three  living, and I believe three had passed away early. One was a baby, and  one was fairly young and the other, not too old. I think one got to be  twelve, one of the three that passed away. I didn   t figure I would be here  at this age. The male population of the Felder group   my grandfather  was an exception to the rule. He lived to be in his eighties, seventies at  least. My father died not too long in his fifties. He had two brothers, two  living brothers, one older and one younger than him, both passed away  before he did.  Where did your father grow up? On the other homestead?  Well, yes, he grew up on the other homestead and he was the one who  went and lived on this, the one that we   re talking about.  Godfrey   s.  Yes. He went and took that. That was the quarter. They added another  house. They took another two-room building, whether it was a house or  not, and stuck it up against the two that were there, and made a four-room  house out of it. Then there was nine of us. There were two born in  that house. I was born in the southeast corner of that bedroom, and so  9  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  was the sister next to me.  Describe that house for me.  About as simple as you can get, and about as probably   by today   s  standards   about as obnoxious as it could be. The two original rooms,  they had to be side by side. When they pushed these other two up against  them, there is actually a step of about   not a foot, but almost a foot     from one of the houses into the other house. On top of that, the well  water at the house that we lived in, the one my great-grandfather had, the  well water wasn   t any good. So they had the cistern, which if you know  about cisterns, is not really a great thing either.  So how many brothers and sisters did you have?  I had four brothers and four sisters. So it was nine of us in the family.  We were all raised in those four rooms. We had a boys    bedroom and a  girls    bedroom and Mom and Dad   s bedroom. The other room was  everything. The kitchen, the dining room and up until 1940   never been  electricity to this place, on the one down on the home place. There was  never running water in the house. There was never a bathroom in the  house. My mother would tell you, if you started talking about the good  old days, she would straighten you up pretty quick. She   d say,    The  good old days, buddy, is right now. You don   t have to go out in the  snow to take a leak or crap and you don   t have to carry water or break  water on the ice bucket in the morning. You   ve got it pretty good the  way you   ve got it right now.     So were you the oldest, the youngest, the middle?  I was the oldest. The ones that are left is the youngest girl   there   s four  of us left out of the nine, two girls and two boys. I   m the oldest, and the  middle girl, the fifth born is alive. The baby boy and the baby girl are  still alive.  So as the oldest son, you probably had lots of chores and  responsibilities.  Yeah, I think so. (Laughter)  Tell me some of your chores growing up.  I don   t think mine were any different than the standards. I had to do  some of the milking. Not all of it, but some of the milking. Help feed the  cattle. We always had a garden. That garden, I would guess the great-grandfather  and great-grandmother put the garden in. It was probably  10  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  between a half and three-quarters of an acre in size. I   ve already told you  the land is a little better down here on the one we lived on, the one my  grandfather lived on. But still, the main crops were green beans,  potatoes. We had asparagus and currant. Do you know what a currant is?  Is it like a berry?  It   s a berry, a little tart berry that makes real good jelly. There was a row  of them. I   d say there was a hundred-foot row, or two rows of them,  running east and west. So you got into picking them, too, whenever they  got ripe. Canning was a big thing. I   m going to tell y   all something. If  you   ve never eaten beef or rabbit or duck or any of that   duck, have you  ever tried to eat a duck? We ate duck all the time, then. And they were  good. Whether it was good because you didn   t have anything else   I  believe I left potatoes out. We raised quite a few potatoes. They didn   t  grow good potatoes, but potatoes are something that you need. The way  that cellar was set up, shelves at the west end and then a potato crate,  which would probably hold fifty bushel, and the beer deal was on the  north side. It was used for a storm cellar for us, also.  The beer?  Yes. We   re German, in case you hadn   t guessed. I don   t know of any  German family in this area that home brew was not one of their staples.  I   ve already told you that my grandfather raised a lot of grapes and that  he made three barrels of wine every year and sold it to the local saloons  in Okeene. That was not for their consumption. That was part of the  income. The beer, that was for local consumption. By the way, if you  need to borrow a beer crock, I   ve got one of the crocks, yet. It used to  be, the week before the snake hunt  Rattlesnake Roundup , we would  brew a batch of home brew here so we would have it for the snake hunt  rather than buying beer. It really didn   t have nothing to do with buying  the beer. It had to do with the fact that it was homegrown and a lot of  fun.  Did they actually can the beef?  Yes, that   s what I was going to tell you. If you   ve never ate canned beef,  you   ve never ate beef. That beef and that broth, we talk about it when  we go to coffee. The group gathers at the table, I   m the next to oldest  one there, now. I used to be one of the young ones. Now I   m the next to  oldest one. Harold Smith is the oldest one. He   s almost four years older  than I am, eighty-nine. He was raised on a farm, also. All of them,  basically, were raised on a farm. So we   ve all got the same canning  experience. We never seen pressure cookers at that time. I believe they  called it cold packed, which was not true. It was well cooked. It was  11  Finchum  Felder  Finchum  Felder  cooked and then put in jars and cooked again with the lids on and sealed.  It would keep. And pork, something you don   t see today. We always had  pork. We always had pigs around somewhere. My grandfather raised  lots of hogs at some times in there. My dad raised some pretty good  sized bunches of hogs, also. The neighbors would all get together. One  of the things on this get-together is   they also didn   t have any ice. So  there wasn   t any cooling. So a lot of that got ate pretty fast. The rest of it  was   you ever hear of Morton   s Tender Quick? It was a seasoning salt.  I believe it   s still on the market today. That was one of the things they  would use. They   d inject a solution down on the joints in the hams and  pack them in this salt. They were good-eating, too. Not as good as that  beef, but they were good-eating.  Did they have a smokehouse?  The smokehouse for both families was on my grandfather   s place. I   m  not sure that you still can   t see remnants of that. The fire was twenty to  thirty feet from the smokehouse and it didn   t have a door going into it.  Everything went in from the top. Pick the roof up and set it off, and set it  back on. I   ve seen some of the smoking. That made super good-eating,  too. It lengthened the time you could keep it quite a while. The only  thing I remember smoking was pork, though. I don   t remember any beef  being smoked.  And did they have chickens?  Oh, sure they had chickens and eggs. You were pretty self-sufficient.  Everybody had at least one separator. Do you know what a separator  did? It was not the threshing machine. It was the deal with the clicker  and crank on it that you ran the milk through and separated the cream.  Every Saturday night, almost everybody came to town, whatever their  town was, and made an evening of it. They   d bring in the eggs and the  cream they had to sell, and anything else they had to sell   chickens.  This town had   I can remember when they had three, and they may  have had more than that, pretty good sized, what they call, produces,  which bought eggs and cream and chickens and skunk hides. Any of  your fur-bearers, which brought in some income, also. I think everybody  hunted back then.  Don   t get me started on another story because there is a story that goes,  and you can turn me on or off on this. A story goes where a guy came to  a grocery store, which was five miles east of here, called Slemmer   s  Store. The Solid Rock school was out there right by it. But if you read  the story that   s in   it   s been written in a couple books. This guy showed  up and they said he was wearing foreign clothes. My grandfather said he  got to know him a little. He was only there about six or eight days. Said  12  that they all talked about the fact that   my grandfather said that he was  different from anybody here in two ways. He had a brand new wagon  with a good team of horses. Nice horses, not just common horses, but  good-looking horses. And he had money. So that was something that  nobody here had. They didn   t have a new Studebaker wagon and a good-looking  team of horses and harness. This old boy had it, and the old boy  said he was waiting for a friend, and that   s where they decided to meet.  How they   d know where Slemmer   s Store was, I wouldn   t know because  it was a two-room deal. They lived in one room and the other end was a  grocery store.  But this guy then was gone. He was there about eight days, and then he  was gone. They assumed the guy that was going to meet him, met him,  and they went. About a week after that, John Haworth and George Cobb  and guys who were duck hunting   at that time, duck hunting was a  profession. They would hunt ducks and ship them, and quail also. By  then, we had a railroad. They would put them in barrels and salt them  down and ship them to Chicago, undressed, on the railroad. They were a  delicacy there. But anyway, these guys were down there hunting, and his  body floated up.  So here we go back to an association here. The body was tied to a  cornerstone. Do you know what a cornerstone is? When they did the  surveys, they used a lot of corner posts and they also would char ends on  them, and they also used stones, if they could find them. The deal on the  survey said,    They didn   t use the stone that was natural to the area.     That was baloney. They used whatever stone they could get. It was the  fact that they stood it up on end and dug a ditch and piled trenches  around it that told you it was different from another stone. But this one  at Slemmer   s was back on this line. It was a stone that marked, not only  a section line, it marked the differential from Cherokee Outlet to  Cheyenne Arapaho Reservation. Therefore, they picked a great big  stone. Probably eighteen inches long, twelve inches deep, and maybe  five inches thick. This thing had been sitting up in the road, and they   d  been bumping on it for years. That stone went   they picked that up,  whoever done it and took it down. That   s what they buried   sunk him in  Deep Creek with.  They brought the body back and buried him in Collins Cemetery, which  is in the same section that my grandfather   s farmland  is in . They put  him outside the cemetery. It was at a section where the quarter corners  come together, two different lands. Smith gave an acre in there. So there  is a corner here that you can   t farm anyway, so they buried him in there.  Later, they added on the cemetery. That   s where I got involved in it. We  went out to do the survey for the cemetery and took the fences out and  disc it to where you could see. Here   s this imprint of   it wasn   t any  13  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  question of what it was. Omer McClung said,    Yeah, that   s where we  buried the guy out of Deep Creek.     You remember how they used to make cement blocks to build a  building? Somebody had taken one of those block-making things and  made a block and put    Body found in Deep Creek,    on it. That was what  marked it. Then my brother and I and Dale Leisher talked about,    We  ought to mark it.    This was after we put it in the cemetery. There is no  way you can put this thing in the cemetery. It   s buried north-south, and I  learned later   I didn   t know why it was buried north-south, but  everybody is buried east-west. Did you know that?  I thought I knew quite a little about religion and all that. I go to Geary to  stake a cemetery down there, and we changed the way they did it. We  changed it so they could get a tractor through to dig, rather than making  a five-foot alley, which you can   t put a tractor in so you crunch out the  tombstones and everything, doing it. We   d make alleys. We made one  alley   in fact, we made every alley about eight-feet wide, that way you  could run a tractor up and down. You could also run a hearse up and  down it. Over in the corners, we got these places where you really  can   t   what are you going to do with them? You know, just little  triangle deals because your road comes across them. I get the idea,     Well, why not   we can put five graves in there real nice, but  only   two of them are going to be buried east and west.     There is a lady on the cemetery board. I had this thing up explaining it,  thought we were about ready to go, and she said,    What about these  grave sites  north and south ? These are burial sites,  north and south .    I  said,    Well, what   s wrong with it?    She said,    Where do you go to  church?    I said,    Well, Catholic, but why?    She said,    Well, then you  should know that you   re buried with your head to the west, and you   re  buried east and west so that when you rise, you   ll rise facing the rising  sun.    No, I didn   t know that, but I acted like,    Oh, hell yeah, I knew  that.    We did away with those gravesites and used it to plant shrubs in. It  made the cemetery look better.  Well, we   ll get back to the cemetery, but I want to go back to when you  were younger on the Godfrey land. When you   re younger and doing  your chores, where were you going to school?  I was going to school   here we go back to my grandfather   s place. From  his place, remember, it   s another half-mile south. It   s down section ten.  The school land had a corner on the Emmons place. That   s where the  school was built. The house that we had would be like three-quarters of  a mile from the school. We walked there, back and forth. If we went the  way we were supposed to go, which was out our driveway and down the  14  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  road, it would be a mile. But we would cut across through pastures, and  there was a pasture route down there. We would walk three-quarters of a  mile back. The story goes,    It was uphill both ways,    but I don   t think it  was. But there were some kids that went to school that were walking like  two miles.  What was it called, do you remember?  Independence. District Number 1.  How many grades did you go to school for?  Eight.  Wow, how many were in your graduating class?  Probably three. Yeah, three.  Would you pack your lunch or would they cook it for you?  Oh, you packed your Karo bucket just like everybody else did. You had  two sandwiches   generally peanut butter and jelly and an apple. Then  later, my last four years, they went to where they cooked a kettle of  beans every day. So you had a hot kettle of beans on the stove that was  in there. Had one in the schoolhouse.  Indoor plumbing?  No, there wasn   t any indoor plumbing  There was boys and girls, in a  coal house. (Laughter)  When you got home from school     You had your work cut out for you.  What was waiting for you back at the farm?  You knew you had to get in the cows and you had to milk them   take  care of them. That was basically, during the winter, the main thing you  had to do. About all you had to do.  Would you do homework by lamp?  Sure. Kerosene lamp. I remember when we got the first Aladdin lamp.  Do you know the difference? An Aladdin lamp was a taller lamp and it  was a gas lamp. What kept the thing from blowing all to hell, I don   t  15  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Finchum  Felder  know, but it had a mantle on it. It was far advanced. I believe they used  fuel oil in it, I believe, rather than kerosene. See, kerosene was what you  used in the regular lamps like   we   ve still got a couple of old lamps  around here that we use during storms and when electricity is out. But  that Aladdin lamp put out a lot of light.  So after Independence, where did you go to school?  In 1942, we moved to Okeene. The house two doors  north  from here.  We moved here in the winter and went to school. We moved back in the  summer and farmed. When it came time for the farming part, the wheat  harvest and that, we went back to the farm and lived in that four-room  house.  So what was the main reasoning to move to town?  A lot more convenient. Electricity, water, inside toilet, just a whole lot  of great things in there. Rather than the kerosene cooking stove, you had  a natural gas stove. A lot better. We didn   t have central heat and cooling,  but we did have heat, you know, the controllable floor furnace. This  house here in town has an upstairs in it. It   s got three rooms upstairs and  four down. Now it   s got six down. When they bought it, it had four  down. That   s another thing. It was pretty nice as far as   you divide up  two or three to a room. Four boys still slept in one room up there. It had  a lot more room.  Did your father have a job outside of the farm?  No. Not that I know of.  So here in Okeene, where were you going to school?  At the public school. The girls went ahead and went to the Catholic high  school, and the boys pretty well went through eighth grade at St. Mary   s  and then on to the public high school.  Why did the girls get to go there and not the public?  You   re going to have to ask my mother and dad. I don   t know.  I   m curious to the reasoning for that.  Not that I know of   probably vocational agriculture. Why would you do  that and not talk about home-ec? I   ve got to say that because Jane is  here. (Laughter)  16  Finchum  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Do you remember the first time you drove a tractor?  Oh, yeah. I was probably eight years old.  Do you remember the model?  Yeah   still got it. We   ll let you look at it if you go out there.  (Laughter) Does it still run?  Oh, hell no. In fact, all of us got marks, that this tractor marked all of us.  It was an Oliver Hart-Parr. We called it Old Spanky, and you   ll see why.  If you took that on hard ground, it would beat you to death going four  miles per hour, which is as fast as it can run. All of us got scars from a  rupture.  So during your youth, what was going on on the farm? What were you  all farming?  Wheat and alfalfa. Quite a little alfalfa. My dad started out farming that  place and half of what we call the 120. So he was farming that and then  the grandfather bought some more land and they wound up farming the  120 and the home place, and then he bought the Platt place, which is  hooked up by a weird driveway system back out to the road. Their  driveway not only   not only us used the driveway, they   d use our  driveway coming part way and then our driveway swung and went to the  north into that house, and the other one went on to the quarter mile and  into the Platt property.  Did your family retain the mineral rights on the land?  Thank god. My mother always said,    God didn   t treat us right. He  should have let the minerals be developed a lot earlier than what they  were developed.    Yes. We   ve still got   in the family, the heirs in my  family, the heirs still got everything that was there, that   s ever been  there. All the adjoining lands and everything is still property of those  heirs. My interest is seven acres.  Do you know what year they started drilling?  No, but I know it was about seventy-five years ago.  That   s a while.  And that well, that seventy-five-year-old well is still producing pretty  well.  17  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  So that helped a little bit with the family.  Oh, you   re not joking. Totally changed our lifestyles.  How did it change everything?  Everything. We wore shoes in the summertime. Before, we didn   t wear  shoes in the summertime because you had your shoes you wore to  church, but other than that, you barely wore them. Now, hell, you   ve got  shoes   if you wanted cowboy boots, you   d even be allowed to buy a  pair of those. I never did own a pair, because they never did look  comfortable to me.  Is that about the time they moved to town, then?  In    42? No, I believe   I really can   t tell you that. It seems like that well  was drilled before that. That well is a piece of history out there, because  the wells around it, that one was drilled, a lot of dry wells have been  drilled. Not a lot of them, but a few dry wells, and then they drilled this  well. Now, there is a scurry because the thing is producing natural gas  and condensate. It doesn   t produce oil. The condensate produced was  clearer than that water. Naturally, there was a scurry around the  adjoining quarters to get a well drilled. That thing was a 640-acre spaced  well. There was some moves to get it broke up, you know, to break it  down into quarters. It was owned by Lou Ward and Carl Gungle and  Jack Choate and Continental Resources. They decided to leave it a unit  and do what they called,    increased density.    So whenever another  company drilled a well, they would go in a straight line between that  well and the well that was being drilled and drill a well. It would be a  producer. Even though some of them were   well, there is one drilled  within less than a half   a quarter of a mile from that well, on our land.  Land that we had then, and it was drilled, and it had produced and quit  and been worked over and reproduced, but it is still producing. I think  we get about a hundred a month off of it.  So your seventy-five-year-old well, do you have a name for it?  Yeah, it   s the Freed Number 1. There is ten wells in that section, now.  So you can count how many wells have been drilled around it by  counting those wells. There was one drilled on this place, and it was a  well. It was a freak deal, too. One of the guys that owns   it was a 640-  acre well when it was drilled, spaced well. One of the guys that was in it  was an Adams. Adams had a quarter. Adams    boy was the attorney, head  attorney for the corporation commission. Guess what they named that  well? The Adams. Then later, they broke that section spacing up, mainly  18  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  that kid caused it, and drilled a well on Adams. When they did it, we  opposed it because we thought that if it is 640 and they   ve been taking  their part out of this, now they   re going to break it up, it really doesn   t  seem fair that that well would contribute. This baby brother was running  around, we spent some money fighting it. This baby brother was saying,     Why are we fighting it? We   re luckier than they are.    They drilled it  and it lasted almost eighteen months and went dry. And then   can we  stay with the oil well?  Sure.  Then about four years ago, Chesapeake came in and on the east side  over there, there is some federal land. They got that federal land free.  They don   t pay the government royalties or nothing. This was done  when they had it at their best. Then they redone the spacing and spaced  the eighties east and called it laydown eighties. Put two laydown eighties  and drilled wells on them. So now we got forty acres on this well and the  government has got the other forty. Same way on both of them. The  reason they do that, is they don   t have to abide by the federal mandates  on what you   ve got to do to protect everything. Get on private land, they  can tear the hell out of you and you   ve got to try to guard it. Those are  not great wells, but you wouldn   t know it by what we think. Now we   re  in a little different situation.  Another thing, this land that was in my grandfather   s and father   s and  mother   s and all that   all that land was tied together. It was in one  transfer. In other words, it   s a reservation. That mineral will go back to  the land when there is no production on any of the land. So actually,  we   ve got mineral and land we don   t own or have any influence over at  all. But we   ve still got the interest until all of that dries up. We had a  dispute, which I don   t even want to go into, over the fact that these two  first wells drilled by Chesapeake was on the quarter east, which was  Platt land, which my father had purchased. See, at the time of the  drilling, that   s all been divided up among kids. Mother and father both  gone. But they had the land, thank god, as they added it   they also  added it not into this group, but made a deal that said the same thing,     As long as there is production on any of the land we   ve accumulated, it  belongs to everybody.    So now they   ve drilled a third well, and it   s  probably the best of the three.  Makes recordkeeping pretty interesting, doesn   t it?  Oh, recordkeeping is a nightmare, but you   re willing to do it for a small  fee. You know, your part of it feels pretty good. In fact, we proved that  we would go to court to protect it.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  In the early days of drilling, it made an impact on your family. Were  they drilling on other lands around you so it helped your neighbors as  well?  Yeah, it affected the whole area, but the big income was limited to that  one section, which we only had what we called the 120. The major  county line and the line between the Cherokee Outlet and the Cheyenne  Arapaho Reservation   so it   s actually in Major County. It   s not in  Blaine County.  So the Ouija board was correct, it was just liquid gold.  Wrong section, too.  Oh, okay. (Laughter) I thought I had that figured out.  Almost worked. I   ve never played with an Ouija board.  I   m surprised he even got a hold of one.  I think there was a lot of things people didn   t think about being    The  Platts had one of what was called   what the hell did they call it? It took  two pictures. I believe they called it a Recordiac. It had a deal that you  put over your face and these two pictures. Have you ever seen one of  those? It slides out and it becomes three dimensional. There was a lot  of   we never had one. The Platts had more money than we did or  something or they enjoyed life better. They had one.  Oh, cards and what have you, was a lot bigger deal. People would get  together and play cards and that type of thing. I was thinking of  something else and with my great memory, lost it while we were talking,  on something else that we had   entertainment we had that you wouldn   t  even think was entertainment, now. It wasn   t pushing a buggy rim with a  lathe, either. It was something else.  When you were younger, in your teen years, what would you do for fun  when you weren   t working on the farm?  We played a lot of softball, played a lot of dominos, and my mother was  a hell of a card player. Probably comes from playing cards with all these  kids. I and this younger brother kept trying to get her   we would go to  Las Vegas once in a while. Without that oil well, that probably never  would have happened. We   d go out there once in a while, and we kept  trying to talk her into going.    No, the devil had something to do with  that,    out there, and she wouldn   t touch it with a ten foot pole. We  figured if we could get her out there and get her in a poker game out  20  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Nusz  there, we could come out real well. God, she was lucky.  Your mom probably did a whole lot of taking care of the kids. Would she  sew clothes?  Oh, you bet. She made most of our clothes. Her Singer sewing machine  ran hours and hours.  Was she a good cook?  Yeah.  What were some of your favorite meals she cooked?  Really, I can   t think of something that wasn   t a favorite meal. Let   s go  back to one thing. That was the exception of green beans. The green  beans, see, she would can like 200 quarts of green beans every year. So  you pretty well had green beans   it didn   t matter what you had. There  was probably going to be green beans mixed in there somewhere. It got  to where that got pretty monotonous. I still am not a lover of green beans  to this day, not even if they   ve got bacon in them.  Tell me about holidays. Where would you all go for holidays? Would  you celebrate it in town or back on the farm?  Well, believe it or not, the Fourth of July   even when we didn   t have  any money   was a big celebration at our place, even on the farm. There  was kinfolks, when we got around to where we had a    33 Chevrolet,  which ran like a tea kettle, we would go as far out as like Mooreland and  meet with some of my mother   s family up there, and other places. My  dad   s older brother had   they had about eight kids, or nine, too. Those  two families get together all the time.  Christmas?  Christmas has always been great even though all you got was   you  ought to come to one of our Christmas parties today  You talk about a  Christmas party. We still have a Christmas party here for kids. It   s  getting real tough and restrained because when you get down to great-grandkids,  you   re getting to where really they need to be home. But we  kind of   Jewel especially, kind of pushes them toward,    That   s our day.  You still come here.    You get all them in here, and this house is full. It   s  great.  About fifty people.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Wow   And of course, in case you didn   t know it, Okeene has a snake hunt.  We noticed that. What did it have back in your youth? Did it have a  movie theater?  Here in town? Oh, yeah. They even had a preview.  What   s a preview?  Saturday night, they   d run a late movie. I can remember   well, when  Saturday night came and you could come to town. Everybody came to  town. People got one haircut a month, but they did it on Saturday if they  came in here. A lot of haircuts were at home, then. But if they came in,  everybody would sit on the streets. Then, you could sit on the fender of a  car. Now, hell, there isn   t any fender on the car. That   s what you seen  was the whole two blocks would be full and it there   d be somebody  sitting on every fender, visiting.  What were some of the old stores you remember in town?  Well, the one I already told you was definitely one that went around and  around and around. One of the town   s best organizations was the AHTA.  Do you know what the AHTA is?  Anti-Horse Thief Association, something or other?  Keep going. Yeah, I   ve got my grandfather   s pin. Can you believe this?  I   ve got my grandfather   s AHTA pin. I   m going to tell you a story that  didn   t go around a whole lot, but it was a hell of a story. Our robbers  were Black and Yeager. If you go into the Hennessy area, it   s still Black  and Yeager. You go Canton, Hitchcock, and if you   ve got time, I   ll tell  you a couple of those stories. But see, this house, there was a lapse in  between the time my dad and his bride moved out on that farm and my  great-grandfather went off of there. In that time, the other family that  lived on there was a guy named Carl Wallsmith   s family. They moved  on. Their house became a granary. A guy named John McGee moved in,  which was a one-legged Irishman. This guy was a friend of Black and  Yeager   s. They   d stay all night with him out on that farm. That didn   t  mean grandfather had any use for Black and Yeager. It was one of the  things they knew went on.  At one time, Black and Yeager robbed a saloon in Okeene and went  northeast. A posse forms in Okeene following them. As they go out  through the country, they gather people. When that posse is moving,  22  they pick up anybody. My grandfather joined this deal and they got in  the river bottom down there on what land we later owned, because we  bought it and added it to the farm, on Newman land. They got fire, so  they figured they   d caught up with Black and Yeager. They had a  shootout. They wound up killing two guys. What they found out later,  the guys they killed were two Mexicans that were down there with some  horses and they thought it was just a bunch of guys coming in to steal  their horses. So they were defending their horses and these guys thought  they were after Black and Yeager and wound up killing them. The two  guns that came out of that, their rifles were little short rifles about this  long. One of them is in a pawn shop in Enid, now. They were lever  action. The lever moved the cylinder around to shoot. They gave those  to the guy who owned the land, and buried the two Mexicans.  Let   s go back and say it started with Black and Yeager robbed a beer  joint in Hitchcock. One of the guys in there was a guy named Ben  Redding. While they were robbing it, he wasn   t too interested in  apprehending them. He didn   t have nothing. But when it was over, he  went over to some of his relations and got a gun and went with the  posse. They chase them west of Hitchcock to the edge of the hills. When  they get to the edge of the hills, Black and Yeager had stopped running  when they got to the top of the hill, and was shooting back at the posse.  Ben Redding told me this story. He said,    We knew how far we could  go, and we knew they weren   t shooting at us.    In other words, they  didn   t want to kill nobody. But they were shooting close enough that you  knew they could hit you if they wanted to hit you. So they stayed there  until about dark and decide,    Hey, we   ve got to go home.    So the posse  packs up and goes back to Hitchcock.  Ben Redding   s home is not in Hitchcock. Ben Redding   s home is three  miles east of Hitchcock and two miles south. So he gets a few more  beers and then heads home. On the way home, he said he could hear and  feel horses gaining on him. He said he speeded up a little, but they  caught up with him. He said,    The first thing they said was,    How are  you? Where was you this afternoon?       He said,    I   ve been to Hitchcock  and did a little drinking.    They said,    Well, yeah, but weren   t you in that  posse that followed us out west?       No, no.    They said,    Yeah, we know  you were. You shouldn   t have done that because we   re going to kill  you.    They kept right on riding and he said they visited with him and all  along, they   re telling him,    We   re going to let you get close enough to  home to where they   ll find your body easy, but we   re going to kill you.     He said,    I begged and prayed. I got a family and two or three kids.    Get  home and he could see his wife in the house. They said,    You go in and  give her a kiss and then we   ll shoot you.    He said he went in and real  tearfully told his wife what was going to happen, and he said what  happened then, they just rode off. So he wasn   t really too mad at Black  23  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  and Yeager, but he would tell you that he was damn well scared and  knew that he was going to die.  Interesting. Going back to the farm, at what point did it come into your  hands?  This is going to get fairly complicated. My father passed away, and it all  went to my mother. At that point, not long after she got it, she gave all of  the kids half of what they were going to get. They had a joint will telling  what everybody got. Basically, everybody got a quarter. The ones that  didn   t get a quarter got something else. This brother and sister, the living  brother and sister, got an eighty apiece. She got a sixty and he got a  forty, and then he got the house they lived in here in town. My great-grandmother  moved into the house. They owned the house across the  street. Well, the folks bought that. They gave that to the girl to average  things up.  At that time, I really don   t like to tell this, but I will. They gave all of us  but one that. One member of the family, they didn   t give him his half.  He was going to get a quarter, but he didn   t get his half when we got it.  Every time David and I got a chance, when we   d talk to our mother,  we   d tell her, she was the person   if she divided a damn penny up, if  she had a penny to divide, she would have cut it in nine pieces and  forked it out of there that way. Here she was, she   d kept this from this  one. I said,    Mom, this isn   t you. You shouldn   t do it.    She said,    Well,  he said as soon as I give it to him, he was going to sell it. I couldn   t  handle it.    We   re saying,    That don   t hold water because when you give  us       I know in my case, hell, I mortgaged it. I mortgaged that land,  several times. So there was a chance you   d lose it. She said,    I could  stand that.    Well, what   s the difference if you sold it or you mortgaged  it? None as far as I   m concerned.  Anyway, finally five or six years down the road, she did give him his  half. When she passed away, the rest of it came. She   d always   when  she kept, she   d keep   like we got the half with the pasture land on it.  She   d done that with everybody   s. In other words, the main income, she  kept. She damn well kept the minerals. Later, when we got the minerals  that was greater, yet.  So is it all back in your name? All 160 or whatever?  No. It   s in the four oldest girls    names, now. Forty at a time, and then we  acquired 240 beside that. This won   t sound fair to you, but to me, I  thought I was cheating the other end. The youngest girl, Barb and Tony  each got half. The river runs through this 120. A lot more hunting value  and there was cattle value, too, grass value. But in my opinion, we  24  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Mrs. Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  divided it up monetarily at the time. So each girl got forty acres and each  one of them got 120 acres. That don   t sound fair, but that   s the way it  went. Later, the boy sold his. He got more for that 120 than I thought the  whole mess would have brought. It was hellacious hunting. That   s what  it sold   it sold as hunting land.  So what   s going on on the property today?  The story on the property today is that it   s divided into forty-acre strips  running north and south, because that   s the best way they could get  access with the road easement, that isn   t even visible. But if something  was to happen, they   d have equal kind of access in there. It   s all farmed  as one unit.  So how did you meet your wife?  I have no idea. (Laughter) It used to be a bunch of boys from Okeene  went to Hennessey, and out of that came five marriages. Didn   t it? We  were one of them.  How many children do you have?  I have six.  How many grandchildren?  You   re going to have to ask her.  Eleven grandchildren and nineteen great-grandchildren.  Wow. So, looking into the future, what do you hope happens in the next  100 years to this property?  Truthfully, I   m being honest, I have no hopes. Yeah, I kind of hope they  keep it. I kind of hope it does, but I   m a realist enough to know that  things happen that   you have people ask you,    What would you do  different if you could live life over? What would you do different?     Haven   t you? My answer to that is I think I   d do the same thing that I   ve  done before, because you probably did it on a set of circumstances. You  set those circumstances back up and you   d probably make the same  decision.  Let   s back up a little bit, too, how important was religion to your  generation and your grandmother   s and great-grandfather   s?  Probably very important.  25  Finchum  Felder  Mrs. Felder  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Went to church on Sundays?  Yes.  He   s Catholic, I   m Methodist.  So maybe it   s not so important. (Laughter)  What would you normally do on a Sunday afternoon?  Normally   my grandfather talked about this. That was a hell of a trip  from out there seven miles out of town to church in a buggy. He told me  that a lot of the times, they   d meet a neighbor and never get to church.  Meet a neighbor and sit there and visit. Maybe they didn   t go to the  same church. So times have not changed as much as we think they have  in a lot of cases.  After high school, what did you go on to do?  I went directly from there into the Soil Conservation Service. I worked  for the Soil Conservation Service my sophomore summer and my junior  summer and my senior summer and then went to work for them. Came  out of that as a registered land surveyor. I retired when I was fifty-five. I  only worked thirty-two years, ten months and fourteen days. I had a lot  of people say,    You must not have liked your job.    Hell no, I didn   t like  it. I loved it. I always said that as soon as I can retire, I will retire and go  on and chase this other rabbit, and let somebody else have that job. I  don   t think it was a mistake.  So what were you doing after you retired?  Surveying and farming. At one time, we ran a hundred head of cattle and  farmed a little over four hundred acres of wheat and worked. That was  after I served about a three-year deal at Freedom, Oklahoma with Soil  Conservation Service, and then got back here. All the time in there,  when I was in high school, I farmed land for one quarter, at what was  called the grandma place. I farmed 160 acres. When I say I was close to  my grandfather, I feel like I   m not exaggerating. When I was in high  school, first he rented me an eighty, and then later he rented me the  whole quarter.  Where are your family buried?  Mostly right out here at St. Anthony   s Catholic Cemetery.  26  Finchum  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Back in the early days, was the farm terraced or any other soil  conservation type measures?  How could you work for them and not put enough pressure on your  people to get it there? When we go through these maps, you   ll see a  pond and terraces on the drawing of the place.  Before we take a break here and look at your maps, is there anything  else you   d like to share about your family farm that we haven   t talked  about today?  Not really. Not unless I told you I once tried broom corn. One of the  times that   one of the dry spells we didn   t have any wheat, I put out  about sixty acres of broom corn. Oh, my god, what a lesson.  A good lesson?  No, not a good lesson. I wound up pasturing off, which didn   t turn out  too bad, about fifty acres of it   maybe a little more than fifty acres of  it   and pulling the rest of it. That was where the education was. Number  one, if you haven   t pulled broom corn   I always swore I   d never pick  cotton. I should have sworn I   d never pull broom corn. We had to hire  help to pull it. Then you had to hire   it   s seeded, which means they took  the seeds off of it. Then you baled it, and if you   ve never seen a broom  corn bale, you   ve got the experience of your life. It will weigh between  five hundred and six hundred pounds. The shape, when it   s laying down,  it   s probably this tall. When it stands up, it is about that tall. The shape is  kind of egged on both ends and swelled up in the middle. We get this  stuff and another nut that had raised some broom corn, too. So the two  of us was  combined  and Abe Clester said,    I   ll haul it for you.    Had to  haul it to Shattuck to sell it. We had one hell of a time putting this broom  corn on two trucks. We didn   t have much broom corn, but man, getting  this stuff on there and stacking it. We couldn   t stack it to save our souls.  I bet we had half of the rope in Okeene tying that crap on to haul it out  there. We get out there, they unload it on the dock with a forklift and  stack it seven bales high. Pick it up with a forklift and take it in and put  it in a warehouse. You don   t stack it on the side like you would a bale,  you stack it on end. If we   d have figured that out, we could have done it.  We never did figure that out. (Laughs)  When you were raising wheat, would you take it to Kingfisher?  No, no. We had Piper elevator, which the railroad called it Piper Spur.  It   s no longer there. It was a little elevator. From great-grandfather   s  northwest corner, it would have been two miles to it, two and a quarter  miles. It served its purpose out there. It gathered a lot of wheat.  27  Finchum  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Finchum  Felder  Finchum  Felder  So the railroad came pretty close to the farm?  Yes.  Did you have problems with hobos?  No, they were further away than that. Besides that, they probably  wouldn   t have gotten out and hoboed out to one house, anyway. They  probably would have done their most   she  Mrs. Felder  can get into  some hobo stories. She came from a railroad family. Her dad was a  section foreman on the mainline Rock Island. So they lived in a section  house and put food out for the hoboes and all that good stuff.  While we were looking through the paperwork, the original farm was  161 acres and some odd     Yeah, you   re getting ready to take a survey course. (Laughter)  Well, let   s get to it, then.  Okay. Townships   they are thirty-six, six miles square in a township,  right? Say yes because that   s what there is. There is going to be error  even in this. Little known to most people, a lot of astronomy went into  setting these rectangles on this round earth. They done a hell of a job. I   d  make the statement   if my son was here, he   d correct this, but I say, if  you were to survey Oklahoma today, just Oklahoma out by itself, the  whole state   and if you contracted it, two things would happen. They  would never get done, with all the modern tools we   ve got. My son still  surveys. Surveying has went through one hell of an evolution. When I  started surveying, the ultimate was a twenty-second transit and a steel  tape. My giant step was called a total station, which would measure  angles and outside. A transit measures angles interior, and there was  twenty seconds of inaccuracy in there. So you   d spin your deal five  times and take that reading and divide by five, and that   s what you come  up with as a correction.  So they took a theodolite, which measures externally, and put an  electronic distance meter in it and called it a total station. Changed  surveying totally. What you   d been   like measuring a mile. Measuring a  mile with a steel tape   probably an hour, because you pulled it and  corrected for temperature. Something that most people don   t even think  about, the steel tape on a hot day gets about that much longer than it did.  The old original surveyors didn   t use a tape, they used a chain. These  lengths were a little over seven inches long. While they were measuring,  if any one of them flipped in a kink, which they watched for because it  28  Finchum  Felder  happened all the time, then you had a compound error. Now, you   re  taking about seven inches out of it, really. Every time you measure, the  error got bigger. But now comes this total station.  The U.S. Supreme Court did one of the most wonderful things because  right away they had a lawsuit. It went to the Supreme Court and said,     Hey, we   ve got this section out here which isn   t correct by  measurement.    See, you think there is 5,280 feet in a mile, but I know  there is not. We   re different that way, right off. We   re whatever it  measures. A mile is however long it measures to be, which in the state of  Oklahoma is normally about five-foot short per mile, because that was  about the normal error. Also, when they measured, even with this tape,  they pulled it tight and tried to make it level. There is still error. There is  still error even with that electronic distance meter. The only error is the  change in temperature and humidity to it while you   re in the survey. So  you   ve narrowed it down. Or, if you   ve got a plumb bob   oh, god, if I   d  have thought of this, I would have brought something. Do you know  what a plumb bob is?  No idea, no.  A plumb bob is shaped like a top that has been stretched up so that it   s  got a point. You put this under a twenty-second transit, and then you put  that over your point. You don   t have much error. In Oklahoma, about the  only thing that would affect you was the wind. You had a hell of a time  getting it to hang down straight any time out here in Western Oklahoma.  Eastern Oklahoma is not so bad. Eastern Oklahoma, you   ve got all the  trees to contend with so they were just as bad. Also, Eastern Oklahoma  has got a lot of rocks. Now, you   re measuring to a rock. How in the hell  do you know the rock you   re looking for is the one just laying out there?  Anyway, you get into this set of sections, this error that is going to be in  there, where are you going to put it? So they put everything on the north  line and the west line. So section two is on the north line. The error is up  there. What I   ve already told you, tells you it should be short, right? It  should have been measured short. That one is the goofy one. It may have  been measured long.  So surveyors have a lot of fun when they   re at the coffee shop. It used to  be, the surveyor walked into a restaurant, he knew if there was another  surveyor in there if he   d never been in that town. You know how he  knew? There was a plumb bob hanging out of that guy   s hip pocket. He  had it and was using it to pull his tape with, he was using it on his  instruments, and he was using it for everything. Now, the new ones are  even worse than this. The ones that Tony has got have optical plummets  on them. So you look in the hole and the prism turns it down. So you  look down there, the wind don   t affect it and all that. The new ones, you  29  know what they   ve got. They   ve got the same thing the laser sights got.  So, hell, you set the thing on there, look down and there is a red dot on  the ground   you just push it over on top of your point.  Let me tell you a story that goes along with this survey. I had a gal  working for me one time. Hell of an employee. Best employee I ever  had. We were in Cherokee going through all the old notes trying to find  where all the other surveyors   the old surveyors did a good job of  following each other. If you found a cornerstone, you marked it. Here is  where it gets funny. When they first found it, if they found a  cornerstone, first thing they basically did was put a whiskey bottle on it  with a cork in it. Why would they do that? It didn   t rot, and it had a point  on the top. The neck came up and it was only about that big around  when the cork went in. So they   d mark with that. Later, they got to  where they were driving rebar and to help the rebar, they would pile pop  cans and beer cans around it because those metal detectors would pick  that up. Then when the moon program came along, they developed  locating magnets. Now you didn   t need the beer cans, either.  We were in Cherokee, Alfalfa County, going through these notes. She  was going through one book and I was going through another book. I  looked over and she had a look on her face like she couldn   t believe. I  wondered what the hell is going on with Elaine. I asked her,    What did  you find, Elaine?    She said,    Come over here.    What this thing said, that  this old boy had found the stone and it gave the measurements of it,  which basically was the same as the measurements of the stone the  surveyor had set. He placed a dead soldier over it and gave some  references to a corner post. She was going,    What is a dead soldier?     (Laughs) It was a whiskey bottle, and it was empty. So that was a lot of  fun.  I haven   t got down to this. So anyway, you   ve got these lots across the  top. The average attorney in Oklahoma twenty years ago didn   t know  that. Did you know that? He would write a legal description. He   d say,     The northwest corner of section two,    or,    The northwest corner of the  northwest quarter of section two.    There isn   t any northwest corner of  section two. That   s lot two  Or in that case, lot four, where it is the  northwest corner. They go across the top: one, two, three. Now, if you  get over here in section six, what have you got? You   ve got lots across  the top and lots down the side. Every section has got it, or every  township has got it. Twelve sections of every township is affected by  that.  You can get into another thing that   s weird. All this was done by hand,  right   a survey crew then consisted of an instrument man, a note keeper,  a cook, a hunter and about three axe men, a chainman (two chainmen,  30  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  one on each end) and then the guy that set the stones and the guy that  scattered the stones. They generally had two wagons. Do you know what  the wagons were for? The cook had one and the guy that went and got  the posts or the stones to put over those places had the other one. Those  surveyors didn   t ride, they walked everywhere. The pattern they walked.  I don   t know how to tell you this, but here is your thirty-six. Six down  the side and back over. So thirty-six is down in this corner over here.  They   d start at the southeast corner of the township and they would     now, remember the old boys that had done this worked with the stars,  North Star, Polaris and all that   had went in and put in all these corners  for them. They would come over a mile, find that stone, go up a mile,  back over a mile and lock back in on that stone on that side. Then guess  where they went? They walked over across, back down here to that far  corner. They   d go over, up, over, up, back over and lock. They finished  it that way.  Anything that was left over   now what happened on correction corners,  which happens every eighteen miles where you have a crook in the road.  You   ve got another problem, haven   t you? Remember, Oklahoma is a  young state, right? Kansas is over a hundred years older than we are.  When they did the Oklahoma survey, and thank god for this, the  Chickasaws had a survey done before Oklahoma was surveyed. When  they came back in, they hired the same guys to do the Oklahoma survey  that they hired to do the Chickasaw. Greatest thing that ever happened  because now they hooked together. They went down and took their old  survey and just spread out of there. If you ever get a chance to go to  what they call the  initial survey  point in Oklahoma, go to it. You   re not  going to see anything, but you   re just going to feel a lot better the rest of  your life.  Where is it at?  It   s at Davis, Oklahoma. It   s on a hilltop down there. This old boy took a  stone that looks like a giant post and put it out on the top of the tallest  hill he could see and did all his surveying off that. That   s the initial  point. We went down there. Tony hadn   t been surveying but probably  two years. We went down there, had a meeting. We had annual  meetings. We   d meet at this initial point. We   d go down there a day  early, which most people don   t. Most people are smarter than that. We   d  go down there a day early, and we decided to go out there. We already  had this letter telling us what we could and couldn   t do out there. Like  you can   t drive off of an established road.  Harris Ranch, this thing hasn   t got any roads going to it. They never  built the roads to that initial point. We drive up there and drove up to the  gate, and the gate is locked. Here comes an old boy driving an old Jeep  31  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  up there, unlocked the gate and drove out. He came over to us and said,     What do you guys want?    We introduced ourselves and visited with  him a while. I was talking to him and I said,    We   d like to go up there,  but we got these instructions. We know we can   t get off these trails and  the things we can   t do. We can   t build any fires and all that.    He said,     Where   d you get that piece of paper?    I said,    Well, they sent it out.     He said,    I own this damn thing, and I didn   t know that.    He said,    You  guys go anywhere you want to go. Here   s the key. When you get  through with it, put it under a rock here by the gate.    So we went up  there. In fact, he went with us to show us right where it   s at. It   d  probably took us three hours to find it. It had a fence going to it from the  north and the fence going to it going east. It didn   t have the other two  fences going to it, so it would have took us a while to find it. Super old  boy.  Then the next day when we all go out there, they   ve got a key, too, the  state society has got a key. They went through this whole list. When we  went in the gate, we just went straight to it. Old   what was his name?  Can   t think of his name. He works for the state society now. He did,  then. We got up there, he said,    You wasn   t supposed to do that.    I said,     Well, old Fred Harris    uncle told us we could go anywhere we damn  well please.    He said,    Well, I guess you can then, because he owns it,  doesn   t he?    I said,    Yeah, I think so.    Fred Harris, our state senator,  was an Indian. You knew that, probably. Do you remember Fred Harris?  Fred Harris was a U.S. senator from Oklahoma for one term. His wife is  a full-blood and he was three-quarter. They owned Harris Ranch. Just  being out there, you get some real good feelings.  I guess surveying has seen lots of changes in technology over time.  You   re not joking. Don   t tell me you don   t. You hate change as bad as I  do. Everybody hates change, you know. Once something has gone on for  two years, it ought to go on forever, but it don   t. When I started  surveying, it was twenty-second transit and steel tape, and a magnetic  compass which wasn   t worth a damn for nothing. Also, can you imagine  what would happen to you if you walked over one of these electric  fences dragging a steel tape? It   d get your attention real quick. There  was a lot of other problems with it.  I can tell you, David Knowles is a professor at the university at Rolla,  the Missouri School of Mines. We had him   he   s a good seminar  presenter because he   s been there   he   s been out in the field. He was  telling us, right after he got his professorship, he was using his students  to help him survey. He said he had a graduate student and they went out  and measured a mile with a distance meter. This student was running the  distance meter. He said he asked him on the two-way radio,    Well,  32  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  Nykolaiszyn  Felder  how   d we do?    The old kid said,    We   ve got gross error.    He said,    All  the way driving back down there I was thinking,    Hell, this is a pretty  standard looking deal, I can   t imagine gross error.       He got down there.  He had five-foot error. He said,    Here I am, the student   s got the gross  error and I   m happy as a damn lark,    because that   s real standard. That  five-foot is all over pretty standard.     Well, do you have anything else you   d like to add before we take a look  at some of these maps?  No, let   s take a look at some of the maps or go eat, either one.  All right, thank you for your time today.  Y   all are welcome. I need to get you into the snake hunting stories.  -------  -------
