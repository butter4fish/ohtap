Speaker 1: What is your favorite phrase, or saying?
Speaker 2: I never really thought about my favorite phrase, or saying.  It would be, I'd have to think about it.  Actually I do have, especially when you say favorite, because I hadn't really thought about it.  There was a phrase really, it's sort of a strange thing where--
Speaker 1: [TAPE INTERRUPTED]
Speaker 2: --it's a Robert E. Lee quote and it was talking about the, I'll come back to the quote, I don't remember it.  I remember it stood out and I wrote it down at the time.  I was reading a book on the life of Harry Truman in my coloring book [unclear]--Harry Truman was a fascinating person by the way--but he was a Robert E. Lee fan and Robert E. Lee was just talking about that, the need, if you wanted to tell anything to be, and it was basically saying, be frank.  Be frank, be honest, at least that's what he said, that's what it was: frankness is a combination of honesty, integrity and courage.  The ability to be honest, to say what actually is and have the courage to really--to do it because in essence it was meant to sort of show that most people don't really do that, they don't really--they hem and they haw, they do things that for me, even in my present life.  I always feel that I'm the guy who, my job is to deliver the message that no one else will.  I've worked for corporations and things, especially when you work in a situation where there are people who are internal within that organization who report to a person, they're afraid to tell him what's real.  Well my job is to always tell the emperor he has on no clothes and no one else was, so I kind of fell in love with that statement because for me, I'd almost rather be frank and honest and tell you what's what up front and then you make a decision to leave me alone rather than to try to string you on on something that I might want or desire for you and then at some point down the road try to tell you what might be happening or you might find out.  So I've just stuck to that statement because I really believe in being honest and being up front.  I prefer people, if you don't like me or you don't want to deal with me, I'd like you to know exactly where I'm coming from so that you can make that decision up front.  So that's a phrase that I've caught hold of.  There are other little phrases but some of them I wouldn't want to [laughter]--
Speaker 1: What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: As fat as I am, I probably enjoy--I like pizza.  I consider myself a real chef, so probably, I love gumbo if it's made right.
Speaker 1: A chef, you cook.
Speaker 2: I cook a lot. I cook anything.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite thing to cook then?
Speaker 2: I like cooking creole food, the jambalayas, the gumbos, things of that nature.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Well I enjoy summertime only because of the fact that I've been fortunate enough to live my life on a school schedule almost my entire life.  So that means that, even now, because the legislature mirrors that in the sense that they're down during the summer.  So I enjoy summer because that's when I generally have the most leisure time.  In terms of just certain aspects of the transitions of spring and fall are always pleasant, the smell, the change in the air, that goes about, the transitions of the seasons always bring it out but in terms of just leisure time I enjoy summer because I'm always looking forward to that summer vacation to that time with the kids, and that--a little bit of moment to be away from the job but it's more a matter of the circumstances than weather.
Speaker 1: And your favorite color.
Speaker 2: I really don't know, I mean I've always liked--I really don't have one.  I like red, I like blue.
Speaker 1: And when you take a vacation, where do you like to go?
Speaker 2: Generally I enjoy South Carolina.  I enjoy places up and down the southeast coast.  Generally I've traveled it from Florida up to at least DC [Washington, D.C.].  DC is the demarcation line between the south and the north and I've been to Virginia Beach [Virginia], Myrtle Beach [South Carolina], all up and down there, I love Charleston [South Carolina], the atmosphere, those kind of places I enjoy a lot.  And then secondly my family is from a small town called Athens, Tennessee which is about 50 miles from the Great Smoky Mountains and Gatlinburg [Tennessee]. And I enjoy Gatlinburg, I just enjoy the, just sitting there looking at the mountain type things.
Story_ID: 47667
Speaker 1: Well great, that brings us to your family.  Would you name your parents and tell us where they're from?
Speaker 2: My mother is Sarah Phyllis Hayes, was her maiden name, Sarah Williams.  She was born here in Chicago, Illinois.  My father was Paul L. Williams.  He was born in Athens, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And siblings?
Speaker 2: I have two sisters, Donita Foreman and Joanne Harris.  Donita is the oldest, she is the oldest of the three.  My sister is the middle child and I'm the baby.  I'm the only boy, and the baby.
Speaker 1: Spoiled.
Speaker 2: Not at all.  Actually, I got a lot of respect for females out of that because I grew up in a family where my father was very, that was--it was a no-no, I don't care what they do, you don't hit your sisters, you don't hit your mom, you don't do things of that nature and at the same time, that's how I learned how to cook, because nobody would cook for me, so I didn't grow up, I don't believe, anyway, pampered, or any way getting any kind of, nobody, it was not one of those situations where men and women had defined roles.  We all did what we did.
Story_ID: 47668
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is the earliest memory you have of your direct relationship to your dad [Paul Williams]?  What event stands out that you and your dad shared?
Speaker 2: There are just tons of memories.  Things that really stand out for me with my dad are somewhat strange stories, in the sense that I remember once when I was--I mean, lots of stories about my dad, getting whippings from my dad.  I remember once, when I was a rambunctious child, I was just not going to do right and they sent me to school with my sister.  My dad looked out the window and he realized I had broken away from my sister and was sitting on the step in front of the house during school times.  Of course, I got a spanking all the way back to school.  Those kind of memories.  But the ones--you know, some of the ones that really stand out in addition to, my dad was, my dad probably was not the greatest breadwinner of all time.  My dad was an extremely proud man.  I remember stories like when I was on the baseball team.  My dad became a coach and when my sisters were giving parties and stuff my dad would be the chaperone and stuff and stories about my dad and his family were always magical and historical to me, just like the time when my father had taken my sisters down south and my dad, we used to call him, excuse the expression, I gotta be careful I say this on tape, you just call it I-hope-to-die-end, okay [laughter].  So by that I mean, that's an old country estate they had in his hometown.  I remember once when my sisters were little [unclear], and they were going to get into a cab, they got out at Knoxville [Tennessee] or somewhere and the cab, it was back in the early part of the 50's [1950s] and 60's [1960s], he looked like he was going to--white guy looked like he was going to put my--slam my sister's finger in the door and as he got ready to close the door my father put the knife to his neck and said, if that girl's finger gets touched, you're throat's coming off.  That's the way my dad was.  He didn't have any problem fighting with anybody over--he was a little bitty man.  But the one thing that really affected me, was, well I remember particularly, and I can go on from here, when I was in the fourth grade, I believe it was about fourth, third or fourth, I wrote a poem.  I remember the poem, most of it, not all of it, I don't want to go to Singapore or any far-off land, I just want to stay at home and play and rip and rob and prance but if by chance, it went on like this, and I wrote two poems, the other one is talking about, here we are in this man-made cage racing here for our pre-dug graves unaware of destiny's intention trying to match, I was in fourth grade, my teacher did not believe that I wrote the poems, she said I copied them out of a book.  And she, in essence, gave me an F and sent me home with it.  My dad went up to school, and he says--because he asked me, pointblank, did you write them, because we'd had big things over the truth in my household.  You could do wrong but you had to admit it.  If you told a lie, you got in far more trouble than whatever the underlying wrong was.  So my dad asked, did you write this, I said, yes, I did, because I had.  And he went back up to school and he confronted the teacher and he told her, you're either going to change--you say he took them out of a book, you find the book, you find the poem, otherwise you change this grade right now.  And she had to.  That had a great impression on me as a young man, having my father stand up for me, not in a crazy way but basically saying, you have accused him of something but you can't prove it.  You say this is from a book but you don't have the book.  You don't know the poems, you've never seen them before, you just can't believe he would write this?  You don't believe that a black kid could do this?  And that was--those kind of things, I guess for me, my dad was extremely proud, I mean the kind of guy that--he had a job somewhere, whether it was Tidess [ph.] or something and they came to him and asked him once could he train a white guy to be the foreman, and my dad couldn't understand.  If I could train him, I could be the foreman, so of course my dad walked off the job.  And he was [unclear] my dad wasn't the greatest provider because he was always walking off jobs for one reason or another, and he eventually ended up running a pool room.  But the point was, that's the way he was and that was really one of the deepest memories that sits in my heart because the way I feel about my children.
Story_ID: 47669
Speaker 1: That's great. So it was very interesting growing up in the Williams household.
Speaker 2: I think.  I think that we had--we weren't special or anything but it was--we had strong family traditions.  To this day we have a strong family unit.  Me and my sisters [Donita Foreman and Joanne Harris] and my mom [Sarah Williams], I tell anybody, my support system comes from my family.  When I first ran for office my mom and sisters were there licking stamps all night, standing on the floor.  So we have a strong support system in my family.
Speaker 1: Any--I know it's a lot of special moments.  Is there anything you want to mention about your relationship to your mom?
Speaker 2: You know, moms was--the thing about my mother that most stands out was my mother's refusal to allow us to think that we weren't capable of doing anything.  My mom had one basic statement.  When you would come home with the, Johnny can do this, and so-and-so, my mother would just look at us.  My mother's whole attitude was, if somebody else can do it, you kids can do it.  You kids are smart, you kids are capable, your kids are do-able.  My mother was, she was the all-around mom.  She worked hard, she kept a job and kept food on the table, even as much as my dad [Paul Williams], if not more, seeing that sometimes they had reverse roles because of the circumstances of the time, especially with my dad being such a proud type of individual.  But he didn't have any problem doing a reverse role either, so between my mom and my dad, and my mother in particular I think, my mother was just that gel, she held us all together, she always encouraged us.  And my mother had been particularly good in school.  And she just felt that her children were capable of doing anything.  She never would allow us to even, and the same things, we grew up--like my mother wouldn't allow us to--we couldn't take anything from people.  Like when my father would--my father ran a pool room and so we lived over the pool room and my father was sort of like the caretaker of it and he did whatever people who run pool rooms do.  Guys would come in there just to gamble.  They wanted to give us, if I was sitting there, she saw him giving--she wouldn't allow them to give me a quarter or anything.  If they went to give us something, my mother would say, give it back, my kids don't beg.  We do those kind of things and if they need something I'll give it to them.  She wouldn't even allow us to, and to this day, that had a major impact on me [unclear] I won't have anybody do anything for me if I can do it myself, even if they want to do it.  I just believed that that's the way you're supposed to do things.
Story_ID: 47670
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, I was in trouble all the time.  I must have got a whipping every day, half the time because I was having fights with my sisters [Donita Foreman and Joanne Harris].  I was just, I think that I was--you know my mother [Sarah Williams] and them say I was probably considered bright, but at the same time I was considered lazy.  I didn't want to do much of anything.  I really was not that ambitious.  I was troublesome, I was a semi-street kid, did all types of stuff.  I never went to, even when I was in high school, the teacher said, Paul if you'd just turn in your homework, you're going to get a B, if you turn in your homework, I'll give you an A.  I'd look at him straight and say, a B is fine with me.  That is the type of kid I was.
Speaker 1: That's great. Elementary school.  What stands out about it and where did you attend elementary school?
Speaker 2: Three elementary schools.  I started out in Fuller.  I don't remember a lot about Fuller.  I left Fuller when I was in third grade.  I actually took third grade, did some, a mid-year.  The only thing that I really remember, I remember the social center, they used to have it then.  We could go to the social center in the evening and things of that nature, but in terms of the, it's just too early in my memory to really make a point.  Pirie and Dixon were the two predominant schools--grammar schools that I remember.
Speaker 1: Where were they?
Speaker 2: Pirie is at, that's when they first opened up, that was at 84th, I guess it would be Champlain, because it's back over, back behind St. Mark's church, I remember when they actually built it.  And then Dixon is at 83rd and St. Lawrence.
Story_ID: 47671
Speaker 1: Did middle school become more eventful and where was that?
Speaker 2: I went all the way through elementary, through two high schools, all the way to eight grade.  There were lots of memories, lots of good memories, probably more so, some of the people I went to school with.  Some of them have done quite well. Derrick Blakeley, the Channel 5 announcer, he and I were, we lived around the corner from each other, and we--events such as--I have lots of memories of patrol boy, being a patrol boy.  As I tell people, I got my first political going-on, in fact it involved Derrick Blakeley and I was in eighth grade, I was going from seventh to eighth, I was in eighth mid-year or something.  I was a lieutenant and they were going to change officers and the captain's spot was up, I couldn't do any more.  And I became clear that I wasn't going to win it early on.  So I went to the guy who I thought had the best chance of winning and cut a deal with him and told him I would support him if, in fact, he would allow me to be named to an inside hall monitor job and he put Derrick on the outside of the door, because Derrick had a special arrangement.  I used to always, Derrick would let me look at his English homework, so I cut my first deal back in eight grade.  I remember that, those sort of things I was--and it all worked out.  Everything happened just that way.
Speaker 1: Oh, good. By the time you got to high school, was it becoming more eventful?
Speaker 2: Oh Lindblom [Lindblom High School, currently Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois], I think, in particular, at the time, I don't know if you've interviewed other Lindblomites, we were quite egotistical.  We thought--well, at the time it was a big deal to get into Lindblom.  You had to get a certain score to take the test, and then only so many people that actually took the test were accepted, it was probably, it was a predecessor to today's Whitney Young [Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, Chicago, Illinois].  They had Lane [Lane Technical Prep College High School, Chicago, Illionis] and they had Lindblom.  So when we got to Lindblom, it was an opening for me and I met a lot of, a lot of people.  A lot of my classmates, we just had our 25th, well it's almost been closer to thirtieth, I guess, but a few years back.  But it was fun, a lot of people were successful.  So just the idea of football games and girls and the whole life came to being at Lindblom, and also I remember Lindblom as really [unclear] actually it was kind of funny.  When I was in grammar school, for a little while I thought of myself as slow.  Not because of whatever, but because I had tested into, now they were tracking kids then, I had tested into the high track coming out, but coming from way back, when I was coming from Fuller to Pirie and Dixon, I felt that other kids read better out loud than me so I was kind of, I didn't want to do that, and those kind of things that were shy, and I used to stutter, so those kind of things were somewhat difficult.  By the time I got to Lindblom, Lindblom brought out a lot in me, I got a lot of opportunities.  I wasn't one of the better known students, people knew me, but I just seemed to come into my own there.  And it was a tough school.  I often said I thought Lindblom High was tougher than college and that gave me a certain satisfaction, that I could do, that I could compete.
Story_ID: 47672
Speaker 1: Oh great. Who were your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness, Lord, I can't even remember.  I really--it sounds funny.
Speaker 1: [Unclear]
Speaker 2: Not [unclear] we go back to Miss Madeline Stradin [ph.] in grammar school.  Miss Stradin was--
Speaker 1: What grade?
Speaker 2: Oh, this would have been seventh and eight grade in the sense that she was the first person that I ever knew who really talked about and worked with black history.  Miss Stradin, she was an older lady but for us as kids she really was one of the early, you'd go in and her room would be full of pictures of African Americans who had done great things and she was constantly giving us that kind of positive images as youngsters.  And I remember her, she stood out for that reason to me.  There were other teachers throughout the time that I had special relationships with and probably I started getting, when I got to college I started getting a little more involved with different things where I stood out because even at Lindblom [Lindblom High School, currently Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois], I thought I was pretty smart but there were a whole bunch of smart kinds there.  Our class, when we had the 25th [unclear] black--we had about 40 engineers in that class and maybe five or ten doctors [unclear], lawyers and accountants and CPAs [Certified Public Accountant].  Out of 440-something kids, about 415 went to college. At that time it was almost an all-black school.  So it took a lot to stand out at Lindblom, and that sort of thing.  I think of teachers here and there, but Miss Stradin is probably one of the ones that made some early impressions on me.
Story_ID: 47673
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you, as you moved out of high school[Lindblom High School, currently Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois] into college, any marked experiences as you made that transition slowly into young adulthood?
Speaker 2: Well there were a lot of things going on at that time so I have a lot of different things that were extra outside of school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell me about your community--
Speaker 2: Well at that time, because we were in, I remember when we were in high school, it was right around the time, I remember, when Mark Clark and Fred Hampton got killed and we--some of our kids got together, we went over to the site where he was shot and all of things, and going through the school right during there.  I remember when King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, and particularly Lindblom--Lindblom was in a--
Speaker 1: [OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: --so I remember when we were in school and the riots were going on, Lindblom was in an area that was, actually in that time, blacks didn't live west of Ashland.  Lindblom was a little bit west, it was in between Ashland and Damen and when the riots came on, when King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got killed, they had to get us out of there.  I remember going--we would go to school, little kids, they'd point fingers at you and say, nigger, nigger, stuff like that, those dynamics at the same time with other dynamics going on was Jeff Fort, you know the Black P. Stone Nation and guys meeting over on 39th Street, so it was just a lot of dynamics.  We were choosing between being a revolutionary or a gangster, that sort of a thing, and I had clearly felt somewhere in the middle there.
Story_ID: 47674
Speaker 1: And we had--and there were some other things that happened while I was in high school.  Actually, one of the guys you may or may not have interviewed, I don't know, Philip Jackson.  Well Philip Jackson is the guy, he's not a legislator, he used to be the most recent past he was head of the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority].  He and I, we all went to, we all worked together as janitors in a nursery school when I first met him.  We formed a club and as a kid we used to go to these parties [unclear] they'd call them a dollar party, a two dollar party, but we went and we started and these guys were making a lot of money.  So we formed a club, the four of us, four guys and we just came up with a name and we gave a party and made 1,600 bucks in one night.  So after that we formed two or three other clubs and we had different names.  We were giving parties. By the time I was halfway through high school [Lindblom High School, currently Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois] I had about ten grand. I was doing all types of things and it was all, all this was straight up, and we had people who wanted to--I remember one night, we actually gave three parties in one night, one of them was for adults, we actually rented a club in somebody's name and we just stuck our guys in the door to make--collect money.  We had gotten so good at this that the buildings downtown, they grew to know us and they wouldn't allow some of, they would ask us for recommendations whether or not we should allow other groups to give parties there, are they a good group, or whatever, and sometimes we would go to the group and say hey, look, if you want this place, you need to, because there got to be so many parties, you've got to cut us fifty percent, we'll take care of the advertising and everything else and you just show up with your group.  And it would go like that.  That's what I'm saying, those were the dynamics of my high school.  I was involved-I was a young entrepreneur.  I could do anything.  I sold used comic books, I would buy them from a friend who had bought them and he would sell them to me, big stacks of them, and I'd resell them, everything of that nature.  But it was just doing the things, but really, it was part of what was the social dynamics of what was going on in the late 60's [1960s], the early 70's [1970s], riots, social consciousness, black power, hippies, all of it, all of it, I mean the whole thing, the big naturals, the Led Zeppelin concerts, all of it.  It was fun years [unclear].  Things were going on.  I spent the last few years scared that I would end up in Vietnam even though I wasn't quite, when I came out in '71 [1971], I think Viet Nam went on to '74 [1974], I was draft eligible and I had a cousin, when they pulled the lottery, we used to joke, who was the oldest, it was a question whether I was born July 21 or July 22, born in the same hospital around midnight.  We were cousins and we always claimed, well the day they picked the lottery there was no doubt in mind that's which day I became July 22 quickly.  My cousin drew number five, and I drew number two sixty-eight or something like that, and I was like no, you're the oldest, and he went off.  I think he did refrigeration work. But anyway, those were the times, the dynamics of it all.  There was a lot emphasis on, say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud, and all of those kind of dynamics going up and Black Panthers and this and that and the other, like I say, the other dynamic was the gangs and stuff.
Story_ID: 47675
Speaker 1: So you majored in history?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a history major. Out of a history of education, I taught for a tiny bit of time.
Speaker 1: First I'm going to ask you during the period you were just talking about, were you and your family very political in a formal or an informal way?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I think my family had past political stuff.  My father [Paul Williams] a long time ago had been a Republican precinct captain during the second war, back in the days when they used to do it, the Republicans, black Republicans weren't as rare as they are today, we had some, but not in the formal sense, we were just, if anybody, it would have been me, we were just people growing up watching the dynamics, if anything, my mother [Sarah Williams] being afraid for me, trying to keep me out of all that stuff, it was like, you've seen the riots going on, my mother was get yourself inside the house, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: You made your way through Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  And who picked up that tab and how did you get them to pick it up?
Speaker 2: At the time I went through on what they call a teacher's scholarship, teachers' shortages, you agreed to teach for so many years and you taught and then you would be basically forgiven if you taught for your college there.  So I went on a teacher's scholarship and I taught, actually I was a substitute teacher down in Springfield, Illinois, what I did qualify to repay my debt, or at least qualify for forgiveness of the debt.
Speaker 1: At the time you were in college, is that when you started working with Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: No, not really, not as an undergrad, when I was in college, what I did was, I was involved with somebody called the Midwest Model United Nations.  Chicago State was a great school for me.  A lot of people, you should have gone to UI [University of Illinois-Chicago], you could have gone to one of the larger schools.  For the same reason that I didn't stand out at Lindblom [Lindblom High School, currently Lindblom Math and Science Academy], it was probably best that I didn't go to one of those because for some reason I stood out at Chicago State University, just changing over from Chicago Teacher's College and they'd worn out the new campus we would still be at 69th Street.  They moved while I was in college.  What was the question again? I kind of lost my--
Speaker 1: I was just asking you had you--who paid, I said who paid the tab, and then [unclear] [off camera discussion]--
Speaker 2: Right. So basically-so Chicago State was just a good school for me, it allowed me to do things.  That's what you asked about certain political things and I didn't get involved with Harold Washington then.  I basically was just involved with what they called the Midwest Model United Nations.  I got selected as a delegate, then eventually I got selected as a staffer, actually it was the first time I went to St. Louis [Missouri] and stayed in a hotel by myself and things of that nature.  I had never done a lot of those types of things prior to that, so it gave me an opportunity.
Story_ID: 47676
Speaker 1: At Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] I kind of stood out and I got a lot of opportunities to do things that eventually led to it because what ended up happening from the Midwest Model United Nations I got picked as an undergraduate intern.  For a guy, and I was still an undergrad, an internship, they put you on, gave you, you worked with a member of the legislature.  I worked with a guy, a Republican by the name of Romie Palmer, Romie Palmer was the, this was when I was in my senior year, the chairman of the--he was the minority spokesperson of what was called the Judiciary II Committee, which is the Criminal Law Committee, and of all people, Harold Washington was the chairman of that committee.  And so one day I was doing my work for Romie and they were discussing the Illinois Retail Theft Act.  It wasn't--it is part of law now but it wasn't then.  And Mr. Palmer, Romie didn't--he was a white guy out of Mississippi, a lawyer, he was a nice guy, gave me a lot of encouragement.  You often don't know what to do with interns, so he just gave me this, he said read it and tell me what you think.  So we were sitting there and they had Harold and the big time lawyers and the big time staffers, they had been reviewing, people from the Retail Merchants Association and when they were all through and figured, Romie just said, what do you think, son, just for the heck of it, since I had read it, and I came up with an observation, after reading this thing, I'm still a college senior, and I said, it appears to me the way this thing is written that if I were to take something while I'm in the store and put it in my pocket, at that moment I become guilty of the offense.  What if I were to put it in my pocket, walk up to the cash register, and take it back out and pay for it?  You know, you're giving them the authority to grab me from the moment I'm putting it in my pocket.  Well, Harold Washington jumps up and says, he's right, he's right, and they changed the Illinois Retail Theft Act that says you had to get past the last said pay station.  Well at that moment, Harold says, make sure that kid gets into the graduate program.  So I came back in, into the graduate internship program where I was assigned to Senator Partee's staff but it was at that moment when I was first recognized by Harold so to some extent I realized I wasn't working with him at that time but I probably was first noticed by him as a result of my involvement with the internship program, and just happened to be, I just by luck of chance, happened to end up in there, working for a guy on the same committee with Harold.

Speaker 1: What stands out for you about your relationship with Harold Washington?
Speaker 2: I mean there are tons of people--it's just that Harold [Mayor Harold Washington] always had a very, a certain amount of people said it was, it was just, he was just such a warm and down to earth person.  I always had a hard time even referring to him as Mr. Mayor, because I had always known him as Harold, I had always known him as Harold, so Harold it was, and Harold it will be.  The other thing was the advice that he gave me in the commonness of him, the fact that he never, a great example, years later when I was lobbying I, Harold had just recently, it was right before the Illinois Association of Realtors and Harold would give me stories, I've got tons of Harold stories, the earlier one was, when I didn't know if I wanted to even work for them, 'cause you know, realtors, and I called Harold, and he said, boy, don't be foolish, we've always needed somebody on the inside, that guy you're working for is a great guy, he knows what he's doing, we need to put some people in those spots, you take the job.  So those kind of situations with Harold, we were always, well later on, years later, I took the job and I was working for the realtors, Harold is now in Congress.  He's passed the Illinois House, he's passed the Illinois Senate, actually he's even won the primary for mayor, through all the years in dealing with the realtors for whatever reason they worked with me in dealing with Harold when he was in the legislature and he became the Mayor, all of a sudden everybody they go to Arthur Rubloff, everybody knows Arthur Rubloff, it's a big name, to try to get in contact with Harold and they must have spent months and months and months, or at least a month or so trying to get a meeting with Harold and no one even told me they were trying so finally because now he's going to Mayor, so get rid of this little kid, move him on to the side, we need to have real direct with this guy, that always, so they couldn't get the meeting, so finally they come to me, you think you can get us to see Harold, this was on a Tuesday, well, we were in to see Harold by Thursday that same week and so in front of me and everybody else, the guys, all the big time, all the big honchos in Chicago real estate, the big guys, were in the room and they asked, what's the best way to communicate with Harold, and he looked over at me and he pointed at me and he says, you see that boy, I raised him, he said I raised that boy, politically speaking, he said, why are you asking me that question, you've always used him.  You know, that sort of thing, here's Harold, he could have easily said get rid of the young black kid, you know, Mr. Rubloff, big shots, all you guys, I've been waiting for you guys to come and get me.  No, right out of his mouth, right out of there, that's my guy, I raised him, why are you, for me that was just a great moment.  And moments like that abound with Harold.  So Harold was just, that personality in my life that not only encouraged me, supported me time and again, in earlier times when people asked me to run earlier, he told me to hold off, finish law school, it was he himself who later got me to run. When I did run, it was because, I would never have run if Harold hadn't personally--
Story_ID: 47678
Speaker 1: What was that like, when he asked you?
Speaker 2: It was interesting. In the time, I don't want to get too deep into it, some of the people I'll be talking about are also taking interviews, but Harold [Mayor Harold Washington] had made up his mind that he wanted to see, and there was some contention between how this seat would be filled, who would fill it, and they had to get some agreement with Dorothy Tillman [HistoryMaker], alderman at the time and other people and to make a long story short, the alderman asked me, I had just come out of law school, I said, no, I'm not really thrilled about it, and Grimshaw asked me and one day I'm sitting in a room and we get a call and it's the Mayor, Harold [Mayor Harold Washington], and he said, come on over, I want to cook you breakfast.  I looked over at my wife [Erma Brooks Williams], I guess I'm going to run for State Rep, I know what's going to happen now.  I went over there and he said, Paul, you're going to solve the problem, for me, if you'll be willing to do this.  And I said fine.  So in many ways he, it just, I just had many instances where he personally helped me.  I looked at him as a real mentor, a real friend, a real person that really gave me comfort around there and I knew him at a time when it was comfortable to know him.  I knew him before he was Mayor, I knew like I said, before he was a Congressman, even before he was a state senator, even when he was a state rep and it was easy to, there was a lot of people, and it was access and I got a lot of personal time with him.
Story_ID: 47679
Speaker 1: What was he like from a personal [unclear]--
Speaker 2: It was really a shock.  I remember driving down the expressway and heard the news.  And you know, I was an elected official so we all started getting calls, hey, 'cause we were supposed to be going to the National Conference of Black State Legislators like a day or so, he died the day before Thanksgiving and I was supposed to leave the day after, everybody had to cancel all those plans because the Mayor [Mayor Harold Washington] had died and all kinds of things were going on.  So personally he was just, to me he was just one of the most genuine persons I'd ever met.  There was not much fake in Harold.  Harold couldn't fake it.  Now don't get me wrong, Harold could politic with the best of them.  He could be shrewd, he would tell you what you wanted to hear, he could do this, he could do that, and he could jive a lot of folks, but at the same time in his heart, you could not, you could never, ever mistake his commitment, his love of politics and his commitment to the African American community.  It was never in question.
Story_ID: 47680
Speaker 1: What was it like working with Cecil Partee?
Speaker 2: Cecil Partee was just a brilliant person.  He was an eloquent spokesman, the difference between, let me see--Harold [Mayor Harold Washington] was like, both of them were brilliant.  I remember, I could give Harold a paper I'd worked on for months and he could read it in two seconds and seemed to know it all.  Partee was sort of like, Harold was rough and Partee was smooth.  They both used words that nobody understood or knew, such huge words, and they both were eloquent speakers.  Partee was more--and very very, very positive light about Partee.  Partee did a lot of things because at that time we were into the blackness of it all, you can't be part of the Machine and all that stuff.  He made a lot of things happen that people were not aware of.  They probably wouldn't have any--probably wouldn't have had a Kennedy-King and it certainly wouldn't have been furnished and all types of things.  And people just, to some extent, Harold himself would not have evolved up the ladder if it weren't for Partee.  Partee cast the crucial vote amongst the committeemen that made Harold the state senator and state rep.  There were all types of things because as much as they had disagreements, because I was involved and knew a lot of that, amongst themselves in some political ways, Partee always admired intelligence and he knew that Harold was intelligent.
Story_ID: 47681
Speaker 1: Now you were fortunate enough to be brought along by some really special men, politicians, special persons.  Have you identified anyone you want to bring along like this, to mentor?
Speaker 2: To some extent I think there are, I won't say I've identified, but I've worked with guys who I think to this day, both in what I used to do and what I'm doing. I've worked with them, and I'm still here, I've got myself, so I don't know which stage you get to be--stop being up and coming and start being somebody to bring someone else. I can say, it sounds funny, I do, as I say, I'm a lawyer and I lobby now. A lot of guys who--I spend as much time with somebody because I have an opportunity to work with young legislators as they come along whether they be young in age, or most are young and inexperienced, I have an opportunity to be able to work with a lot of guys now both young and old who when they're getting their feet wet in the process, I'm able to try to give them directions to help them stay afloat in that process and to that extent, whether I've identified them or not, I've worked with them and I feel a part of it. I feel really particularly proud of my early work and when I first hit Springfield [Illinois] I think the legislative black caucus was very, very loose.  I feel proud about writing the rules for that, going through the process of making sure that we raised funds and that we did things that made us an entity and trying to make us recognized that after all of my years as a, as just working around there that we had to be a cohesive voting block on at least those things that were important if we were going to have an impact on this whole process and once in a while we had to play around with things to give us negotiating power.  Those sort of things I feel good about and as far as mentees today, I would think, a lot of young [unclear] be surprised, I've got another sort of--if anything, people think of me now as a lobbyist, less of a legislator, so I find a lot of young guys, the guys trying to transition out of those staff positions and other things which can be great to get into as an African American or as anybody but sometime hard to get out of, meaning you kind of, once you're there you're stuck there.  It's good for them to do that on the public payroll, they're making sure, but how do you transform this into something more.  There are a lot of young guys that I'm doing that with, trying to help them to understand how to do it or give them whatever advice I can.
Story_ID: 47682
Speaker 1: What would you say to young people, middle and high school, when they're starting a civics classes, what do you think is the way to get them to be more aware of the state legislative process and how important state legislators are?
Speaker 2: That's a tough question in a sense of I do some of this mentoring, you speak in schools and things, and you notice a certain amount of disinterest in all this stuff amongst young people. I think it's just a matter of realizing its impact on your own day to day life, the fact that in many instances, especially from a Chicagoan's perspective, the only real office is alderman.  You're the mayor or the alderman or a junior politician, Chicago [Illinois] must be the only place in the world where a person is known to leave Congress to come back to sit on the City Council.  That's absolutely unheard of.  I think Pucinski [Alderman Roman Pucinski] did it here in Chicago.  Those sort of things--I mean, the things that you could talk about with state government is that making people realize that it's really there, that they have a lot of impact on school funding, the rules about schools, to getting your licenses, to getting in the profession that you'd like to get into, to the fact that you know from your criminal laws to everything, a lot of the things that have an impact from day to day takes place in state government and people don't recognize it.  Then you get calls even if it's dealing with a welfare check and everything.  A lot of it goes through state government.  How do you get people to be aware of it?  It's difficult and it's difficult only because of the fact that there's just little interest.  In other words, if people can't, I call it get their garbage done, that's important.  If I were to just say anything, it would to just make people to understand even more so than government, is the importance of government and politics in general on their lives.  The fact is that a lot of the things we'd like to consider ourselves, in going back, any interaction between two people is a certain polity, it is called, and when you expand it out the reality of it all is that the breadth and the full impact and enjoyment of your life is going to be impacted by these things, and some extent you, I just, what I really ask people to say is, don't be, not pacifists, but don't be always on for the right.  Sometimes you've got to try to drive this train. You know what I'm saying?  In other words, everybody has a goal, everybody has--human nature says, let Mikie try it, the old commercial, I don't know if it tastes good, let Mikie try it.  Sometimes you've got to try it and that's what I would say to people, taste life, flavor it, go for it, don't always wait for someone to bring it to you, don't wait for the next guy to get involved and you fall behind, once in a while grab a piece of it and taste it for yourself.
Story_ID: 47683
Speaker 1: I know you're still young and this may be a little early to ask you this, but up to this point, how do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what's important to you?
Speaker 2: I feel good about attaining certain goals, both financial and other things.  I also feel guilty in some sense about, being honest about it is, I feel guilty about, sometimes about, leaving public life in the sense that at the time there were people who looked at me as being a potential, comer, I was real close to Harold [Mayor Harold Washington].  There was an article, another article, that even mentioned me as a successor to the Mayor and other things of that nature. And when I actually lost my election after a re-map in the primary, and I won't call myself bitter, 'cause that's not the word, but it was a matter of saying, there's almost a little bit of bitterness saying, oh I did all these things, white guys saying, if I'd have done that, I'd have been elected for life, and nobody even knows you in the community kind of deal, you kinda--and I'm saying that I can send everybody's kids to college but mine because I can't afford it so in some ways I feel guilty because I went out and got into the commercial world because it's--for the financial and everything else and trying to make things elsewhere.  So I'm satisfied with my life, I feel good about the time that I did spend in public service.  Sometimes I have a feeling that I had a responsibility because we all as African Americans, feel we had a responsibility to our people to have gotten more involved and gotten back into the mix instead of being, now I'm more or less the sideline, backroom player that helps a lot.  I spent a lot of time helping guys but I don't ask for advertisement for it.  I basically, I've told a lot of people, I remember once, some people try to come up and interview me again for--that's why it took me a while to get here, and I tell them no, don't interview me, interview that guy, interview that guy, keep me out of the limelight if you can help it, let me be in the background and do what I need to do.  Sometimes I feel bad because as I talk about step up and take that bite but I also feel, not disappointed about it, because there are not many African Americans that do what I do and I try to tell people, I says, you know, sometimes, whether you recognize it or not, I have, and this sounds real braggadocios, but I have a lot of influence on issues.  Right now, I probably have more impact on a lot of issues, larger issues, issues that aren't necessarily defined as African American, like the Electric Utility re-write, things of that nature, but that has a huge impact on everything, so I still feel that I have the ability to impact on things but I've just somewhat lost that banner as a spokesman for our people.
Story_ID: 47684
Speaker 1: How many African American lobbyists, just a rough idea [unclear] in the state [simultaneous]--
Speaker 2: Well, probably registered, registered as lobbyists, probably thirty-something. The type that actually do it on a regular basis?  Oh, it's probably a handful of us, ten, fifteen maybe, who actually do it on a regular basis.  At it may be a few more, I mean, I'm just saying.  And it depends on, and there may be a few more as I really think about it, actually, there are some more because there are a number of people who do it.  And I guess I think about the guys who dibble and dabble, the liaisons for government agencies, and that type of lobbying, most of them, a lot of them are in-house, meaning they're with the company.  There's just a real handful of independents like myself, me, Billie Paige, probably Jean Barnes, you get hard pressed, when you get past there. You've got Letitia [Dewith-Anderson] coming along, she used to work for me, now she's on her own.  And I've got a young lady now working for me, there's another guy that I'm, he's presently talking to be about trying to become, so that's another way of doing things.  In other words, that in and of itself, is something that we've not done and we've kind of sat back and realized that these people have a lot of influence and a lot of say on issues and we're not there.  And in some instances when you're dealing with these large corporations you have to, you can't ignore a block of African American voters or anything and I'm saying, and not only African American voters but legislators and the impact of what they're doing has on these communities so you do have an ability to shape things that impact on our community.
Story_ID: 47685
Speaker 1: Do you like lobbying?
Speaker 2: That's what I do, yes.  I enjoy the legislative process.  I mean, I've been involved with it as, almost, as I tell people, my entire adult life and I enjoy it, like a game of chess.
Speaker 1: You don't ever see yourself going back into public political life?
Speaker 2: I don't say no, I just don't, even like with the first time, I never jumped up and said I wanted to run for office.  I kind of got strung along and one day I was asked to run and I said yes.  I don't see myself personally jumping up, throwing my hat in the ring but under certain circumstances, depending on the office, I don't necessarily see myself being a state legislator again.  I mean, if I could be Mayor of the City of Chicago, of course I would love that opportunity to shape this city, to have an opportunity to be an example, a role model, to bring back that pride I saw in young African Americans under Harold [Mayor Harold Washington] and even Sawyer [Mayor Eugene Sawyer, HistoryMaker], state's attorney, I'm too liberal, they'd never elect me.  But that sort of thing, attorney general, if one of those kind of offices came up, it's just like, I'll give you an example, your present assessor, he's a white guy, Jim Houlihan [Assessor James M. Houlihan] the same thing.  Jim was a state legislator, became a lobbyist, and we always talked, Jim's a nice guy.  And one day he got called back to be assessor.  Now Jim's making a ton of dough as a lobbyist, being an assessor he probably makes less money but he was always wanting public service and it was the right thing at the right time.  So if the right thing at the right time comes along, I would involve myself, for the right cause and for the right person.  If there were certain people who got in office, whether it be electoral office, but for certain people, if they were to ask me to do certain things that would involve public service, I would give it very serious thought.
Story_ID: 47686
Speaker 1: And public service is very hard on families.  Tell me a little bit about your wife [Erma Brooks Williams] and daughter.
Speaker 2: Well I--and that's right.  I met my wife, actually my wife is halfway as political as I was, I met my wife when I was working over in the Senate and she was working in the Senate also.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Erma Brooks, Erma Brooks Williams now.  She was there, she worked for the Senate under Tommy Hynes [Senator Thomas Hynes] and then later for Roland Burris [HistoryMaker] when he was the comptroller.  And when we got married she was a Madigan [Representative Michael J. Madigan] staffer, at the time when we got married, and then later when she came to Chicago [Illinois] she served on Harold's [Mayor Harold Washington] congressional staff, and then was on Charlie Hayes' [Representative Charles Hayes, HistoryMaker] congressional staff before at some point we made a decision that we don't both need to wake up crying on election day so one of us needs to exit politics and she got into education and is now completing her doctorate and she is a special--she does the, she is sort of like the person in charge of the Board of Trustees at Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois] and Special Assistant to the President dealing with certain governmental issues.  So we have similar background and similar issues and things.  I mean, there are lot of guys like, when she was over in the Senate, she was "Harold's special person" and Newhouse's [Senator Richard Newhouse], people like that, all this--Dawn Clark Netsch just loved her, you know, that kind of thing.  In fact, they warned her against marrying me and that sort of thing [laughter].  But we have two daughters, both are just as lovely as they can be to me, and bright and encouraging.  I think the thing that probably gives me--and it sounds strange [unclear], because I grew up in a female household, the only male except for my father and I'm, that again, the thing about it probably that gives me the most concern going forward is looking at their lives and, looking at this society, is making sure that I teach them how to be self-sufficient. So that they're not, as I tell them, that's another one of those great quotes coming from a teacher of mine who, going back it says, when it came to relationships with people, always be in a relationship because you want to be there, and not because you feel that you need to be there.  In other words, I'm with you not because I need you, not because you pay my bills, not because you do this or do that, but because I want to be.  And that's one of the things I'd like to put them in a position that whatever relationships they're in in life, it's because they want to be.
Story_ID: 47687
Speaker 1: She understands it, but I know with her and my mother [Sarah Williams], she understands it, and has been around politicians and politics most of her life, I think my mother was not thrilled with my being a politician only because of the people, you don't necessarily want them to be picking on your son.  I think my wife [Erma Brooks Williams] would be an ally in the sense that she knows what it's like.  Whether she'd be thrilled about me getting back into politics, I'm not sure about that at all.  But I've--I enjoy politics.  I enjoy being a part, and I'm particularly proud of some things I was able to do when I was in politics, I really am.
Speaker 2: Governorship?
Speaker 1: I don't think about those things because, put it this way, I look at it, there are a lot of capable people and the one thing that I do take criticism for that I probably goes back to my saying is that I'm willing to serve, but I'm probably considered not willing to fight enough for it.  By that I'm saying, it was like hey, if you want me, I'll do it, if you don't want me, that's good too.  I'm not going to, put it like this, there are guys who are just itching and itching and itching and that's all they live for, and that's all they want to do.  If I do it, and it really sounds self-serving, it would be because somebody figured I can serve, I can help, we really need this at this time and this is the guy that has the ability to do it, not I wake up in the bed and say, God, I really have to be that.  And that's the difference.  It's not that, I don't know if I have the drive, that's what they say, for some of those, 'cause campaigns could be brutal.
Speaker 2: [Unclear] You have the drive to do the job but in the meantime you'll take the beating [simultaneous]--
Speaker 1: Right, exactly. Well that's the same thing. It goes back to it was just like when I was in politics, like I said I always told myself I was a great legislator and a poor politician.  In other words, I would sit up and we'd be giving speeches, and I'd tell people, the guy, my opponent, he'd be promising the world, not only I won't, but he can't do all that stuff that he just talked about.  And I go down, and I used to have a favorite slogan.  I used to go through--I'd say, look, I had a guy came up to me once and he started talking about, Mr. Williams, I want to do this and I want to do that, and I went through the list of things and I said, look, you want me to do it for you. I said, if you want me to do that, do you have a list of exactly what it takes to be that?  I said, now let's sit down, I was in front of the audience, let's draw up a list, you've got to go to this, you've got to go to that, I went through about ten, twenty. I said, are you willing to do A, B, C?  I said, when you get to down to here, it's at that point when you need me. But you can't come to me now, so I'm basically saying, I'm willing to walk with you, I'm willing to make you understand what it takes to be there, I'm willing to help you but you've got to do it.  So those kind of things. But I do have--like I say, I was a great, but I was very blunt and I was very--and I also tell people, if I've got to lie to keep this office, you take the office, I don't need to lie to you, I don't need to sugarcoat it because I'm not helping you, I'm not helping our people by telling us things are great when I know they're not, I'm not helping you by telling you if you vote for me I'm going to give you everything.  And that's one of the things that I, one of the problems that I even had, as much as I am a politician or political person, I'm cynical about politics.  I've also learned, I remember when we were talking about mentoring legislators, one time I pulled over one legislator and I said, I'm going to tell you something, guy, you'll do great down here as long as you don't believe that salvation is under that dome, you know what I'm saying? You've got to understand that there's a role that it plays in our lives.  It is not the role, it's part of your spiritual and all of it that in [unclear], we've got to make possible for those that have that drive to succeed.  I can't--if you don't have that drive I can't put it in you and that's part of what I believe is that I want to be, even now I often believe that that's not the only contribution a person can make, I can make a contribution. I'm trying to develop property a little bit, that might be a contribution, I'm trying to just do things, I do all types of free stuff for people, that's just contributions that I make to my community. If politics is that highest contribution then I might be willing to do that.

Speaker 1: [TAPE INTERRUPTED]
Speaker 2: --I don't know where it goes, you know. There are some things that--I mean, I'm proud of my legislative record, I really am.  I have two or three things I'm still doing it, can I mention it now?
Speaker 1: Oh, of course.
Speaker 2: That I accomplished, I think, while I was a legislator that I really feel good about.  One was as I stated, it wasn't a legislative thing but it was an administrative thing, it was kind of helping to restructure the caucus at the time when I got there.  Legislatively I'm proud of the fact that
Speaker 1: [OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: Well I was credited for saving the, or making sure that they did, they kept funding the school based clinics and that one of them was in my district and we thought they were by the way and those statement said, they said I singlehandedly done that, I remember that the bill that they talked about was called the Home Equity Bill, in which I was able to get it changed and I took the floor. I remember it was funny, a guy, Senator [John] Cullerton, he's still a senator now. At the time he was a rep, a Madigan [Representative Michael J. Madigan] spokesman, he told me I was a freshman, that if we were to, that they were going to ram this bill down my throat and they didn't care what I thought about it, and he said, you might be able to get the sixteen blacks to vote so it'd be 104, and when it was over with they barely passed the bill by one vote.  Even Madigan himself told him, yall better lay off because Williams might win and I'm a freshman, you know I kept the floor for three hours by myself, no one--and it became clear that I knew more about the issue than anybody on their staff, 'cause I--those kind of things I was particularly proud, and the way they reshaped that bill, and the one real, I mean had a number of legislative proposals, I sponsored the independent public defender's office here in Cook County [Illinois] moved it out of, given its own authority and its own budget and things, it was mixed in with the State's Attorney's office which was a strange way for it to be done and rewrote the, sponsor and recodification of the Title Insurance Act but the jewel of my legislative career was being the sponsor of judicial subcircuits, myself and Representative Anthony Young [HistoryMaker] who is now a judge along with Senator Miguel Devalier.  That started out when we actually brought a lawsuit. It was Williams v. State Board of Elections against the Illinois Supreme Court, Cook County Bar, I mean not Cook County, but Chicago [Illinois], how we elected judges in Cook County and to be able to do that, I mean everybody in the world told us it would be absolutely impossible, we would never be able to do it and to put together actually a coalition of blacks and Republicans that lifted the bill through and into actual law and to feel that there are now probably double, we've doubled since the passage of the law, we've more than doubled the number of black judges here in Cook County, and that was a particularly proud moment for me.
Story_ID: 47689
Speaker 1: That's wonderful. Now tell me kind of the most fun thing of your legislative career, just something that stands out as just plain old-fashioned funny or fun.
Speaker 2: We had, I mean just the sort of camaraderie, the strange stories and things that went on. I mean it's hard to pinpoint a moment, but if I were to sum it up it would be the personal relationships that you have with people or, it's just like you learn and you know things about people from Senator [Carol Moseley] Braun [HistoryMaker] who I served with to the judges and everything. And you can sit there and sometimes you can see them on TV in all of their pomp and circumstance, and you just kind of smile, and you say, I really know this guy, he looks good, but I know how he is.  There are just, I mean you think about the embarrassing moments when people try to trick you in the legislature for fun, like they've got this ritual that they do all the time in the legislature, particularly the married men. What they do is, they send you a note and you're sitting there on the floor and they will send you a note saying, so-and-so, there's some gorgeous woman looking at you from the gallery, please come up and meet me.  So you're standing up in the gallery, and you're looking all around and somebody from the floor comes on, hey Paul, and you're sitting there all exposed, feeling stupid.  Those kind of little things you remember being done.  But I do have something that comes to my mind.  It really was, it's sort of a cute story surrounding a serious topic.  It was the passage of, at that time, the surcharge, which was really the first real increase in taxes for schools and local governments in Illinois since they'd enacted the income tax.  Well the story goes that I had been picked as the sponsor, and I'd--we had just voted for school reform and I went to Madigan [Representative Michael J. Madigan], I said we have to have a vote on taxes.  Madigan had never wanted to do this.  So out of the blue one day up comes the bill, he says Paul ought to be the sponsor, I found out I'd be sponsoring it and we eventually passed the thing but I'm thinking, oh, all along I've got this thing going and I really found out, this was a good example, Madigan, he'd figured out that I was the one person he could give the bill to, or could hand the bill, he didn't give it to me, he found a way for me to end up with it, I didn't know he had given it, it had been put in my name, he could honestly look at his Democratic members and tell them, because I was a Democrat, that he had no ability to talk me out of it because I was just that bullheaded and stubborn.  But in reality it was all his plan to get his members ready to take his vote and the last minute he switched that bill and passed that thing and [unclear].  He was able to pass a tax increase without promising anybody anything and I was a key part of the plan but didn't know about it and halfway through it I'm sitting there with the Majority Leader looking at me, as we were passing it, and I said, Jim, this was a setup from day one.  He started smiling because I came to realize that only he, Madigan and one staffer, and the staffer didn't know till it until two days before, he and Madigan had this whole plan going way back for months and it progressed and I was saying, just the fact that, it's a real testament to Madigan, how he was able to use people's own, how he knew they would act without asking them to do it, to advance the cause to a certain point.  I just felt good because at the end of it at least, as I'd like to say, at least I came out of the matrix.  I was able to figure out the matrix.  I was in it, but I didn't know it.  I just starting thinking, wait a minute, I've been here all these years, there has never been a revenue bill called and now all of a sudden one ends up in my name, and this thing, and all of a sudden the night before Madigan does this, and Madigan does that, and he jams the governor this way and I'm saying, wait a minute, this is no accident, and I didn't make this happen.  And I'm trying to figure out, how was the dupe.  It was sort of fun.  I was the dupe for a good cause.  But that was a fun thing for me when I realized it and I was just happy because I was able to figure it out.

Speaker 1: Okay, that's great, that's great. Okay, well I guess I'll just close it with is there anything I should have asked you that I didn't?
Speaker 2: I don't really know.  You asked quite a few questions.  I think the only thing that I would like to say is that I've been blessed.  I feel that I don't necessarily consider myself to have any special upbringing, any special talents that anyone else can't have but I've been blessed.  I've been in the right places, right time, I've had good people taught me, we were talking about Lewis A. H. Caldwell [State Representative Lewis A. H. Caldwell]. He used to, he was--actually he and Harold Washington used to ride back and forth together and he was my cousin, a far distant cousin, I didn't know Louis, but I knew who he was because he was a legend in our family, we had this Louis.  And he didn't even claim me even though he knew I was coming down until after I did good. He said he wasn't going to tell anybody I was his cousin until he found out if I could hang. But I just, just the ability to have worked with people of that nature, people who were involved with the creation, like with Lewis, he was one of the first founders of the Alpha fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], a graduate Northwestern in '32 [1932], wrote the policy back then, talking about the internal things, was involved with this key legislation and doing things and to just have these kind of individuals to have had a hand in molding me and shaping me and being around me, I think the one thing I really remember was, I was a street kid, in a sense, I had made my money giving parties and doing things the fast and easy way with this, that and the other, and all of a sudden I went to Springfield [Illinois], and I said, this is real money, we're talking billions, not a couple thousand, and if I can only be a part of this and people were willing to support and help, so the only thing I would say is, my part, even my part in doing this is a recognition that somebody has helped me and that if I can just say to anything to anybody who might see this, particularly any young African Americans who might be wondering what is their potential in life, and I guess it the only thing I would say is it's unlimited, it's your dream, but also learn how to be self-satisfied, learn how to love yourself and recognize who you are. And be--don't necessarily, in other words, because I tell people I don't have to have a thousand people bowing me to feel good about me, as I said, I don't need to have a little theme music band following behind me to say, Paul Williams is great, learn how to love yourself, learn how to love this life and learn how to respect yourself and I think that you can be happy.  I always tell people, one of the big definitions in my life is happiness and I've made it up myself, is the ability to take care of me and mine and I know that I can do that and if I can do that then I don't have to have a lot of other people telling me I'm great or doing these things but be honest, be, as I stated, be frank, be straightforward, and work hard, do your best, just do your best, and know that you've done your best, that no matter what the outcome is, you don't sit around and say, I could have done something different or better, I tried my best and it didn't work out but I tried my best.
