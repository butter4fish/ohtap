 Myers, and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is April 27, 2012 and I   m in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma,  meeting at the home of Gene Slocum. I   ll be interviewing Gene today as  part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history series of the Oklahoma  Oral History Research Program. Thank you for meeting with me today,  Gene. Would you tell me a little about your family and what your  childhood was like growing up here in Oklahoma?  I was very fortunate, Joe. I had good Christian parents. They were both  uneducated, but they were the type people I could have patterned my life  after them and done just fine. My parents had three boys, three sons. My  dad came from a very abusive background and he never dealt with it.  We never had a father-son relationship. But when my dad passed, the  pastor asked me, he said,    Was there anything special about your  father?    I said,    Well, I never had a good relationship with him as far as  a father-son relationship. But one thing I knew is my dad loved me. He  was a great man.    My mom was the same way. She was very strict. In  fact, when I was about sixty, she asked me to forgive her for the way she  whipped me and everything. I said,    No. I   m the man I am today  because of you and Dad, the way you raised me in a strict, disciplined  background.    So, great, great parents.  All right. So you had two brothers, as well?  I had two brothers.  What were their names?  My older brother   s name is Don, and my younger brother   s name was  Ralph. He died when he was about forty-nine from   they did a biopsy  and the doctor said there were so many things wrong with him, they  couldn   t pinpoint anything. That was a real loss to me, Joe, because he  5  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  was my best friend.  I   m sure. So you grew up around the Tulsa area, here?  I was born in Bartlesville, 1931. We lived there until 1947,    48 and then  my parents moved to Tulsa, so we came down here with them.  I   m actually very familiar with the Bartlesville area. That   s where I  grew up.  Oh, are you?  Yes. (Laughs) So you were in Bartlesville. Did your father work for  Phillips Petroleum up there?  No, he worked for the newspaper, The Examiner     The Examiner Enterprise.  Enterprise, right. (Laughs) So you know about it.  I do.  Yes, he was a foreman there. One reason he left is after the Second War,  they were taking advantage of veterans. Using them until   with the GI  Bill, what they did is work the salary. They started them at a low salary  and eventually, when he gets to the top pay, then they   d get rid of him  and get two more veterans and start all over. My dad couldn   t work like  that so he came down to Tulsa and worked for the Tulsa World until he  retired at sixty-seven. He was a very shy, quiet, introverted man. They  always wanted him to be the foreman. He wouldn   t do it because he  valued his friends more than the position. Because a lot of times, if  you   re the head man, people resent you.  That   s very true. So you went to elementary school up in Bartlesville?  I went through the seventh grade.  Do you remember what school that was up there?  Jefferson Grade School. We lived at Fourth and Shawnee, right by the  old courthouse. Right down Fourth Street was a little grade school called  Jefferson. I can remember to this day that every morning, we   d go out  and raise the flag and do the    Pledge of Allegiance,    and all that. I am  not a fighting person, but for some reason, in grade school I had one  friend that every time we saw each other, we fought. His name was  6  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Glenny Denny. (Laughter) I always said,    With a name like that, you   ve  got to be a fighter.    Back then, the playground was just still red dirt. I  can still see the principal, Mr. Munsy. He   d come out there and take  both of us in his office. That   s back when they could paddle you. He   d  paddle us, and I had no problem with that. After you got your whipping,  then you had to stand in the hallway underneath the old clock.  Everybody knew, if you were standing there in the hallway, you   d been  bad. That   s the thing that bothered me.  But I enjoyed   well, no. Actually, my first day of school, first grade, I  go to school and after recess I came home. My mom says,    What are  you doing home already?    I said,    I don   t like school.    (Laughter) It   s  like I formed a mental block that I didn   t like school. So, my twelve  years of school were rough for me because I just had that mental thing. I  figured,    I don   t need history. I don   t need math,    so on and so forth.  Because I knew that I was going to go into the printing business like my  dad. I didn   t need all that stuff. Of course, I regretted the fact that I  didn   t really apply myself in school. But then when I did graduate from  Will Rogers, came back from the marine corps, I did go back for  business school in a few subjects like that.  So you moved to Tulsa when you were in the seventh grade? You and  your family.  Let   s see. It wasn   t the seventh, it was a little after that. The last two  years I did here in Tulsa.  So you were in junior high in Bartlesville, still?  Yes.  Was that at Central?  Central, yes. You know Bartlesville, don   t you?  I do. I went to Central, myself.  When I was just a little fellow, Frank Phillips was Uncle Frank to all the  kids. We couldn   t wait until Christmas, because it was during the  Depression. And every Christmas, he   d throw a big Christmas party for  all the kids. He   d give you this sack full of candy and an apple and  ribbon candy, such as that, with a dollar bill. Now, back in the    30s, that  was a lot of money.  What do you think the comparable amount would be today?  7  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Oh, my goodness. I tell my grandkids, when I was growing up as a little  boy, you could buy a hamburger for five cents, but nobody had five  cents. Yes, a dollar bill was     So it was like a hundred dollars.  Even with Frank Phillips, see, he was a millionaire. We thought that was  something else. Now, today, millionaires are a dime a dozen.  His home is right down the street from Central.  Yes. I   ve been through it several times. In fact, he used to brag about he  was the only millionaire that had a millionaire for a chauffeur. He had  this little Chinese guy that lived in the house, there. We went through his  room and everything. Of course, Frank Phillips, he knew all the people  and how to invest money and everything, so his little chauffeur did the  same thing and became a millionaire, driving a millionaire around.  (Laughter)  So you went from Central   did you attend what would have been  College High, back then?  Let   s see, I came from Central to Tulsa and went to Will Rogers. Now,  in Bartlesville, there wasn   t that much to do when I was a little boy, and  even starting into high school there wasn   t that much to do. When I  came here, I got involved in the sports. In Bartlesville, in seventh or  eighth grade, I went out for football. I weighed 115 pounds, played on  the line and liked to have killed me. (Laughter) My mom kept trying to  make me quit. I said,    No, I   m going to finish this season, but I   ll never  do it again.    Came here and I got involved in track and swimming.  Loved to swim. Learned how to swim in the Caney River.  Oh, no kidding.  Yes. Back then, you   re talking in the    30s, your disposal, sewage and  everything, they just dumped it back in the river. We used to go down  this little island, we called Skunk Island. You had to swim like this  because of all the sewage coming back into the river. (Gestures) But yes,  I had a great childhood. Then I came to Tulsa and like I said, got  involved in sports, and I got involved in pole vaulting. Back then, pole  vaulting, you don   t have this fiber pole. It was a bamboo pole, stick.  (Laughs) We were up around eleven, twelve feet, which was pretty high,  then. You didn   t land on a bunch of sponge rubber. You landed in the  red dirt. But my coach told me,    If I could have had you earlier, you  could have done real good.     8  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Then I got involved in swimming. As far as speed, I was short, short  legs. I had no speed as far as swimming. But, I got involved in diving,  and I really enjoyed it. I taught swimming for a while, just really  enjoyed it. So my last years of school, I enjoyed it. But intellectually, I  just didn   t have it. In fact, my senior year, my history teacher told me,  she said,    I will give you a passing grade simply because you tried.    I  said,    Well, thank you, lady.     That   s awfully nice of her to do that.  Oh, excellent. (Laughter)  You graduated from  Will  Rogers High School at eighteen. What kind  of work did you do before you entered the service?  Actually, I mowed yards, just did a few things like that. But when I  graduated from high school, I went to work at Zales Jewelry. My older  brother, Don, was working there and he got me a job. I was engraving  jewelry. The Korean War broke out. A bunch of us kids that just  graduated from high school, we thought,    Well, we   ll join the marine  corps reserve and wear that uniform and get all the girls.    But it didn   t  work because there were no girls at Camp Pendleton. (Laughter) But  here I am working for Zales and when they called in our unit, I was  fixing to leave on my last day. My boss came to me and said,    I   ve got  one more job for you.    He handed me an identification bracelet. He said,     Put your name on it.    So, I carried that all through Korea and had it for  a long time.  Wow. So, what year did you graduate from Rogers, I should ask?  Nineteen fifty.  Nineteen fifty, so you were done in May of 1950 and then went to work  for Zales, and then you just immediately joined the marine reserves as  well?  Walked right into the corps.  And then the war kicked off in June?  It was June. I think it started in June. I had only been in the reserve for  three months. So, they put us on a troop train and took us out to Camp  Pendleton. We   d wake up in the morning on the troop train and the guy  would come around, you   d order off the menu. We   d pull into a big city  and, boy, they   d march us into the nicest hotels, feed us a big meal and  everything. I thought,    Man, this corps is going to be all right.    Then we  9  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  got to Camp Pendleton. (Laughter)  Things changed.  It was different, yes. Then here, when we met at the armory for a  meeting, when they called off your name   my full name is Otis Eugene,  and they   d call my name,    Slocum     We always answered,    Yo     Camp  Pendleton, we got there at ten, eleven o   clock at night. I go to bed at  nine o   clock, but I get up at five. So, we   re standing out in front of this  old barracks in pitch black and they called off my name. I said,    Yo      That officer came by, the DI  Drill Instructor  came and got right face-to-  face with me and he said,    What did you say?    I said,    Yo        What  did you say?    I said,    Here, sir.    He said,    From now on, it   s    Here,  sir.        So, like I tell people, I didn   t have any problem in the corps as far as  obeying orders because my mother was like a DI. When she said it once,  she didn   t say it twice. You just did what you were told. So, I guess it  was about eleven o   clock at night, our DI stomped out of the room.  Several of us, we were tired. We were going to go to bed. So, we go to  bed, turn off the lights. DI comes back in, flips the lights back on and  says,    What have I got, a bunch of sleeping beauties?     That   s when we  learned to go to bed by the numbers. You stand at the foot of your bed at  attention. Then he hollers,    One,    and you go to the side of your bed,  and then    Two,    and,    Three,    and so on, and you lay down.    Are you  asleep?    You say,    No, sir.       All right, you do it again,    and this time  you don   t answer him.    Okay, you ignore me. You   re not obeying  orders.     So, either way, you were wrong. So, I began to think,    Man, this corps  is not what I thought it was going to be.    We finally did go to bed at  about three o   clock in the morning. I remember, I hear these guys  outside singing   what was the song? It was Goodnight, Irene. That was  a very popular song. I thought,    Three o   clock in the morning? What are  they doing out there singing at three o   clock in the morning?    Well, I  found out a few nights later. I was out there singing Goodnight Irene.  (Laughter) I learned real quick, just do what you   re told.  Was that a formal boot camp for you when you went to Pendleton?  Exactly. I mean, it was a very, very strict boot camp. They have eased  up a lot. It was pretty rough back then.  What was the roughest part of the boot camp for you?  Oh, I   d say most of it. I was in good shape, physically, and I was used to  10  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  the discipline and everything. But as short as I was, they always put the  short guys at the back of the platoon. We   re trying to stay up with the  tall guys up front, and it just   man, it would just push you for all it   s  worth.  When you   re marching or jogging? That sort of thing?  Marching, jogging, any of it. It was rough. But I came from a very  disciplined background, which helped me through boot camp. There was  over 300 of us in the reserve unit, here. When we get to Camp  Pendleton, we were out there three months before we did much of  anything. Then they finally called us out there one day and they said,     Everyone from a corporal on up, get in this group over here. You  private guys, get over here.    I had just been in for a few months. We say,     What happens to us?    They said,    Well, you go to boot camp for  twelve weeks.    We said,    How about the other guys?    I   ll never forget,  the officer said,    God only knows.    A lot of those marines, they learned  to load and shoot their rifle at a barrel behind the ship, troop ship, as  they were going across. So many of those guys came back in body bags  because they had no training.  My goodness. When did you finish up boot camp?  It was twelve weeks later.  So that would have been     Oh, let   s see.  October?  Well, it seems like   we   re talking sixty-something years ago   seems  like after we finished boot camp, a lot of the equipment and everything  had been greased and stored away from the Second War. It seems like  they kept us there several weeks cleaning up barracks and had a grease  or something they coated everything with. We had to clean all that stuff  off and everything.  Cosmoline?  Cosmoline  Yes. Exactly. (Laughs) So, we spent some time cleaning up.  I don   t remember the exact month or date that I went to Korea. But I  remember on this troop ship there were five thousand marines. They  took six of us and put us on the ship several days prior to the rest of  them coming on, so we could learn the areas of the ship and help direct  the other guys. We were, I think, something like twenty-one days going  11  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  over on that ship. I didn   t mind that. I had a good time.  So three weeks later, did you end up at Kobe, Japan, initially?  We went to   I think our first stop was Yokosuka, Japan, the naval base,  there. Then we went to Kobe. We get to Yokosuka, there, and they give  us base liberty. We   re going to Korea in a couple days and get ourselves  shot at. Base liberty? Here, I was a nice guy, I stayed on base. A lot of  the guys, man, they just tore the fence down and went into town because  what have you got to lose? Then we went up to Kobe the next day. I told  my buddies, I said,    Man, I can   t wait to go to a Japanese restaurant,  have a Japanese meal, and really enjoy it.    So, we go to Kobe, go  ashore, go to the restaurant there, and they were serving hamburgers and  singing a country western song. (Laughter) So, I never did have my  Japanese meal.  Oh, no  (Laughs) How long were you at Kobe?  Just overnight.  Then from there, did you move out to Inchon?  You have to understand, Joe, combat messed me up so much. When I  left the naval hospital in Corpus Christi, I put all that behind me. I don   t  remember battles, I don   t remember towns, villages, nothing. I just put it  behind me. A lot of the guys, they can tell you every hill, every battle,  every town. I just didn   t want to deal with it.  Sure, I understand that. So you head out from Kobe. I know from the  historical record that the initial push was the left hook into Inchon.  From there, US troops, along with UN forces, were moving towards  Seoul. Now, you were a part of that push?  I remember I got there two months after the Chosin Reservoir. So, you  might be able to date it that way.  Okay, so you actually would have come in, probably, and then gone the  other direction, up to the north from there.  I was there eight months and did up and down, up and down the east  coast, right pass the thirty-eighth parallel.  So from the Pusan Perimeter, basically, up and down.  Yes, back and forth.  12  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  My goodness. How did you guys   well, let me ask you this first. Do you  remember the men that you served with?  Yes.  What were their names?  Well, we paired up. What they   d do in the marine corps, may be the  same thing with other services, they don   t want you to have a close  relationship. They keep dividing you. Now, the group that we left from  Tulsa with, I was with very few of those men when we got to Korea. I  was with one in particular, his name was Dean Roberts. He and I, we  pitched our pup tents together and we became like brothers. And another  one, let   s see, his name was Tommy Roberts. Now, again, it   s been so  many years ago, I   ve pretty well forgotten most of them by name.  Another one, Bob Martin, his dad was chief of police in Austin, Texas.  Bob and I, we ended up carrying ammunition for the light .30  machine  guns . As small as I am, carrying all my gear, those two boxes of ammo,  I think they weighed something like twenty-one pounds apiece. I   ll have  to admit, I had a real attitude in Korea. I didn   t want to be there. I don   t  like killing people and being mean and such as that. If we   re going up  the road and we   re not having any resistance, what Bob and I would do,  we   d just lay down and take a nap, because there   s nothing happening.  By the time we caught up with them, we had all the bad duty. First thing  we had to do was dig the slit trench, where you go to the bathroom.  We   re just a couple ornery guys. We   d dig it so wide, the guys could  hardly straddle. Just out of meanness. (Laughter) And KP  Kitchen  Patrol  duty, got used to it. Now, I   ve forgotten a lot of those names.  So it was Dean Roberts, Tommy Roberts, and Bob Martin.  Yes.  When you first joined the marines, what was your military job? Your  MOS  Military Occupational Specialty  that they assigned you?  Infantry. We had no choice.  That   s where everybody was going to, essentially.  You   re going to Korea. You had no choice.  What kind of weapon did you carry over there?  M1. Weighed seventeen pounds. I did real good in boot camp on the  13  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  rifle range. I gave my medals to my son, and he made that case for me.  (Gestures) You know what that wood is? It   s called purple heart.  Oh, no kidding.  That   s purple heart wood. It   s an exotic wood. He put all my medals in  there. The one I got for marksman, I gave it to him because it was  sterling silver. He   d had it appraised and it was fifteen hundred dollars.  So, I just gave him all my original medals and he bought new ones for  me. On the rifle range, oh, man. That M1 had such a kick to it. You   d  come home after the rifle range, your shoulder would just be black and  blue from that thing kicking. It had this steel plate on it and, man, we got  so sore. I would zero in on that and I   d close my eyes,    Bam     But I did  real good.  Those were just paper targets back then? Did you have popup targets at  any point in time?  No, it was stationary. You   d fire your round, and then they   d lift up the  little black circle to show where you hit the target and then you could  adjust according to that.  Okay.  One thing I remember about boot camp is one of the gases they used on  us. I can   t even think of it now   tear gas. Put you in this little building,  and you   ve got your mask on and everything. Then they   d let the tear  gas loose. Then the DI says,    Take off your mask.    Your eyes start  burning and watering and your throat gets sore.    Now, sing the marine  corps hymn.    (Laughter) That   ll give you an attitude, believe me.  Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Do you remember the names of any of your  DIs out there?  No, I don   t.  Any of them come to mind just for their actions or the way they  comported themselves?  Well, the first one   we had two. The first one was just as mean as he  could be. He was a good DI. You never saw him smile. He hollered at  you all the time, right in your face. But the other one, he was just a very  mellow guy. I remember we   d go out on the parade ground there in  Camp Pendleton. For the first time, they call you a marine. They call  you everything but a marine. But then they call you a marine, your chest  swells up and you feel so proud. Then you go back to the barracks and  14  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  the mean DI, he didn   t come in, but the other one that was real mellow,  he sits and visits like we   re good friends. We asked him, said,    What are  you going to do now?    I   ll never forget, he said,    I   ll get another group  of warm bodies.    See, in boot camp, what you   ve got to realize, we   re  kids coming from every different background that you can imagine.  They completely destroy you and make you a unit. It   s one thing about  that, I think one thing that really led me into the marine corps is the  pride. I mean, you just come in and you   re so proud of being a marine.  Something to hang your hat on.  Right. And then of course, during the Second War, we were seven,  eight-years-old, me and my brothers. We   d go down to the Caney River  and play war. Of course, I watched all the John Wayne movies. Man, he  was our hero. I thought,    Man, if I ever go in the military, I   m going to  be a marine.    So, I go in. My two brothers   my older brother, he went  into the seabees. He worked in the laundry and cut hair. And I   m going  over there getting myself shot at. Now, my younger brother, Ralph, he  joined the navy. Man, he wanted to see the world. He was never on a  ship. He ended up in Pensacola, Florida, folding parachutes.  Oh, no.  So I   d called him,    Mom   s little mothball fleet.    (Laughter) He didn   t  see the humor to it.  So he was down there in that white sand area down there at Pensacola.  Right.  Wow. So how did you guys entertain yourselves? Both here in the States  and even once you got over to Korea?  In the States, after boot camp, all the guys, there were three things they  wanted to do: go into San Diego, Oceanside, buy some ribbons, because  you could buy them at the store, get a tattoo, and find a woman to sleep  with. Well, I came from a Christian background. I didn   t want a tattoo. I  didn   t drink. I didn   t want to sleep around. So, I had two buddies. I can   t  think of their   one of them was Bob Martin. I can   t remember the other  one   s name. I would go with them every weekend into San Diego and  those different places, in and out of all the bars. I   d get me a 7UP, put a  little coke or something in it, and it   d look like I was drinking. When  they got so drunk they couldn   t take care of themselves, I   d take them  back to the barracks. They   d get up the next morning,    Oh, Gene. Don   t  ever drink. It   s not worth it.    Of course, the next weekend, they were  doing it again. (Laughter) But I went with them back and forth. That   s  15  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  kind of how I entertained myself. Then on base, of course, in boot camp,  they   ve got every minute of your day tied up.  Sure.  Then after you graduate, we weren   t there for but just a very short time  until we shipped out. But I remember just going out and just walking  around the base, so proud of being a marine.  Do you recall any particularly humorous or unusual event while you  were in the service?  Well, when I went into the service, I didn   t have anyone writing to me. I  hadn   t had that much interest in girls until right before I went into the  marine corps. Then here I am in Camp Pendleton and I told them,    Man,  I   m going to go home on leave and get me some names of girls that I   m  going to write to.    When I came back from boot camp, I had a list of  eighteen girls I was writing to. (Laughs) In Korea   now, see, I didn   t  think I was a good-looking kid. My mother, bless her heart, she beat me  down and I just had no self-esteem at all. As far as she was concerned, I  don   t care how good I did, I didn   t do good enough.    You should have  done this, if you   d have just listened to me.     Like I said, when I was a little boy, she didn   t use a belt. She   d make us  go out and get a switch off a tree, and she would switch me with that.  The reason she apologized to me when I was in my sixties, she said,     When I whipped you, you wouldn   t cry. Then I got mad and I   d beat  you.    That   s what really bothered her. I don   t know why I shared that.  But I go overseas and, of course, you   re in a combat zone. I was kind of  a reserve unit that I was with, so I didn   t go through what the Chosin  Few did. If I   d gone through that, Joe, I think I   d have lost my mind  because as a Christian, I have a compassion to help people. And to go  over there and kill them? It just really tore me up.  I think what bothered me more than anything over there, you   re a crazy  person. You   re a hired killer. You see and do things that you just, today,  it just makes you sick to think of what you did. I was writing to one girl,  I told her, I said,    What do you want me to bring you back from Korea?     She didn   t say anything, I said,    I   ll tell you what. I   ll bring you the  teeth out of a North Korean.    Of course, the Chinese weren   t into you.  We   re over there, this hill had been hit by napalm sometime before we  got there, and I find this skull. It   s still greasy. Both shoes are there with  the feet in. (Cries) I   ve got a picture of it. I pulled those teeth out of that  skull. I look at it now   that was someone   s son. It could have been  someone   s dad. But I thought nothing of it, then. These things come  back to you.  16  Myers  We didn   t take very many prisoners. I remember one we took. He   d  been hit in the throat and these marines were giving him a drink of water  and it   d run back out his throat. They were laughing at it. To me, it  wasn   t funny. (Cries) You stand there and watch him die. Those things,  they don   t go away. When I was in Korea, there was a number of times  that I should have been dead. I remember one time we   d just taken this  hill. It was real rocky soil and everything. I   d dug my foxhole, and it was  just deep enough for me to lay in, because it was so rocky. Dug my  foxhole out and everything, then we get into a firefight. I was literally  chased into my foxhole with a machinegun. Bullets were just hitting all  around me. I remember diving into my foxhole and I thought,    Man,  when this is over with       You   d be surprised how deep I got that  foxhole because I came so close to dying.  I remember being on a tank and we just crossed this creek. Several of us  rode the tank across because we didn   t want to get wet again. We just  got to the other side and hit a tank mine. We thought it was mortars  coming in. I remember jumping off the back of that tank and seeing the  driver. He was just screaming like crazy. He looked like a black man, he  was burned so bad. Of course, we didn   t have black marines with us.  The segregation thing was bad. But you see those things. They   re just  there.  I think one of the things that bothered me more than anything   is the  children. We used to get C-rations most every day. We got these little  children coming up to you, and they   d want the chocolate bar and the  cigarettes. I   d give them the chocolate bar and the cigarettes and some of  the baked beans or whatever because I knew that I   d get another meal in  the next day or so. I remember one little girl, she was probably nine or  ten-years-old, that had been hit in the leg and everything. It was all  festered and infected and everything. To this day, I wonder what  happened to those little children. (Cries) Those are things you just can   t  forget.  I remember one time, we were carrying ammunition going up the side of  this hill, no resistance or anything. We stopped for a break, the machine  gunner that I was carrying ammo for, we   re laying there having our  cigarettes and he was saying,    I was in the Second War. Now, here I   m  in Korea. When I get out of here, I   m getting out of the corps.    We  picked up our gear and we headed about fifty yards up the hill until a  machine gun opened up on us. They got him. Just a young man, young  kids. Those things stick with you and you can   t   I still have nightmares.  Yes. Can you tell me about a couple of your most memorable  experiences, good memorable experiences? We   ll step away from the     17  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Good or bad?  Good or bad. Either, or.  I remember, like I told you, I had an attitude in Korea. For some reason,  the sergeant took a real disliking to me. We carried two canteens and  every time we had inspection, those canteens better be full of water.  Ours were not the plastic, they were the old aluminum and they had that  seam around it. One of my canteens had a leak and I could only carry it  half full of water. I kept telling the sergeant, I said,    I need a new  canteen.    For some reason, my attitude, he wouldn   t give me a new one.  So, we   re going through inspection one time and the officer shakes my  canteen and says,    How come that one is only half full.    I said,    Sir, that  one   s got a leak in it. The sergeant won   t give me a new one.    Well, that  didn   t help my relationship with the sergeant. But I   ve never forgotten  that. Some old silly thing like that. What was your question?  Some of the most memorable things. Some of your most memorable  experiences over there.  Well, back to when I kind of mentioned, at boot camp, when you   re  graduating and they call you a marine, that was one of my highlights.  But in Korea   I   ve always been kind of a happy-go-lucky, joking  person. I don   t care what the situation was, I could laugh about it. We   d  get into a firefight and get hit pretty hard, after it   s over with, I could  laugh about it. I   ve always tried to salvage whatever we were going  through. I still see the little children. I just had such a love for them. One  of my buddies is Bob Martin. They   d get their ration of beer, and he   s  saving up his cans of beer for a USO show. He was going to tie one on  at that show. (Laughter)  We were sitting there on a log, watching the show. A reconnaissance  plane comes swinging around and brings a little piper cub in. The  marines are really scavengers. A lot of our vehicles said US Army  because when they   d get hit, they   d run off and leave their equipment.  We   d go back and get it. Our reconnaissance planes said Army on the  side of it. He was coming in and comes swooping along the mountains,  comes in to land it   we   re watching the show. He comes in to land it  and the wheels hit just a little ditch right at the end of the runway and  flipped it over, upside down. It didn   t bother us, Joe.    Yeah, look at that,  he   s upside down.    We   re watching the show. Bob Martin, I looked  over, he   s flat on his back. One can of beer knocked him out. (Laughter)  But I   ve never forgotten that.  In fact, after I got out of the service, Bob and I kept contact for a while.  18  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Now, this Dean Martin that was with me, he was right behind me when I  stepped on that land mine. I was his best man at the wedding and we  were friends for quite some time. Then we just kind of drifted apart.  There was always the good and always the bad. A lot of times, your  situation is all in the way you handle it yourself. So, I just always tried to  make the best of it.  Tried to see the humor in things.  Yes. My family was that way. My dad, like I said, he was very quiet.  We   d sit down and eat at the dinner table and he wouldn   t say anything.  He   d just eat his meal, get up and leave, and go read his newspaper. My  mother was the one that brought a sense of humor to the family. We  could always see something funny about   I don   t care what the situation  was. After she found out that her boys were okay and everything, then  she   d start laughing about it. She brought that sense of humor into the  family, which I   m really thankful for. I take life very serious, but I still  have a sense of humor.  I   m sure it serves you well.  Oh, absolutely.  Do you remember the unit, what the unit name was that you were with in  Korea? Just offhand.  No, remember, I put all that behind me.  Okay.  Some of the guys with the Chosin Few, they can   t believe that I don   t  remember any of that. There was one man with the Chosin Few, you  didn   t meet him because he   s had a stroke and he doesn   t come  anymore, Jim Warner. He did exactly the same thing I did. When he left  that camp, he forgot it. He just put it all behind him. You ask him,    Jim,  where were you in Korea?       I was just there.    He can   t tell you any  battles, any hills, any of those things. So, like I said, I was kind of with  the reserve unit. There was one hill over there I don   t remember if it was  Pork Chop Hill or whatever it was, a ship offshore was firing these big  sixteen-inch shells. We   re sitting there because we   re the next unit to go  in. You   re sitting there and      Shoo     (Imitates shell sound) You can  hear these sixteen-inch shells come over. They just pulverized that little  hill. As soon as they stopped firing, here comes the Chinese out from  under, down in those caves. They came out.  My goodness. Do you recall your first firefight that you got into?  19  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Yes. I was so fortunate. We had a lieutenant that was in the Second War.  He had been in combat. We   re taking this hill. We go up the side of it.  We get up to the top, and the Chinese are running up the other side. I  shot this guy in the back. It   s always bothered me. (Cries) I went for  counseling here in Tulsa. The first counselor I met with, he and I just  didn   t hit it off at all. He kept telling me,    You need to get over it. Just  get over it.    I looked him right in the face, his name was Steve, I said,     Steve, did you ever shoot another man?    He says,    No.    I said,    You  don   t get over it.    That   s the only one I   ve talked about. (Cries)  My wife, my family, they know very little of what I went through. I  don   t talk about it. I see these Second World War vets and they still cry,  during the    90s. We had a couple of them there last Saturday that   they  were kind of funny because they could talk about anything. But that was  the first firefight I ever remember being in. After that, I can   t do it  anymore. But that was just the first one. Of course, they always tell you,     You were following orders.    It doesn   t matter, you killed a man.  Yes.  See, over there, things like that didn   t bother me. Sitting down having  my meal next to dead bodies laying around, you don   t think about it.  Like I say, you   re crazy when you   re over there. Just absolutely crazy.  But when you come back   I did eight months in the hospital because I  was coming down this hill one time and I stepped on a land mine. My  first reaction was,    God, why me? I   ve been good.    All the guys were  telling me,    Boy, you got that million dollar wound.    From the outside,  you couldn   t see anything wrong, no blood, no nothing. But on the  inside, from my knee down, everything was just shattered. They took me  to one of those aid stations. Did you ever watch that program MASH?  Yes.  I couldn   t watch it, because they made a comedy out of it. It wasn   t  funny to me.  No.  Just a kid, twenty, twenty-one years old, came back to Yokosuka, Japan.  My leg was so swelled it was five weeks before they could do any  surgery. Then they gave me a spinal block. And that   s back when     when was that?  Nineteen  fifty-two, it was something new. They were  just learning how to do it. It was supposed to just deaden my left leg.  Well, she stuck that needle in my back and,    Woops, got it in the wrong  place.    Pulled it out, sounded like when you pull a nail out of a board.  20  Then she counted down my spine, did it again, and I was totally numb. I  could move my eyes. That   s all I could do.  Then they put this screen up there, so I can   t see what   s going on. Here I  am, laying there. I   ve been in combat for eight months, and the nurse is  squeezing blackheads. I could hear them, the doctors talking, and they   d  go over and look at the x-rays and everything. They asked for screws  and a screwdriver and you wonder,    What in the world are they doing?     They put two screws in my ankle to hold it together.  It   s kind of funny. I came home and married Hazel, my second wife,  who is my best friend. I was in the naval hospital in Martinez,  California, just outside of San Francisco. They were talking about  removing that screw, because you could feel the head of it. The doctor  said it would be major surgery because they had to break bones to get  into one of them. I said,    Hey, just leave it alone. It doesn   t bother me,  just leave it alone.    So, my dear wife likes to tell people that her  husband has a loose screw, literally. (Laughter)  I was in the hospital for eight months and I think I matured more, then,  as a young man, than any other part of my life. And I   m feeling sorry for  myself. Laying in bed, Corpus Christi, and the chaplain comes around,     What   s wrong with you?    I said,    Man, my leg is busted up. I can   t  walk.    They even talked about taking my foot off. He said,    Look at that  guy over there. He   s got a gut wound. He   s not going to make it. That  one over there has lost an eye, lost an arm, and here you are feeling sorry  for yourself.    That   s exactly what I needed to hear because, again, my  sense of humor came back. I started feeling better, having a better  attitude and everything.  You always wanted liberty, just to get out of that hospital and get  something different than just hospital food. The doctor would come  around every Friday and like with my ankle   of course, he knew what  he was doing, he would turn it every way but loose. By the time he got  through, I hurt so bad, I didn   t want to go on liberty. I just wanted to go  back to bed. (Laughs) Then I hadn   t been home for sixteen months, and  every time I   d go to the doctor to see if I could go home,    Not yet. Not  yet.    I had what they called a cast ulcer blister on my heel. They had put  skin grafts on it. He looked at my file and said,    If I cut it off your arm,  you   re going to have a great heel.    So, just right over here, three  different times, he put skin grafts on it.  Finally, I go in and the doctor said,    I   ll tell you what. I   ll give you a  seventy-two hour pass, but don   t leave Corpus Christi County.       No  problem, Doc.    I was still on crutches. So, I go out of his office, go back  to my bunk, tie my crutches up underneath my bed, and hitchhiked  21  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  home. I was just so homesick and just wanting to get out of there.  Like I say, you   re crazy. You   re head has just been like my mom said,  and many moms said the same thing,    My son was never the same after  Korea.    You don   t go through what we went through, the marines and  the soldiers, and come back and live a normal life. But I hitchhiked  home, knocked on the door. My parents didn   t know I was coming. It  was on a Saturday morning. Of course, after they got through crying and  everything,    When do you have to be back?    I said,    Monday morning.        How are you going to get back?    I never thought of that. So, what  happened is   what really ticked my parents off is the following  weekend I had a thirty-day leave. So my mom drove me back to Corpus  Christi and spent a week down there, then we came back.  Oh, she spent a week down there waiting for you.  Yes.  I see.  Again, to kind of show you how the Lord can take care of you   I   m  down there in Corpus Christi standing on a street corner in the dark, kind  of feeling sorry for myself because I wanted to go home, doctor  wouldn   t let me. A young man walks up to me and introduced himself  and says,    I   m a marine.    He said,    I   ll take you to my parents    house.     So, we got to his parents    house, Mr. and Mrs. Davis, go out, meet his  parents. She took me in the bedroom. She said,    That   s your bed,     opened up the closet, pushed the clothes back, she said,    That   s where  you hang your clothes. I want you out here every weekend.    If I wasn   t  there, she   d call the hospital wanting to know why.  No kidding.  One of the best Christmases I ever had was at the Davis    Christmas  dinner. I mean, they had stepladders, crates, everything around the ole  kitchen table, there. They were just old country people. I could just feel  the love in that family. It was just so neat. So, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Speaking of the hospital there, when I finally began to leave the room  there and go out and walk around, I wouldn   t get off the sidewalk,  because if I got off the sidewalk, I would get blown up again. So, for the  longest time, I stayed right on the concrete. Those are just things you  have to work through, just like with PTSD. I didn   t talk about it for forty  years, Joe. I didn   t want people to know I was a marine, because we  came back from Korea as baby killers.  Two things they teach in the marine corps. I mentioned earlier, don   t get  22  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  into a close relationship. The farther north we went into Korea, even the  little kids would kill you. They teach you, don   t trust anyone. I came  back. With all these girls I was writing to, I was writing to one that  became the love of my life. To this day, I still think about her. Her name  was Barbara. I came back, she and I were going together. I am such a  mess, emotionally.    Don   t get into a close relationship and don   t trust  people.    I didn   t trust the girls I went with. I wouldn   t kiss them  goodnight. I wouldn   t hold hands, nothing. This Barbara, she and I just  had the best relationship. We were great friends. But then I go to pick  her up one night, she opened the door and handed me my class ring back  and said,    I don   t want to go with you anymore.     I was so shook up. I quit my job, moved to Okmulgee and was going to  the trade school down there. Years later, my niece got married and her  husband was a marine. I told him, I said,    Mike, this girl was the love of  my life. I don   t understand why she dumped me like she did.    He said,     It   s your marine corps training.    I said,    Marine corps training? What  do you mean?       Don   t you remember? You were taught not to get into a  close relationship because      which it happened several times in  Korea      and then you don   t trust anyone.    I said,    That   s exactly it.    Of  course, with that training and that in my subconscious, it didn   t help my  first marriage. When my first wife and I   we had children   when they  were five, six-years-old, I wouldn   t allow them downstairs until I went  upstairs and inspected their bedroom. My wife said,    You   re trying to  make marines out of our children.    I said,    What   s wrong with that?     But I look back at it now and it bothers me. I asked my kids to forgive  me, but they   re great. They   re great. Strange things. But to this day, I  still think of that girl.  Did you ever hear from her after that?  No, I never did. I was so shook up that   of course, I felt it was all my  fault, which a lot of it was. Now, this Tommy Roberts I had mentioned,  he was right behind me when I got wounded. He knew this Barbara.  They were good friends. In fact, the girl he married lived right next door  to her. I saw him at the airport one time and I said,    Hey, whatever  happened to Barbara?    He said,    Oh, she finally got married.    But I  never called or anything like that, because I figured it was all my fault  anyway. But many years later, I realized it was my training. See, I have  no problems following orders. I had no problems obeying people.  (Break)  What were we talking about before?  I think I was talking about girls, wasn   t I?  23  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  I think so. Oh, Barbara?  Barbara, yes.  So, you never were able to talk to her after that?  No, I was too embarrassed to go back. I   m a shy person. Used to be I  was so introverted and so insecure, if something went wrong, it was my  fault. I never went back. I was so cruel to the girls I went with after I  came back from Korea. I remember one girl in Okmulgee. She and I  went together for a while. We were sitting in front of her house. Oh,  man, I hate to even say these things. She said,    As long as we   ve been  going together, you   ve never opened a car door for me.    I just kind of  slipped down in my seat and I said,    Well, wake me up in the morning. I  have an eight o   clock class.    (Laughter) She never went with me after  that. You don   t blame her. That was my attitude. I don   t know what it  was. I don   t know what caused that. But it was many years later that I  realized I had a very, as far as a sense of humor, I could really hurt  people just trying to be funny. But it wasn   t funny. I look at it now and  think,    Man, what a mess I was.    I   m not blaming it all on Korea or  anything like that. Because I came from a very loving family.  Sure. You said you stayed in touch with several of the fellows from your  unit back then. Do you guys get together for reunions or anything like  that? Or meet at central places?  I got together one time with the reserve unit that left Tulsa. I went to  that, and with my present wife. And I saw these guys all crippled up and  I could just   because I   d done domestic counseling, I could see the hurt  and the pain in them. I told Hazel afterwards, I said,    I don   t want to go  to another reunion.    I did have one, his name was Jimmy Potts. I met  him here in Tulsa and went to school with him. He ended up in Oregon,  Washington, up there somewhere. He called   that   s before I moved  back to Tulsa. He called my parents and said that he   d like to get in  contact with me, but I never did. I never did contact him.  Why do you think that is?  I don   t know. I   m still kind of an insecure person. I   m very successful at  anything that I do, but I just feel like anyone could do better than me.  It   s just like in the printing business. I could do four-color process off of  a duplicating machine. I think it   s still around, the old Multilith. It was  basically a duplicating machine. I even had people come out from the  company and say,    How can you produce that kind of work off this  duplicating machine?    I told them,    I just pray.    I give God a lot of  24  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  credit for my success and things that I   ve accomplished. But even as  Christian counselors and dealing with all the domestic things, we were  very successful, my wife and I. We   ve got kids that were twelve,  thirteen-years-old when we started working with them. They were into  drugs and all that sort of stuff. They   re in their fifties now, and they still  call us and tell us that,    You have made life worth living for us.    It  makes you feel good to know that people still contact you.  Yes, wow.  And people I work for will say that   I worked one little job shop when I  first got out of the trade school. I go and apply for the job, just a little job  shop, downtown Tulsa. He said,    Can you run a Heidelberg?       I knew it  was a German press. I said,    Sure.    I   d never even seen one. (Laughter)  So, I go in the first day of work, I asked the foreman, I said,    How do  you turn this thing on?    Like I said, I was very good at what I did, even  in the printing business. The boss came to me one day and said,    You   re  the first pressman I   ve ever had that made money for me off that press.     Even as a counselor, we were very successful because I felt God had  anointed us to be able to do that type of stuff.  That   s outstanding.  We still do it. In fact, just yesterday, I   m dealing with a young man,  PTSD. He refuses to talk about Iraq and the things that he went through  and the killings. I sat here for four hours yesterday listening to him talk.  Never mentioned PTSD. Talked about all the other things that just didn   t  relate to what we needed to talk about at all. But I   m very patient. I can  listen to him talk because someday, he   s going to have to deal with it  and we   ll help him.  That   s absolutely true. When you were in Korea, or even just in the  marines, was there something special you did or something special you  carried with you for good luck?  Well, I guess that ID bracelet that I mentioned when I worked at Zales.  Every time I look at that, I think,    Man, those people thought enough of  me to give me that bracelet,    because I really valued it. Of course, we  carried the little pack like that in Korea. (Gestures) You had a change of  clothes, your shaving gear, and that   s about it. I had an opium pipe and a  Korean flag. They meant a lot to me. But when I was wounded and  laying on the stretcher there, they said,    Is there anything you want out  of your pack?    You know what I wanted? The teeth that I took out of  that skull. I didn   t care about anything else. I just wanted those teeth.  Did you keep those?  25  Slocum  Oh, I had them for years. Finally, I started dealing with the PTSD. Let  me back up just a minute. Hazel and I got married. She had a lot of  emotional problems of her own that she was dealing with. So, we kind of  helped each other. Then it got to how   I   m sure you   ve heard these  stories over and over   she   d wake me up at night. I   d be beating the  stuffings out of her. I   m back in combat. She   d wake me up. I   d be  screaming and having nightmares. It   s very common of combat veterans.  You wake up, there   s someone in the house. You just know. I go  through the house, the doors are all locked, the lights are out, there   s no  one in the house. But I don   t have much problem with that anymore.  Finally, I told her, I said,    Sweetheart, before I hurt you, I   m going to  move into a different bedroom. When you hear me screaming at night,  just don   t come in.    We were dealing   we thought I was going crazy. I  didn   t know anything about PTSD. What really set me off, Joe   I can   t  explain why   was 9/11. Then I started going over on Forty-first for  counseling. They put me on medication trying to help me and  everything. I told the psychiatrist at that time, I said,    A lot of these  firemen and policemen that were at 9/11, you watch, they   re going to  commit suicide because they can   t handle it.    Sure enough, within  months, they   re committing suicide.  Then I kind of backed off and I wasn   t getting any better. So, I started  going to the marines that I still meet with, the Chosin Few. I may have  mentioned this to you the other day, but when I walked out, I told Hazel,     I   ve never been in a room with so many hearing aids and nobody can  hear.    (Laughter) But then I went to over on Eleventh and  Highway   169 to the mental section. I can   t think of the psychologist   s name   Dr.  Jeffries. She shared the symptoms of PTSD and we realized, that   s what  is wrong with me  I said,    That   s what is wrong with me     I felt so much  better just hearing her describe those symptoms, because that made me  realize,    I   m not going crazy.    I   m not going crazy. Then I went for  three years for PTSD counseling. Like I mentioned earlier, the first  counselor   he and I just had a real problem, telling me to get over it.  So, finally, after several months with him, I just told him, I said,    Look  Steve, you   ve really helped me.    I didn   t want to be rude to him. I said,     I   m moving on.    Then I started going to another unit at Eleventh and   Highway  169. At first, it   s a whole group, then they break it down. I  think there was six of us met in a room, sit around one of the tables. I  could see those guys and how messed up they were. I began to realize,     Man, I can get through this. I can work through this,    because I was  taught by my mom.    Honey, you can do better than that. I know you can  do better than that.     26  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  I started getting over it. Like I say, I went for three years. We didn   t talk  about combat, we didn   t talk about killing, we didn   t talk about all those  different things like that. We talked about life. One of them was a  farmer. He talked about his cattle and his crops he was raising, such as  that. We had one black man that all he could talk about is,    Why do they  always talk about the bad things in North Tulsa?    Unfortunately, there is  a lot coming out of there, but there is bad stuff over here, too. There was  two of them, they would sit with their back to the wall, so nobody could  get behind them. I could see how   I do this at church. I have to sit on  the end. If I have to sit in the middle, I don   t hear what the preacher is  saying. I   m a nervous wreck that I   m cornered. So, I sit on the end. I  went there for three years and I felt like I was doing pretty good.  Because of that, with the VA working, with the VA listening to them,  I   ve come to the point now where I   m a certified chaplain to work with  PTSD. So, I feel   I still have bad nights. I still, a lot of times watching  the news or reading the newspaper, I close my eyes. I can   t watch it. I  realize that that   s just part of it, so I just see my way through it.  I see. Sounds like a good path, though, that   s led you there. Did you  keep a diary or a journal or anything like that when you were in the  service?  No.  Do you remember where you were at when the Korean War ended?  Thirty-eight parallel.  You were on the thirty-eighth parallel when it ended?  Well, when the ceasefire. Actually, I don   t believe that war has ever  ended.  No, no, we   re still in a ceasefire right now. They   re still rattling sabers,  even today.  I   m just waiting for North Korea to do it again.  Yes, I   yes, absolutely. I think that   s happening sooner than later.  Absolutely.  Let me throw this in, Joe.  Sure.  I was working as a counselor in the local church, here. We were taking a  27  Myers  Slocum  break. All these years, I thought,    Man, Korea ruined my life. I   ve got  all these hang-ups and everything and flashbacks and all that sort of  stuff. The war is not over, we just wasted our time.    We were working  as counselors in a church here, and we   re sitting in a room with all these  counselors coming out of Oral Roberts. I just made a comment, I said,     You know, I was with the marines in Korea in    51.    I didn   t realize it,  but there was a young Korean man sitting across the room from me. He  came over and stood in front of me. He says,    May I       he said,    Thank  you. Thank you. Thank you.    Then I began to realize, because we went  over there and kept the North Koreans out, South Korea is a free  country. As free as they can be. That young man can come over here and  get an education. Then I felt kind of proud of what we did. But up until  then, it was a waste of time, waste of lives. Nope, they   re coming over  here, getting an education. Some of them stay, some of them go back.  Next door is a Vietnamese family. They   re just really nice people. They  never come out of the house, they don   t speak English. The one young  man, his name is Sai. He   s studying to be an architect. He   s the only one  that speaks fluent English. They   ve been here ten, fifteen years. We can  communicate with him. Now, we have an ole vegetable garden. In the  summertime, we   ll take the fresh vegetables over to them. Maybe a day  or two later, there is a knock on the door, open the door, here   s this little  Vietnamese woman with a plateful of egg rolls for us. Right out of the  wok. (Laughs) But they don   t come out of the house, they just stay there.  They   ll wave to you once in a while, but...  Wow. When you got back after you were out of the hospital and you   d  been released from the marines, did you go back to school, or did you go  to school on the GI Bill, or did you go to work right away?  I had that attitude that,    I   m just going to get started in the printing  business. I   ll just work my way up.    Back then, I think minimum wage  was like a dollar, dollar and a quarter an hour. I was working for eighty  cents an hour. I   m working up a sweat at the Oil and Gas Journal. I got  to thinking,    This isn   t very smart. The government will pay for my  education. I can go to Okmulgee and get an education, come out and go  to work that way,    which I did. I really enjoyed going to school over  there. Of course, I started doing a lot of dating. Like I say, Joe, I was  very insecure, I didn   t think I was nice looking or anything. A veteran  saw my picture in the hallway there when I was nineteen. He said,     Man, you were really a cutie.    I said,    I didn   t know it.    (Laughter)  But anyway, when I was over in Okmulgee, there was this girl. She  wasn   t a girlfriend. I don   t know where I met her. Tall, red hair, freckle  face, skinny, ugly. She had a list of girls that wanted to go with this  marine. If I wanted a date   I don   t remember her name   all I had to do  28  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  is call her.    Hey, can you set me up for a date tonight?    and she did.  One girl over there, her name was Jodi Henderson. She was football  queen. Cute personality like you wouldn   t believe. We got to going  together, brought her to Tulsa, introduced her to my family. We went  together all summer long. Like I say, all that time we were together I  think we kissed one time. I don   t remember even holding her hand. But  she was a real winner, just as sweet as she could be, personality like you  wouldn   t believe. My mom said, right in front of her, said,    Well, I  picked out one of my daughter-in-laws.    I took her home one weekend  and I said,    Jodi, I don   t want to go with you anymore.    I don   t know  why, but I just couldn   t finalize a good relationship. So, I broke up. My  buddies and my family were so upset with me. But see, I can   t trust her.  It   s in my subconscious. I heard later that she got married, had five  children, and her husband beat her to death. She was such a sweetheart,  too. I didn   t feel guilty or anything, I just,    Well, it   s really sad.    But I  did think,    What if I had married her?    We could have had a good  marriage. But for some reason, I just couldn   t finalize a relationship.  I know you kind of touched on this before. Do you believe a lot of that  did just come from the training, as far as having to desensitize yourself  to everything around you?  Yes. Like I said, I respected authority and did what I was told. If they  said,    Don   t get in a close relationship, don   t trust people       And even  to this day, there is a lot of times when I   ll meet someone and think,     For some reason, I don   t trust them.    I   ve been burned many times. I   m  pretty well over it now. I used to meet someone and immediately, I  judged them. I like you or I don   t like you. But not anymore. I   ll meet  someone, I don   t care how messed up they are or where they   re coming  from. I get acquainted with them. I meet a person that   s angry or fear or  depression, whatever, my first thought is,    Why are they that way?     Then I get to know them, and working as a counselor, eventually it  comes out. Whether they were abused as a child or this or that happened.  Then I find out,    Hey, that guy is all right. He just has some issues he  needs to deal with.     This is usually a tough question. I ask this from time to time. In war,  there are examples of both, really good examples of good humanity and  the worst of humanity. Is there anything that kind of comes to mind that  we haven   t talked about, as far as either the best of humanity or the  worst of humanity that you witnessed?  I remember the Second War. Of course, I was just a little kid, but we  were taught in America that the Japanese people were like animals.  They   re not even human. But when the marines went over there and  29  Myers  Slocum  started dealing with the Japanese people,    Hey, they   re just like we are.  Their eyes are a little different, their skin is a little different color, but  they   re human beings just like we are.    I remember there in Korea, we   d  take a prisoner and I   d realize,    That guy   s got a family. He has a mom  and dad. He is human just like I am. He   s just simply obeying orders.     Then I see how some of the other marines would mistreat them and  everything, treat them like an animal. But they   re not, they   re a human  being. I tried to show respect for them. Of course I   ve got my guard up,  but I tried to be as nice as I can.  There were times that we   d take prisoners   it happened more than once  and I   ve even talked to Second World War vets that said the same thing.  They were taught that they were animals and such as that. We   d take in a  prisoner, if they were wounded or something, we   d medicate them, take  care of them and everything, give cigarettes and food and everything.  Next thing you know, they   re willing to fight for us. Why? Because we  just showed them love and affection. They   re taught the same thing.     They   re crazy people. Kill them.     No, it just bothered me because I don   t care who it is, that   s some man     my wife and I, we   ve worked a lot with the veterans on the street  because they just can   t fit back into society. When we were in Northern  California, a lot of the Vietnam vets were actually living back in the  mountains, dungarees, fatigues. They were still in combat. They can   t  get over it. Their life has been ruined. We go downtown and some of  them are very intelligent people. There was one veteran down there that  his dad was a district judge. Highly educated man. His son, living back  there in North Tulsa, up in the bushes and everything   very, very  intellectual, but he just can   t fit back into society. I was talking to him  one time and he was just starting to talk about things that happened in  Vietnam, the first time he shot someone and how it   d just flashed back  on him. He was just beginning to open up. Then my wife walks in. Of  course he clammed right back up. There are some good men back there,  but war just ruined them.  I know you have the opportunity to talk to a lot of these guys, a lot of  veterans. If you had a wider audience to talk to, or even someone that  will read this or see this later on that   s a veteran, what would you say to  them regarding your experience and being able to move forward with  your life after serving in a combat zone?  We came back from Korea, it wasn   t just the marines, any serviceman  coming back from Korea was not respected. We were looked down on. I  guess it was towards the end of Vietnam and getting into Iraq and all  that. Then all of the sudden, our country starts respecting the military. I  was never respected or anything or,    We   re proud of you and thank you  30  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  for your service,    until we get into Iraq and all that sort of stuff. Now, if  I wear a marine corps hat or a purple heart hat, people come up to me  and say,    We appreciate your service.    You know what I tell them?    It  was an honor.    And Joe, it was. It   s an honor.  We   re still free today because all through the history of this country, we  have fought for our freedom. That old saying,    Freedom is not free,     there   s a lot of people buried overseas, thousands of servicemen. They  never came home, but they gave their lives so we could be free. I know I  tell people,    It   s an honor. It was an honor to serve in the marine corps.     I   m proud of it now. You see this decal on the front door? (Gestures) Big  marine sign. I   m proud of it. I   m extremely proud of being a marine. In  talking about how tough the marines are, I   ve talked to soldiers that went  through worse than what some marines did. A lot worse than what I  went through. So, anyone that is serving our country and fighting for our  country, I respect them and I honor them.  What is your best advice for these guys that are coming back and feel  disconnected?  Deal with it. Now, everyone talks about how terrible the VA is. Not to  me. You know why? And I tell young boys going in the VA,    Watch  your attitude.    I took one veteran in from Vietnam. When he was in the  military he fell in the shower and cut his hand. I told him, I said,    Rod,  watch your attitude when you go in.       Oh, I   m going to get 100  percent.    He goes in there with a cocky attitude, foul mouth and  everything. They gave him some pain pills and made him pay for them.  I go in, I know my doctor by name, Dr. Nightingale. He   s been my  doctor for years and years. My wife and I, we   re to the point where  we   re both retired, so we do some traveling. I go in and see him for my  annual and he   ll say,    Well, where you been this time?    The nurses, we  know each other by name. Barbara, my nurse, she gives me a big hug  and everything,    How are you doing? How   s your wife?    and  everything. So,    Watch your attitude when you go in there. But don   t do  like I did and put it off for forty years,    because I became a workaholic.  That   s how I dealt with it. As long as I was busy, my mind was occupied  and busy, I didn   t have to deal with it. But the older I got, and even got  towards retirement, then it starts coming back. Like I say, 9/11 really  topped it off. But no, I tell these young people   I dealt with one  yesterday from Iraq,    Deal with it. Don   t do like I did. Don   t put it  aside.    I said,    Let   s deal with it right now.     Talk it out, basically.  Oh, yes, talk about it. I sat with him four hours yesterday. Not really  31  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Slocum  talk, but like I said, I   m very patient. I can sit and listen to him talk about  cars and family and having a good father and all that. I can listen to it.  Someday it   s going to come to the surface. He   s going to run out of  things to talk about. (Laughs) That   s why my wife and I, both, are  certified counselors, chaplains, to work with these people. I   ve very  patient.  I think that   s wonderful. I really do.  He still says,    No, I don   t want to deal with it.    Hazel told him, she said,     Look, I   ll go to the VA with you to the counselor.       Okay.    He just  wants someone to help him.  Sure. All of us at some point in time need a hand up or just a little  guidance will get us there.  Yes, he has the nightmares and the sweats, and he   s got some real, real  bad mental problems and separated from his family and everything. He  says he   s doing okay. I tell him,    You   re not doing okay. How come you  have nightmares? How come you   re separated from your family?        Well, it   s not as bad as it used to be.    I told him, I said,    Look, the  older you get, the worse it   s going to get unless you deal with it.    So,  we   re going to go to Branson on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Thursday, we   re taking him to the VA to talk to a counselor, get him  started.  Outstanding. I just have a couple more questions. Were you ever a  member of like the VFW  Veterans of Foreign Wars  or American  Legion or anything like that when you came back or later on?  DAV was our first one. Disabled Vets, I   m involved with them. I   m  involved with the marines, the Chosin Few. I   m a member of Military  Order of Purple Hearts. The VFW, I   m not really involved with them.  But I   m involved in several groups that help me because we can sit  down and we can, once in a great while, like Saturday when you were  there, they started talking about it. It starts coming up. So, just being  with those guys, I feel so much better. I   m not alone.  Absolutely. Is there anything you   d like to add that we haven   t covered  so far in our talk today?  Well, you may want to erase this, but like I told you, Joe, I appreciate  you, that you   ll take the time to talk to veterans that need help. The fact,  I may never see it, but this will go on to reach children generations to  come. Because of you, they   re going to know about the Second War,  Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. They   re going to know.  32  Myers  Slocum  Myers  Well, it   s an honor for me to be able to do this. It truly is. I want to thank  you for your time sitting with me today and talking about your  experiences.  I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Absolutely. Thank you.  -------  -------
