Callahan Right.  Finchum In Caddo County.  E. Callahan Caddo County.  Finchum Alright, and were you an only child?  E. Callahan No. I had a sister, Grace Javellas. Her son lives out of town, and Jess,  the oldest brother, Jess, and Raymond, and my baby brother, Herbert.  Herbert Hoover Hyde that was his name.  Finchum H. H. H.  Bishop After the president.  Finchum So there were five children? Three boys and two girls?  E. Callahan Grace, Jess, me, and Raymond. That   s our picture. (Gestures)  Finchum And then Herbert?  E. Callahan And then Herbert was the baby, and he was a bookworm.  Finchum And what did your parents do for a living?  E. Callahan They were farmers, but they   bunch of them decided to come. That  was when Oklahoma was just beginning to blossom. They came   I  know it was in   they picked cotton, but when they come here my dad  applied for a job at the   it was an ice plant then. Worked there until he  was electrocuted by the cord that was supposed to be insulated that  wasn   t.  Bishop Was the ice plant here in Pawhuska?  E. Callahan We had an ice plant here at one time.  Finchum Did your mother work?  E. Callahan After my father passed away.  Finchum She had to.  E. Callahan She washed dishes at the Duncan Hotel.  Finchum And how old were you when he passed away? Still at home?  6  E. Callahan No. No, because I had married and we had gone to California. I worked  at the gauges, oil or whatever it was. My oldest daughter, I only had one  at the time, but that was the nice thing about living out there. We could  get all the beautiful flowers, oh it was just   not like it is today  according to the television. We rode out there, drove out there with  another couple that didn   t have children then. As I said, I worked at  the   I forget what they called it. My daughter was in, my only daughter  I had then, was in nursery school. The thing that I loved was the  flowers. You could just get any kind of beautiful flowers for a dollar. Or  go down to the little stand and say,    I want a dozen of these,    and there  they were.  Finchum How did you meet your husband?  E. Callahan Oh shoot, where did we meet? He worked   my brother worked  for   what did they do, Betty?  B. Callahan Is that when they were hauling brick?  E. Callahan Yes, he worked for a company here in Pawhuska called Wise Trucking.  He drove a truck and they hauled stuff around the country, around  Oklahoma. And helped build, I say helped build because they would  haul the brick that built the little town.  Finchum How old were you when you got married? After high school?  E. Callahan Yes. I was working at the Dime   let me see, was it the Dime Store? I  believe. Then the Dime Store had different counters like jewelry and  socks and stuff. I was on   you had to keep your own counter up and  see to the people that come in, and alcohol, there was one particular  Indian woman that would come in. Didn   t want anybody to know it, get  her a bottle of Bay Rum. Course went out with a sack, but she had other  things. Then after I got married and we come back from   the only thing  I liked about California was the flowers. Just beautiful flowers.  Finchum Were you out there during the war? Was that why you went? During the     40s?  E. Callahan Yeah, I think it was just kind of at the end of the war because Ralph Jr.     Ralph and Liz, we lived with them for a time. Liz worked in the     Finchum Let   s back up a little bit. When you went to elementary school, talk a  little bit about that. How would you get there?  7  E. Callahan Well, we lived just off of Main Street, a little house down there. The  house is still there. My mother made us go to school. Papa worked at  the ice plant and my sister and I had to walk, regardless of the weather.  Boys would walk and get a ride, but Grace and I had to walk. We had to  try to get there. Her son lives out   is that west of town? We had a good  relationship up until she passed away. We   d go   she loved to fish and  our mother loved to fish. We   d get her and here we   d go.  B. Callahan Mom, where did you go to elementary school? I don   t even know that.  What school did you go to when you went to elementary school?  Elementary? Which school did you go to?  E. Callahan Went to Franklin. Used to be Franklin School. Lordy, Pawhuska was  bigger then, because we had Franklin, Union, Century, and Lynn, and  what was the   I thought we had five. Prudent, did I say Prudent?  Finchum That   s pretty big.  E. Callahan We had five schools.  Bishop You   d have to walk to school, but the boys would ride?  E. Callahan Well, my sister and I had   our mother thought we had to go to school  regardless. The boys, it was okay because they could go up on Main  Street and somebody would pick them up. They   re not going to pick a  girl up. Back then they wasn   t. Grace and I, our mother was determined  we were going to go and learn.  I think one of the particular times that I remember I think we would   ve  froze to death if it hadn   t of been   now this wasn   t cruelty, it was just  because they had less than we had and they wanted us to have the  education. The boys didn   t have any trouble, they   d just go up to Main  Street and get to school. One particular time that Grace and I had started  I think we would probably   now my mother was not mean. She was  just determined to her kids that...Momma made us start to school. I  think we would   ve froze to death if it hadn   t of been   teachers in a cab  picked us up, Grace and I. Boys didn   t have any problem. She was  determined. She and my dad was determined we were going to be  educated.  Finchum And did you finish the twelfth grade?  E. Callahan Did I?  Finchum Finish the twelfth?  8  E. Callahan Yes, yes. Sure did.  Finchum Made her happy then, huh?  E. Callahan Yes. Then I met your dad. I   ve forgotten     B. Callahan That was one of the questions. You met him through Uncle Jess. He  was Uncle Jess    friend.  E. Callahan Oh, they were hauling brick to build some place off down in Oklahoma.  My brother and I met him through   Red was my husband, met him  through     Finchum Through your brother.  E. Callahan Yes, and better believe that he took good care of me because Jess was  right behind him. Good friends, but     Finchum Still took care of his sister.  Bishop His name was Red?  E. Callahan Well, his name was Wilson, W.B., Wilson Bryan. My brother   s name  was Jesse Harve Hyde. We were Hydes. They would go up just a block  to Main Street, the boys, and catch a ride. Mom thought we ought to go,  ought to go to school. Pushed me and Grace out. I think we would   ve  froze to death if it hadn   t had been for teachers picked us up.  Bishop Do you remember the Great Depression during that time? What was  that like?  E. Callahan Oh yes, I sure do. I remember those little sandstorms we had during that  time. It was so hot, but you had to keep your house closed because of  this sand. It just blew all the time.  Bishop Did you have to cover the windows?  Callahan Yeah.  Bishop How would you do that?  E. Callahan Well, with whatever you had. Try to keep what   we had   well I can   t  say that   our house must   ve been airtight, because I can   t   I know that  my brothers would just go up to Main Street and get a ride     Finchum What would you take for lunch?  9  E. Callahan Oh, peanut butter sandwiches or just whatever there was to eat.  Finchum Did your mother make your clothes? Sew? Did she sew?  E. Callahan Yes, she sure did.  Finchum Did she teach you how?  E. Callahan Yes.  Finchum And what was the favorite   your favorite thing she cooked for you?  E. Callahan Oh, I can just taste the beans and cornbread. (Laughs) Beans and  cornbread and good fried potatoes. That was a good meal.  Finchum And what would you drink with it?  E. Callahan Well, I guess I can   t remember. We didn   t have a cow. So I don   t know,  sometimes we had milk, but I can   t remember. I think that   I can   t  remember, I think she got it at the little store.  Finchum Pinto beans?  E. Callahan Pinto beans. That was my favorite with a big chunk of salt meat, and  cornbread, and fried taters.  Finchum Sounds good to me. (Laughter)  E. Callahan Still good.  Finchum And what would you do for fun?  E. Callahan We had   my parents were very strict, but I did get to   some older girls  had a team, basketball, and what was the other? Basketball and can   t  remember what   but they were older and I was the youngest one. Pop  said I could go and do as long as I didn   t go in those places where the  older girls went to drink. I had to sit in the car. I mean I did, because he  worked nights.  Finchum And he   d find out if you didn   t.  E. Callahan I don   t know how those men found out things, (laughs) but they did.  Sure did.  Finchum So you played basketball?  10  E. Callahan I did.  Finchum What did you play in? What kind of clothes?  E. Callahan Shoot.  Finchum Wasn   t short-shorts I   m sure.  E. Callahan No. I just don   t remember that. I think it was   it had to be just   only  not this kind of material, and shirts. Just regular shirts.  Finchum Come down to your knees?  E. Callahan Shirttail out     Finchum Did it come down to your knees or     E. Callahan Yes.  Finchum Kind of like bloomers?  E. Callahan Yeah, well we had the bloomers too, once upon a time. I knew about  both of them.  Finchum How did your mother do laundry?  E. Callahan I think that   how did she     Finchum Did she have a washboard?  E. Callahan Oh yes.  Finchum I mean a rubboard?  E. Callahan Right. I was trying to think. My dad worked at the ice plant and he was  electrocuted with a drop-cord and Momma had to go to work. She  worked at the Duncan Hotel, down in the kitchen, washing dishes.  Bishop When you moved to California, where did you work?  E. Callahan I was married then.  Bishop Did you work in California?  11  E. Callahan Yes I did, and I would climb those ladders to the top of the tank and  take a stick and poke down, there was an outlet up there, and poke  down to see how much was in the tank. Then I   d have to go down and  shovel stuff in the   I guess it was coal. Coal in the   they called it the  feeders.  Bishop Where was this?  E. Callahan California.  Bishop I mean was it a shipyard, was it     E. Callahan Yeah. Well, my husband worked at the shipyards, but   am I getting  that right, Betty?  B. Callahan Standard Oil.  Finchum What was in the tank? Oil?  E. Callahan Oh yeah. That was almost war back then.  Finchum Well in the tanks that you were measuring, what was in them?  E. Callahan Oil. I   d have to go down and feed that coal, whatever it was, into the     Bishop That was during the war? You did that during the war?  E. Callahan I don   t think   we weren   t in a war, but the war was on in   where was  it Betty?  B. Callahan I remember you talking about your ration coupons, and Daddy would  take his and his cigarette and buy meat with them. So it was at the end  of the war, because you still had rations.  E. Callahan And they still worked on those boats because he would have to walk on  a board to get to the whatever they were working on. That was when  Patricia was a baby. Well, she was what? Four or five years old? Then  when we came back I was pregnant, Red thought we ought to come  back home. Rode the train back to Bartlesville then. I don   t know how  they do now, but we had to pay to get from Bartlesville to Pawhuska. I  can   t remember just how much it was, but we really didn   t have it. He  had a job, got a job right away.  Bishop What was Pawhuska like back in the day? Can you describe it?  12  E. Callahan Well, now my sister and I   my mother was very strict. We didn   t get to  go. The boys could go wherever and get a ride. Just walk a block up to  Main Street and get a ride     Bishop Do you remember the town that much?  E. Callahan It was Pawhuska.  Bishop What was it like back in its heyday?  Finchum Like what else was on Main Street?  E. Callahan Main Street, where the Triangle Building is, it was offices there. They  didn   t call it Triangle Building, but when they would have   well like  the Playboys back in the days of the Playboys     B. Callahan Bob Wills.  Finchum Oh, Bob Wills.  E. Callahan Yes, yes. Boy, everybody turned out to see Bob Wills and the Texas  Playboys. Then they   d have a dance over in one of the buildings  downtown. I didn   t get to go to it. Grace and I, my sister and I, didn   t  get to go to it, but the boys did. That was back in the days  when   wasn   t like today.  Bishop Prohibition. Was it the Prohibition days?  E.

Callahan Not Woolworth   s   shoot.  Finchum Yeah, there   s another one I can   t think of.  13  E. Callahan Woolworth and     Finchum Kress   ? Kress? K-R-E-S-S, Kress?  E. Callahan No. G L Drugstore and     Finchum Well, that   s okay. Did Pawhuska have a movie theater?  E. Callahan It did, didn   t it?  B. Callahan I don   t know when you were growing up, I wasn   t there. (Laughter)  E. Callahan Yes we did. We did. We had, I think we had two at that time. When the  people quit going to one and went to the other, they finally just  consolidated them and went to one. That   s where all the things that  come to town would be, but also that one place over the drugstore is  where the men would go play cards and drink. There was two theaters,  and a pool   they didn   t call it a pool hall, where the cattleman would  come in and     Finchum Billiards?  E. Callahan Yes.  B. Callahan Smokehouse. The Smokehouse.  E. Callahan Smokehouse, that was it, and G L Drugstore, and Woolworth   s, that   s  where I worked. No, I didn   t work at Woolworth   s.

Callahan Oh, fish  Lord, I   d rather go fishing than eat. I still did until recently.  No, my mother was very strict with my sister and I, but the boys got to  do things. But she did let me play   they called it softball, girls    softball  team. Isn   t that where you make a basket?  Bishop Basketball?  E. Callahan Yeah, and after a game they would go to a little place that sold drinks.  You know, food as well, but the big girls got to go in there. I didn   t get  to go because my dad said he didn   t ever     14  Finchum And you did what your dad said.  E. Callahan I mean to tell you, we did what my mom said and my dad. You did. No  ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Finchum How did they punish you when you did something wrong?  E. Callahan Momma had a little switch that   oh, it stung. It   s good for the legs.  You learned to jump rope real fast. (Laughs) They were   people today  would look back and say that they should never punish like that, but  who knows what they did before that. You don   t know from one time  until the next how you   re going to do.  Finchum Did you go to church?  E. Callahan When we could. I was trying to think of the church that we went to. I  think we went to the church the same place we went to school.  Finchum Could have in those days. When you went fishing did you go to a pond  or to a river?  E. Callahan Creek. (Laughs)  Finchum And what kind of fish would you catch?  E. Callahan Just big old perch, boney as can be, and catfish.  Finchum Would you noodle?  E. Callahan No. The boys did, but that was up on a lake.  Finchum Would you degut and fillet the fish? Would you     B. Callahan Scales.  Finchum Yeah, whatever you call it. Would you dress the fish?  E. Callahan I could, but   yes. Cut down one side, they   re good fried in that deep  fat. Cornbread and taters.  Bishop You have any good fishing stories?  E. Callahan Well, I don   t think so. They   re just ordinary fishing stories. Oh, until I  had raised my family and we went up to   what   s the name of that?  Where we would go to fish.  15  B. Callahan Trap? The Trap?  E. Callahan The Trap upon Chapman bartered land. It was one of those lakes that  they built during the Depression. It had   then they brought fish and     Finchum Stocked it.  E. Callahan Stocked it. We fished there until I couldn   t. Somebody had to put my  chair up, put my bait right by my chair. But my friend Maudelle and I  would walk around that lake. Lordy, Lord, had a lot of good times.  Finchum Would you catch and release?  E. Callahan We didn   t keep them small ones, yeah. Sometimes we turned them  loose (laughs) because we didn   t want to clean them.  Finchum What would you use for bait?  E. Callahan Worms and catch a little fish and get pieces of it and put it on the     B. Callahan Minnows.  E. Callahan And minnows. I was going to say. What else did we use?  Bishop And you mentioned   what was your friend   s name? You mentioned a  woman   s name.  E. Callahan Maudelle.  Bishop And who was she?  E. Callahan She was my true friend. She had a daughter that was my daughter   s age,  one of my daughter   s age, and longtime friend that wound up in a rest  home. Now, doesn   t even know her own kids.  Bishop How   d you meet her?  E. Callahan Through our daughters. Well I   ll be darned     Bishop But she liked to fish too?  E. Callahan Maudelle? Oh yes, we   d fish when nobody else did.  Finchum Was it a competition on who go the most?  16  E. Callahan No, there really never was. I don   t think. The only time I was in  competition was when that, one of your friends come up and we went  up there. I think she was comparing the fish with what she caught down  there in Texas. I can   t remember what her name is, but I     B. Callahan Margaret.  E. Callahan Margaret, yes. Comparing Texas, everything   s bigger in Texas.  Finchum Including the tall tales, huh?  E.

Showed  her off, and she was the cutest and the feistiest little thing. But when     the sad thing is that when I had the boy, he didn   t pay as much attention  to Betty as he should have, but we lived through it and she lived  through it. She knew what, in her heart, what her daddy was and that he  17  was good and kind. Never saw a stranger, but he was an old country  boy. Wasn   t he from that little town     B. Callahan He went to school at Mountain Valley, and when his parents died he  moved to Aunt Katherine   s in Hennessey to graduate.  E. Callahan Mountain Valley, which was   still there isn   t it?  E. Callahan Just the remnants.  Finchum Did you ever think you would make it to 100?  E. Callahan I never thought about it. I just     B. Callahan I   m going to interrupt here. She always said she was going to live to be  100. She always said that,    I   m going to be 100.     Finchum She   s telling on you. Did anybody else in your family?  E. Callahan No. Jess was the oldest, wasn   t he?  Bishop But did anybody in your family make it to 100 years? Grandparent?  E. Callahan Don   t seem like. Way before my time. I don   t know.  Bishop Any brothers or sisters?  B. Callahan None that I knew of.  Finchum You   re the first  What do you think you   re secret is to living so long?  E. Callahan That   s what I don   t know, why? But we don   t ask why, because there   s  only one person that knows. That   s Jesus Christ.  Finchum Can you describe a typical day for you?  E. Callahan Here?  Finchum Yeah, what time do you get up?  E. Callahan Well, Betty lets me sleep in, and I   ll sleep until about what? Eight?  B. Callahan Ten thirty. (Laughter) Unless someone   s coming. When your bath aide  comes, you get up at eight forty-five.  E. Callahan And then she lets me sleep longer.  18  Finchum And then what time do you go to bed?  E. Callahan I don   t know. What time do I?  B. Callahan About eight thirty.  Finchum And you said you like to read.  E. Callahan Yes I like to read.  Finchum You have a favorite? I noticed Louis L   Amour over there.  E. Callahan (Laughs) I   ve read all of those and to read them again, they   d be new.  The other books that are   but I would rather read a Louis L   Amour  book than     Finchum Westerns? I haven   t read a single one. I   m going to have to.  E. Callahan Have you read any of them, Betty?  B. Callahan That   s the one Penny gave you for your birthday, that   s a new author.  Finchum But you can see pretty well if you can read this.  E. Callahan Oh I can see.  Finchum What   s the biggest challenge for being 100? You can hear pretty well  and see pretty well. Just getting around?  E. Callahan I guess, and grateful that I can get up and go and not have to be waited  on hand and foot.  Finchum Anything on your wish list? Things you wanted to do and didn   t get to?  E. Callahan I can   t think of   have I ever asked for something I didn   t get? Wish I  had that or wish I     B. Callahan I don   t know, you have to answer that.  Finchum Go deep sea fishing?  E. Callahan No   oh wait a minute  Did I out in California? No. Just pond fishing,  deep.  Finchum Ever catch a snake?  19  E. Callahan Well, I thought I had him. He was wiggling so I gave up on it. I think  that was when Margaret was here, wasn   t it?  Finchum What about turtles?  E. Callahan Oh yeah, that   s fun. (Laughs) Getting those turtles to come up and them  trying to get that bait. Oh gosh, thinking about Trap. Lordy, Lord, my  buddy Maudelle and I walked around that Trap. That   s where Patricia  fell.  B. Callahan It   s where you fell.  Finchum Would you wear a hat to keep out of the sun?  E. Callahan My mother, when I was growing up, tried to get me to wear a hat, but I  wouldn   t. I have a picture somewhere of my sister and me, but she  didn   t burn like I did. She was a darker complexion than I was, wasn   t  she? But somewhere I had a picture of her   we were sitting with our  feet in the water.  Finchum And you had on a hat?  E. Callahan Oh I freckled and burned. I was supposed to wear a hat all the time, I   d  take it off after I got away from the house. That thing bothered me.  B. Callahan When you fished with Maudelle, did you wear a hat?  E. Callahan When Maudelle and I fished, why   where   s my picture? There   s  Maudelle. That   s Betty here on this end. That   s Maudelle, you can   t  hardly see her. That   s my oldest daughter Patricia, and JoAnne, and  they   re gone.  Bishop Living in Pawhuska, did you   you talked about the American Indian  woman. Did you ever have any other interactions with the, I guess it  was the Osage Tribe that was here?  E. Callahan Did it?  Bishop Can you tell us a little bit about the Indians   the Native Americans here  in Pawhuska? The Osage? Did you ever have any friends that were  Osage, or neighbors?  E. Callahan When we grew up, we grew up with Indians and they had their own  Indian camp, little part of Pawhuska. It was Indians. The Whitehorns,  why I didn   t think I   d ever forget Moo-Moo.  20  B. Callahan Brunt?  E. Callahan Brunt. That was part white, her dad was an Indian and her mother was  white.  B. Callahan No.  E. Callahan Were they both Indian? Anyway, well     Finchum Would they go to school with you?  E. Callahan We had five schools and you went to the   it didn   t make any difference  what color you were. You went to the school that you were  closest to .  But they did have the Indian Camp School. That was just out there. By  the time you got in high school, why, it didn   t make any difference.  Finchum And was there just one high school? Pawhuska High?  E. Callahan Was just the one.  Finchum What year did you graduate?  E. Callahan  In  1933, I think.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  E. Callahan Yes I did. I loved history, and I had a woman teacher that married Mr.  Joachim. He was a hateful, old, thing. He taught math, and Simpson,  Ms. Simpson, she was a sweetie. What she saw in him (laughs)   course  I was a kid then. Ms. Bensen was my, she was white, she was my  English teacher. We mixed, but they had five schools then.  Finchum Did you do anything with music? Play the piano, or sing, or anything?  E. Callahan I didn   t, because Mom couldn   t get me to sit still on a piano stool, but  Grace did, my sister.  Finchum Did you share a bedroom with her?  E. Callahan Oh yes, had to.  Finchum Share a bed too?  E. Callahan Yes, yes. Well you go in the front door   well I could say we had to be  quiet when we were   Papa worked nights and had to have his sleep, so  21  he had the front bedroom. Grace and I had the bedroom behind that  until she met her husband, Tom, who   s a Greek. They didn   t date long,  she got married right away. Didn   t he have a caf   down by the school?  That   s where she met him. They bought a place down just off of Main  Street. Is that right?  B. Callahan I don   t know.  E. Callahan We lived across the railroad track in a little house that   s still there. The  boys just walked up that block to Main Street and got a ride. Grace and  I   Momma made us go regardless of the weather. We had to go.  Finchum How was that house heated?  E. Callahan Gas heaters.  Finchum Did it have indoor plumbing?  E. Callahan Yes, thank God. (Laughs) The little house is still down there. I think  they use it for sleep-ins for different things that come to town, but it   s  still my little house. And sandstorms, when those terrible sandstorms     you couldn   t see your hand in front of you. Have to have that little  house windows down.

Callahan Michigan, and guess who popped up? She went to Michigan with us.  Brought the new truck home, didn   t know she was in there.

If you can   t, try something else. Try, try again. (Laughs) I don   t know  that I   d change anything. I think about what my sister and I and how  strict Mom was with us.  Finchum Were you that strict with your girls?  E. Callahan Yes. Yessum.  B. Callahan We couldn   t go to the dances either. We had the switch used on us.  (Laughs)  E.

I say that, but that  doesn   t mean there are things that I didn   t particularly like, or maybe  shouldn   t have done, or whatever, but that   s hindsight. What is, is, and  you can   t change it.  Finchum Just keep moving.  E. Callahan So we just look at old Bella (the dog) and tell her,    Keep going.    And  we go.
