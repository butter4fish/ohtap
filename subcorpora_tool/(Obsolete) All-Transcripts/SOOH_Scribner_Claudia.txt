 Finchum  Scribner  Today is September 21, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m here in  Nichols Hills, which is outside of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to speak  with Claudia Scribner regarding her memories and experiences with  former Oklahoma governor and U.S. senator, Henry Bellmon. Thank  you for inviting me into your home.  Thanks for being here.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about yourself beginning with  where you were born, and then we will work our way forward.  I was born in Fargo, North Dakota, but I never actually lived there. It   s  just where my parents were from, that part of the world, Minnesota,  North Dakota. I was actually meant to be born in California, but my  mother went back to be with her mother when I was born. I lived in  several different states and ultimately settled in Southwest Oklahoma  when I was in the fifth grade.  Where did you graduate from high school?  Frederick, Oklahoma.  In high school, were you interested in politics?  No, not really. Not a lot of interest. Probably more interested in politics  than science or math, but not a great interest in politics. Graduated from  Frederick High School in 1968 and went to OSU.  Oklahoma State.  Oklahoma State. Graduated from there in    73 with a BA in English. So  still no great interest in politics.  5  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Okay then that brings us to, at what point did you meet Mr. Henry  Bellmon? How do you refer to him?  I typically referred to him as Henry Bellmon. I don   t know why I   ve  always used both names, but Governor and Senator   it kind of depends  on where we are in time, I guess. My parents were Republicans in  Tillman County. We moved there in 1960 and they were Republicans  when we moved there and there weren   t hardly any others. So when  Henry Bellmon would come to town for his political stops when he was  state chairman or governor the first time or whatever, he would, of  course, always call my parents because they were about the only choice  he had. So probably my path crossed with his as I was growing up. I  don   t have any great memories of that, but I know that he and my  parents were friends and political allies.  Were your parents farmers? What did they do for a living?  My father was in the cattle business. He had a commercial cattle  operation east of town. He moved to Frederick to build it. He had fed  about ten to twelve thousand head of cattle there. He and Henry Bellmon  had that in common too, their agricultural backgrounds. They had a lot  to talk about.  So you graduated from OSU and then what was your first job?  Working for Henry Bellmon.  How did that come about?  He was in his first term in the U.S. Senate, and I had graduated from  OSU. I had really not a clue what I was going to do career wise because  a degree in English, as you may know, is not worth a lot if you don   t  have a teaching certificate, which I didn   t. But anyway, the Watergate  hearings were going on, and I had spent some time that summer after I  graduated watching them on TV, and I was fascinated. That probably  was my first serious interest in politics. In any event, Henry Bellmon  was coming to Lawton, Oklahoma, for a fundraiser for his second term  in the US Senate and as a draw, he brought Howard Baker, who was the  Republican co-chair of the Watergate Committee. I was fascinated by  the whole process, and so my parents invited me to go with them to this  event, and I went along. I visited with Henry Bellmon there and he said,     What are you doing?    I said,    Nothing.    (Laughs) He said,    Why don   t  you come talk about working for me. Come talk to Drew Mason,  actually, about going to work for us in the U.S. Senate office.    So that   s  kind of how that started.  6  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  So you trundled on up to DC?  No, not actually. That was an evening event. The next morning, Drew  called me early in the morning. He was at his desk. He   d been at this  event and he said,    Come meet with me tomorrow.    I went to Oklahoma  City, interviewed with him and maybe, I don   t know, a week, ten days  later, I was working in the Oklahoma City office. I never really worked  in Washington. I went there from time to time. Henry Bellmon was  always very good about letting people trade off. Like if there was  someone in Washington who wanted to come back to Oklahoma for  whatever reason, a sick relative, a wedding or whatever, he   d send one  of us up to fill in and that person would come home for awhile. So  anyway, I did go up there occasionally, but I was based in the Oklahoma  City office.  What were some of the things you would do?  I started as receptionist, which meant answering the phone from eight  a.m. to five p.m. and talking to the widest variety of people you could  ever imagine. It was quite a trial by fire, I tell you, or an education.  Ultimately, when he left the Senate, I was the office manager of the  Oklahoma City office and handled the immigration and State  Department case work.  About how often would he come through the office?  He came quite often because, you   ve probably heard this before, but he  didn   t like Washington. He would rather be in Oklahoma and he, of  course, most would like to be at the farm. Often, we   d get him in the  Oklahoma City office on Fridays or Mondays when he was going back  and forth, or when they were on recess. We didn   t have him on a daily  basis like the Washington people, but we saw quite a bit of him.  Any favorite stories from those early days?  I can   t think of any favorites.  What was your impression of him?  Always a good impression, of course, but I was, I think, surprised at how  thoughtful and considerate he was of everyone on the staff. I was at the  bottom of the totem pole, but he always took time to talk to me and to  see how everything was going. He always seemed interested in what all  of us had to say. My impression was that he was a good, kind man. I was  impressed with how thoughtful he was.  7  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  All these phone calls that you would take, would he return some of  them?  Oh, yeah. He had no fear when it came to talking to people. He would  talk to anybody. We had a lot of interesting people that called our office.  Over the years there were some pretty controversial issues that came up  and of course, the receptionist got the heat of it all, first. I didn   t  ultimately have to deal with everybody, but he was very good about  saying,    Hang up on that person. If you get a call that   s abusive or rude,  do not think twice. You don   t have to talk to those people.    So I always  felt good knowing I had that option, because some days were pretty bad.  (Laughs) I had been in his office and the phone would be ringing and  there   d be nobody else around to pick it up, and he   d just arbitrarily pick  it up and half the time people wouldn   t believe it was really him.    Yes,  this is really Henry Bellmon.    I think he had one lady hang up on him  because she thought he was lying to her. So yeah, he talked to callers.  He had a lot of patience. He   d talk to about anybody about anything.  In that particular office, how many other workers were there?  When I first went to work for Henry Bellmon, Dewey Bartlett had been  elected to the U.S. Senate and he and Henry Bellmon agreed to have  joint offices as a hopefully more efficient and more cost effective way of  conducting their business in Oklahoma. So we had in the Oklahoma City  office, maybe five or six Bellmon staffers and three or four Bartlett  staffers?  So a pretty good size.  Then in Tulsa, it was kind of the opposite. Senator Bartlett had a few  more staffers than we did. They kind of divided it up. Oklahoma City,  budget wise, I think was Bellmon   s and Tulsa was Bartlett   s. Then there  were offices in Lawton and Enid, McAlester. There were six. The  remote ones were two people, usually a field rep and a secretary.  Did you have to help plan some of his schedule when he was going to be  in town or was that handled by someone else?  When I first went to work there, it was done by other people, but  eventually I ended up doing his scheduling in Oklahoma, which was  more a matter of coordinating things. I mean, other staffers would set up  meetings or would want him to be at events. Coordinator, I guess, is the  best way to put it. I did schedule some meetings he wanted to have.  Was he pretty easy to keep on track, time wise, on where to be when?  8  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Yes. He was pretty good. He was always a man of great energy. You   ve  probably heard this, but he started early and he worked late. Sometimes I  think there was more on his schedule than he could realistically handle,  but he could do it. He   d just move right on. He needed staff there to pull  him away sometimes. I   m not so sure that was his fault or the group he  was with. I think he tried real hard to stay on schedule, not keep people  waiting.  Your responsibilities changed, then, I take it, as time went on.  Yeah, but I still think the hardest job I ever did was the first one. Maybe  that   s because I was scared and young.  So    73, you would have been there when he ran for Senate the second  time?  Yes. I went to work, I don   t know, a year-and-a-half or so before he was  elected to his second term.  Any role in the campaign?  Not really. I did a lot of volunteer work in the campaign, just after hours  or weekends.  Have much interaction with Shirley or the girls?  Yeah, some. Gail and I, I think this is right, Gail and I are just about the  same age. We were at OSU at the same time. We didn   t really know  each other well. At that point, they were kind of just starting their  careers and their married lives. I did interact with them more so in later  years than probably at the beginning. Shirley was always a big part of  our staff. She was always a good lady to come by and bring us a pecan  pie or say a good word of encouragement. She was a great, great lady to  know.  Once you were employed, how soon did you make a trip to the farm? Or  did you make a trip?  Oh, yeah, I made lots of trips to the farm. I can   t tell you when the first  one was, but the Bellmons were always good about including the staff  and having events at the farm. I think it was almost like the staff was an  extended part of their family. They were always making us a part of  their lives. Maybe once a year or so they   d have something at the farm. I  do not remember my first trip there, but it seems like maybe he  announced his re-election bid from the farm so that would have been  9  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  some time in that first year. I   m not sure.  Were you surprised when he didn   t run for Senate a third time?  No, not at all. I think he felt he   d served his time. He was ready to leave  Washington. I wasn   t surprised.  What were you doing between the time he was no longer senator and  then when he ran for governor the second time?  I worked for him, most of it.  He was at DHS between that time.  Yes, Cowboy Hall of Fame, DHS, another company down here, the Ram  Group. He had his hand in a lot of different things, but my work, a lot of  it was part-time. So between leaving the Senate and running for  governor, I pretty much worked for him.  Still organizing his days?  Yes. I went with him to DHS when he went there and that, of course,  was definitely a full-time position, as was the work at the Cowboy Hall  of Fame for awhile.  Would he just assume you were going to go with him, or did he ask?  Oh, he always asked. No, I don   t think he assumed anything. But, no, he  was always very thoughtful and respectful in that regard. It was like,    I  think I   m going to do this Claudia, would you like to come along?    I  was always asked or invited, and I felt very lucky to be a part of all that.  What was your role when he was the governor the second time?  I worked on his campaign staff and when he was elected, I think I just  started out. My title was executive assistant, which doesn   t tell you  much, but pretty much I coordinated things. That   s the best word I can  come up with. I did his scheduling, put together meetings, that type of  thing.  Did you do any kind of system for him to keep up with what he was  supposed to do next?  Oh, yeah. He was always very hands-on with everything. I typed up a  little card at the end of each day. I think it was a 3x5 and it started when  his day started and went all the way through, and sometimes it was real  10  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  hard to get it all on there. But front and back or two or three cards,  whatever the case was. So, yeah, I sent that home with him every  evening   and distributed it to everybody else that needed to know what  he was up to. We did monthly schedules, weekly schedules, and daily  schedules. Keep in mind, this is all before computers.  I was going to say on a good old typewriter.  Yeah, and I   m not much of a typist, but anyway. Yeah, he always  wanted to know where he was supposed to be and when.  Would he keep those in his shirt pocket or coat pocket or   ?  Yes, kept him in his shirt pocket. Carried around his little white cards  and they were very important to him.  I wonder what he did with them at the end of the day. Were they kept?  Well, we were under strict instructions in the governor   s office, well and  I suppose in the Senate too, not to throw away anything because OSU  ultimately wanted it all. I would guess that all those little 3x5 cards went  in a box somewhere and you   ve probably got them.  I   ll look.  There should be a ton of them.  Okay. The office in the capitol, would you be the first person a visitor  would come to?  No, I was not the first. When you walked in the front door of the  governor   s office, there was a receptionist and further back, there was  another room that was kind of a waiting room if you were there to see  the governor. Because, keep in mind, a lot of people came there not  particularly to see him. They were meeting with other staff people or  whatever. I was not there either. I was kind of to the other side. I was  next door to his office on what I   ll call the quiet side. And then, Sharon   Sharp , who you   ve talked with, was next to me. Then another lady, Joy  Sullivan, and then Drew  Mason  was at the end of our little row of  people. So we were all pretty close to the governor.  Did you ever beat him to the capitol?  Never. I never beat him to the capitol. (Laughs) Sharon might have beat  him once or twice, because she was always the early person, bless her  heart. It took at least two of us to keep up with covering him during the  11  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  day. I think they met, typically, at seven a.m. in the governor   s office  and Sharon, I think was supposed to leave a little earlier, but I don   t  think she got to do that very often, and then I was the one appointed to  stay a little later. I don   t think I ever beat Henry Bellmon to the office in  all the years, thirty some years, I worked for him.  Very few people     Yeah, and he   d already started his day at the mansion. He did a lot of his  reading   I sent a folder home with him every evening, in the governor   s  office, of a variety of things. Memos from staff, letters from  constituents, whatever he needed to see. Sometimes it was that thick  (gestures an inch), sometimes it was that thick (gestures several inches).  But he took it home at the end of the day and I think typically he read it  before he came in in the morning. So he put in long, long days.  Did you have an opportunity to visit the mansion very often?  Yeah, again, the Bellmons were always eager to include the staff. They  had us over on holidays and just at random, they   d have us over. They  always included staff and extended staff, and they made their home kind  of open to all of us.  When they were having some of the controversial issues, did you have to  deal with the public much during that period?  You mean in the governor   s office? I didn   t bear the brunt of the more  controversial things as much then as I did maybe in the Senate office,  but I still had to deal with a lot of legislators that were not always very  happy with him. I heard a few rants and raves from time to time. Not so  much from the    public    as from the elected officials who were not  always too happy.  Did you have the same instructions that you didn   t have to listen to them  if you didn   t want to?  Probably, yeah, at that point, I think I felt confident enough that I knew  that I didn   t have to put up with some of those people that were kind of  prima donnas, in my opinion. Henry Bellmon was the one that could put  up with them. He had the patience, just incredible. I could hear on the  other side of the wall all sorts of controversy, and he   d just sit and wait it  out. He was quite the diplomat. Difficult times.  Can you recall any details about his office? Did he always work across  the desk from people or did he come around and sit when they were  discussing?  12  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  He had a desk with an arm on it and he did sit across the desk with some  people, I   d say particularly probably staff or small meetings. But if I  remember correctly, the meetings with the legislators, the other end of  his office was a conversation area. Tables and chairs. I mean, like coffee  table and chairs. They would move over there for those debates.  He was very good at crossing party lines, too?  Oh, without question. I think he   s been called the father of the  Republican Party and in my opinion, he was in Oklahoma. Once he got  elected, he pretty much put aside partisan politics and, I think, treated  everyone very equally. Didn   t matter if you were a Democrat or  Republican, if you wanted to meet with him, you were more than  welcome.  I understand he had a habit of appearing to doze off during meetings.  Oh, maybe not just appearing. There may have been a nap or two. He  did on occasion and I think that was one of the roles the staff had to play  was to give him a little kick every now and then if he did. But you know,  when you think about it, the man started his day early, five a.m. or so  and by two or three in the afternoon in some of those long drawn out  probably boring meetings, you can   t blame him for needing a little nap.  And his mind was always going, from what people say     Yeah, taking notes, listening. He loved a good discussion, he liked a  good debate, and he was interested in everything. Always curious. When  someone from OSU came to him about the ground source heat pump and  retrofitting the capitol to save money   I just think about all the various  things that caught his interest. He never thought anything was boring,  that   s for sure.  Did you go with him when he went to OSU?  Yes.  Was that in the late    80s,    90s, somewhere in there?  He went kind of twice. Once he was doing some guest lecturing before  he was elected governor the second time, and then he went back kind of  toward the very end of his career     Did things with research, getting funds or grants.  13  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Yeah. Worked with the vice-president for research   s office at OSU. But  he did also do some work with the political science department.  Taught some?  Yeah. Yeah.  I   m not real familiar with what all he did while he was at OSU. Do you  know a little bit more toward that end?  No, and I was not with him that much at that point. I can   t tell you,  except yeah, it was all about trying to bring in research dollars. I do  know that. Right after he left the governor   s office, he started the Office  of Public Policy Research. A consortium of OU, OSU and TU, trying to  coordinate projects that would bring in research dollars to Oklahoma  from outside sources. A lot of it was Washington, federal money. I don   t  have the name of that quite right, but anyway that   s kind of where he  hung his hat after he left office in    91. Bob Fulton, who was a cabinet  secretary in the governor   s office, and Lex Holmes and several people  got involved, and they made a pretty serious effort to try to help the  universities bring in some more money.  And did you have a role in that?  Yeah, I kept the office open. The office was here in Oklahoma City.  Henry Bellmon came in a day or two a week, usually.  So in thirty-six years, did you know when you first said,    Yes, I   ll do  this,    you   d still be saying yes?  Never in a million years. I never dreamed it would be a career when I  first started. I   m really, really glad it did become a career. He was a great  man to work for. It was a great education.  Were you present during election nights?  Oh, yeah.  Watch parties?  Oh, yeah, you couldn   t miss that. There were some pretty tight election  nights. I   m sure you   ve heard about that, too, the close calls and let me  see, I guess it must have been his second when his election was  challenged. In his second term for the U.S. Senate, we were up half the  night. I don   t think we went to bed knowing for sure who won. Then he  had me calling my parents telling them to go down and guard the ballot  14  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  boxes. It was a pretty stressful time. The election was challenged and  then we went on and on and on waiting to see who was actually finally  the winner.  At any point along the way, if he hadn   t been re-elected, did you have a  backup plan for what you wanted to do?  No, not really.  You knew he was going to win.  I knew he   d win, yeah.  And historically, he had.  Yeah, he had only one loss and that was very early on. But all of his  elections were pretty close. They kept us up wondering for sure what  was going to happen. He could pull it off. I think he had, I don   t know,  he just had the ability to convince people he knew what he was doing.  Whether they agreed with him, philosophically or politically, whether  they agreed with him, they had trust that he would do what he believed  was the right thing. I think they respected him as a man of principle and  integrity and consequently, gave him their vote, despite the fact that he  didn   t make them too happy along the way in previous elected offices.  He was always a little controversial.  Someone was telling us early on, he had a habit of putting his hands in  his pockets. Shirley sewed them shut so he couldn   t do it.  Yeah, I think those first what they called    two-party tea parties,    that  was kind of before my time, too, but I   ve heard that story that the  campaign people were saying,    He just looks so awkward, he keeps  putting       So Shirley took care of that. (Laughs) I think that was  another thing that attracted him to people was that he was such a  common man. He wasn   t articulate and he wasn   t   I think he appealed  to the average person and voter. He was just such a people person, I  guess. He was not a good speaker, but what he said was worth hearing.  He just didn   t have the ability, kind of like me, to say it very well, I  think. But I think people admired that about him, that in spite of his not  being so eloquent, he   d still get up and tell you what he thought.  Very genuine.  Very genuine. True. That came across, I mean, there was no slickness  about him, that   s for sure.  15  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  I know there   s a paper trail that people can follow to learn about his  votes legislation, but is there anything that   s not commonly known that  you can think of?  In his voting?  No, just anything in general?  Oh     His naps are no longer a secret, now.  No, I   m not sure they ever were. I think he got his picture in the paper a  time or two napping. When he was a director at DHS and George Nigh  was making a State of the State address and all the agency directors of  course went over and sat upstairs at the capitol, I think there is a picture  of Henry Bellmon sleeping. It was on the front page of the paper,  napping during Governor Nigh   s address. If I remember correctly,  ultimately, Governor Nigh signed that picture and said something clever.  So he didn   t take it personally.  Did he even snack during the day?  Oh, he snacked. What I remember is, he often times drove himself  places. From time to time, he had a lot of staff and there was somebody  to ride with him and drive with him, but in the interims, between elected  offices, he was often on his own and I think he liked it that way. But he  always had a jar of peanuts or something in his car that he could reach  for if he thought he was going to go to sleep driving. Soft drinks, he  liked Dr. Peppers. He had a little closet at the governor   s office that was  filled with snacks. I don   t remember anything other than the peanuts in  the car but I think that was more of a safety thing, something to do to  stay awake. (Laughs) He liked to go out to eat. He   d grab whoever was  around on the staff and we   d go to Leo   s and have barbecue. He loved  Mexican food. He   d eat Mexican food probably any time anyone would  invite him.  Shirley, of course, was a great cook. He did tell me once when he was  on the farm, I don   t remember what   when he was not an elected  official and he was home at the farm. Shirley was busy, probably  making dolls or doing something. He told me how he made grilled  cheese sandwiches, which was to toast the bread, put the cheese in the  middle and the important part was wrapping it in a paper towel and  putting it in the microwave so that it didn   t get moist I guess it was. I  don   t know, I   ve never tried it. I think he thought he was pretty smart  that he   d perfected grilled cheese sandwiches without grilling them.  16  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  (Laughs) Other than that, I don   t think he was much of a cook. He didn   t  need to be because Shirley took good care of that department.  Of the various jobs that he had from senator to governor, do you have a  feel for what his favorite was?  Oh, I think without question it was governor.  Yet, he chose not to run for a second term.  Well     He was older at that point, too.  Yeah, at that point, I think he was ready to go to the farm. That was  always his first love. He had served two terms as governor. They were  twenty-four years apart, but he had done it twice. I don   t know, I think  he accomplished a lot of what he set out to accomplish in his second  term as governor. I think he was in a position to feel like it was time to  go home and plant the wheat, count the cows, and take a little break,  maybe. He didn   t slow down, too much, but I think that last four years  was probably enough.  Do you know if OSU called him, or if he went knocking on their door for  something to do after that?  I   m not certain, but I   m pretty sure they contacted him. They were wise  to do so. He had a lot to offer.  Were you surprised when they decided to name the research building  after him?  No, I think it was very appropriate to name it after him. He worked real  hard to bring research to OSU, research and research dollars. However,  you   ve probably heard this from more than one person, he really didn   t  like to have things named after him. I don   t know what he would have  said if he were asked that. I think he would have felt very complimented  and honored to be asked, but people used to write in or call in and want  to name their highways or buildings after him all through the years. He  always diplomatically turned it down. It   s a great honor, and it should be  at OSU, and it   s very fitting and appropriate, and I   m glad they did it.  I   m sorry I didn   t get to attend the event.  See the bust?  I   ve seen pictures.  17  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  It   s nice. They did a very good job with it.  Good, good. I   ll get up there one of these days and see it.  Gail  Wynne  thought the same thing that he might have been okay with  the name, but it would have had to take some talking.  Yeah, he would have had to have his arm twisted. But of all the times he  was asked, that is the one that he would appreciate the most, and he  would be more inclined to accept, I guess. Because his heart was always  at OSU.  He graduated from there.  Oklahoma A M, yeah.  Part of what helped with you, too?  Yeah, I think that made a difference. (Laughter) I think that got his  attention. Well, at the time I was hired, which was 1973, I think there  was some transition in the Washington office. There were people  leaving, I don   t remember exactly, I mean it was before I got there but  Henry Bellmon had a woman on his staff, Shirley Bridges. Her name is  Shirley Walker today, but anyway. He had asked her to do some  recruiting to staff his Washington office because of these people retiring  or leaving, maybe because he was going to run for a second term, people  had made up their mind to come home or whatever. I don   t know, but  anyway. He put Shirley in charge and she went to, I know OSU and I  think OU, and I   m not sure where else and recruited from the college  campuses. That   s not how I was hired, but it was at that same time. He  felt real strongly about hiring people from Oklahoma and always did.  We didn   t have a lot of outsiders on our staff in Washington, or ever in  the governor   s office, for sure. I thought it was always good that he gave  those opportunities to Oklahomans.  Once given that opportunity, they pretty much stayed loyal to him.  I don   t know if you went around and checked that you would find a  more loyal following than he has of former staff members. Many of us  are still in contact with each other. Like I said earlier, it kind of became  one big family.  Why do you think that   s so?  Well, it   s all because of him, and Shirley, too. He inspired that. We all  18  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  respected him, but it was also easy to know him and to like him. He just  made everyone very comfortable. I   m sure there   s some U.S. senators  and governors that staff hardly ever sees them, much less sits down and  plays a game of bridge with them, or whatever, gets invited to their farm  to have barbecue or fried fish. But he had a way of making everyone feel  welcome and comfortable and proud. Very proud to be working for him.  I just feel very fortunate that I had the opportunity. It was just a quirk of  fate but now here we are thirty-some years later and I   m here thinking of  all the many, many good memories and the education I received. I mean,  it was better than, definitely better than four years at OSU. But, quite a  man. He   ll always be so well thought of, I think, by all of us that worked  for him. I don   t think you   ll hear an unkind word.  Do you recall the last conversation you had with him?  Yeah. I remember this. A former staff member was going to be in town.  Who that was, I can   t quite recall. Often, I would have people over to  my house to get together with him because Oklahoma City was more  convenient, usually, than the farm. So I   d invite a few people over for  lunch, or whatever, to say hello. Somebody was going to be here to visit  and I   d called him to say,    Whoever, is going to be here next Thursday,  would you like to come down and have lunch with us?    He was always  very eager to do that. He looked forward, I think, to seeing staffers that  had moved out and about. So a day or two before that lunch day, he  called me and said,    Claudia, I don   t think I   m going to be able to come  on Thursday, I   m in the hospital.    That was the last conversation I had.  So that was just, you know, literally four or five days before he died.  Had you gone to his birthday party a few years before that? Didn   t they  have his 85th birthday bash or something at the farm?  Oh, I   m sure I did. Yeah, I did. Some of those events all kind of run  together. Had a big birthday party for him in Perry one year. I don   t even  remember what birthday that was. Anyway, lots of birthday celebrations,  but I did keep in touch with him a lot by phone and like I said,  occasionally these get-togethers with co-workers.  So you might speak with him a couple times a year or more often than  that?  More often than that, probably. Yeah. He liked to keep up with everyone  and know what everybody was up to. He always made time for  everyone. He had a lot on his plate, even as he retired with farming and  cattle and grandchildren, but he still liked to keep up with the staff.  A statesman to the end.  19  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Finchum  Scribner  Truly. Without question. Always a statesman. Good, kind, generous  man   there just aren   t a lot of elected officials today that you can say all  that about, I don   t think. Maybe it   s because I don   t know them as well,  but I don   t think so.  You don   t hear about them.  No, no.  Anything else you want to add before we sign off?  No, I can   t really think of anything other than how privileged I feel to  have known him and to have worked for him.  Okay, well thank you very much.  Thank you, Tanya.  -------  -------
