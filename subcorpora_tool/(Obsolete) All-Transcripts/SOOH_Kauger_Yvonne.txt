 Little Thunder  Kauger  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday, January  22, 2014. I   m interviewing Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Yvonne  Kauger for the Oklahoma Native Artists Project, sponsored by the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at OSU. We   re at the  judicial center on the capitol grounds of Oklahoma City. Justice Kauger,  your life has an amazing trajectory from growing up in Colony,  Oklahoma, to becoming the first woman chief justice of the Oklahoma  Supreme Court. Your story can be found in OSU   s Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame digital collection, but today I   m here to talk with you  about your love of Native art, your work in helping found the Red Earth  Indian Arts Festival, and other matters pertaining to Native art in  Oklahoma. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Thank you for asking me.  You grew up on a farm. Did you have much art in the home growing up?  My daddy had an Acee Blue Eagle, and our house burned when I was in  the eighth grade. I thought about that the other day. That was one of the  great tragedies, and that was one of the things that he grieved for most, I  think. He went to school with Archie Blackowl, so that sort of  connects   they were best friends. He was a little town boy, and Archie  was at the school at Colony. They threw rocks at each other as children  and grew to be best friends.  That   s a neat story. When you were little, do you remember a moment of  first being aware of art as art?  Art as art, I don   t think so. I just always liked it. My grandmother died  when my daddy was six months old, and my great-grandfather, who was  a German from Russia, hired the Cheyenne women to be my daddy   s  nannies. We were always involved with the powwow, and I went to  5  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  school in what was an Indian school, and was always aware that it  wasn   t that far removed from Little Bighorn and that there may have  been warriors there still alive. Those sort of things, I was aware of, Chief  Annanita Washee sitting on the bench in front of Payne   s Store with his  braids. As an adult, I regretted that people were not more aware to  involve those wonderful historic figures in bringing them to school,  letting us hear those stories.  Right. So you mentioned the Acee Blue Eagle in your home. Do you have  another memory of seeing a Native painting growing up?  Some Archies, but it really wasn   t emphasized that much in a place  where it should   ve been.  Do you have any memories of meeting Native artists when you were  young?  No, not really. It was just, it was there: the powwow and the dancing and  the drums they were   . When I was a little girl, they were still dancing  in the summertime at the powwow grounds at Colony, the Cheyenne-  Arapaho. I would go down to dance, and my mother would come and  retrieve me. I never learned to dance, and I still can   t dance. When I was  adopted in 1984  by the Cheyenne-Arapaho tribe  after I was appointed  to the court, I was really excited. My mother said she couldn   t  understand why I wanted to be adopted because I had two perfectly good  parents, and I did. I had wonderful parents.  After the ceremony and the dance, I went over and said to her,    Well,  Mother, what   d you think?    She said,    You still haven   t learned to  dance.    It was all her fault. It was all her fault. (Laughter) I   m a terrible  dancer. Barbara Poe at Red Earth was there at the beginning. She knew I  couldn   t dance, but she said,    Yvonne, it doesn   t matter that your feet  are in the right spot. We know that your heart is.    (Laughter) Oh, I was  going to tell you, I wasn   t the first woman chief justice.  Thank you for that correction.  Alma Wilson was. I was appointed by Governor  George  Nigh two  years after Justice Wilson. I was the first woman to be both vice chief  justice and chief justice, but Alma was the first. Justice  Robert   Lavender waived his turn so Alma could be chief justice as the first  woman chief justice. Governor Nigh appointed her in 1982, and he  appointed me in 1984. When Hardy Summers was appointed, I believe  in 1985, somewhere within a year after I was appointed, he said he lived  in mortal fear that a woman would apply for the position he wanted  because he had heard Governor Nigh say he really liked those women,  6  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  and he thought he   d just keep right on appointing them. (Laughter)  That   s a great story. Thank you. Were you interested in drawing or  painting growing up?  I am not an artist. In fact, when DG  Smalling  and I collaborated on the  painting that I showed you of what   s called The Oklahoma Nine, the  members of our court in their districts, I told him that I wanted it to  represent something about us, something personal, not just holding a  scales but something personal to us. He said he didn   t know anything  about them, and I said, well, I did. He said,    Just show me,    so I drew  stick pictures for him. (Laughter) But I do sculpt. I do people. My staff  calls them my Kaugirls. They   re based on my grandmother Annie Belle  Gordon Bottom, who was in Oklahoma. My great-grandfather came for  the  Land  Run, and the other great-grandfather was here before  statehood. Fred was at Colony before statehood.  And you sculpt with     Clay.     clay, okay.  In fact, there   s one of my people out in the bookshelf out there.  I   m going to check that out. Do you remember any significant art  experiences in primary school or secondary school?  I still remember the vase I drew in El Reno, which wasn   t very good.  We made a puppet, and my puppet was one of the ugliest puppets ever  made out of papier-m  ch  . I really, I like my people. My people turn out  okay. I like to think that maybe while I can   t execute, I have a really  good eye. I know what looks good, I know how to hang it, and I  certainly know whether I like it or not. (Laughs)  You played basketball with Jeri Redcorn.  And we were good  We were good. You just ask Phillip  Cross . He still  tells people that I was really good. I was a longshot artist in the days that  only counted two points. Now, there   s just no telling what we could   ve  done if they had scored my things three instead of two. (Laughs)  I was wondering if she   s the only high school classmate you had that  went on to do something in Native art.  No. The Cross family   s very artistic. Phillip made that wonderful  7  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Geronimo bow over there on the wall, and he is highly recognized as a  wonderful bow maker. I think that Carol does some things, and I know  Jennifer does shawls, very beautiful shawls. Mary Evelyn, their cousin  whose great-grandmother was my daddy   s nanny, Howling Man  Woman, made little people. Keepers of Life she called them. Mostly they  were women with babies, lovely little, sort of primitive-looking pieces.  Did you have a couple of those? Did your dad have a couple?  Yes.  You attended Southwestern Oklahoma State University and became a  medical technician to pay your way through law school?  That   s right.  Did you have any exposure   did you take an art class at Southwestern?  An art appreciation class. I finished in three years. I was sort of in a  hurry, (Laughs) but as I look back, I would   ve done it differently. In  fact, one of the classes I did do differently and I   m very grateful for was  Oklahoma History. I didn   t intend to take Oklahoma History. I   d had  Oklahoma History, which they don   t teach now, which is a shame. I  signed up for Professor Richardson   s course on speech. I never wanted  to be a public person, but I thought maybe I should take this speech  course. It was a Tuesday/Thursday, and I went on Tuesday, and he  recorded half the class. On Thursday, he played them back, but he didn   t  get to the Ks yet.  He was so brutal, and I hate the way I sound, anyway, that I dropped the  class and signed up for Herschel Risinger   s Oklahoma History course,  which I   ve never regretted. It was incredible. I love history, and  particularly, Oklahoma History. That   s what we   ve tried to do in our  book that we   re publishing is to tell the history of the courts and the  judiciary through the art in our building. It   s not really a history book,  and it   s not really an art book, but it all ties together. We hope they will  use it in schools to teach a painless and beautiful history, not that our  history has been painless, but that the book is painless and beautiful.  Wonderful way to get both of those knowledge bases across. When did  you purchase your first piece of Native artwork?  The first good piece, (I purchased, probably, a little piece earlier) the  very best piece, still one of my very best pieces and the beginning of my  real collection was the day David Boren was inaugurated as Governor of  the State of Oklahoma. I was working for Justice  Ralph  Hodges as the  8  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  first woman to be a staff lawyer for the Supreme Court, and Governor  Boren had a Native American art exhibition in connection with this  inauguration. George    Woogie    Watchetaker was there, and he had his  piece that had won First Prize at the Heard Museum in Phoenix. It   s of  the Cheyenne and Sioux women after the Battle of Little Bighorn, with  the blue coats on spears, and dancing. It   s red and black, which are two  of my favorite colors, anyway. It   s a big piece, and I bought it. That was  the first really good piece that I bought. Later I got to ride in parades  with Woogie Watchetaker, and it was just incredible. (Laughter)  What was the first Native art show that you attended?  I don   t remember. I do not remember what was the first one. It wasn   t  that one, but that would be pretty close. One of the reasons for the  genesis of Red Earth was that there was no place to go where Native  artists were featured. You   ll remember that in the early days, they were  frozen out of the Santa Fe market. I always wanted to have an art gallery  in Santa Fe, but I knew I could never afford it. On the way to Santa Fe  one summer, early summer, it hit me that I could have my own gallery in  Colony, Oklahoma, in the old post office that my great-grandfather had  built that looks like Santa Fe. It   s stucco, looks a little bit like a jail,  maybe, but it was the post office. It   s about eighteen by thirty, just one  straight shot. I came back and told my daddy that I was going to open an  art gallery on Labor Day weekend with a powwow, and I was going to  have Archie Blackowl as the first featured artist. My mother said,    No  way      And this was what year?  That would be 1981 or   2. She said,    No way     and I said to my daddy,     I haven   t asked you for anything since I asked you not to go to the  Army in World War II. I want it, and you   re going to give it to me.    He  was getting ten dollars a month rent from Payne   s Store for it. It was full  of crickets. They were using it for feed. He helped me, and we opened  Labor Day weekend. Archie Blackowl was the featured artist. All the  invitations for twenty-five years were lithographs signed and numbered  by the artists.  I wrote a letter to Archie because I told Daddy,    I   ve got to get Archie  before he dies.    Now, Archie would   ve been in his seventies then.  Daddy called me and said,    You need to come out. There   s someone  that   s coming tomorrow to visit with you.    It was Archie. When I saw  him, he said,    I got your letter, and it bothered me, and so I took it to my  mother,    who was ninety-six,    and asked her what she thought about it.     (Laughs) He agreed to be the first featured artist.  9  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  What a wonderful way to advertise a show with those lithograph  invitations.  They came from all   someone came the first year, even, from Egypt to  Colony, Oklahoma. My mother said,    Johnny, it   s all over. They   re here  from Egypt.    (Laughs) He had said,    I   ll do it, but nobody will come.     Well, they really did.  At that point you were practicing, you were still working as...  I was working for Justice Hodges.  Okay. So you had some connections. You were starting to get to know  some people to let them know about your gallery, as well.  Well, actually I was   I told you before, I never wanted to speak. I think  it   s really ironic that I got a speaking engagement call just moments ago.  I realized that in order to do this, I had to speak for my artists because  they were so shy and it was so difficult for them to get a market. That  little bitty gallery in Colony and the Cheyenne-Arapaho powwow is the  genesis for Red Earth. It   s just on a bigger scale.  I   m going to go back just a moment or two in time. Did you start out  consciously thinking after you bought Archie   s piece, thinking of  yourself as a collector   or Woogie   s, I guess, I   m sorry   thinking of  yourself as a collector, or did that just kind of evolve?  I would say it evolved.  Did you notice any kind of pattern to your collecting, in terms of theme  or style?  No, I like it all. The pattern to my collecting after I opened the gallery  was I tried to make sure that everyone sold something, and so I would  buy things to make sure that if the public didn   t buy it that there would  be some sales. Of course, I had the best artists. The best artists are here.  There   s no question about it. There were things I couldn   t afford. I can  remember a Mirac Creepingbear piece. I had some nice Miracs, but the  one I really wanted, it was four hundred dollars, and I didn   t have four  hundred dollars. That was the gallery discount. I didn   t have four  hundred dollars to buy it. It   s down at the Fred Jones  Jr. Museum of  Art  now. Mr.  Richard  Fleischaker bought it. And I never could afford  Merlin. He was always just   but my son-in-law finally bought me a  Merlin Little Thunder. (Laughter)  Did you develop friendships with other collectors or     10  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Yes.  I wondered if that impacted your collecting.  No. The artists impacted it much more than the collectors did.  What is the first Native art event aside from, you know, working your  own gallery that you got involved in as a volunteer?  Well, it wasn   t   I worked at the first arts festival  Festival of the Arts   in Oklahoma City.  Spring arts festival?  Yes, which wasn   t a Native event, but there were a couple. I think Bert   Seabourn  was probably there. It didn   t have anything to do with Native  art, but I was very active in Lyric Theatre. I ran the concession stand  there for sixteen years while they were at OCU  Oklahoma City  University  and was president on the board. I worked a lot in civic  organizations before I was named to the court. We can   t raise money, so  that sort of ended my volunteer work.  You mentioned, and I   d like to pick this up again, that the Oklahoma  artists were frozen out of Santa Fe, and you had talked to me about the  fact that it was initially focused just on Southwest artists. At some point  they let a small percentage of out-of-staters in.  They did, and then they won. Then they were featured, (Laughter) and  then they were president of the board. Les Berryhill grew up to be  president of the board.  So as you were thinking about the possibility of doing a Native arts  festival in Oklahoma City, who else were you talking to?  Well, I talked to Phil Lujan was one of the first people I talked to. We  were at a meeting at OCU with Wilma Mankiller, and I mentioned it to  Phil that I sort of had this in the back of my mind. Then I had lunch with  Ken Bonds, that I   d known from the Lyric board, and told him the  National Cowboy Finals had left. I said,    There   s a way to do this. This  is what ought to happen.    He became very excited; he   s Cherokee. He  became excited, and we talked to Ed Cook down at the chamber and  Kathleen Marks. Ed Cook was very excited about it, at the Oklahoma  City Chamber of Commerce. They gave us some help. We talked to  other people, and it just sort of grew. Ken definitely was very active.  11  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  So you   re having these conversations around 1970     When would that be? It   ll be twenty-eight   I think Red Earth is twenty-eight  years, where the Sovereignty Symposium is twenty-seven, so    86,  maybe?  Okay.  Time goes so fast. I   m not very good at the dates.  The chamber had a positive response?  Yes, then we talked to Kelly Haney and Allie Reynolds. Allie was  wonderful. Kelly, at the time, was chair of the Appropriations  Committee in the Senate. Governor  Henry  Bellmon was very helpful,  and Rodger Randle, who was president pro tem of the Senate, and Leroy  Bridges. Without Governor Bellmon there wouldn   t have been any prize  money because he authorized, he said he,    thought they could find it,  couldn   t they, Rodger and Kelly?     That   s wonderful, for the first show. Who went about and filed the  incorporation papers or did some of the     I   m not so certain that Allison didn   t, but I   m not sure.  Allison?  Allison Cave. She was my staff lawyer at the time.  How did you decide on a location?  Oh, I know. I think maybe it was Jack Blankenship. Maybe Jack did it.  You know, after I got them together, I just sort of disappeared.  So they sort of formed     There had been a group out at the Kirkpatrick  Center , where they met  out there. There   d been this group that had sort of tried to do this. Kelly  had been in it; Lou Kerr was early in it; several people that became very  active when it became Red Earth. They had never put on the show or the  dance, so they sort of merged after a year or so into Red Earth.  What were your expectations? You got the working committee together.  They started working.  Well, I expected it   d be bigger than it is now. I really thought it would  12  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  be. I mean, I   m really glad that it   s the way it is, but I   ve been  disappointed it hasn   t had as big a crowd as I think it ought to have. At  the time there was a white buffalo in Colony, and I could kind of  envision Carol Pigg   s white buffalo running through gray smoke into the  arena. That   s one thing that never got done. (Laughter)  How about the first year of the Festival?  Oh, the first year was wonderful because we didn   t know if anyone  would come. Phil Lujan and I met on Main and Broadway before the  first parade. They came   pickups, blankets. It wasn   t pretty, it wasn   t  fancy, but it was there, dancers in buckskin and feathers. We looked at  each other and looked down at our arms, and we both had goose bumps.  It was just a goose bump moment. Then dancing with Allie in the grand  entry was fantastic. I said to him,    Look at this, Allie. Isn   t this great?  Isn   t this great?    He said,    My knees are killing me.    (Laughter) But  Allie stood there on that Sunday evening and handed out the checks to  all the winners. We wanted to make sure that   and Ken Bonds. They  kept the bank open so they could cash them.  You mentioned in one article that you deliberately wanted to time it  around the Indian law symposium because you knew that would     Well, we did that   the next year we did the Sovereignty Symposium.  We did it because it   we have a hundred faculty. Every person on the  panel could be the keynoter for the Sovereignty Symposium. This year  we will have the Baroness of Winterbourne, a member of the House of  Lords, who   s coming back for her second appearance, Emma Nicholson,  and Beverley McLachlin, the Chief Justice of Canada. The Warrior  Woman by Dr. Dick West, there, will be the poster because we have two  warrior women. That   s my logo: Cheyenne Warrior Woman. The  enticement is Red Earth for this faculty to come from literally all over  the world.  Yeah, that was a very good move, I think. Were you still involved with  Red Earth when the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed? I  wondered how that was handled.  I was there. I was having an art show, and one of the artists that     because mine was not confined. You didn   t have to be a card-carrying   .  Patrick Riley, who   s done this wonderful, wonderful thirty-foot  sculpture for our building, participates in the show, in fact, ran it the  year after I gave the building to Southwestern. Because of that act, we  were featuring Jeanne Rorex, and she didn   t have her card. In order to  comply with the law (I was in Quebec City, Canada) Kyle  Shifflett   steamed open all the invitations before they went out and put a  13  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  disclaimer in. So yes, I was around. (Laughter)  What did you learn from   we   ll kind of jump back to your gallery  experience which was such a great way, I   m sure, to get to know the  artists and know the behind-the-scenes stuff that goes on. What else did  you learn from opening that gallery?  That you probably can   t make any money, and I never thought I would  in the art business. That for three days a year, I had a gallery that would  match any gallery anywhere in the United States, in the world, for  Native American art. We had the very best artists: Ben Harjo, Dr. Dick  West, Archie Blackowl, Merlin Little Thunder. That was the reward,  was getting to meet them, have friends.  It was a fun show to do, with Colony powwow. I remember that. When  did you start overseeing the collection of art for the judicial center?  Well, this building took me thirty years, three bond issues, and 250  dozen cookies. I was named     Explain about the cookies. (Laughs)  Oh, I will explain about the cookies. When I went to Colony High  School, they substituted home economics for my science courses. I was  a med tech before I was a lawyer, so I majored in biology with a minor  in chemistry. At the time, it made it very hard in the chemistry  particularly, not to have had any background whatsoever. I really, at the  time, actually, I wanted to do cattle judging instead of home economics,  but they kicked me out of that. I am really good at judging cattle, at  least. (Laughs) So I   m in home economics, and I really resented it, but I  learned to make oatmeal crispy cookies in Helen Brown   s home  economics class. Among other things, she was a wonderful teacher. I  still have some great recipes. When I started going to the Appropriations  Committee meetings, I would bake Helen Brown   s oatmeal crispy  cookies, and they came to expect them. I told my daughter that this  building is built not out of mortar, but out of cookie dough, and she  didn   t believe me.  M. J. Van Deventer got married a year ago November, at All Souls   Episcopal  Church, and I went to the wedding. She   s originally from  Muskogee. Jonna went with me. The former longtime chair of the  Appropriations Committee of the House, Bill Settle, was there. He saw  me, and he ran across the room. Instead of the first thing out of his  mouth being,    Yvonne, it   s so good to see you,    he said in front of  Jonna, which just made it perfect,    Are you still making those cookies?     (Laughs) It turned out that it was a better thing that I have that cookie  14  Little Thunder  Kauger  recipe than I had preparation for chemistry. (Laughter) I have written in  our book that we   re doing of the art in the building, Robert Henry has  written the foreword, and Dr. Bob Blackburn   s written the afterword,  and I have written the last word, and the last thing in the book is the  cookie recipe with the cookies framed like a painting because they were  instrumental in this building. (Laughter)  That   s wonderful. Can you take us through a little bit of the process by  which you acquired the art? I know that some of     Yes. I was named the chair of the Building Committee. I supervised the  building, which was really great fun and a lot of work. I had good help  with Kyle, my staff lawyer, who would rather be a decorator, probably,  than a lawyer. We had a great time doing it, along with David Dixon and  Ronnie Nunn, and people that helped us on different facets of it. Paul  Haley, the capitol architect, was terrific. This took quite a long time.  Thanks to Art in Public Places, 1   percent of the amount of the building  shall be spent on public art. If you   ll see different renderings (some I   d  like, some not so much) down Lincoln Boulevard, they have spent their  money on, usually, maybe, one giant piece or two.  We have the Veterans Memorial right out my window, and it was in  horrible disrepair. The sidewalks were cracked; the vegetation was  overgrown. The names of the veterans who gave their lives for this  country to defend our Constitution, which is what we do every day, it  seemed most appropriate that we spend some of that Art in Public Places  on restoration of the memorial because they would never appropriate the  money for it. We did a third of the money for Art in Public Places went  to restore Jay O   Melia   s Veterans Memorial. Even going back as far as  when Blake Wade was director of the  Oklahoma  History Center, I  knew they had some nice art. He had let me look at it. I was particularly  looking for a  Stephen  Mopope that had been in Hardy Summer   s office  when he was chief justice. I called Jeff Briley over at the History Center  and said,    I   m looking for a Mopope.    I described it. Robert Henry gave  me the prototype for it, the sketches, in one of the offices back there.  Well, he couldn   t find it. He said,    I have Mopopes. You need to come  and see the Mopopes I have.    When I did, those four-feet-by-ten-feet  murals that used to be at Southwestern in the library where I went to  college were there, and I knew exactly where they went. It turns out life  is a circle. Patrick Riley had been head of the Art Department at  Southwestern, and he discovered them. They cut them down. They were  in the library. They cut them down, (you can still see the little cuts on  them where the woodwork was) rolled them up, and put them in the  attic, and were ready to throw them away, these priceless things. It took  probably five or six sessions for Kyle and I to go over with Jeff Briley  15  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  and go through every piece of art they have, the people   s art in the  History Center that they would never see. No one would ever see it. It   s  in the basement.  The Herbert Adams sculptures of Wiley Post and Will Rogers, which  were commissioned by Frank Phillips in 1934 after they died in the  airplane crash, cost  25,000. Now Herbert Adams    pieces are in the  rotunda of the capitol. In today   s dollars that would be  406,000 that he  paid for these two pieces. They were sitting on the floor in the basement  because they have no place to show the art. I call us History Center  South because we   re the gallery. If you   ll look in the book, it will say  that the contract says it   s on a ten-year loan with the opportunity to  extend, but I   m not giving it back. The book says it   s on permanent loan.  (Laughs) I don   t have any place to keep it, so that   s going to be it. They  were very generous to let us do   and it   s good for everyone because  some of the pieces required restoration. They didn   t have the money to  do it, and they would never be restored or seen. This is the people   s  building, and it   s open to the public. There are places you have to get  someone to let you into, but the general major part of it, anyone can  come anytime and see the art. We   re very proud to showcase it.  What are you hoping that   as the public finds out about it, I   m sure  many more people will be coming through. What are you hoping that  they   ll take away from being able to see this art?  Amber Sharples runs the Oklahoma Arts Council now, and she brought  a regional group of art directors from seven states to see it. They could  not believe it. They were just so overwhelmed that Oklahoma had done  this. When people come to see the building, I think that   s what they have  been taking away. They can   t believe that we did it, and we did it with  pretty much what we had. Sixty-five percent of the art was from the  collection that would never be shown. Then the artists have been very  generous to donate pieces. Jim Bruce donated The Eagle in memory of  Justice  Marian  Opala, one of our colleagues. Brent Learned came to  the artist party at the Sovereignty Symposium the first year we were  open. I had bought a buffalo from him for the collection from Red Earth.  He called me and said,    Yvonne, I saw my buffalo.    I said,    Yes, and  it   s wonderful.    He said,    Yes, but it   s very lonely. My buffalo is very  lonely. I would like to donate two pieces to go on each side of my  buffalo so it will not be lonely.    So these wonderful Fancy Dancers are  on each side of his buffalo, and it is not lonely anymore. (Laughs)  That   s a great story. What other opportunities do you to seek to provide  for the artists here?  Well, I think it   s a good opportunity to have their art here. Ryan  16  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Cunningham, who   s not a Native American artist   and it   s not confined  to Native American art. It   s probably about half and half when you  analyze it. He   s a young lawyer and donated his piece, just to have it  here. I think that   s pretty wonderful. I think the artists are   they were so  excited; I did a New Year   s Eve party, my seventh annual New Year   s  Eve party. This time we previewed the book. Many of the artists were  there, and they were excited to see themselves in the book. It   s pretty  cool to be in the book. I guess one of the regrets I have is that Dr. Dick  West and Archie Blackowl aren   t in the book because the History Center  didn   t have pieces, and I   m not ready to give mine away yet. (Laughter)  Not donating it for your book. (Laughs)  So part of it is who was already in the collection, and then we were able  to find some others.  You   ve received the Governor   s Arts Award twice. Do they give that  award twice to the same person very often?  I don   t know, but I surely am glad to get it. (Laughs) The last award was  to our committee, the thirteen members on the art committee. It   s  required by statute sort of. We had wonderful members on our  committee. The then Chief Justice Steven W. Taylor nominated us for  the Governor   s Arts Award for the art in the building. He said at the time  if we did not win it, they should abolish it, (Laughter) so I was very glad  we won. Robert Henry and Bob Blackburn were on the committee.  That   s the first time Robert Henry   s won an arts award, and he was very  proud to get the Governor   s Arts Award. When his cousin was the  Governor, he didn   t get it, although his wife did.  And then you were nominated by yourself, (is that right) too?  No, no, I   ve never nominated myself.  No, I mean you   ve received an award     Oh, oh, yes I received it myself        yourself.     for the work with Red Earth and the Colony gallery, and the  promotion of art, yes. I think Lou Kerr nominated me for that.  What changes have you observed in the Native art landscape since Red  Earth opened? It   s a lot of time to cover, I know, but     17  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Well, one thing that   s happened is, of course, they   ve been accepted and  acknowledged in Santa Fe. I think much more, it   s opened up some eyes.  I hate to see galleries closing. I   m really glad, you know   people have  asked me if the building is my legacy, and it is not. My daughter and my  two grandsons are my legacy. My daughter was president of Red Earth  and was highly instrumental in getting them out of debt and moving  them downtown to where they have a gallery open. People come and  buy stuff, and I   m really glad to see that. I think that is good for artists  and for Oklahoma City. Then my grandson  Jay  is the youngest  member of the Board of Red Earth, so I   m glad to see that. Winston   Scambler , who has to do everything his big brother   s doing, just can   t  wait until he thinks he   s old enough to do that. That   s one thing. I hope it  educates   .  When you ask me what is my first piece of art, well, my grandchildren   s  first piece of art is very clear. I went to England where Jay  Scambler   was born and took him a N  ske'e, a Cheyenne sculpture of a  grandmother and a grandchild. That was his first piece of art. I buy them  art on their birthday and Christmas every year, and they have nice  collections. As Winston says,    You have to watch your art, or Mommy  will take it,    (Laughs) so I write on the back that this is for them.  They   re very good. They know. Jay   s a sophomore at OU  University of  Oklahoma  now.  He was in the president   s leadership class and went to President  David   Boren   s house and was able to discuss with President Boren very  knowledgably about all the Native American artists, and he knows them  personally. When he was six, we were featuring Bert Seabourn. He   s  this little bitty guy, and the paintings are around the walls. He just walks  through, and then he says,    I   ll take that one right there. I   ll get that  one.    I look at it, and it   s not a very big piece. It has a shaman with a  pouch, and on the pouch is Spider-Man. It   s the Spider-Man shaman.  (Laughter) They all have very discerning eyes. They expect their art, and  they want it.  Thanks for sharing that. What kinds of work do you think need to be  done in Oklahoma, still, for Native artists to thrive?  A real market, they need a real market. I was hopeful, even, and I talked  to Jim Brewer when he was still alive early on. I can   t remember who   I  think maybe Louise Painter went with me. Two or three went of us went  to talk to him about the possibility of having a gallery in the old train  station, but the train station wasn   t open that much. Maybe with this  new   . There needs to be something that   s there, that   s open, that   s  available, that   s centrally located. I would just like to see more. The year  that we opened Red Earth, the poster from the Oklahoma, I think it was  18  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  the Oklahoma Chamber, the emphasis was on Oklahoma lakes and the  symphony. Okay. We have more miles of manmade shoreline than any  state, but I don   t think when people think of us, they think of lakes  particularly. Although the symphony   s very good, it   s not New York  City. We do have some things that we   re the very best at, and I   d like to  see us showcase that. Our art is one of them, so I would like to see a  more proactive stance by those in charge. (Laughter)  Well, we   re finishing out our conversation here pretty soon, but I   d like  to switch back to your personal collecting again for a moment. When  you   re drawn to something, how important is cultural content?  Probably not at all. (Laughs) You know, I see things I like and   . Back  to Jay, this last summer he decided that three of his Beta brothers would  rent a house in Norman, and they did. It   s a nice house. You know, it   s a  college house, but it has real potential. He developed a passion for going  to estate sales with me, and we furnished his house in Norman by going  to estate sales. We found some really nice art at estate sales, and he has a  great collection. His good stuff   s at home, but he has some really nice  things that we found at estate sales. His house is phenomenal because he  says he   s going to live there three years, and he wants to live in a home.  I   ve been drawn to things at estate sales that I   ve just had to have.  Do you collect works by newer or younger artists and their     Yes, I do. This Levi guy, this Cheyenne from     George Levi?  Yes. His things I bought, and what I   ve been able to do   I got Norma  Howard the first year she showed at Red Earth, and I paid seventy five  bucks for a pretty nice piece that is now four thousand dollars. I do  collect new ones. I like to do that. I like to get them early, Crystal  Hanna, Jane Osti. I went to Tahlequah   do you know Jane Osti? I went  to Tahlequah to speak, and Roger Webb was still  Northeastern State  University  president. There was this incredible sculpture that Jane had  done, and I said to her,    Are you going to Red Earth?    She said,    No.    I  said,    Oh, you ought to go.    This is early on, said,    You really ought to  go.    She said,    I don   t have the entry fee. I can   t go.    So when I   m  doing my speech, I say,    Roger, you have an incredible artist here, and  I   ll bet you can find the money to pay her entry fee to Red Earth, can   t  you?    He said,    Yes, I can.    She won Second the very first year.  (Laughter)  That   s wonderful.  19  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Those are things that are really fun, to spot them early. You do know  Jeri  Redcorn  has her piece in the President   s Oval Office. Did you  know that?  My grandson has that picture. (Laughs)  Yes, I just think that   s pretty phenomenal.  That   s wonderful. How do your paintings live in your home? I mean, if  you get something, do you know right away where you   ll hang it, or do  you sort of let it sit against the wall while you think about it?  Oh, they never sit. I   ve gotten to the point that I can   t get anything very  big. People have said,    Well, you ought to just store some.    No, no, I  don   t want   they   re like children. I don   t want anything stored. I want  to see everything I have, and I built upstairs as a gallery. The whole wall  is a gallery wall. I don   t want every wall in my house to be a gallery  wall. I don   t do well   I don   t like clutter. I have two gallery walls, and  I   m very comfortable with those.  What advice would you give to another Native art collector who is just  starting to acquire Native art?  Don   t buy prints. (Laughs) I don   t care. Get the smallest original. Don   t  buy prints. You get all that money invested in framing, and you still  have a print. Maybe that   s snobbish, but that   s just the way I feel about  it. (Laughter)  This may be a little bit, just sort of adding to what you said, some  wonderful things, but why is it important to collect Native art?  It   s part of who I am. It   s what I   m comfortable living with. You know,  we could go off to another   say it   s good for the economy, it   s good for  business, it   s good to promote those jobs and culture. Look at our history  and what we can do for our children. We need to remind them that it  wasn   t always this way.  Well, is there anything you   d like to add, or we   ve left out, before we  look at a couple of your pieces? I think we   ll look at a few pieces in the  office here.  Okay. Well, I think you   ve been pretty exhaustive.  We did have an additional comment here.  Yes, we did have one. I left out the punchline on my grandchildren   s art  20  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  Little Thunder  Kauger  collection. It   s that I   ve always told them   there   s seven years between  them. When Jay was little, he would want little plastic toys and I would  tell him,    No, I   m not buying you those. I am not your toy grandmother.  I am your art grandmother. You will love your art years from now, and  those toys will be in the garbage.    When he applied to college, he was  required to write an essay on something he was passionate about, and he  wrote about me. He said that I had always said that he was mine, (and he  is) and that I was not his toy grandmother, and that he loves his Native  American art that graces his room at home, and that he has developed a  passion for it, and I was right. I think that paid off.  Certainly did. Okay, how about this painting?  That   s an Archie Blackowl of the Cheyenne family, and I particularly  like it at Christmas because it looks like the Holy Family.  And that Archie Blackowl is one of your personal pieces that   s all yours.  How about this bowl?  This is by William Charles Sellers who was a trial lawyer in Sapulpa,  Oklahoma. They also called him Wild Bill because, as he said, he wasn   t  tame. He was my daughter   s godfather. He played five musical  instruments, he painted, and he took up woodworking not long before he  died. He made this piece for me when I was chief  justice .  Just beautiful.  He was Cherokee. His mother was Maud Muskrat.  All right, we   re looking at a painting and a headdress here.  The painting is by Mike Larsen, and my family gave it to me the day I  was sworn in as chief justice. Mike was there to unveil it. It was quite an  exciting day. The headdress is by Brent Learned, who doesn   t usually do  headdresses.  I was going to say I did not know he did. Beautiful. Well, thank you so  much for your time today.  You   re welcome, Julie. Thanks for coming.  -------  -------
