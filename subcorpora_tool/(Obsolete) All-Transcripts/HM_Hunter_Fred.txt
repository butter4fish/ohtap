Story_ID: 551577
Speaker 1: Well we're gonna talk about your family history. I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Ray Hunter] side of the family, but we're gonna talk about 'em separately. So can--well we'll start with your mother's side. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Maiden name, yeah. Her maiden name, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, maiden name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Marjorie [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter], M-A-R-J-O-R-I-E, Rosemond, R-O-S-E-M-O-N-D.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 11, 1911 [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: She was born in Liberty, L-I-B-E-R-T-Y, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side? How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, I know that they, on her mother's side, they came from Liberty. I'm not sure where the old man came from, but the--on her mother's side the Rosemonds [sic.] came from Liberty, South Carolina, migrated to Asheville probably early 20th century, probably 1918, 1920 somewhere around there to Asheville, North Carolina. I'm sorry, I'm sorry let me back that up, that's not on the Rosemond side. My mother's mother was a Blassingame [ph.], okay and the Blassingames came from Liberty.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Blassingames (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they migrated, they migrated to Asheville, now when I'm not sure, I'm guessing, you know I'm sort of putting this together, late teens [1910s] early '20s [1920s] probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories that--I mean how far back can, do--are there any old stories like they any stories about slavery or Reconstruction, or any of that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't recall any stories specific to slavery. The earliest stories I think my grandfather on my mother's side was killed by a horse. You know he was around the horse and I guess he was trying to train the horse and the horse kicked him, and he never recovered from that and I think that happened like late '20s [1920s] something like that, but that's about as far back as I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were your ancestors on your mother's side, were they working around farm animals, where they--and were they farmers and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah well they did both. You know they were--I think once, once they got to the city--you know they always had the land, in fact they still got land down there okay, so they're always semi-farming, or raising their own stuff, had animals and so forth, but in the city for some reason or other men, the men became roofers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are the men that worked you out here you know. What I'm told a lot of the men didn't work, they drank liquor and hung around all day, you know so I don't know I wasn't there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but some were roofers.
Speaker 2: The ones that worked were somehow or another they got into roofing.
Speaker 1: Okay but did they have their own business or did they work for other people?
Speaker 2: I don't think any of 'em were entrepreneurs, I think they all--
Story_ID: 551578
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] talk about growing up, what it was like growing up in--now, did she grow up in Liberty [South Carolina] or Asheville [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: They moved, like my mother, on my mother's side, there was one older brother, T.J. [T.J. Rosemond (ph.)], there was an older sister, Louise [Louise Rosemond], okay, then there was my mom and a younger sister, Mary Alice [Mary Alice Rosemond], and a younger brother, Joel [Joel Rosemond]. Okay, those are the five oldest kids and then there was a break for about six or seven years I think between my youngest Uncle Joel, and two younger girls came along, Dot [Dorothy Rosemond] and Hazel [Hazel Rosemond], and all the kids, the first five kids I think were born in Liberty. The last two were born in Asheville, so after they made that transition to Asheville which my--once again I'm guessing. My oldest [sic. youngest] aunt was several or eight years older than me so she was born in like '26 [1926]; 1926 that puts them in Asheville about that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother basically she grew up basically in Liberty, but then finished her teen years in Asheville.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she finished her teens, didn't finish high school because the mom passed and when the mom passed which was tradition then you know, there were aunts around, but all the aunts had families of their own or they were in Liberty or they had to come to Detroit [Michigan] or whatever by then because a lot of the--that side of the family came to Detroit, began coming to Detroit about that period of time. So she, she dropped out of school to become a mom for her younger sibs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To work and become a mom so that took place in the late '20s [1920s], early '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now does she have any stories that she's passed down to you about life in Asheville?
Speaker 2: Well you know the one thing that, that she talks about is because they came to Asheville they weren't born there, is the problems they had in terms of the transitioning as a family you know and so they all became fighters. They had to fight their way into the neighborhood and they had to fight to stay in the neighborhood, and they had one--the younger brother was not as aggressive as the rest of 'em and they use to talk about him because all the rest were hell raisers and they would fight like hell except him so that's one of the stories she talks about.
Speaker 1: You're talking about actually physically fighting they had to actually (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Physically fighting, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They say that's the Rosemonds became known as fighters and they fought everyday on their way to school and on their way back from school (laughter). My older, oldest uncle, T.J., he's was the oldest on my mom's side was never around much and the reason he was never around, he left when he was about sixteen, seventeen years old because that's the same time that they started the Negro Leagues. So that's what he did most of his young adult life.
Speaker 1: He played baseball?
Speaker 2: He played baseball in the old black baseball leagues.
Speaker 1: What, what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He played with the Homestead Grays, he was an outfielder.
Speaker 1: Oh, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Rosemond, T.J. Rosemond.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he played with the Homestead Grays in--?
Speaker 2: I think, now don't hold me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to that. I think Homestead and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]--you know where Crawfords would've been right?
Speaker 1: Well yeah, Homestead Grays and they had the Pittsburgh Crawfords too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, don't hold me to that you know this--he never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --talked about it, they talked about it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I only saw him two or three times in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Other than that she just you know talked about how they just had to do what they could do to survive which was domestic work. You know everybody pooled together and did what they had to do.
Speaker 1: Okay. It's--
Speaker 2: And that the father after the mom passed, the father--my aunt was pretty religious and she'd be taking the kids to Sunday school and church and all that on Sunday. He'd be on a corner with his buddies drunk, because he you know--I guess the liquor got the best of him over the years.
Story_ID: 551579
Speaker 1: Now Asheville [North Carolina], I don't know if this is the right time to talk about this or not, but this is--there's probably the, the lifestyle of the rich and poor is probably dramatically different in Nashville--I mean in Asheville than any other--'cause you got I guess the richest house in America, the Biltmore [Biltmore Estate, Asheville, North Carolina] sitting there and you got you know, also you know people who don't have much, you know in the same area. Is--were there a lot of significantly rich white property owners there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yeah, yeah and a lot of it had to do with people like Vanderbilt [George Washington Vanderbilt II]. Now Vanderbilt was from the South [sic.] if I remember correctly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Railroads, but there were a lot of folks from Northeast, Baltimore [Maryland] and D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and New York [New York] who had second homes down there okay, and they discovered how beautiful that was and desirable of a place it was long before the rest of us did, so a good deal of the white population made up of folks like that.
Speaker 1: As you said it is a place of great beauty.
Speaker 2: Oh my god (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's been the scenic backdrop for many movies, big cliffs and waterfalls and--
Speaker 2: Breathtakingly beautiful, you know and when you go though it it's so beautiful. Each time you go through it, my wife [Leila Hunter] and I go through it, there're a lot places like you have never--this is the first time you've never been there before. You know it's like you just you know, the first time is--every time is the first time, yeah it really is.
Speaker 1: Okay so you have like this dichotomy of a very rich, sumptuous homes, and these scenic places and then the, the black community basically served that population--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --of rich people.
Speaker 2: That's, that's why you had the second migration, you know so you had the migration from Liberty [South Carolina] to Asheville because there were jobs and opportunities, but that's also why like when the Depression [Great Depression] hit and then you got World War II [WWII], post and jobs, defense and all that. So there opportunities opened up in Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois] okay, defense jobs. So you had a chance to get out of there and make some real money rather than the menial jobs that you were doing in Asheville, and that's why you had the second generation, so like all my mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] and her sibs all of 'em ended up either in Chicago or Detroit, for that--for the reason you're saying.
Story_ID: 551580
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Ray, R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ray Hunter, is (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And does he have a middle name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, never had a middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay and it's not short for Raymond?
Speaker 2: No, it's just Ray.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 19th--you know I gave you--my mom's [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] is 1916, his is 1911. I had 'em switched around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So your mother is 1916?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his is 1911.
Speaker 1: All right, so your mother was younger than in Nashville--in Asheville [North Carolina], yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, she came there just--time to start school, just yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: And his I don't know as much about, okay?
Speaker 1: Now where was he born?
Speaker 2: I think he was born in Asheville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even though his folks came from, what I found out years later, his dad, his old man--like my wife's [Leila Hunter] from Abbeville, South Carolina and I have, I have relatives, cousins in Anderson, South Carolina and the assumption that I had all these years was that the old man, our grandfather, actually came from Anderson. Well, what we found out was, and I had an old aunt who use to laugh 'cause when my wife and I were courting she told us you guys are related because if she's from Abbeville so is your grandfather and everybody in all small towns is related, so you guys probably are related. Well, as it played out she may have been right (laughter) because my grandfather we found out actually came from Abbeville, South Carolina and he got into it with some--with a white guy down there that tried to kick him and he got into a tussle with the guy and he had to take off 'cause he was hot as a firecracker, and when he took off he went to Anderson and from Anderson he later on migrated to Asheville, so.
Speaker 1: Okay so he wasn't actually telling anybody he was from Abbeville you know 'cause (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We found out years later, yes yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: A lot of stories are like that where people you know get in trouble resisting and they have--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to run.
Story_ID: 551581
Speaker 1: So well, tell us about your father now, he, he grew up in?
Speaker 2: Grew up in Asheville [North Carolina] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Asheville, and now what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Nothing, he was a hobo, he was a bum, he was a playboy, he was an interesting dude (laughter). He was very tal- he was very bright but he was--his mom, his mom died--well he was a twin, but his, his twin died when he was a baby, a year or so, okay. Ray [Ray Hunter] and Roy [ph.], Roy passed and so he was the baby boy out of a family of ten and so he was rotten you know because when he was born I guess when they're twins and back then twins weren't as healthy as they are now and so they, they catered to him and he got used to, used to that and comfortable with it and because he was bright he learned how to leverage it into whatever so he was the family's baby so he didn't you know. Bottom line he never really had a job per se, but he liked the better things in life, especially pretty women and good liquor; very well read though, had a good practical sense of life as it was and history. He grew up in Asheville and didn't do anything, really didn't have a job. My mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] used to tell me say when he did have a job it was never work--you know like you go to work and you get a meaningful paycheck and come home and take care of what you needed to take care of. He'd spend it all on liquor or clothes or whatever. I think I shared with you the one thing that before my brother and I were born that my mom and dad did that they worked out at the Biltmore Estate [Asheville, North Carolina] and they you know they bused tables and they were waitresses and washed dishes and all the other menial kinds of things that you do and those kinds of things and then in the evening they would dance for the, for the rich white crowd, okay? Sometimes he would take off and he would just hobo up and down the East Coast from all the way up to Baltimore [Maryland] or to New England and back. He would just catch trains and hook a ride and go. He did that until World War II [WWII] broke out and somehow or another Uncle Sam found him, didn't find him 'til like '42 [1942] though, and when he went in [the U.S. military] service he stayed there. So he, he was a career soldier, twenty, twenty-one years something like that.
Speaker 1: Oh, so your father he was drafted in 1942?
Speaker 2: Forty-two [1942], went into the service in '42 [1942] yeah.
Speaker 1: And he stayed in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I never remembered them being together, by the time I was old enough to remember anything like they, they had already been divorced and it was all over, so I don't ever remember them as a husband and wife.
Story_ID: 551582
Speaker 1: Well was your father [Ray Hunter] around when you were--?
Speaker 2: He use to come in town after we moved up here, I think I saw him--I remember seeing him once when I was in Asheville [North Carolina] when we moved to Anderson [South Carolina] in '44 [1944], I think I use to see him about every three or four years. Interesting thing, you probably aren't old enough to remember that but during World War II [WWII] when married men with kids were in service, they use to call--take out, the government use to take out their pay what we use to call an allotment so for each kid, the government would take out X number of dollars towards the support of that kid and my mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] got remarried like in 1947 and she was showing us the papers that when they found my dad--they finally found him and he went into the [U.S.] Army in '42 [1942] you have to declare how many children you have so that they can take out (laughter) he showed--in 1942 he said he had zero kids (laughter), so all these years I think she finally caught him and caught up with him and saw the records and got it corrected like, oh we were darn near, my brother and I were darn near teenagers so I'm saying it was probably '47 [1947], '48 [1948] maybe '49 [1949] before (laughter)--and the thing that was so interesting about this guy is every time you saw him he had Stacy Adams shoes on, they were spit shined to the highest, he had a suit on, didn't have a tie but he had a nice sports shirt, trench coat and hat every day of his life (laughter), every day and he had a pint or a half pint of Johnnie Walker Red or Johnnie Walker Black or Haig and Haig Pinch or something like that, so interesting guy though, interesting guy.
Speaker 1: So did he, now did he finish school or you said he was well read and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no didn't finish high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He liked history, he liked reading about sports, professional sports, liked reading biographies, was a real student of people like Courtney Hodges and Mark Clark [Mark W. Clark] and Patton [George S. Patton] and those kinds of folks. He really read a lot of biographies about those folks plus he was a professional soldier, also about the German and Russian generals too.
Speaker 1: What was he attached in the Army to some officer or something or, you think or?
Speaker 2: No, he was--what he was he taught and became a--I guess a fairly knowledgeable statistician. He taught statistics and logistics and those kinds of things out at Fort Eustis [Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia].
Speaker 1: At Fort Eustis, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He had a math--he had a facility for numbers I mean.
Speaker 1: Fort Eustis, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Right, interesting thing, another thing about him you know he went in, in '42 [1942], spent the war in the Pacific, Guadalcanal [Solomon Islands] and Guam and Iwo [Iwo Jima, Japan], and like most black troops he was in a support group where you know.
Speaker 1: It's a Quartermaster Corps [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps].
Speaker 2: Right, he came back to the states in '45 [1945], '46 [1946] went to Germany '46 [1946], stayed there 'til '48 [1948], '49 [1949], retired in '63 [1963], and never spent another minute outta the country, all through the Korean War and everything else, never spent another minute out of the country.
Speaker 1: So he retired from the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, well it's interesting that he was--I guess he was of some use to the military for them to keep him around for--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he loved, he loved the--interesting enough he, he fell in love--he, he was--he you know he took great pride that he was a professional soldier.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he wasn't much use to the family?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, horrible!
Story_ID: 551583
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter and Ray Hunter] met do they talk about--did your mother ever talk about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, but you know it's like most black neighborhoods then, (gesture) the neighborhood was probably about (laughter) a six, six block, and most blacks lived there so you met people who were your age. There was a small part, that's what we call West Asheville [Asheville, North Carolina], well not West Asheville because there's a town [sic. neighborhood] now that's West Asheville, but that's the west side of Asheville [North Carolina] then and that's where blacks were. There was a little part we called Stumptown [Asheville, North Carolina], it's just a little north and a little part south, but most blacks stayed right there so you, so in your age group you're gonna meet 'em.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Church, school, you were gonna meet 'em.
Story_ID: 551584
Speaker 1: So you, you had a story from your father [Ray Hunter] that you were gonna tell us.
Speaker 2: Well, you know he used to--now you don't know whether these were war stories or not you know because he was a, he was a great teller of tales, but he use to talk about in the foxholes in the Pacific how he'd be--you'd be talking to a buddy and all a sudden you hear him say (makes noise), that was it he'd be gone you know just like that he'd said you're still talking to him. But because he had this strange kind of mind he was always, he'd put a spin on everything and one of the spins he came out of there was--he was--he's really an atheist he says because of all of the suffering that, that he saw and all the dying and all that, that there's no way in the world there could be a god that would allow that. So he came out it with that kind of attitude. But the other--one of the other things that came out of there was he became a great admirer of quote, unquote leaders, you know folks that had the wherewithal to get things done in time of trial and so I think out of that he really read into--dug into the historical backgrounds of people like Patton [George S. Patton], Zhukov [Georgy K. Zhukov] from--the Russian general, the great Prussian generals from Germany, Rommel [Erwin Rommel] and von Rundstedt [Gerd von Rundstedt]. Really became knowledgeable about these people and what made them what they were. Interesting, now he's--the other, another interesting thing (laughter), he stayed in the [U.S. military] service twenty plus years (laughter) so he wasn't a great soldier, he took a great--a good deal of pride about it but he was, he was a hell raiser and he wasn't a very disciplined person because he, he retired as a corporal (laughter).
Speaker 1: After twenty-one--and he was basically an instructor you're saying?
Speaker 2: In logistics and so this real dichotomy, here's this really talented, bright guy, knowledgeable but he, he really wasn't a great soldier obviously, took a lot of pride in the fact that he was a soldier though.
Speaker 1: Now, what, were you--how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Just one brother, a year older.
Speaker 1: Just one brother, okay and is that all in the family or do you have (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That we know of yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you'd see him like once every four years or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah but when he retired 1964, at that time I was married, been married three years and had one son [Stuart Hunter], my oldest son was three years when he retired, and we picked him up at the airport and for some reason or another, well we found out later why because he had this problem and he knew he didn't have a lot of time, but he came to Evanston [Illinois] to live. Now he had three sisters living then and the only family he had left then was three sisters, there he had one brother in New York and me and my wife [Leila Hunter] and he didn't know my wife, he hadn't met her but we went to the airport to pick him up. My grand- my son had never seen him before, when he saw him he took off ran, my father picked him up. They fell in love with each other and they were in love until the day he died, and he was a fantastic grandfather, fantastic, used to babysit. He and my wife and my son got along beautifully, attentive, doting grandfather (gesture) (laughter), so you never know.
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that you were open enough to you know let him interact with your family after all this time, after all that time.
Speaker 2: My wife and him they got along great.
Story_ID: 551585
Speaker 1: When you look at your parents' personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: More like her [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter], but I gotta lot of him [Ray Hunter] in me, but more like her, more like her in terms of personalities and values too.
Speaker 1: Okay, what specific values do you?
Speaker 2: Well I try to do the right thing, be responsible, those kinds of things, try to do the right thing and try to be responsible and decent, those kinds of things. My old man didn't care, you know she was out for (laughter), she was out for him and it--but there was nothing pretentious about him, he was whoever- whoever he was that's who he was.
Story_ID: 551586
Speaker 1: Now you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Of him [Hunter's father, Ray Hunter]?
Speaker 1: No, of just period.
Speaker 2: You know, you know I guess the signature moment for me, and I keep thinking back and I think, and I couldn't, it wouldn't of been--and I probably, and I had no way of recognizing it then but I--my mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter]--there was a big court battle. My mom comes up here in 1940, '41 [1941], she leaves my brother and I with my dad's sister, oldest sister, and says, "I'm gonna go up and get a job," 'cause she came up and lived with two of my dad's sisters 'til she could get a job and get established, which was not uncommon then, okay? And she would send for us once she got on her feet. Well it took her a couple of years all right, so, so she came down in 1944--she came down two or three times a year between, in between to stay in contact with us and called and wrote all the time. She came down, she came down in 1943 to get us. My aunt changed her mind and wouldn't let her have us. Well, in Asheville [North Carolina] my aunt was a hell of a lot more well known than my mother was, so the authorities obviously sided with her, okay? So it was a court battle that ensued, my dad [Ray Hunter] now is in the Pacific then so this battle is between my aunt and my mom and they have us in court. So I remember those court, you know.
Speaker 1: And your aunt is your, is this your mother's sister or your dad's sister (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dad's older sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I remember these court battles and they were pretty nasty, but so she came down--the last time she came down there was this judge, not a judge but a police officer told--a lawyer told her, said, "You're not gonna win this, so the best thing for you to do is pretend that you're going to take your sons shopping and get on the train and get out of here because once you get up there, they're not gonna--nobody in their right mind is going to make you come back with 'em, just take your kids and go." That's what she did, she, she even fooled us, when she told us we were gonna take a train ride. We got on the train and we came to Evanston [Illinois].
Story_ID: 551587
Speaker 1: But what I remember is--have you ever been to Evanston [Illinois]? Okay, back then there was an old Wieboldt's store [Wieboldt Stores, Chicago, Illinois], Wieboldt's department store, and my mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter], my brother's a year older than me so I'm in third grade, he's in fourth grade okay? She took off 'cause she was a domestic, she had two or three jobs. One of the things she did was domestic, one of the things she did was she was an elevator operator part time in Evanshire Hotel. It's out in Evanston [Illinois]. She took off from work one day and showed us how to catch the bus from where we were living, got us registered in St. Mary's Catholic school [St. Mary's School, Evanston, Illinois], showed us how to take the bus and get back home, okay, and it was September of 1944 and she bought us some heavy coats and some clothes, 'cause she obviously couldn't--had to leave everything we had down there, she couldn't--okay, and she says, "I'm only taking off one day to show you guys what you need to do. You guys have got to pay attention and you've got to do it, but if you behave yourselves, come out of the Wieboldt's store and you don't clown too much, we'll go across here to the Woolworths store [F.W. Woolworth Company]," which is right across from Wieboldt's, five and ten store, "and we'll get a soda, an ice cream soda." Oh, yeah, hell yeah we'll behave for an ice cream soda but, and she took us and after we got through with Wieboldt's and she took us into the Woolworths to get the sodas. She told us to sit down at the counter, she had to restrain us. There's no way in our minds we could sit down at that counter because we came from you know? I mean she had to physically restrain us and make us sit there because in our mind there was no way we could sit down at that counter and have a soda, you know, it's 1944 in Evanston, and I think about that so often because when my wife [Leila Hunter] and I got married in '61 [1961], I think the first time I had gone back south, I went down in '86 [1986] to bury my mother-in-law. I didn't go back 'til like '96 [1996], because I was working two and three jobs and hustling and trying to pay bills 'cause I had two other boys soon after that. So I'm trying to be a father and provider you know, so my wife went and took the kids [Stuart Hunter, Aubrey Hunter and Kenyon Hunter] down every year but I never went back. The first time I went back and had any time to spend there it was like '96 [1996] and I was just absolutely blown away and it still does a thing with my head to have white folks say, "Yes sir," and "No sir" because I was eight years old and I remember that's not what you were called in 1944 (laughter), that's not what you--believe me. Yes, sir and no, sir and thank you and however genuine or not it is, it just--I contrast that in my mind to that September 1944 thing where my brother and I were being constrained by my mom so that we would sit there and partake of what we--you know and so if you ask for a signature moment as a kid, that's probably the signature moment for me was that incident in the--at the dime store.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 551588
Speaker 1: So when you moved to--so you were about eight years old when (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eight years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you moved to Evanston [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, well describe--we always ask this question but you got two places to describe for us, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells in growing up?
Speaker 2: Well Asheville [North Carolina], man it was a Friday night fish fry--and you've been to Asheville, you know those hills? Friday night and you could just smell those fried--those fish fry neighborhood all over, fried fish and just dripping with grease, unhealthy grease and everything with salt, all the stuff you're not supposed to have but it smells great and tasted wonderfully. A big thing was a Friday night fish fry, the other big thing was the baseball games at McCormick Field [Asheville, North Carolina] you know, the all-black teams. Those were the big events there in Asheville.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were some other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: In Asheville?
Speaker 1: In either, either one.
Speaker 2: Dew, getting up in the morning seeing that dew, and the taste of the water which is totally different from up here. It's hard water up here, down there it was just soft. You know how you'd, you'd take a bath, up here the residue would be on top of the--you wouldn't find that down there, but getting up in the morning and seeing that dew--all those hills is just you know, you come up here in flat Illinois, everything's--so those scenes, those kinds of scenes and things would jump off. In Evanston we came here in September, by November, December we stayed next to a railroad track, on the other side of the railroad track was what we called Mason Park [Evanston, Illinois] and we're over in November and December or something and we see people ice skating, we've never seen that before in our life. We use to roller skate up and down the hills in Asheville, but we've never seek ice skates, and we're, what is, what in the world is ice skating, and to see these folks ice skating was just mindboggling, absolutely mindboggling and, and my mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] had to get us some skates and we had that so we, she found some used skates 'cause everything we got then was used. Somehow or another she found us some used skates and then we use to spend all evening and all weekend and on Christmas break, every day during Christmas break we spent on the ice because we were determined to learn how to ice skate because you know that didn't exist down south and our--you know obviously we wanted to be to you know when we talked to our buddies from down south we wanted to tell 'em about ice skating you know. So, ice skating is something that jumps off. End of World War II [WWII], V-E Day [Victory in Europe Day] was a big event, big event. I don't know and, and for some reason or another it was a hell of a lot bigger than V-J Day [Victory over Japan Day], V-E Day seemed to be the biggest one.
Speaker 1: Now what's the difference between the two?
Speaker 2: Europe and Japan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Europe happened first though and it was bigger than V-J Day. It was bigger than the atomic bomb, this was '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay so do you think that people just kind of took it for granted we were going to finally win in Japan after we won in Europe (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That--right a certain amount of time so and the atom bomb was almost anti-climatic and--where we were.
Story_ID: 551589
Speaker 1: The next big one? Jackie Robinson, '47 [1947], huge, my son, my youngest son [Kenyon Hunter] asked me last week who's he comparable to now? I said, "Nothing, there's nothing that's happened since then that was comparable, nothing that I could think of." He said, "What about the two black coaches in the Super Bowl?" I said, "That's not even close," because first of all you had, you had to put baseball in perspective and baseball was it, this was ten, eleven years before the NFL [National Football League] and the NBA [National Basketball Association] became big, baseball was it. You know someone said something about Joe Louis winning the champion- well I, I was born that year he won, '36 [sic. 1937] so I, I can't say but I think one of the differences would've is we could see it, television and the movies, we could see--television, we could see that in '47 [1947]. We could see Jackie Robinson, the only time you could see Joe Louis was if you went to the movie, you saw the re-run but we can actually see Jackie Robinson, and no matter where you lived and all of us were contained on the west side of Evanston [Illinois] then. That's where--so because the community was contained, it reverberated. So it was, whether you were a baseball fan or whether you knew anything about baseball or not, immediately you became a baseball fan immediately, then you became a Brooklyn Dodger [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers], Jackie Robinson fan (laughter), so the, the fallout from that was just like nothing but (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now, now Asheville [North Carolina] where you come from is a place where they make a lot of baseball bats.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that, really (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah I think so.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: There's one company there that makes, it's on the bat actually I think it was one of them. I know it's not Louisville Slugger (laughter). It's another one, but I think it's made in Asheville.
Story_ID: 551590
Speaker 1: From '44 [1944] to '47 [1947] the things that a jump off are V-E Day [Victory in Europe Day], ice skating obviously (laughter) and Jackie Robinson by far. Now the fourth thing that happened in 1947 and this is peculiar to Evanston [Illinois], prior to that Evanston Township High School [Evanston, Illinois], which was at that point one of the top city high schools in the country academically, and you had a number of blacks, but you didn't have, participating in athletics, a smattering, one on this team one on that team, two on this team, but in 1947 the class of 1951 became freshmen at Evanston high school, okay, September of '47 [1947] and that team had--that freshmen team out of eleven starters, seven or eight of 'em were black.
Speaker 2: That's the football team right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had a black quarterback, the whole black, the backfield, the entire backfield, both the ends, and one of the guards were black. Now, a black kid growing up in Evanston had never seen that before okay. So I'd been in Evanston three or four years by then and you know so the big thing in the town then is, even bigger than Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], was the high school. If you're a kid the big thing was the high school, that's what you related to, you didn't relate to Northwestern, you related to the high school. You can't imagine what that did to, to the psyche you know. All of a sudden there's like three years where everybody became a baseball player with Jackie Robinson in the spring. Everybody became a football player in the fall when you saw these.
Speaker 2: Who was the quarterback? Who were some of the players that you remember?
Speaker 1: Richard Gilbert was a quarterback, first black quarterback; he also became the first state champion, Evanston Township High School's first state, wrestling state champion, George King (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Gilbert, you said?
Speaker 1: Richard Gilbert.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: George King was a left halfback 'cause back then that's the way they identified him. Johnny Hunter [John Hunter] was a right half back, Lovie Gibbs [George Gibbs] was the fullback. The two ends were Willie Grant--well I'm dating myself here, Willie Grant and Billie Logan [William Logan] and the guard was Ed Logan [ph.]. That shows you the impression it made on me this is 1947 I can remember okay, and they pretty much stayed that way until they were seniors. All those guys except Ed Logan were starters all the way through.
Speaker 2: So they were your heroes when you were in your (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely!
Speaker 2: From eleven to--
Speaker 1: Absolutely!
Speaker 2: --I guess fourteen or--
Speaker 1: And still are.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you know you hear--you use to hear so much about ineligibility, black kids flunking out, never a problem. All those people were bright and talented, came from--
Story_ID: 551591
Speaker 1: Another interesting thing is, if you study the history of blacks in Evanston [Illinois] it stems from a family, a group of probably three or four families. All of whom were cousins or were related and they came from Abbeville, South Carolina. Hard working, middle class people with values and morals and ethics and principles, and it's also skills because they were carpenters or plumbers or whatever, okay. You know they learned these skills and trades while they were in the South Carolina area.
Speaker 2: Now is there, as far as you know is there a direct connection between the well to do white people that lived in Asheville [North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: In Evanston?
Speaker 2: No, yeah in Evanston.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, I think--here's what--in Abbeville County [South Carolina], and I found this out in the last few years, in Abbeville County which was cotton country then okay. I mean it was really cotton country. It was the rich white folks then were cotton, cotton was king okay? So if you're in Abbeville County in 19--from 1926 'til 1932 something like that, Abbeville County experienced the largest outward migration of folks, lost more population than any county in the South during those five or six years, and three things happened that caused that. Boll weevil struck, you had a drought and you had a depression [Great Depression]. All hit simultaneously and so people had to leave for jobs, and you know the history of black folks being what it is, and most immigrants or people new to areas. What happened is one came, got established and told the others about it okay. So out the Taylors [ph.] and the Perrins [ph.], and the Taylors the Perrins, Adams [ph.] and another family I forgot. Taylors, Taylors, Perrins, Holmes about four families.
Speaker 2: And Adams you said.
Speaker 1: Original blacks in Evanston stem from those four or five families. The Kings is another one--he came.
Speaker 2: Is there a specific source of employment that they all were engaged in?
Speaker 1: Well when they came here the ones that weren't skilled, a lot of 'em were skilled, a lot of 'em were carpenters, builders, okay, but the ones that weren't what they became is hustlers on the North Shore [Chicago, Illinois]. They were, they and they became chauffeurs and drivers and window washers, and gardeners (laughter), you know because they came--they were people that were growing--that grew up on the farms and they knew how to fix and do things you know?
Speaker 2: Okay, that's interesting you know, I still wonder like why Evanston, of all--is--it's like--is it a terminus on a rail route or something or what, why would they choose Evanston rather than stop in Chicago [Illinois] or some other place (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay because Evanston--as you come out of--as Chicago grew the affluency went north and Evanston's the first suburb north okay so like and Lake Forest [Illinois] and Glencoe [Illinois] okay, but that's you know, now eventually they moved farther north but Evanston at that point in time was where the affluent were. So that's where the need for the kinds of things that they could do that's where the need was you know. You could wash windows, you could tend to children, you could clean homes, you could drive cars, you were trustworthy you could fix things (laughter), you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The men and women.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, so you had a lot of folks who use to do what's called staying on place, you know what I'm talking about? Okay, so.
Speaker 2: Actually live in the home of the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right and they'd have an apartment maybe in Evanston but they--okay, and so a lot of the folks that I grew up with were second generation were people that were these kids--the football players that I just named [from Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois], all of them, all of them, their fathers and mothers were from that elk.
Speaker 2: Okay, had roots in Abbeville?
Speaker 1: Yes, all of 'em, everyone of 'em, Richard Gilbert, George King is from Abbeville, Lovie Gibbs [George Gibbs], Gibbs is from Abbeville, Johnny Hunter [John Hunter] is from Abbeville, Willie Grant [William Grant] is down in Laurens [South Carolina] which is the next town east right now and Logan [William Logan] might not be, he may be the only one, I'm not sure where he's from. He may be from Georgia, but the rest of them are from that Abbeville.
Story_ID: 551592
Speaker 1: Tell us about school, now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school in Asheville, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Hill Street School went there first, second, kindergarten, first, second and part of third grade.
Speaker 1: Hill Street School in Asheville, now it was--this is an all-black school right?
Speaker 2: All-black school.
Speaker 1: Was it supported by the state or was--did it just--is it a school that the people had to come up with to support themselves (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now it was a city school.
Speaker 1: City school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, part of the Asheville school system.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you like school?
Speaker 2: No, hell no, I liked recess.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: But I was--my brother was a good student I wasn't, no school wasn't my thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any favorite teachers or anything there?
Speaker 2: Not really, I remember the principal, what the hell was his name, Dr.--stayed right across from us. I can't remember, but no not really, school you know, all I was interested in was getting out for recess.
Story_ID: 551593
Speaker 1: When you moved to Evanston [Illinois] where'd you go? Did--was that, was that, would that be your second (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Interesting, another interesting thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter], my mom's twenty years older than me, so I'm eight she's twenty-eight right? Single mom, this is 1944, she's got two boys, nine and--eight and nine years old. In her head she had something about what our lives were gonna be like okay, she not only brought us to Evanston--now, she's a domestic okay, no skills. She enrolled us in St. Mary's parochial- Catholic school, parochial school [St. Mary's School, Evanston, Illinois]. She signed us up for private piano lessons at the Evanston Conservatory of Music [Evanston, Illinois]. She's a domestic, okay?
Speaker 1: So you went to the music--what the Evanston Conservatory of Music you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah we took piano lessons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she has this thing about what her boys are gonna be right? Well, she was wrong but (laughter), but and so we had school clothes and we had play clothes. So the school--so every time we always beat her home but we were not to play in our school clothes. We were to hang 'em up okay. Well I guess they were sort of like a show thing okay, but I think about that so often you know? Here's a twenty-eight year old single mom and the Evanston school systems were just like the high school [Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois], one of the tops in the country at that time. They weren't good enough okay. I think about that so often, where'd she get all that stuff from.
Speaker 1: Yeah did you ever find out, I mean did you ever ask her how she got those aspirations?
Speaker 2: That's, that's what she wanted for her boys, she wanted 'em to be quote unquote be something you know and we stayed in parochial school until we were--came time to go to junior high which was seventh grade. So we stayed there three, three and half years.
Speaker 1: Did you think that maybe your mother was mirroring the aspirations of the people she worked for, they were successful and had lots of money and such, right? And status?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think that's part of it but you know a good part of it had to come from much deeper than that, had to be there before she--you know because there are lot of folks that work around folks like that didn't send their kids to--so some of it had to be her.
Speaker 1: Or having the will to do that, or the vision to.
Speaker 2: The will and something that said my boys aren't going, aren't going to just boys you know, you know. I don't know the answer to you. I don't know I thought about that a lot and I don't know the answer to that but I've been wondering if, if you--you know, if you're in a great school system, you're in a great community, why isn't that enough?
Story_ID: 551594
Speaker 1: Was Catholic school [St. Mary's School, Evanston, Illinois] challenging after coming out of Asheville [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: It wasn't for me 'cause I wasn't a good student. It was--
Speaker 1: So it didn't make any difference (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now my brother was just the opposite. He was a good student, he was, he was like my dad [Ray Hunter] in terms of personality. He was a hell raiser, he, he was smart, he was bright, he was intellectually inquisitive. All I wanted to do is play sports and you know, but he had this facility for numbers. He was a just a good, he's a bright guy, he's intellectually motivated and he thought that anything that was being taught he could learn and he could learn it better than anyone else and so he figured any grade he would get would have to be--should be an A and the subtleties of quote unquote racism being what they were then we were thrown into a, an environment that was, came from a black environment into an environment that was basically Irish Catholic, North Shore [Chicago, Illinois], okay (laughter). I can remember my mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] use to--we'd come home and she'd try to talk to us about school, how did the day go and everything (laughter)--I remember we would say, "We don't know they all look alike, they have freckles and their names are Patty Carol and Gerald and Tim," Irish Catholic names. We didn't know Irish Catholic then but as time was--they all have freckles or red hair or they all look alike, which they did. They--it took months before we knew one kid from the other. We knew names and put names with faces 'cause the environment we came from is totally different. So they all looked white and then down the road you began to distinguish between features of white, but they were all just white girls and white boys you know. About mid semester, you got to know is Gerry here, Gerry there.
Speaker 1: Was it kind of a shock being in school with them?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god you know and the sisters, it was all sisters then. There weren't any lay teachers. Everybody was and they didn't tolerate anything, they beat the hell out of you if you did anything and you know it was a real culture shock, and you had to be disciplined and you couldn't you know, you had to march when they told you to march and all that you know, totally different.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: If I had a favorite subject it was probably the social sciences, the history and that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 551595
Speaker 1: Now you went on to middle school at, in the public school right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, by the time we got to junior high, we pretty much had gotten pretty good with telling our story to our mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] and basically what we told her, "Hey mom, look here there's no difference between this parochial stuff and these Evanston [Illinois] schools. They're all tough, they're all good," (laughter) "you know but it's no sense in you killing yourself and wasting your money because we're whomever we are, and we're going to, you know," so.
Speaker 1: Was this Evanston junior high school or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah so we went to Nichols Junior High School [Nichols Middle School, Evanston, Illinois] which is in the Evanston public school system.
Speaker 1: It's Nichols you said?
Speaker 2: N-I-C-H-O-L-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now a strange thing happened, this was like 19--this was the fall of 1948 okay. Prior to that Evanston had two districts, two, two public school systems--districts. North was District sixty- 76 [sic. District 75]; south was District 75 [sic. District 76], okay so it split the town in half. In 1948 they did away with the two and they combined and made one and they took a digit from each one and called it District 76 [sic. Evanston/Skokie School District 65] okay? That's also the year that they stopped having midyear graduations, up until that point you had like if you were in seventh grade, there was a group of what we call 7A and a 7B. 7A were kids that would graduate and go to eighth grade in the middle of the year. 7B were the kids that were--would do that in June, okay? So, my brother for some reason or another and a bunch of the guys who we grew up with were all a year older than me, all the black guys, none of 'em--they went through this testing thing and invariably they all were put back half a grade instead of--okay? Now here's my brother and some of his friends who were always better students than me ended in the same grade with me. They were a year older and, but we, we can't document one, one case where those guys, anyone that took the test--anyone stayed where they were, they all were--and when the decision was made, okay. How that happened, why, who knows?
Speaker 1: Was it just--was it just the black kids that were moved back? Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. So anyway, so my brother and I at that point, from that point on, even though he's year older, we're in the same grade. So we finished high school [Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois] together and everything else.
Speaker 1: And you were saying he was a much better student?
Speaker 2: Aw--I mean he's an A student, not on behavior but in terms of achievement, he was an A student you know. So that happened in 1948. So at, at the junior high, interesting; we came from a predominately Irish Catholic system, so we'd gone from this black environment in Asheville [North Carolina] to this for three, three and a half years for this, to this predominant Irish Catholic system to an affluent public school system, but she had kids here off the lakefront of Evanston and anywhere else, and I think you only had, we had three high schools in the whole town. You had north Evanston which was even more affluent, it was Haven [Haven Junior High School; Haven Middle School, Evanston, Illinois], okay and Nichols where we were and you had Foster [Foster School; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Literary and Fine Arts School, Evanston, Illinois] which was--served the black, black area, the west side of Evanston. Those were the three junior high.
Story_ID: 551596
Speaker 1: And so we finished there in June of 1950. We went into high school--we graduated from junior high [Nichols Junior High School; Nichols Middle School, Evanston, Illinois] the same week that Korea [Korean War] broke out. So we didn't know anything about Korea and I remember it was the focal point of our freshman civics classes, learning about Korea because from the time we graduated junior high and started high school, Korea had happened.
Speaker 2: Okay, so well you went to Evanston Township High School [Evanston, Illinois] right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, the Korean War did people, were people drafted that you knew in the neighborhood (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah a lot of--yeah, a lot of people were drafted. In fact there was a guy, Jessie Peaks [ph.], big guy. When we went into high school he was in our civics class okay, we went through junior high with this guy, he was a straight guy, good guy but he was just, he was just a big clown. He enlisted 'cause he was big and got fake ID and anyway 'cause he was so large he was able to deceive the folks and enlisted in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.
Speaker 2: At what age would he be?
Speaker 1: We would've been fifteen then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay; went through boot camp and got his orders to go to ship out to Korea and scared the living daylights out of him and he called his mom and dad and then everyday he tried to get out and they got him back. So he started our freshman year with us okay? He left, by the spring he was back with us (laughter), but yeah we--Korea was the first time that we knew folks because when World War II [WWII] broke out we were too young to really know anyone, but Korea was the first we knew folks in the neighborhood who were affected by--actually got wounded and so on and so forth.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's in--by that time the [U.S.] military is going through the process of integration too.
Speaker 1: Yeah '48 [1948] Truman [President Harry S. Truman] desegregates, '52 [1952], '50 [1950], '50 [1950], '52 [1952] they actually started making it happen.
Speaker 2: Okay, well now in high school were you a good student in high school?
Speaker 1: No, horrible student, I think out of my graduating class we had 500 something students; I think I was 430 in the graduating class.
Speaker 2: Well what were you doing, were you working in school?
Speaker 1: No just having fun.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Playing--wrestling and playing football and having fun.
Speaker 2: Okay so you were on a team I guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Played football and wrestled all four years, I did enough to get by.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Liked, liked history and politics and civics; didn't care for anything else so I did all right in that, those classes, but anything else I was just getting by.
Story_ID: 551597
Speaker 1: Now did the football team, what did the football team do when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: The year before I went to high school, they won the Suburban League championship [Central Suburban League], undefeated. It was the class of 1950, 1951 they lost one game, 1952 they won the Suburban League championship again. In 1953, my junior year we, we lost the state championship game to New Trier [New Trier High School, Winnetka, Illinois], the last game of the year and '54 [1954] in my senior year we fell apart, we lost a lot of kids, I think we ended up four and four, something like that. So we had good football teams.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did you play?
Speaker 2: A guard, offensive guard and defensive corner.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any favorite teachers in high school or mentors?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the coaches were our mentors really. They had some good coaches and they were--the first time we really ran into educators. They were beyond sports, they would say, "Hey, you know, what are you gonna do with your life? Here's some things you need to be thinking about." So yeah we had some good mentors but beyond the coaches the town had a lot of--the community had a lot of mentors--the ministers, and back then Evanston [Illinois] must've had--Evanston's probably about fifty thousand people and I guess maybe eight thousand, ten thousand blacks and we had about seven or eight black doctors, two black pharmacists, a couple of lawyers. The town was made up with the kinds of people that I described before who were hardworking property owners or aspiring to be property owners on the west you know. So you had a good solid, hardcore black middle class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And everybody knew everybody you know so you--initially if you're in the community and something happened, the first thing they'd ask you is who's your father, who's your mother, they would know them, so they had this very supportive community, very supportive.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so when you're in high school did, did--oh so it was a--Evanston Township High School [Evanston, Illinois] is an integrated high school; you had--was the prom integrated and all that or did they?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah the prom integrated 1950; 1950 was the last separate prom.
Speaker 1: Okay but before that time it was separate?
Speaker 2: Right, they use to have two proms, you had a white prom and a black prom so, so the class of '51 [1951] which is three years ahead of me had integrated by then.

Speaker 1: Now was, was the church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: A big part of my mother's [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] life, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It never really became big in our lives, yeah a big part of hers.
Speaker 1: So did you every Sunday?
Speaker 2: Yeah we did the obligatory Sunday duty, Sunday school when we were small and a quick duck in, duck out on Sunday morning when we got older.
Speaker 1: Now what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We'd always sit in the back, so she'd sit in the front she didn't know when we left (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what church was it?
Speaker 2: Ebenezer A.M.E. Church [Evanston, Illinois].
Story_ID: 551599
Speaker 1: What was the, the music like when you were growing and popular culture things that you know held your interest, what was--'cause I know television had just, was just coming out but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first TV was, we had the first TV was--we had the first TV on the block, '47 [1947], '48 [1948] and so the big thing there was the Wednesday night fights. Wednesday night, Sugar Ray, Sugar Ray Robinson and Kid Gavilan and--that was the big thing.
Speaker 1: That's when Gillette [The Gillette Company] would bring the fights I think right?
Speaker 2: 'Gillette Cavalcade of Sports' ['The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports'] yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, okay what was the music like when you were growing up when you were in high school [Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Man the music is something, my mom [Marjorie Rosemond Hunter] liked Mahalia Jackson, and the great spirituals. She liked Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington all those folks okay. She liked Duke Ellington and Count Basie, my dad [Ray Hunter] when he was in town was a jazz nut, a real scholar though you know like Lester Young, Chu Berry, knew jazz, he was really, really an impresario, he really knew jazz and loved it made us when he'd come in town, he made us sit down and listen to it. In the neighborhood the doo-woppers, you know the groups? That was big. Music was all over the place, all kinds of music.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you go to a lot of live shows in those days?
Speaker 2: We use to go--once a year they would take us either to the Oriental [Oriental Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], the Regal [Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] or both and we'd see stage shows, Erskine Hawkins or Ella Fitzgerald or Dinah Washington or someone. Once or twice a year we'd go to either the Oriental or the Chicago Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], or the Regal to see a real, what we use to call then the stage shows. The real big one, one of the few things was the 'Jazz at the Phil' ['Jazz at the Philharmonic'] at the opera house. It was real big back then.
Speaker 1: It was a jazz show was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah it was put on by Norman Granz and he'd have all the--you know like the Down Beat was the jazz magazine of th- the authoritative jazz magazine then so they would rate the jazz artists by instrument and each year he would talk the top, the top rated ones and he'd put on a concert and travel all over the country, major halls and it was called 'Jazz at the Phil' and that was a big event. We use to see Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker.
Speaker 1: Was that the Field Museum [Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois], 'Jazz at the Field Museum,' you said?
Speaker 2: No, no 'Jazz at the Phil'--what--I think where it originated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, philharmonic?
Speaker 2: Philharmonic, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right I got--okay, now okay. That's, that's in the South then?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Is that in Evanston [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no that was down here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that was in the city [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I think that we use to see it at the opera house over on Wacker Drive.
Speaker 1: Oh, the Lyric Opera [Civic Opera House, Chicago, Illinois] I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 551600
Speaker 1: So, well when you were on the--now were you in clubs and that sort of thing in high school [Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois]? Did you--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Just played ball and--?
Speaker 2: Played ball and hung out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, now were you a ladies' man too?
Speaker 2: No, probably in my mind yeah (laughter), no, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were senior what were your prospects, what did you think you were gonna do when you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had thought I was gonna--I think I told someone I was gonna be an engineer. I didn't have the slightest idea what an engineer was and surely didn't have any kind of facility for it because I was horrible in numbers and math. So I had no idea what the heck I wanted to be. So when it came that time my buddy and I went down to Southern Illinois University [Carbondale, Illinois] in the spring, talked to the football coaches and, and we thought that they told us, yeah we were gonna have scholarships, football scholarships. Well, that's not what they told us, so we went down in the fall when we graduated and found out there were no scholarships so ended up and said well this is not gonna work. I had another buddy did it just to join the [U.S.] Marine Corps when we graduated in June, and, and one of the reasons he--the reason he had joined he said well you know he knew his folks didn't have any money so when he got out he was going to go to--on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] he was gonna go to aeronautics school, that's what he thought he was gonna be. So we were down there with no money and no prospects. That hit me, I said hey, I go back home the folks don't have any money and so I came back home and I joined the Marine Corps in September of '54 [1954] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: So I graduated high school June of '54 [1954] and went in the Marine Corps September of '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to San Diego, California for boot--
Speaker 1: Now why the Marine Corps?
Speaker 2: 'Cause my buddy had been in there.
Speaker 1: Okay that's.
Speaker 2: He joined in June you know, and the G.I. Bill okay, but you would've gotten the G.I. Bill regardless.
Speaker 1: Right, right,
Speaker 2: But okay.
Speaker 1: Right, now was it, did it seem glamorous to be in the Marine Corps?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that too you know, wrestling, football player, Marine you know (laughter). So stayed there 'til, 'til September of '57 [1957], but a funny thing happened though in, in the Marine Corps. Like I said I graduated like 530, 437 out 535 something like that, didn't take any classes or anything while I was in the Marine Corps just sort of hung out, but I think I grew up because when I got out and I--it was time for me to go I said I was gonna go to school and I started taking tests, the VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] counselor there says, "Well, you know you don't have--there's nothing here--I can't tell you, 'cause you're entitled to the G.I. Bill but if someone were to ask me, I'd say you're wasting the government's money and your time by saying you're gonna go to college because there's nothing here in your record to indicate that your going to college is gonna be worthwhile to you." So he says, "You know, you test all right, but you'd have to work your butt off to make it in college based on what I can tell." So I said okay, you know I didn't argue with the guy or anything, but something had happened while I was in college because--while I was in the service because once I enrolled in school, Illinois State [Illinois State Normal University; Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois], it came together for me. I mean like I think I was a junior before I got a C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was on the dean's list almost every--you know, something happened, I saw that if you work hard that's how you get good grades, but I was able to make the connection which wasn't able to make when I was younger.
Story_ID: 551601
Speaker 1: I know we went past the [U.S.] Marine Corps but was your sojourn in the Marine Corps significant in any way? You said things turned around once you got out but?
Speaker 2: Yeah you know what I think the thing that happened to, the most significant thing that happened as far as I'm concerned in the Marine Corps--I wasn't sure while I was in there or after I got out what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go, but what it did was it told me that somehow I got the message that I don't want this to be--that I didn't want the Marine Corps to be the only option that I had, and in order to not let that happen I needed to get an education and some skills. So didn't know what it was gonna be in or what the skills were or whatever, but so that I wouldn't be boxed in and have the [U.S.] military as my only option, I needed to do something different.
Speaker 1: Now was--did the Marine Corps was it--did it fulfill your expectations? Was it what you thought it was gonna be or?
Speaker 2: No, no I--it's--I was scared the whole time I was in there because we got called up two or three times and it was either we're on our way to Egypt to put out a fire or we're on our way to Formosa, which is now Taiwan--was we're always ready to go put out a fire which even then as young as I was, I knew it was senseless. I said this just makes no sense (laughter), just let me get up out of here (laughter) and I promise you I will do something different and better, so that I won't end up with this as my way out.
Speaker 1: It's kind of like shock treatment then I some ways I guess so.
Speaker 2: Reality, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of like a cold slap in the face or.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and if you want options there are prices to be paid for options, otherwise you're going to end up with this as your only option and I didn't like the people, you know, you, you encounter a hundred people and one of 'em might be a decent person.
Speaker 1: Well the Marine Corps calls the white soldiers maggots and stuff, I mean how--were the black soldiers treated any worse?
Speaker 2: I didn't run into--I very--I, I you know one of the good things about the military even then, this is '54 [1954], it's '54 [1954], it was the closest thing you're gonna find I think in terms of organization or to the, to the playing field being equal--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --level, I, I didn't encounter a lot of that--this was--even in '54 [1954] and I--
Speaker 1: So you basically served in California?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started out in San Diego [California] and went to Twentynine- no I went to survivor's training up in Pickel Meadows [Mountain Warfare Training Center, California] which is up in the Sierras [Sierra Nevada], so we did cold weather survival training up there for six weeks and then I spent almost two years in the Twentynine Palms [Marine Corps Training Center Twentynine Palms; Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, Twentynine Palms, California] in the Mohave Desert, I was in artillery and then the last six months I spent with the 1st Marine Division down in Oceanside, Camp Pendleton [Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California]. So I was all over Southern California.
Story_ID: 551602
Speaker 1: All right, now back now Illinois, now how did you choose the Illinois State [Illinois State Normal University; Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well I had to go to junior college for a year first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to Wright Junior College [Wilbur Wright Junior College; Wilbur Wright College, Chicago, Illinois] and then went to Illinois State and you know I still didn't know what the heck I was gonna do, so back then you know (laughter) in '57 [1957] a good safe, decent, respectable thing to do was to teach okay? So I knew that was an option, I didn't know, I, I had no desire and I wasn't clearly wasn't academically inclined you know so I, I didn't thirst for learning and all that so it was not--I mean it didn't make sense in terms of what my previous experiences had been, but I, I don't wanna do the [U.S.] Marine Corps or the [U.S.] military, I need to do something so I have some other options, teaching became the one that jumped off the page. So Illinois State at that point was a state teachers college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you got married in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: That's before you graduated right?
Speaker 2: I got married my--'cause I was going back for my senior year.
Speaker 1: Now did you meet your wife [Leila Hunter] in?
Speaker 2: I met my wife in '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay, was she in Evanston [Illinois], did you meet in Evanston (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She came, she came from Abbeville [South Carolina] to Evanston, part of that train, her mom, her mom's sister was up here and she finished high school in '58 [1958], there was nothing to do in Abbeville, so you come up here to--okay?
Speaker 1: Okay all right so, so what was your major at Illinois State?
Speaker 2: I had a major in social science and a minor in Spanish.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were you gonna teach in the schools?
Speaker 2: When I finished I taught, taught at what was then Waller High School [Robert A. Waller High School]; are you familiar with it?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's now Lincoln Park.
Speaker 1: Now it's Lincoln Park High School [Chicago, Illinois], right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And so I taught Spanish, I did that for two years and then the last year I taught over at the junior high down the street from Crane Tech [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School] on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Um, I don't know, it's (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Upper Grade Center [William McKinley Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois]--it'll come to me.
Story_ID: 551603
Speaker 1: Let's go back for a minute did you have any--were there any significant mentors or teachers at Illinois State [Illinois State Normal University; Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois] that you were--related to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I--but I didn't need any at that point you know I--in fact I don't think there was a--no that was--I had one history teacher that encouraged me to go on to grad school but no not really.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's nothing really significant, were there very many black students at Illinois State?
Speaker 2: There were a hundred of us, student body of about five or six thousand. I think--I was talking to one of my old buddies and he said, "You know there were a hundred of us all together down there during say from '59 [1959] to '62 [1962], there were a hundred, on the average, about a hundred of us all together."
Speaker 1: And had the Civil Rights Movement penetrated student life there at all?
Speaker 2: It wasn't big, now there are you know we did a little organizing, a little placards but you know like we'd go to the barbershop, white barbershop and see if they'd cut our hair, I mean it wasn't big.
Speaker 1: Now that's significant though that something is going on 'cause--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it wasn't you know like--it wasn't like it was at most campuses.
Speaker 1: Well those were the beginning days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well because of where now that I think--I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Those are the beginning days of the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Civil Rights Movement basically.
Speaker 2: But it became a hotbed I'm told later on after we left.
Speaker 1: What state, what's the town that Illinois State is in, its--?
Speaker 2: The school itself was in Normal.
Speaker 1: Norman--that's right Normal, Illinois.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's right--it and Bloomington [Illinois] are hooked at the--you know are one in the same, Bloomington-Normal.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah that seems interesting, Normal, Illinois (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well originally you know you had--you got the four state schools, state teachers college. You had Northern Illinois State- Northern Illinois normal teachers school [Northern Illinois State Normal School; Northern Illinois University] and that was in, in DeKalb [Illinois]. Then you had Western Illinois normal teaching school [Western Illinois State Teachers College; Western Illinois University, Macomb, Illinois], and then you had Southern [Southern Illinois Normal College; Southern Illinois University] in Carbondale [Illinois] and you had Normal in Bloomington. So you had four state teaching schools and those were the four and then as time went on and things evolved and developed. They changed their names and they changed their focus and became something bigger than teacher schools, you know.
Story_ID: 551604
Speaker 1: So now did you enjoy teaching high school?
Speaker 2: No I, I--you know I--it was cash flow until I could do something. I had a family, it was a way to make a living and create some cash and look for some things but no I never intended to teach very long.
Speaker 1: Now was Waller [Robert A. Waller High School; Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] mostly black when you were there?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no; Waller was a, almost a model and I'm sure that it's not staying that way. We had--if you look at the student body it was pretty much divided into three elements. You had the affluent white kids off the lakefront okay, you had the immigrant kids, Hispanic and Eastern European off of the west side of the expressway or west of Halsted [Street] okay and then you had the black kids out of Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] and off of Larrabee [Street] and Sedgwick [Street] and Hudson [Avenue], those dilapidated areas down there which are now affluent--Lincoln Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's pretty much what the makeup of the school was then, fascinating place to be, fascinating you know? Fascinating school and then it wasn't artificially created; it was just the way it was.
Speaker 1: That is an interesting mix, you have the Gold Coast [Chicago, Illinois] kids and Cabrini kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --in the same public school.
Speaker 2: And the ethnic kids.
Speaker 1: Any good stories from Waller?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I we, we use to talk about it if you, if you really had educators, people that are really interested in education, what a perfect environment to do some things and try some things you know, but they were about BS and politics, they weren't about educating. I'm trying to think I, you know my head wasn't in it so I--you know I was there, I didn't get into it. I was, hey, I, I gotta do this 'til I can do better.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you--so you were at Waller how long?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: And then you said you taught in the middle school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I don't know why in the heck I can't remember the name of that, but anyway the last year I was there, the last year I taught we had two student shootings in that one year, McKinley, McKinley Upper Grade Center [William McKinley Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, Upper Grade Center?
Speaker 2: Right, which is middle school.
Speaker 1: Yeah and you were there from what?
Speaker 2: I was there from September of--from September of '65 [1965] to March of '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay and now what school were you at when they started--when you had the two shootings?
Speaker 2: McKinley.
Speaker 1: McKinley okay all right, so this is in '66 [1966]? What happened?
Speaker 2: Just tough neighborhood, just tough neighborhood. We had, you know we had a cop there all the time and he had--I don't know how many times he had to pull his weapon, it's a tough neighborhood.
Speaker 1: These gang problems or?
Speaker 2: Everything, you name it, but.
Speaker 1: Is this like a West Side [Chicago, Illinois] school?
Speaker 2: Yeah right down the street from Crane [Crane Technical High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's two blocks from Crane.
Story_ID: 551605
Speaker 1: What happened that you left teaching?
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now what's going on now is things are opening up in the private industry. These companies now are looking for their first, second, or whatever third black professionals to hire okay, to put into sales or what they call management training programs, blah, blah, blah--whatever it was okay? And I had put a resume together and had talked to people and started looking and two opportunities presented themselves. One was with Lederle Labs [Lederle Laboratories], would've been pharmaceutical sales, and the other was with the--oh, at that point in time it was called Standard of Indiana, Standard Oil of Indiana became Amoco [Amoco Corporation; BP Corporation North America Inc.] okay? It became--I'm sorry it became American [American Oil Company] and from American it became Amoco as a sales representative, and so Lederle Labs I would've been a detail person or a pharmaceutical sales. So they offered me a job at the same time Standard Oil or Amoco, American Oil offered me a job as a sales--as a territory manager, okay? I would've been responsible for managing in and so forth, about twenty-five stations and territory I would've been responsible for was starting on like Halsted [Street] and running west to Oak Park [Illinois] to Austin [Chicago, Illinois] from like Lake Street down to Roosevelt Road. So I would've had the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] and some of Oak Park and all that, and so I had to make a decision, 'cause I told 'em both yes, but I had make the decision (unclear), and I talked to some fellows that I knew at Lederle Labs, in fact a guy by the name of Ted Wheeler. Is Ted on your list? He was I think the first black rep [representative] at Lederle Labs.
Speaker 1: Ted Wheeler, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He, ultimately he ended up being assistant head coach at Iowa, he'd been a track star at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa]. He was from Evanston [Illinois], and he says, "Well Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Hunter]," I said, "Hold on, I got two jobs here man, tell me the pros and cons of coming to Lederle Labs," and he basically told me man--you got--unless you want to do this for the rest of your life don't come here because it's dead end. All they're gonna do is put you in a territory, you're gonna run after numbers, as long as you get the numbers they'll leave you alone, they'll give you a good bonus and a company car but you'll get comfortable and there's no out. There was no one really to talk to much at the Amoco because I--I think there were only--they only had--I was the third black rep, I would've been the third and so I talked to the--I did talk to two fellows. One was Chuck White who had been the first black hired at Amoco and he was getting ready to leave and he says, "Man don't come to this because it's dead end." He was getting ready--Chuck White then became Chuck White Ryan- on the Ryan [Chuck White's Buick on the Ryan, Chicago, Illinois], the Buick dealer?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He became Chuck okay, he says, "Dead end, they'll work the hell out of you, they just put you in a territory that's predominately black, they'll want you to beat up the people and push numbers into gas and oil and push all this merchandise and there's nothing in it for you." So, here I was caught between the devil and deep blue. I wanted to leave teaching, I wanted to get out and do something that was business like or entrepreneurial not--you know I wanted to get into the business world rather than the nurturing, caring teaching world, and you know because my thought were this is something that's never been offered to us and so I, you know if I got this opportunity I'm gonna try it, but I wasn't getting good feedback from the folks that had been out there. So I said well you know neither one of 'em seem to be great, but I said okay welcome to the real world; of the two which one helps me best and so I said learning a business, because that's what you become when you become a representative with Amoco back then, you become an expert in that particular small business. You know the service station business top to bottom. So I said well seems to me that's the best way, the better way to go versus pharmaceutical sales. I'm not gonna ever be in business in pharmaceutical sales, but at least I will learn the principles of business by going with Amoco oil, so I took that job and had the territory on the West Side of Chicago.
Story_ID: 551606
Speaker 1: I was the representative [for Standard Oil of Indiana; BP Corporation North America Inc.]--that was my sales territory where the riots started. I was on the corner of Madison [Street] and Kedzie [Avenue], right down the street from Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] when the riots broke out, but that was my sales territory.
Speaker 2: Now that was in 1968?
Speaker 1: That's '68 [1968] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed April 4, '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: That was '68 [1968]. Right.
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: I was standing right there on the corner of Madison and Kedzie.
Speaker 2: Now what did you see, I mean what?
Speaker 1: (Makes noise) And people looting and running and shooting and shouting and yelling and pulling folks out of cars, whites that were driving through they were pulling 'em out of car and beating 'em and, and I left there and I went down to twenty- to 22nd [Street] and St. Louis [Avenue] 'cause they had a station down there and I called into the office and they said, "Get the hell outta there, forget about that territory go home." And I left 22nd and St. Louis 'cause it was exploding down there and I went over I had a station at Warren [Boulevard] and Western [Avenue] which is one block north of Madison around on Western, just north of and all the way down all you could see was looting, TVs, clothes. Madison was--at that point in time I had two of the busiest stretches in the City of Chicago [Illinois] in terms of commercial business in my territory. There was on the corner of Madison and Western, there was the corner of Pulaski [Road] and Washington [Boulevard]. Retail--I also had Roosevelt Road, but I didn't get down that far and all you could see was looting, yelling and screaming, shooting and beatings, that's all you could see. So I made it to Western and Warren and from there I went straight north on Western and got the hell out of there, I didn't come back for a week. And when we came back there was just nothing but devastation.
Speaker 2: And they actually set the stations on fire, they--?
Speaker 1: No they didn't set any stations they were just looting, the worst thing you saw was looting, just yelling, screaming, running and looting.
Speaker 2: Now how, how did you first hear about Dr. King being killed. Do you remember when you first found out (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I heard it right there, that's where I heard it, right there on the--there's a restaurant at Madison and Kedzie and I was in there, that's when I heard about it.
Speaker 2: How did you feel about it?
Speaker 1: I, I was surprised he lasted as long as he did, because when I first learned about him, I remember my buddies and I were saying this guy is either a saint or a fool. This is like '62 [1962], '63 [1963] something like that and if he's a saint he's not gonna last very long. We were surprised he lasted 'til '68 [1968]. Said the things he's espousing especially when he really became anti-Vietnam [Vietnam War], said things he's espousing they're gonna get him. I mean that's in our, my immediate circle that was the feeling, they're gonna get him and when he lasted 'til '68 [1968] they said, "Damn, we might be wrong, he might--he may actually get outta this," and because it had started to (gesture), you know it started to (gesture), it started to--by '68 [1968], but in essence we just said hey that guy's talking about--the things he's talking about can't last, that's, that's not what (laughter), that's not the mindset of the powers that be.
Story_ID: 551607
Speaker 1: Now you worked for Standard Oil [Standard Oil of Indiana; BP Corporation North America Inc.] just one more year 'til 1969 right?
Speaker 2: The riots broke out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a sales rep [representative]?
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then like in '69 [1969] you opened your own station?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did that happen, now you're thirty-three years old basically, pretty--a young man out here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean how did you get your own station?
Speaker 2: Well I had this seed in here (gesture) that I wanted to do something other than teach. I wasn't sure what it was. An opportunity came to learn a business and so the business I learned was the service station business and in the process of learning that service station business what I found out was there's a hell of a lot more money to be earned running a service station than it was being a service rep or being a teacher (laughter). Almost immediately--and that a lot of young guys that were leaving the company that were doing that, there are lot of my peers that have been sales reps, none black, most of 'em white and they've been growing in the western and northern suburbs where the growth was then, Hinsdale [Illinois] and Western Springs [Illinois] and Northbrook [Illinois] and Glenview [Illinois] and all those places where the population was just booming. About eight or nine of my peers had left Standard Oil and taken stations and as you talked with 'em almost all of 'em said they doubled their salaries the first year, doubled, doubled their earnings. So back then if we were making thirty that mean immediately they made at least sixty. That's what they were reporting; now how much they were able to--under the table is something else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So. Then in the back of my mind, I started looking for potential locations, and there was one that opened up, there had been a station there but they reconfigured the whole corner and put up a new station. I lived right on the--almost on the corner of Evanston [Illinois] and Skokie [Illinois], on the Evanston side. That was one they put up about six blocks from me and they put a guy in there who was a horrible dealer, all he did was run prices up, treated people poorly in the neighborhood and they gave him a station, gave him an opportunity farther west into Skokie and this was right on the border of Evanston and Skokie and they were looking for someone who knew the neighborhood to put in there and I found out about it and I asked about it. Immediately my district managers told me, "Hell no, you're not leaving, we've trained you, you're one of our rising stars, we're not gonna lose you, forget about it." So, I backed off for about a month. I went back in and talked to 'em again, and he says okay. Ray Wilds [ph.], one of the brightest people, he was an old, hardened and conservative guy from southern Indiana, had a real thick drawl, bright, very incisive thinker, says, "Well Fred [HistoryMaker Fred Hunter], we gotta start doing something about this because you've come back to me," and he said, "that's the test." He said, "I tried to run you off, but I wasn't able to do it so you're determined, so you're going to leave," and he says, "and you're going to leave and you're gonna go into a station I can tell that." He says, "So it makes no sense for me to have you leave and go somewhere else, we've trained you, you're one of our rising stars, you're a hard worker, you have excellent reviews, so why would I lose you? So just sit tight. I figure you don't have any money because you got a young family." (Laughter) I just had a second son [Aubrey Hunter], said, "I know you've been in your house probably about a year or less so I know you probably don't have any money." I said, "You're right." "We're probably going to have to do something in terms of financing so just sit tight, just sit tight," and so he says, "and you'll be hearing from me." So that's when this other opportunity opened up that was in my neighborhood; they said, "We got the right spot." So we made it happen.
Story_ID: 551608
Speaker 1: Okay, so now what's a--is it--so what was it--what you expecting it to be, was it fairly easy to do if you?
Speaker 2: Service station, man it's--
Speaker 1: Now those are--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you man it, it's--without question, without question the best thing that ever happened in my life, I mean other than having my kids [Stuart Hunter, Aubrey Hunter and Kenyon Hunter]. No, no question, it was like having sex every day and totally on your own, making your own living, making your own decisions and not accountable to anyone other--best thing that ever happened to me in my life. It was almost seven or eight years of bliss. Now, you worked your butt off, you had no real life, but the sense of you were in charge of you and you weren't dependent upon anyone else or you didn't have to take orders or directions from anyone else and you could take care of your family and do the things that they, you know that you wanted to do for 'em. Nothing ever, ever close to it like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing. Now, like most things it ran out because I developed an allergy from gasoline fumes. I couldn't see from here to you and the doctor told me, "I can keep shooting you up with all that stuff and everything, but you need to get out of those--outta that environment." So we had to sell.
Speaker 1: Now this is in 19--?
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976], '77 [1977] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-six [1976], '77 [1977] okay.
Story_ID: 551609
Speaker 1: In 1977, you sold your service stations. Now while you were working, while you had your own station you started doing some freelancing for the Tribune [Tribune Company; Tribune Media Company, Chicago, Illinois]. Now, what was the nature of the freelancing?
Speaker 2: No, no this is after I sold the stations.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay so.
Speaker 2: I sold the stations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They--we have this wrong (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, let me back up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After the doctor told me that eventually I was going to have to do something, what I did was I started taking a class down at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois], and I, once again I wasn't sure. I said well can I get the M.B.A. and then I'm approaching forty years old okay? What am I gonna do if I get out of this business, for a living? I had a few pennies so I wasn't panicked to have to do something. I could have taken some time off. You know what I'm saying, which I did. I knew eventually I had to do something so I said well do I go get the M.B.A., do I go to law school? Do I--so I sort of picked in between. I said what I'll do is I'll get a--since I had the undergraduate in, in social science why don't I get a degree, a master's in public administration? So I went back to Roosevelt and started working on that. Before I finished that I sold the station, so I had applied for some government jobs but at that time Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was in office and he slashed everything back so that as a source had pretty much dried up okay? And so I had a buddy of mine that was doing part time delivering newspapers, Tribune [Chicago Tribune]. And so he and I were out, 'cause he a jazz enthusiast like I am, we were out a couple of night listening to jazz and he gets two, three pieces to the wind and he can't do his delivery so he asked me to go along and help him. You know he's a couple of two, three sheets to the wind and so I said, "Help you do what?" Said, "Well with my part time job," well when we were growing up, when we were younger all of us had part time jobs, all of us had hustles, cleaning up buildings or whatever you know. I thought that's what he had, so I told my wife [Leila Hunter], "Let me change clothes and go out and help Rich do his job." Well he takes me to the end of this alley somewhere and these people are loading up cars to deliver newspapers. I said, "I'm not gonna deliver no damn newspapers, what the hell you talking about?" Well the Tribune, you know when we were kids, kids delivered newspapers, but they changed and made it adult delivery, particularly cars and all that. So that happened a couple of two, three times and the guy approached me and says, "I notice you in here a couple of times with," my buddy's name was Rich Jones [ph.], "is this something you might be interested?" I said, "I don't know. Tell me something about it." He told me what the dollars were and I (gesture), and they were paying under the table then, it's all cash. I was thinking yeah, so down here, let me make sure I got this right. We come down here two, three o'clock in the morning, you prepare papers, you put 'em in your car, you deliver 'em, you're through back here by 4:00 or 4:30 and you got yourself a hundred and fifty dollars per week, cash. You know I said hey, that, that ain't all bad, you got the rest of the day to do what you wanna do. So, I said well let me think about it so, I said well let's try it. So I said, "Yeah I'll take one." So he gave me a route and so I did all right on it. He says, "You, you, you're not like most people that are doing this," he said, "you, I gave you something to do and you just do it. I don't have to give you any directions or follow up or anything, you just--it seems like you, you come in here and you got the paper fairy with you and the paper fairy delivers 'em," and so (laughter). Well that's all there is to it you know. Anyway, one thing led to another and he told me, "How would you like to work for the Tribune?" I said, "What do you mean, work for the Tribune?" I said, "I thought this was work for the Tribune?" He says, "No, this is delivery, this is part time, I'm talking about full time," and I said, "I didn't know there were full time jobs other than reporters or something at the newspaper." So he explained to me what was going on. One thing led to another anyway I became a district manager, full time okay, and actually running a area, a district, which was then Evanston/Skokie [Evanston, Illinois and Skokie, Illinois].
Story_ID: 551610
Speaker 1: Long story short I went from there, district manager to assistant district manger, to district manager up in Waukegan [Illinois], district manager from Waukegan back to Evanston [Illinois] then I went downtown--see these trucks that make all the deliveries to the stores and boxes and machines and all that, see these Tribune [Chicago Tribune] trucks? We call that city street sales so I went there as a sales rep [representative] for about three years and I left there and went back up to the North Shore [Chicago, Illinois] and then went back out to Schaumburg [Illinois] as a regional manager. Anyway, district manager, assistant district manager, district manager, regional manager, and then I became a department head, which I was responsible for all the trucks you see on the street in the City of Chicago [Illinois], deliveries to all those stores and all the homes, okay and I did that then I became a regional manager and I had everything from Howard Street up until the state line from the lake [Lake Michigan] all the way over to Route 53 [Illinois Route 53], and--and all of these are first because I--what actually was happening here I was the first department head, first black department head in each one of these. You know they never had black department heads, from the city street sales, city home delivery, a regional manager and--
Speaker 2: Now, well, what's the timetable on some of these? What years do they take place, do you remember?
Speaker 1: Okay so I went--it would have been '77 [1977], this is about '86 [1986], '87 [1987] when these things started, so between '77 [1977] and '85 [1985], '86 [1986] okay.
Speaker 2: Okay so by the time you become (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And '90 [1990] yeah, the last four--
Speaker 2: So when you become a department head for--?
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990] okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then, then a funny thing happened. I was up in North Shore, one of my locations in Northbrook [Illinois] and the number, the guy that was gonna take over, the number two manager of the Chicago Tribune at that point in time, he just--his name was John Madigan, I'm sure you probably heard of him, said he wanted to come out and take a look 'cause he was just taking that job, taking over that job. He just came from Tribune corporate [Tribune Company; Tribune Media Company, Chicago, Illinois], he was coming to the field to--we didn't know he was gonna take over the Chicago Tribune we didn't know it then, but they knew it, and he wanted, he lived in Winnetka [Illinois] and he wanted to come out to the close facility and see what they do in a facility and my closest--the closest one to him was Northbrook which was my facility, okay one of my facilities. And so we met him out there and my boss and one of my peers met him out there one morning and we were showing him around and since it was my facility I was doing most of the showing, and he kept looking and looking and he says, "Let me ask you something. What's your name again?" I told him. He says, "Where do you live?" I said, "Evanston." He said, "Okay." He walked around for a while, while I explained everything what was going on. He asked me, "Let me ask you something else," he says, "how long have you been in Evanston?" I said, "Just about all my life since I was eight years old." He said, "You go to high school?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "What high school?" I said, "Evanston [Evanston Township High School, Evanston, Illinois]." He says, "What year did you go there?" I told him, he said, "I thought so." He remembered me from football and wrestling, he went to New Trier High School [Winnetka, Illinois] (laughter), and he says, "I thought so." He says, "You wrestled and you played football?" I said, "Yeah," anyway I got politically connected there. He remembered that okay and I got, within eighteen months I got three promotions because he was steering things from here okay. I sort of became a hot commodity, and so I ended up leaving the Chicago Tribune and went to Tribune corporate as the first director of diversity management. Well before that I was, I was special assistant to the, to the publisher of the Chicago Tribune and then I became the--at the corporate level I became the director of diversity management, so '77 [1977] walking in off the street throwing newspapers to '96 [1996] all of this happened, just walking in off the street (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, in the course of nineteen years here so?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.
Speaker 2: That's something now you--it's--seemed curious that that's something that you never really expected to do you know?
Speaker 1: Well you know I expected to do all right, to have some opportunities and do all right. I didn't expect those specific things because what I found out is if you apply yourself you don't make a lot of mistakes and you do the politically correct things that things can happen. Now you can't, you're not gonna become Madigan but you can achieve some things you know. So I expected to do all right, I didn't expect it to happen like that.
Story_ID: 551611
Speaker 1: According to what we have here you've been responsible for bringing in a lot of other black employees, good black employees to the Tribune Company [Tribune Media Company, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, over the years that just sort of happened, became a mentor for a lot of young, black and white and Hispanic young folks and I think that had to do more with the fact that I had worked my way up and I think folks sort of identified if you know, if he can help you work your way up if you don't come in wired, politically connected, he can help you work your way up or in keeping your nose clean and doing the right things, and so I still do that. I've been retired over seven years and I have a lot of folks that I talk to, young folks that are--some still with the Tribune some that are no longer with the Tribune.
Speaker 1: Yeah what, what's the most critical advice that you have for someone coming into the Tribune for a minority candidate?
Speaker 2: Know that, what you come into the situation with, the expectations are not always what the expectations are of the organization. You need to find out what are the organization's expectations and goals and align yourself with those, or make the decision, make the decision of whether or not you can morally, ethically align yourself with those and if you can't you need to get out of there, but you need to know that you need to find out what they are so you're not operating in this false atmosphere of you're gonna change the organization, that ain't gonna happen. You need to find out what is it the organization's expectations are. Can you align yourself without out abdicating your morals, ethics and principles? But stretch 'em, be willing to switch 'em, but not abdicate 'em and align yourself with those as much as possible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Know the lay of the land, politically whatever.
Story_ID: 551612
Speaker 1: You were kind of a guide to people to you know kind of educate them as to what the lay of the land is?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about people that you have helped through that you can share with us or, or stories of people who you tried to help but couldn't because of one reason or another they couldn't follow (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well we got some folks that started out with us just like I did as part time delivery drivers, okay. Didn't have degrees, finished their degrees, undergraduate. Got M.B.A.'s from--all of 'em, M.B.A.'s from Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], okay and they're all doing some wonderful things, some with the Tribune [Tribune Company; Tribune Media Company, Chicago, Illinois] some with other companies, they've left. So you've got a number of those okay?
Speaker 1: Okay. Well who some of the people who came through there?
Speaker 2: Latrell Peterson-Dykes, Bennett Williams [Bennett B. Williams], Nicole Kelly [ph.].
Speaker 1: Well I don't wanna get you in trouble (laughter).
Speaker 2: Phyllis Johnson.
Speaker 1: Wait, what was the last one?
Speaker 2: Phyllis Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John O'Loughlin, yeah this--it's just off the top.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and you don't have to name 'em but did you have any cases where people just didn't--they didn't listen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lots, lots, there are more of those than you have, you know or they just made the decision this is not for me. It was just I, I--you know they couldn't align themselves with them.
Speaker 1: Well what do you think the problem is for people who--especially for black to get involved in a corporation like the Tribune in terms of them not wanting to--deciding it's not for them? What do you think the major factor is?
Speaker 2: I think it's a cultural thing, I think their view of Corporate America versus the reality of Corporate America. People who run the show and do well--I'll give you an example. A young majority kid comes into the office, gets--is a new hire. Wants to know where is his desk, who's his secretary, okay? They're coming in with attitude of they feel empowered and they're ready to take that sense of empowerment and leverage it to their advantage okay.
Speaker 1: They just got there right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: A minority kid comes in wants to work hard, keep their nose to the grindstone and be rewarded, have no idea of how to leverage (laughter). The importance of leveraging where you are into something else, they come in with keep your head down, work hard and things will be--will happen for you. Here's the majority kid, how do I make things happen for me? I think that's the biggest difference.
Speaker 1: You think they were fundamentally mis-educated--?
Speaker 2: The cultural difference, the cultural quote, unquote baggage that one brings versus the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that's almost, I mean when you think about it that's, that's very difficult to overcome because black culture teaches you to get your education so you won't have to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so I, I see that historically as the major challenge.
Story_ID: 551613
Speaker 1: Is there any, any particular story of interest from that--those days as diversity director [for the Tribune Company; Tribune Media Company, Chicago, Illinois]? Were you ever put in a position where you, you was kind of squeezed between the employees and the company?
Speaker 2: No, not really because you know by the time I became diversity--I mean I was ready to retire and so you know they knew me, I knew them so it wasn't gonna happen. I, I knew (laughter) what to do and not to do, they knew what to do and what not to do, what they asked in terms of asking me you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now when you retired were you of retirement--just of retirement age or did you just want to--was it just a decision to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got out at sixty-four.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean in--you got out when?
Speaker 2: At sixty-four.
Speaker 1: Age? Okay, so that's the customary retirement age for that.
Speaker 2: Anything past sixty-two, sixty you know. Some people stay to sixty-six or sixty-five--you know sixty-two.
Speaker 1: Okay. So have you basically just remained retired or did you, have you started any?
Speaker 2: I haven't done anything. I, I consulted for one year with them, the first year, went in once a week.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I haven't done anything since.
Speaker 1: Now do you have, do you participate in on boards around town?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I spend--my routine is I get up about 5:00, 5:30 every morning and workout for about two, two and a half hours. I come back and eat my dog food 'cause I'm on a pretty strict diet, eat my mush and I'll go to the library or to the lakefront to Northwestern campus [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], drive up and walk up and down or--then I spend a hell of a lot of time with my grandkids. I have six grandkids and all of 'em are right there, so they're all involved in ballet, ice skating, hockey, soccer, football. So spend a hell of a lot of time with them and then my wife [Leila Hunter] and I have ten acres down in South Carolina down in her home [Abbeville, South Carolina] and she's down there quite a bit. I'm down there sometimes and we work on that.
Story_ID: 551614
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well you know I'm out of sorts here. I was blessed enough to see the giants you know to live with 'em you know, the Jackie Robinsons, the Martin Luther Kings [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], the doctors and the pharmacists and the ministers and the teachers that you know lived in the community that were involved and those are the ones that I describe as the giants okay? And so what, what bothers me now is where are they? Where, where are the giants now 'cause I don't see 'em. You know the town I grew up in, Evanston [Illinois], you know it's a sense of community involvement and responsibility. You can get jacked up doing some of the stuff you, you get away with now. People threatening people and all that so the spirit that I have is where are the giants, now unfortunately I think I know the answer to that too. The reason there aren't any giants because the real giants they were in the parents, and I think that's where the breakdown is, but I don't know the answer to that and I don't know why the parents aren't the giants anymore, but that's my sense of despair is, where are the, where's the leadership? I have no confidence in the quote, unquote ministers. There are some teachers I think are trying to do--where, where's the leadership?
Story_ID: 551615
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: I'd go to law school, I would've come right out of undergrad and I would've gone to law school, because I think that's--if you wanna know what makes this country tick that's the best way to--you have a broad understanding of what makes society--what runs a society.
Story_ID: 551616
Speaker 1: Likewise today when you look at everything you've done to this point, what today would you say is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Kids, my family and kids [Stuart Hunter, Aubrey Hunter and Kenyon Hunter], they're all good parents. They're not, they're not--none of 'em are superstars, one runs his own business, one is in technology, one is sales, but they're good kids, they're good people, they're good mates and they're, they're devoted, dedicated, doting parents here more importantly, and they love the hell out of their mother [Leila Hunter]. They probably feel all right about me but they love the hell out of their mom, they love each other, they love the kids. They're pretty decent dudes.
Story_ID: 551617
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you have three sons [Stuart Hunter, Aubrey Hunter and Kenyon Hunter]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're not superstars, they are just decent dudes and they're trying to do the right thing you know. They have their faults and all but they're, they're for the most part committed to trying to do the right thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, do they all live around here [Evanston, Illinois] too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And well now does your wife [Leila Hunter], is she a teacher I think (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No she's retired, she didn't work for the most part when they were growing up, she worked after they got out of--you know the last ten, twelve years she worked. So she's retired now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She just likes, she's a country girl. She just likes being down south again you know, being out in the woods and building fences and gardens and you know I'm down there, she's got a million and one things to do all the time. So she loves it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she loves being back in her hometown because that's where she grew up and that's where she's comfortable.
Speaker 1: What is it like now back in Abbeville County [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: It's still rural down there, very rural (laughter), I mean the closest airport is an hour and fifteen minutes away. So we fly, fly into Greenville [South Carolina] and then we keep a car by the airport and we drive down. We're an hour and fifteen minutes before we get down into Abbeville [South Carolina], very rural, very laid back. The town square is the center of everything, well just very, very rural and slow and laid back, very much so.
Speaker 1: And how's it for black people down there now is it better or what?
Speaker 2: Well you know it depends on who you talk to. I think, my, my memory of the South was in Asheville [North Carolina], and you weren't called by your name. If you were a black male you weren't called--very seldom were you--called by either boy or uncle or whatever, shine or whatever you weren't called by your name, and I just marvel at "Yes sir," and "No sir," and "Thank you," and "Come back again." I just marvel at that. I mean that to, to a seventy year old guy that grew up down there and left there when that wasn't you know (laughter) to see that I, I just think of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], it just to me is, it's the ultimate 'cause he made that happen. Now whether or not that's genuine who knows, but who cares. It doesn't make any difference whether it's genuine does it? I mean practically speaking, ideally I guess it does, but practically speaking it doesn't make any different whether it's genuine or not you know, that's a fundamental change in our society in my lifetime, that's, that's mindboggling to me.
Story_ID: 551618
Speaker 1: Now is there, is there anything I haven't asked you that we think we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.
Speaker 1: Okay, now our last question is similar to legacy, but a little different. Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Good husband, good father, good friend.
Speaker 1: Okay, that sounds good enough. Well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: All right.
