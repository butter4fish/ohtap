 Gill. Today is June 27, 2009. I   m visiting with Winston  Shindell, former director of the OSU Student Union here in the Student  Union on the OSU campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for  the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Winston, it   s a delight to have you back. First of all, can you  share what brings you back today?  Well actually, Jerry, I   ve found as you get older and get a lot of gray hair  and sometimes missing some gray hair that you suddenly become a  historian. (Laughter) And so the current director of the Union, Mitch  Kilcrease, is doing some taping to capture some of the history of the  Union and so I was invited to come back and very glad to come back. I  always look forward to coming back to Oklahoma State because this is  very much an important part of my history, also.  Winston, this interviewer knows a little bit about you. (Laughter) But  let   s go back and share some of your early times.  Okay.  Can you tell me about where you grew up, a little about your early life?  I grew up in a little town in Durham, Oklahoma. Thirty-five people at  the time I was there.  On Saturday?  Yeah, on Saturday. No, everyone left on Saturday to go to the county  seat, Cheyenne  Roger Mills County . But 35 people. I was part of a  high school graduating class of seven. And as a matter of fact, we lost  our school. We were the last class to graduate from Durham High  School because it was consolidated with another school. So I grew up in  5  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  western Oklahoma in a farming and ranching community. My father had  sort of a hardware/gas station combination store, did a lot of installation  of well pipes. Interestingly enough, that school I   m telling you about is  how I got connected to Oklahoma State University and decided I wanted  to come to Oklahoma State.  Well, let me ask you first of all   because I want to get to that story of  how you got to OSU, Winston, were there some values, lessons about life  that you learned growing up from your family, from the small-town  environment, that influenced you later on?  Yeah, I think it was Hillary Clinton  who  said,    It takes a village to  raise a child.    I think I   m one of those people that she might have been  talking about. It was a very close-knit community. I grew up in the    50s.  I wonder if the    50s weren   t really some of the best times to be growing  up. But hard work, set your goals, if you work hard enough, you   ll get  what you want. Honesty, have your dreams, follow your dreams, all of  those were parts of things that I learned. And just, I think, the  importance of community, the importance of family, the importance of  friends.  How did you get to OSU? What   s the story there?  Well, it   s really interesting because my father never went to college. So  I   m the first generation person to go to college. And he hadn   t been even  on the campus of the University of Oklahoma, but back in those days I  think everyone would listen to the football games. OU football was big,  Bud Wilkinson and all of that. He was a big OU football fan and it was  his thought that I should go to OU. Well, I had a very good friend who  had come here, John Goodwin, also was from Durham. You may  recognize that name.  Professor Goodwin, John Goodwin.  Professor Goodwin. Dan Goodwin was also a brother that ended up at  OSU. And so John had come to Oklahoma State and had suggested that I  might be interested and one day, I was in the school library and found an  annual, a Redskin, and I was thumbing through it and believe it or not, I  saw the picture of this Student Union called the    Waldorf-Astoria of  college unions.    I was just blown away by the structure and the beauty  of the campus. And so that sort of piqued my curiosity and I was lucky  enough to get an alumni scholarship and that sealed the deal. So that   s  how I ended up at Oklahoma State University.  What was your impression when you first set foot on campus?  6  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  (Laughs) Well, being someone  who  graduated with a class of seven in  a town of 35, it was a little bit frightening. Very large. I mean there were  more people on my residence hall floor than lived in my town or even  were in the whole school that I went to. So I think the size of it was sort  of   and I wasn   t real comfortable. I think those first few weeks, I was  kind of getting a little bit homesick and maybe wanting to go back to the  protection of this little community that I was talking about. But my  parents were very   they knew that the way to improve and the way to  get out was education. And so it was very important that I stay. I found  that those fears went away very quickly.  I think Oklahoma State University did a very good job of getting the  freshman class acclimated, touring, breaking a very large group down  into smaller groups that you could deal with. This Union was all a part  of that, because I very quickly became a part of the Union. I could even  tell you on the tour where the   Linda Jones, I can remember the name  of the gal that was up there from SUAB talking about the Student Union  Activities Board and trying to, as we went on our tour, get people to  join. And I decided, boy that   s what I want to do. Because I still was just  in awe of this facility. The Waldorf-Astoria of college unions as it was  called, and I thought,    Well, I   ll probably never get to New York so this  might be as close to the Waldorf-Astoria as I   ll ever get.    And so you  form your groups, you form the smaller groups. Everyone was extremely  friendly, extremely helpful and once I got here, you couldn   t pry me  away.  Did you participate in Howdy Week?  Yeah, Howdy Week,    I   ll Meet You At The Union,    all of those things.  And we even had the freshman beanies as I recall, the little orange ones  where we went over and as a group sat in Gallagher Hall at that time  and     What year was that, Winston?  That would   ve been    57. The fall of    57, right.  You   ve talked a little bit about the Student Union Activities Board and I  assume you got involved in that, but could you share a little bit about  your undergraduate student experience here at Oklahoma State? What  are some of the things you were engaged in, what activities?  Well, I was a member of a fraternity. So I was engaged in all the  fraternity things, Phi Eta Sigma, some of the honorary societies. But the  one thing I was engaged in as a freshman, I found out very quickly if  you come you need to learn to dance. In those days there was a little gal,  7  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  an older gal, from the school of Hyper by the name of Flora Mae Ellis  and Flora Mae taught social dance. So I, along with about a hundred  other kids, would come once a week, to the ballroom and we would  learn to dance. And so that   s one of the things I got into. But most of my  undergraduate experience, I did some work with the Redskin, but it was  mainly focused on the Union, on the Student Union Activities Board.  Can you share some highlights of leadership opportunities that you had  as an undergraduate? Were there some different positions you held,  things you did as an undergraduate?  Well, one of the things that I learned very quickly was that I wanted to  be a chair of a committee. I mean there was sort of a progression on the  Union board so I started out as a committee member on the Program  Committee and then at the end of my freshman year decided I wanted to  be the chair of committee, not realizing that you probably had to spend  two years at that time to get a chair. So interviewed for that and didn   t  get it. That   s probably the first thing that I can remember that I ever  interviewed for  something  that I didn   t get. So that was a good lesson  for me. And I remember that, keep focus on what you want and where  you want to go. The next year I came back and got it and then became  president of SUAB.  Also, I had some leadership positions through ROTC. I was in that  program. Through the fraternity house, I was a member of Tau Kappa  Epsilon, in those days, and had some positions through that. Those were  primarily the things that I was involved in. I got some academic honors  through it. I don   t know how, but I was selected as one of the top ten  seniors, which my folks thought was really great. My sister-in-law was  another one. So my mother-in-law thought that her children had married  very well. (Laughter) They didn   t make it, but their spouses did.  Well, Winston, the Student Union Activities Board still remains very  viable and a very important student organization on our campus. But I  sense that in the    50s, in the early years, it was really a key student  organization, wasn   t it?  It was. I think part of that is because the Union was much more  prominent in those days as the place to be. I mean the place was filled  from morning until night. Then at night there were a lot of activities, a  lot of student meetings occurring in the building, a lot of programs going  on. So it had a special place, I think, on campus. Now, things have  changed and some of the other student organizations have grown and  there   s a lot more things, I think, for students to become involved with  now than there were in those days.  8  Gill  Shindell  Can you share a little bit about your work experience and your journey  toward becoming director of the Student Union?  Well, that   s interesting, Jerry. Because once I got involved with the  Union, I decided that that was what I wanted to do. I didn   t even know  that there was a career in college unions. I can remember going in and  talking to Abe Hesser one day and saying,    You know, I really would  like to be a college union director,    and in the back of my mind it was,  I   d like to have your job.    So how do I do that?    and he said,    Well, you  know, there   s not a formal program.    He said,    There are probably two  ways you can go. One way is through Student Personnel Program in  Higher Education over in the School of Education.    But he said,    I   ll tell  you what. I think that today it   s really important that people who want to  go into this field have a good background in business. And there   s a new  program over in the School of Business called an MBA, Master   s in  Business Administration. I would suggest that you go over there and  enroll in that program.    Which I did, and got my MBA.  Then, I had two years that I had to serve in the service and my thought  was always, I want to come back to Oklahoma State University. I mean I  couldn   t think of any other place that I would rather be than Oklahoma  State University. Well, my wife, Liz, in those years, remembered the  nights that I was not at home, I was at the Union because I had worked  as a graduate assistant, I probably had the first graduate assistant  position here. I worked a lot in catering in those days, so I was gone at  night. She was gone during the day teaching kindergarten. And I can  remember when we were in the service, she said,    You know, I will  support you in anything you want to do except being a college union  director.    (Laughter)  So at that time, I thought well, I   ve got an MBA. I had a friend that said,     You really ought to interview with the DuPont Company because  they   re hiring. You   ve got the hot degree, and if nothing else you can  send them your resume. They may invite you to Delaware or Virginia to  interview and at least you   ll get a free trip out of that.    I did and they  interviewed me and hired me as an industrial engineer, which was not  my background. They said,    You don   t need to worry about it, we   ll  teach you everything you need to know.    So we loaded up after we got  out of the service, everything, moved to Virginia. We cleaned out the  attic because the Army was paying for the move, for the re-location. We  got settled in this little town in Waynesboro, Virginia and I was working  at a textile fibers plant as an industrial engineer doing time and motion  studies, which is not what I like to do, hidden in an office in a little  corner back there with no interaction with people. After six months I just  said,    This is not what I want to do.     9  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  I was very unhappy and I remember calling back here and talking to Abe  Hesser and saying,    If there   s anything that   s available, please let me  know. I   d like to come back and interview.    I was in Louisville,  Kentucky at Fort Knox and I got a call (because I was in reserves at that  time). And he said,    We have a position back here in Halls of Residence  that might be available. Come back and interview.    And well, I did.  Funny thing, while I was on campus, I came back to interview for Halls  of Residence and ended up after talking to Mr. Hesser and Dr.  Robert   Kamm, being hired as Director of Student Activities. So we loaded  everything up and I can remember Liz saying,    Don   t you accept  anything unless they agree to pay for your move.    Well, of course, they  didn   t agree to pay for the move and so we ended up paying for the  move and moving back to Stillwater and Oklahoma State. I became  Director of Student Activities, which was during the years that there  were a lot of things happening on campus, which I wouldn   t trade that  experience for anything.  What year was that, Winston?  That would   ve been 1966, yeah. I was Director of Student Activities for  five years.  And you reported to whom?  I reported to Frank McFarland, who was Dean of Students at that time.  Zelma Patchin was up there, Darryl Troxel was up there, Jim Miller was  Dean of Men. And as you know, we were having a lot of demonstrations  out on the lawns and things like that. Well, I was so na  ve, I   m telling  you a long story, but I   ll get there. I was so na  ve that I thought the  Director of Student Activities was responsible for all student activities.  There were a lot of people on campus that didn   t like those  demonstrations out there and I can remember one day, Dean Miller  walking in and saying,    There   s going to be a demonstration on campus  tomorrow. The president doesn   t want that to happen, stop it.    And he  left, walked out the door. This was at 4 o   clock in the afternoon. Well, I  had good channels of communication with the students and student  government and they happened to be the ones that were going to sponsor  the demonstration. I thought,    Oh geez, what do I do? How am I going  to stop this?  So I went up, they were meeting upstairs and sat down and visited with  them, went through all of their plans and they were indeed going to  sponsor the demonstration. I said,    You know, if there   s anyone that   s  injured, if there   s any damage, you could be held responsible.    They all  understood that, I knew what the answer was going to be but I thought I  should at least try. And they said,    You know, we   re in control of the  10  Gill  mic. We   re in control of the program. That demonstration is going to  happen regardless of whether we are sponsoring it or not. As long as  we   re sponsoring it, we do have control of the podium.    I thought about  that and I thought,    Boy, that makes a lot of sense to me.    So I went  back down      Furthermore, you know, we   re willing to assume any  responsibility that might come from this. Even  if  we   re expelled from  school.    I mean they were going to go to the wall.  I go back down to the office and I   m sitting there thinking   this is  probably about 7:30, 8 o   clock at night. Well, I was told to stop it and  I   ve discussed it, so what do I do? So I remember, I said, well I   ll just  call the president (since apparently Dr. Kamm was the one, according to  the Dean, that wanted it stopped). So I picked up the phone and called  the president and Dr. Kamm answered the phone at home. I went  through the whole thing and explained the rationale and he said,    Don   t  worry about it. Everything   s going to be fine. It   ll be okay.    And I  learned a very important lesson that night and that is there are a lot of  people on campus who will use the name of the president. It   s kind of  like that old game of gossip with the telephone where you go around in a  circle. I think probably what had happened, the president may have  made a statement, something like,    Gee, I wish this weren   t going to  happen tomorrow,    and by the time it got to me, it was,    Stop it.     (Laughter) I hung up the phone and went home and slept that night. The  demonstration was held the next day and nothing happened. It was well  done and so I learned a great deal from that. So those were wonderful, I  really enjoyed those years. A lot of good camaraderie with students and  meeting faculty and things like that.  My goal was to be director of this Union and then in about, I guess it  was 1971, the position opened and I applied and I was selected and  became director. Probably was not prepared at the   well I won   t say  probably, I don   t think I was prepared at the time but I was willing to  take on the challenge. And it was immense. The responsibilities were  immense. I expected the skies to open up and I don   t know, for some  lightning bolt to come down and I   d feel all those great things. Well that  didn   t happen. That was probably the most lonely position I have ever  had. (Laughter) It was great that I had people that I could go to and talk  to that would help me through that, but the responsibility suddenly  dawned on me and I   m reminded be careful what you ask for, you might  get it. And so I   d finally reached and I was probably   let   s see, that  would   ve been    81 so I was about 32 at the time. I had reached what I  thought was going to be my career goal. So that   s how I ended up as  Director of the OSU Student Union.  Your predecessor was Norman Moore, right?  11  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  My predecessor was Norman.  Was that helpful that he moved into the Vice President   s position here?  He moved into the Vice President   s position here and that was extremely  helpful to me because Norman was one of my mentors. Abe Hesser was  one of my mentors. I learned a lot. I think you can learn a lot about how  to manage by different people, both good and bad. Abe was one of these  people that was very controlling with information and things like that  and he managed from a position of power and control more than, I think,  developing people. That was not the model that I wanted, but I did  respect what he was able to do. One of the things that I found was that  there   s a great deal of stress and pressure. I guess I never realized all the  various publics (fully realized, I knew it but I didn   t know it) that this  building serves. Everyone has their own idea of what   s important and  you have to balance all of that. I mean, where else are you serving  students, faculty, staff, alumni, guests of the University, and it   s like a  little city. And particularly this Union the administration, regents,  everyone has their ideas about what should happen or what should be  done.  Winston, going back to your comment about Abe Hesser, there has to be  stories, legions of stories about Abe Hesser. Do you have some favorite  Abe Hesser stories?  Well, (laughs) one of the things that we used to do (and I learned this  when I was a graduate student) we would have Hotel and Restaurant  Hospitality Days. They may still have it, I   m not sure. But the students  would plan that weekend and Abe always wanted everything to go  perfectly well because the Union was the showcase, that was where  everything was going to happen. (Laughs) And the students would come  up with these wonderful ideas of things they wanted to do, but they  happened to be things that we didn   t have a lot of experience in. So we  would practice and practice.  I remember one particular thing, they wanted Baked Alaska. So we had  gone out and bought the sparklers to go on top of the Baked Alaska and  it was going to be in parlors A, B, C, which now I think is suite 1600 or  now, probably it   s a different name, anyway, it was a smaller room, but  it was this formal occasion. I can remember, we   re lighting the  sparklers   well whoever bought the sparklers bought the wrong kind.  Not the kind that sparkle, but the kind that smoke and sort of are red.  They were lighting these things and people were going out in the dining  room carrying these sparklers and Baked Alaska and pretty soon people  started coughing. They were coming in lighting more and I walked in the  dining room and looked. You couldn   t see anything from the chest up  12  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  for the smoke because the air conditioning system couldn   t handle all the  smoke and people were coughing. Oh, it was funny. As I look back on it,  it was funny. It wasn   t so funny to Abe. I mean he really, really, I can  remember we really got a lecture about that. But he was a perfectionist,  he demanded perfection.  There was one person, Polly, his wife. I mean when Polly came through,  I can remember her coming through saying,    Abe Lee, where   s Abe  Lee?    And that was one person that (laughter) he didn   t pass. But all the  rest of us knew about Abe and we sort of quaked. I mean he would have  his early morning staff meetings, I think they might   ve met daily, where  they   d go through the schedule and everyone had to report what was  happening and he   d give his comments and all that. He always defended  his staff, supported his staff. But he was in control. There was no  question about that.  How was Norman Moore different?  Norman was much more open. My relationship with Norman was much  closer. And (laughs) I can remember, when I was director, I   d go over to  Norman and I would have a problem. I would go over to Norman and I  would sit down and I would start to tell him about my problem and he   d  start telling me about his problems and by the time our appointment was  up, I never got to mention my problem, I was listening to Norman   s  problems. I   d walk out feeling like, well I really don   t have   my  problems aren   t so great, so I need to go back and take care of them. But  Norman was always very supportive. He   I really, really, really  appreciated his support not only of me, but of the Union. And that   s  important. He had an idea of what the Union was about   not an idea, he  knew the philosophy of what a college union was all about and he was  able to communicate that particularly, I think, the importance of  programming.  My first job as a graduate assistant in the building, I reported to Norman.  I was working in food service and I learned food service from the  bottom up. I can remember I used to give instructions for the wait staff  at big ballroom banquets, Norman would do that. We had a little in-house  publication called Top of the Tower back in those days and  Norman and I would write them. Norman was the layout design person  because he also was an artist. Norman had a very dry sense of humor  and I really appreciated him. He took a risk  because  he   s the one that  hired me. I will always be grateful to him for that.  Did you work in food service when Haile Selassie was     No, (laughs) that was before me. But the stories of when Haile Selassie  13  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  was here   and Abe was one of those people that I don   t remember,  something in the story went something like the king was ready to enter  the ballroom for this big formal dinner. Abe thought it was important,  and it was, that everyone stand, in respect to the king. (Laughs) He   s  told this story and laughed about it. He said something like,    All hail the  king.    And (laughs) everyone stood up and the king marched in and all  of that. But Abe, he had a very, very, in many respects, soft underbelly.  Not many people ever saw that, but given what he went through, his  experiences as a prisoner of war and all of that.  But I really appreciate   I can remember one time when we were in     well okay, Abe   s not here any longer so I can tell the story. We were in  New Orleans at a conference. We were all seniors on the Student Union  Activities Board and Abe had made arrangements and all that and was  down there with us. We were on Bourbon Street and so all of us wanted  to go to a strip show, one of the strip shows. And Abe said,    No, no,  no.    And so finally he said,    Okay, I   m going to take you.    And we go  into this club (laughs) and I won   t go into a lot of detail but we went in  as a group, we sat as a group, he was with us. And some of the girls  were saying    Oh,    you know,    Hi there, oh,    you know. It was really  kind of funny after it was all over with. We said we wanted to go,     Okay, I   ll take you. You can go. I   m going to take you.    And then we  all saw our   well maybe not all of us, but most of us saw our first strip  show and Abe Hesser was the one that took us in and made sure that we  all stayed there until it was over. It was a burlesque show back in those  days. But we   d thought we   d really done something great. (Laughs)  You talked a little bit earlier about the different constituencies that the  Student Union serves.  Right.  First of all I want to start with what   s the mission of a student union?  I think the mission of a union is to be a community center, a place where  all members of the community can come together. Certainly, a union has  a very important mission, I think, in education and having programs that  help in the development of students. We do that as a laboratory for  learning, I mean we can offer real-life experiences. We   re doing that  right now in this facility through the School of Hotel and Restaurant  Administration and what   s happening in the hotel, what   s happening in  the Rancher   s Club. You   ve got to provide spaces where those things  can occur. It can also be sort of a unifying force, a place where people  can come   athletics does that obviously. But I think a union also does  that whether you   re bringing in people from alumni, guests of the  university from off-campus that want to come in and want to have a  14  Gill  Shindell  place to meet. In fact, that   s one of the reasons this building was built in  the first place was for it to support the extension functions of the  University. I think that   s basically it.  And I think that probably is more important today even than it was in the  days when I was here, simply because there are so many ways that  people can communicate without ever coming together and actually  seeing each other and building those relationships and connecting. If a  union   to me, if we   re doing our job and doing it right, we help the  University in making those connections and giving students a sense of  ownership, a sense of connecting, this is ours, and coming back to the  institution.  And for me, it certainly happened. I mean I was hooked, line and sinker.  I can   t think of Oklahoma State University without thinking of this  Union. This Union and my experiences in this Union out of the  classroom is really what shaped my career and gave me direction. I  mean to take a little kid from this little town in western Oklahoma and to  open a world of opportunities that I have had and experiences that I   ve  had is just, it   s   I can   t fully repay it and tell you how much it means to  me. I mean in many respects it   s certainly defined my professional  career and has had such a wonderful impact on my life. I get a little  misty-eyed when I come back and see the building and all of the  memories that flow through and what happened with the big bands as I  was a student and the formal dances that we had, the informal dances  that we had up in the Marine Room, the day when I was here in school  when they brought the small steer up and got it up into the Marine Room  up on the fourth floor. I mean just crazy college kid stuff. You know, all  those memories, floods of memories come back and it just gives you a  special sense of pride and feeling.  I had heard rumors about the cow in the fourth floor. Can you share a  little bit more information about that?  (Laughter) Well, I honestly   I know that it got up there and I know that  they took it up in the elevator in the building and it was during   oh what  did they call that week? It wasn   t Ag Week. Maybe, it was Ag Week. It  was a special week for the College of Agriculture. And the Marine  Room used to be the place where all of the country western songs were  played on the juke box up there and it just, I mean the dancing up there  was something. As a joke one year, afterhours they got this little steer  into the elevator, got it up there, then put it in the Marine Room. And  that   s all I know. I have no idea how they got it there but that   s one of  those things that I   m reminded of a past president of Indiana University  by the name of Herman B Wells and Dr. Wells said,    You know, I never  let facts get in the way of a good story.    So some of these things just     15  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  All of it   s true and some of it even happened.  No, but that was true. That was true, that part was true.  Well Winston, early in your tenure, what strengths did you identify that  the Student Union had that you wanted to build on?  The Union used to be a place where certainly the community came  together, the civic clubs met here. On Sunday morning you would come  and everyone after church would come to the Union. The cafeteria was  full but it was just sort of one of those tradition things that everyone  would come to the Union, eat in the cafeteria. I think over the years food  patterns changed, competition came in. One of the things that we wanted  to do was to try to rebuild the food service. One of the major things we  did was to completely   I guess it was the first major renovation of the  food service and all of the support services behind it, that project that we  went through and going through the planning of that and seeing it  through to fruition, that was something that was very exciting.  Trying to strengthen the Student Union Activities Board  was another .  Some of the programming, because I felt like one of the things that  happened was that it had sort of gotten shoved aside and was not at the  level that it should be. I know that there was a re-organization that  occurred while I was here where we actually   the Director of Student  Activities and the Student Activities Board, all of those functions were  folded into one and we brought some other functions of the University  into the building trying to bring more and more traffic. All of that   s  good.  And also trying to develop the staff. Because the staff for many years, as  I had mentioned, had been under the very tightly controlled, regulated  form of management and had not been given a lot of, I felt, flexibility  and opportunity to accept responsibility and learn and grow. And trying  to introduce some of those things with it was in the business operation,  and also trying to open up the business operation so that everyone knew  what the facts were. It used to be that you knew what your budget was  and someone else might know what their budget was, but you never saw  the total budget together. This was back to part of that control that I was  talking about. That   s not the way you run an organization, if you   re  going to develop people, if you   re going to help them move along,  you   ve got to open up the communication and start building a team. We  had a team originally but it was a different kind of team.  One of the things that I think was very difficult, very difficult with this  Union, and I don   t know if it   s still that way today but, is this business  side. It   s extremely important, but that was always the side it seemed to  16  Gill  Shindell  me, it was always the pressure to make budget, to make budget, to  generate the revenue. There was always the pressure that other groups  would want space in the building but wouldn   t want to pay for that  space. So you had the pressure from one side of people wanting space  but didn   t want to pay, from the other side you had to meet your budget  projections. And what got lost in all of that, it seems to me, was the  programmatic side, the student development side. I think that   s one of  the things that I   m so excited about, some of the things that   s happening  now, and I don   t know the full extent of what is being planned, but I  have a feeling, knowing Mitch, that he   s trying to bring back the student  development side, the student leadership side, and the role that unions  can play. That was the part that hooked me and that   s the one regret I  have is that as I was leaving the campus and as I left the campus, it  seemed to me that was getting farther and farther pushed aside.  Picking up a little bit of your conversation, what did you enjoy most  about being Student Union Director?  (Laughs) Well, it goes back to all of the different publics that you serve,  the challenges. It   s like being the mayor of a little city. This is a little  city. It has all of the same issues and problems that a little city has,  whether it   s the sewer or whether it   s the utilities or housekeeping,  maintenance, all of the crowds that come through, handling large  crowds, the challenge. The challenge. I can   t think of another job, I   m  sure there are some and given your experience, I   m sure you would say  there are, but I can   t think of another place that has all of these things  that are coming down on top.  I was walking through the halls upstairs and looking at some of the  historical information and it brought back   I remember the 13th of June  in 19 maybe it was    77, I can   t remember when the tornado hit. That was  on a Friday the 13th that hit it the Union. What happened, the previous  month   that was the year that there were two Friday the 13ths. The  previous one was the horrific hail storm that hit the campus and then the  deluge of rain came down. The hail floated, plugged up the storm sewers  and the lowest point on this campus, the formal gardens out here, was  the Student Union basement. I can still remember walking downstairs  and seeing the water cascading in. And the parking garage, what I  learned from that was that Chevrolets float better than Fords. (Laughter)  I mean it   s those kinds of things that happen.  You never know what   s going to happen when you   ve got a physical  plant like this or when you   re feeding   you have to turn over the  ballroom three times in one day to accomodate groups and how do you  do that? Well, everyone has to pitch in and help. It was hard to get labor  in those days, I   ve served many a banquet. You know, my kids for many  17  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  years thought that my job was to pick up trash in the hallways because  they   d always see me picking up trash and throwing it away. So you   ve  got that side of it and then you   ve got the educational side of it, the  student development side of it and working with the students. And  sometimes when the side of the maintenance and housekeeping and all  that, and all of the pressure and stress of the business side, you think  why am I doing this? Then you go back and you meet with the board and  the students and you see that student that   s sitting there that   s president  of your student board and remember when they came on the board, they  could hardly look you in the eye and tell you their name much less take  on leadership responsibility and seeing that development and growth.  That   s what does it. Then following them as they leave and keeping in  touch is wonderful.  You probably partially answered the next question. What did you like the  least about being Student Union Director?  Well, the stress, the pressure, the long, long hours. But it was all worth  it. It was all worth it, that   s part of the job.  You alluded to it being a business also, programmatic side of it, the  business side of it. In your tenure, what were the major operational units  of the Student Union, how were they organized and managed?  Of course, the one that was the major one (and I   m sure is still today),  the one that drives the facility, is the bookstore and the student store, all  of the software business and the books. I mean our budget was made and  (laughs) it could either be made or broken in the fall of the year when  your sales came in or when you took your inventory at the end of the  year and did your count to see was there a shortage or how your books  balanced out. But the bookstore was the major revenue generator. The  hotel certainly was another part of that, and then food service. Then,  maybe some meeting room revenue and that type of thing, but those  were the primary generators. You had to make sure that all of those were  always in good shape because if one went down then the whole budget  collapsed because those were the key parts of the foundation.  We had, I think, some turnover in food service, that   s very, very difficult  business. We tried I know for a year, at least when I was here, going  from self-op to having the institution, the Halls of Residence operate it.  That did not work out too well so we went back to self-op. Now my  experience has been to go back to leasing it out and letting someone else  do it. That   s what most unions do now.  So you had the bookstore and the student store and your food  operations, what else?  18  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  We had the lease shop operations that were here. In fact, this Union was  the forerunner of that. Lease shops in the buildings to commercial  enterprises were a part of the first planning for this building. You had  that little mini mall down on the first floor. That was quite controversial  as far as the profession was concerned when they did it because that was  again, you   re becoming a business and you   re ignoring the education  side of the building, you   re nothing more than just a service station, so to  speak. But that was pretty much it.  Then you had the hotel.  We had the hotel.  And the operation.  And the operation of the hotel. Our occupancy, we had 86 rooms at that  time. And our occupancy was   everyone would always say,    I never  can get a room at the hotel.    Well, everyone wants a room at the same  time: Commencement weekend, athletic events, and those kinds of  special events. So that   s why the conference business is so important, is  to take up the slack. And you   ve got to do that. So the extension side of  it, that   s another important part of sales, marketing, that kind of thing.  Parking garage.  Parking garage. Forgot about the parking garage, that   s another very  important part of it, revenue generator.  And, of course, there is all the janitorial services.  Yeah, and we   ve been very fortunate. One of the things that this Union  and one of the things that I have learned is that you can do a lot of things  but I   m trying to remember one of the trustees, I can   t remember who  made this statement, I think it was with the Higher Ed Board of Regents,  I guess, for the State of Oklahoma said,    You can always tell how well a  facility is operated or run by the restrooms.    And I agree with that. One  of the points of pride of this building has always been maintenance and  housekeeping. There has been a standard there that was set in the very  beginning and has continued to this day. I mean today I walked through  and looked at it, the building looks great. And you consider how old it is,  some of the areas are, and the quality of the finishes. I mean they   ve  done a really great job. That makes a statement. We are the front door of  the campus for so many may people. It not only makes a statement for  the Union, it makes a statement for Oklahoma State University, what  this university values and what it   s all about. So we sort of, I think, set  the stage.  19  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  So speaking of your management style that you indicated earlier, your  meeting, you had the heads of each of the different units. Did you meet  weekly, monthly, what was your style?  Basically, what we would do, we would have a combined staff meeting,  a weekly staff meeting. We would go through the schedule, we would  talk about upcoming events, we would talk about any problems that we  had had previously, we would ask each department head to give an  update, to report, primarily information sharing. If we had other issues  that we needed to address, we would do that in smaller groups and then  bring it to the central group. I think it   s extremely important that  everyone be on the same page and everyone know what is happening.  Another thing that we would do is bring students in. I mean this is a  Student Union. One of the teaching opportunities is to bring students in  to have them involved as we discussed policy, set policy, as we discuss  budgets. That   s all part of the learning process, it   s so important. In  addition to that, I would meet weekly individually with each department  head. We didn   t meet every week, but for the most part it was a weekly  meeting. Maybe in the summers we wouldn   t do that or if there was a  downtime. But I don   t believe in meeting for the sake of meeting just  because I have a very short attention span. (Laughs) Any meeting that   s  longer than an hour is too long for me. And so I always try to keep them  very short yet allow everyone an opportunity to participate. But again, I  think that   s all part of building people and building a team.  Winston, why do you think alumni and friends of this university have  such strong feelings about the Student Union?  Well, I think the feelings that they would have is based on their  experiences with the Union. If it   s been a good experience   one of the  things that I love to do, I did it here, I did it at Indiana, I love to take  tours of the Union. I don   t give the tours. My tours are just sort of  walking through the halls and listening to what people are saying. When  you have students going through your facility and they   re saying,    This  is where we          This is our       when they start using words like that,  you   ve made the connection. That   s the one that is so, so important,  which says to me that they have had some type of experience in this  building, maybe with the building they identify with, maybe it   s a  program, maybe it   s a friend. Whatever that interchange is     Club activities.  Yeah, it could be   I remember one of the greatest people, I still  remember, I can   t remember her name, but I can remember her face was  the lady that worked in the cafeteria line down when I was here as a  freshman. When I was feeling like I was very alone, I can remember that  20  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  lady, I would come in here and she would smile and would always have  something nice to say. And then after awhile, she recognized my face  and would always say if I hadn   t been in awhile,    I   ve missed you.  Where have you been?    I mean, it   s that kind of connection. It   s a     howdy,    this campus has that kind of feel to it. Every campus has a  feel. It sort of embraces you, in a sense of pride, a certain warmth. When  people think of the Union, they think of the building, probably most of  them, and I understand that. When you look at this building and this  structure, there are none other like it that I have seen in the country. It   s  a very, very special place. And so first of all, that   s what attracted me  first, was the building.  Then, I found out there   s a lot more to it than just the building. I mean  that   s the outside, that   s not the heart. The heart   s what   s happening and  the activity and the energy and everything that   s in it. And I think the  central space, the new space down there, the commons, it sort of  becomes the University commons down there where everyone can pass  through and sit and have coffee, talk to their friends. Kind of like sitting  on Main Street and watching people go by and relating to them. I think  the Union   s all those things. I think that   s what makes it special. It   s not  just a service station. If it   s just something where you drive through, get  your product, and leave, or walk through, get your product and leave,  it   s not going to make the connection that I   m talking about. This  morning, I was listening to (I listen a lot ) to a couple walking through  the building with a younger girl, a lady, they had been here and this guy  was saying,    You know, this is really a very special place. They are able  to take a very large       He was talking about the University, but then he  was also talking about the Union.    They are able to take a very large  institution and break it down into smaller units that you can identify with  and make it special.    I thought,    Well geez, that   s about the best thing  you can hear.    It doesn   t mean we always do it right, but on the whole,  we do a pretty damn good job.  I guess it relates, doesn   t it, to the slogans,    I   ll meet you at the Union     and    The Student Union, heart of the campus.    Those were slogans I  remember for years and years.  Yeah. Heart of campus. Oh yeah, oh yeah.    I   ll meet you at the Union,        The heart of the campus.    We had    Howdy Week    and all of that and  the Union was very much a part of that.  One unfortunate thing for OSU here is that the University of Indiana  wooed you (laughs) from OSU. Is there a story about how that evolved,  how that happened?  Well, Jerry, probably the best thing that ever happened to me was that I  21  didn   t get a job I went for. The Vice President   s job. I don   t know that I  would   ve made a very good Vice President but I thought at the time that  I might. I didn   t get that job and quite honestly, Jerry, there are certain  things, we all have certain things we believe strongly in and principles  and for me, I love this place. I love Oklahoma State University. I  thought I would spend my life and my whole career here. What  happened was, I had applied for a job which I thought that I could do  and was qualified for. I did not have my doctorate. I was told that I was  a viable candidate and I felt like I had been deceived. Not because I  didn   t get the job, but  because  I was told I was a viable candidate. All I  had to be told was,    You have to have a doctorate  to qualify .    I think I  was given a courtesy interview and I   ve never in my professional career  given courtesy interviews. I think that   s wrong, you raise expectations,  it   s not being truthful; it   s not being open, so that hurt. Also, I saw a lot  of things happening here that I couldn   t change, I couldn   t stop, as far as  more and more lounge space, student space being converted to offices.  That went against what I really believed in, so I had a decision I had to  make. I either had to accept it and continue, and I was becoming  unhappy with that, or I had to get out of the field, find something else, or  find another job in the field.  Well, as I was struggling with all of that   and one thing that I need to  say very quickly is that I had seen too many people in my career and at  DuPont, when I left DuPont I can   t tell you how many people came up  (and DuPont was a great company and was very good to me) and said,    I  really respect what you   ve done,    but at this point they were trapped.  They had been there too long, they couldn   t leave, and it just wasn   t the  right fit for me.  So I did not want to stay and become cynical or bitter, because I care too  much about this institution and plus if I didn   t feel like I could give it my  best. That   s not fair to the institution. It   s not fair to me. So all of those  thoughts were going through my head. About that time, Indiana  University, the Union at IU opened up and I applied. And part of it was  just to see if I was a viable candidate because I   d been through a  situation where maybe I   m not that good. Whatever. I mean all of those  thoughts go with you. Plus, I was sort of reaching I think   there   s no  question of what men go through, sort of a mid-life crisis, and you  suddenly look around and here I am doing what I thought would be the  end of my career, my career goal and we   d gone through a major  renovation and all these other things. And you sort of say,    Is that all  there is?    I mean these things go through your mind. I saw that as a new  opportunity, something that really excited me. The program, extremely  strong, large university. I saw some things where I thought I could make  an impact and that   s how they offered the job and that   s how we ended  up there.  22  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  And I can tell you that the first night I was there, because Liz and the  family stayed here, I had to go up there by myself. They had what they  called a madrigal dinner and it   s very nice. And so I   d gone to the  madrigal dinner, I   d stayed up late drinking coffee, I went back to my  room, my family was in Oklahoma, my parents were in Oklahoma, my  heart really was still in Oklahoma and I couldn   t go to sleep. I thought,     You idiot, what have you done? You have completely uprooted your  family. You   re moving them to this place and everything   s in Oklahoma.  Why would you do this?     I then started worrying about, oh my gosh, what   s going to happen? If I  should die   I   m serious   will I be buried in Indiana or am I going to be  buried    I mean what started out as not being able to sleep, suddenly I  was dealing with death and dying and who   s going to be buried where  and how are we going to do this. I mean about 3 o   clock in the morning,  or 3:30, I suddenly thought,    You idiot, your problem is you drank  coffee with caffeine and you can   t go to sleep.    That   s the last time I  ever worried about that. You know, I believe when one door closes,  another door opens, that   s always been my philosophy. It was a great  opportunity for me, it was the right fit. I   ve loved it and I felt, I  wondered if I could ever go to another institution and feel the same way  about that institution as the one that you left. You can do that. You  know, I retired there after 23 years as director. Actually, I   ve been at  Indiana longer than here.  Let me step back and ask you, what year did you make that change?  I left here in 1981, December of    81.  And you were how old at the time?  42.  So about ten years. You came in from    70 to    81.  Yeah, I was ten years director here, five years as Director of Student  Activities. Those were wonderful, wonderful, wonderful years. As I   ve  said before, Oklahoma State University, I owe so much, so much to this  institution. It formed me, I mean it lifted me up, it lifted me out. It  defined me in so many ways and it gave me opportunities that I never  dreamed I would have.  I think, Winston, in fairness, we should say that probably most people  nationally recognize the Student Union there at the University of  Indiana as one of the finest in the nation.  23  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  They do but I used to get so angry about that. You know, we have this  whole thing of which is bigger, whose is bigger, is the IMU  Indiana  Memorial Union  bigger than    and I don   t get caught up in that,  although I think they   re counting the parking garage here. (Laughter)  That   s okay, it   s what happens. You know, that   s so important. But it  was the right fit and it offered me the challenges that I was looking for at  that time, an opportunity. One of the things, Jerry, that I have found  through my years is that I   m not sure when I was director here that in  some cases people ever allowed me to make the transition from student  to administration, or have the responsibilities that I had. When you  leave, you make that transition and you don   t have to go through that.  Maybe that was part of it.  But it was the right thing for the Union here, it was the right thing for  Oklahoma State University, it was the right thing for me. I think it was  the right thing for the Indiana Memorial Union, too. But I can   t tell you  how much I love coming back here and the memories. I can walk  through this building, honest to God, and smell just the scent that   s in  certain parts of this building and it brings back all of these memories, I  mean it hasn   t lost that. I   m like an old dog. (Laughter) You walk  through and you know you   re there. You could blindfold me and take  me around the world and then set me down; if it   s here, I   d tell you  where I am, almost what part of the building I   m in. That   s just part of it.  Well, you   ve alluded to some of this, Winston, but can you share a little  bit about your philosophy, what a Student Union should be and what its  relationship with the University should be?  I mentioned that, I think it should be a community center. It should be a  place that brings people together. I think when they build any new  institution that   s being built, the Union is one after the Classroom  Building and something like that, the lecture halls, et cetera, the Union is  usually one of those places that   s conceived of and established simply  because of the need to have a place where community can develop and  you can bring people together and identify with. A Union, really, an  organization can do that, you don   t have to have a building to have a  Union. There are a lot of places that   in fact the one at Indiana started  out as an organization that met and then got their Union and all of that. It  is a focal point. It can be a unifying force.  One of the things that I   ve really enjoyed here, it should make a  statement about the institution. It should be a repository for a lot of  stories, a lot of information about the institution. Up on the fourth floor  they   re doing that here with some of the history and things. Because  that   s what people see, it   s the front door, it can be the front door. Then  that   s talking about the physical structure. More importantly I think, or  24  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  just as important, the student development aspect of it, helping students  realize their potential, helping them grow, giving them real-life  experiences. Then, offering the services that are needed for the  institution, whether it   s meeting rooms, hotel, what have you. Listening  to this guy this morning that I was telling you about, it connects. When it  connects or reaches and hooks someone, it sure makes it easier for the  people that are working in development.  You talked about the importance of the Student Union. Was Henry G.  Bennett, President Bennett, a man ahead of his time when he conceived  the Student Union?  Every great institution, I think, somewhere in its history has a Henry G.  Bennett. At Indiana it was Herman B Wells who was president for golly,  30 years and still remained after he retired, fundraising. Bennett, I mean  few people   my wife is from Indiana, was blown away. I said,    You   re  going to be blown  away . You   re not going to believe what you   re  going to see on this campus.    And the facilities, the beauty of it and the  planning. Bennett being able to close Washington Street and to allow the  formal gardens, to allow the library to be the keystone, which it should  be. He realized the importance of this Union to all of this. Now true,  they needed a place that could accommodate the extension folks and the  meetings and a place for them to stay, it did all of that but he also  realized the importance of bringing people together and having that  community.  I don   t know that he was ahead of his time. I think he might have been  as far as planning and the way that the whole, having the master plan  and making sure that facilities and buildings related to each other. I  don   t know any other institution that does it better. From that standpoint  I think he probably was, because he was looking at the long-term. So  many of us are so focused on short-term. Politicians, it   s the next  election, short-term thinking. And universities can fall into short-term  thinking, too. Bennett was a dreamer and a long-term thinker and a  visionary. I think Herman B Wells was that. I think they realized the  importance of the Union and what it can do for the institution.  Bennett intended the Student Union to be an iconic building, didn   t he?  Right.  He saw that as a main anchor that a university was built on and built  around.  Built around it, was part of   I think the library was probably the anchor,  but then there were certain other buildings that were very important and  25  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  the Union had a very, very obviously prominent place in all of that. It   s  just wonderful.  What do you remember about the funding mechanism, wasn   t that pretty  creative?  It was very creative, that   s what I was getting back to, the sale of  revenue bonds. Usually most Unions before that had been financed  through appropriations or private fundraising. But this was the sale of  revenue bonds that were guaranteed a certain portion of them by student  fees and then the rest of it by whatever revenue could be generated here  in the building. Part of that was looking for space they could generate  revenue and that   s where this whole idea of leasing space, the mini-mall  concept. I mean we had, as you know, Bonnie   s, which was a women   s  clothing store that did very well for many years.  Barber shops, bowling alley     Mr. G   s, now you   ve got a barber shop, beauty shop. We had a jewelry  store in here, had a little gift shop. I mean it was a little mini-mall. And  the drugstore, Cecil Colclazier had that and his parents   well I guess  Cecil was the parent now that I think of it.  Gene.  Gene was the son, right. But yeah, that was very creative. Very creative.  It   s interesting, Louie Sanderson was a part of that group that planned  and I can remember meeting with Louie, what a wonderful man who  understood, I think, the importance of this building and the funding. And  lots of wonderful people and the history that I got to interact with and  were part of my mentoring and building me. But I remember he said that  they traveled to Purdue and looked at the Purdue Memorial Union and  sort of used that as a guide because that particular union also had a hotel,  and it was a land-grant institution and they had the Purdue Student  Union Board, they called it PSUB, and that was what our board was  modeled after. So that was actually the model for this Union. And so  yes, it was very creative and somewhat controversial because of the  business side of it and the spaces being rented out. The interesting thing,  about every Union in the country is doing it now. So they were ahead of  their time.  At that time revenue bonds, while they were used out in the private  world, really in university campuses and particularly with a Student  Union, this was practically the first time to actually do that for a Student  Union.  26  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  I think it was the first, I think it was the first. Again, many have  followed that since then. In fact, I   d say it   s probably the way that it   s  done now on all new construction.  What were some highlights in your ten years, your 15 years, here but  particularly your ten years as Director of the Student Union, significant  moments, key events that you recall?  Oh, well I mentioned one being the renovation and that whole process of  planning and again, involving students in that process. And just  developing the program statements, working with Kendall and  Associates architects, working with Santee and Associates in Kansas  City. That, as I think about it, I was director for ten years and the  planning and the completion of that probably took a good four of those  ten years.  The introduction of the Madrigal feasts.  The move of all  programming down into a common area where we had student  government, student activities, student organizations, fraternities,  sororities, and also Student Union Activities Board, bringing  organizationally all of that together. I think the work that we did in food  service, not only through the management of it but also finding new  leadership there. As I said, I think most of my work was done internally,  trying to develop the staff and move with them.  Winston, the Student Union has a program they call Student Union  Memories. What are some of your favorite memories, individuals,  events, just favorite experiences that you personally had in your long  association with the Union?  My favorite memories start from the very, very beginning. I may be the  only person living that   s experienced the Student Union as a student, as  a committee member on Student Union Activities Board, as a committee  director, as president, as a graduate assistant, and then as Director of the  Union. As a student, it was just the activities and the energy and as I  mentioned the big formal dances were something that we always looked  forward to. The Glen Miller Orchestra, the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra,  Benny Goodman, I mean all of those people, those bands were   not  those people, some of them were dead, but the bands still were around,  were here for those big formal dances. Those are things I remember.  As a graduate student, my focus was primarily dealing with the food  service and just the big banquets that we used to have and some of the  funny things that would happen. I mean it makes me laugh when I think  about, again, some of the things that we tried to do and maybe we didn   t  have enough experience to do, but it didn   t mean we didn   t try. And the  camaraderie that we had in breaking down and setting up and moving  tables and all of that. The students, as director, some of the students that  27  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  came through that I met and some of them that went on and followed me  to Indiana and became graduate students and then went into the field.  Some of the staff that followed me to Indiana and have gone on. Marsha  Herman-Betzen would be one who   s now Executive Director of the  Association of College Unions International. Marsha got started, was  introduced to Unions here.  It   s just mainly not so much events, just people that I   ve had an  opportunity to meet along the way. The programs come and go, the  people I guess come and go, but they   re all so much a part of you in  what you learn and take away from them. Those are the things that stand  out in my mind.  Are there some university personalities that you recall? Not only just  Student Union but in your years here as a student and working here that  still resonate with you?  Well, Bettye Stratton would be one. Bettye was the Social Program  Director of the Union. She was our sort of    mother away from home    so  to speak and helped as the advisor to the program board. I mentioned  Abe Hesser and Norman Moore. Dr. Kamm certainly was someone that I  remember, Louie Sanderson, Bill Halley. The University Architect   s  office, Merle Rogers from the Alumni Association, Jerry Gill from the  Alumni Association, both from the Alumni Association and the next-door  neighbor standpoint. Let me think, the Agnews that were on the  faculty here, Larry Perkins who was on the faculty here in Sociology, I  mentioned Louie Sanderson, Raymond Gerard who was a registrar.  Actually Dr. Willham I remember very, very well. Larry Boger very  well and Frankie. Those were the presidents that I worked with. Darryl  Troxel     Dean Troxel?  Dean Troxel. Zelma Patchin. I was telling you stories about Abe, Zelma  was probably one person that could just drive him up the wall. (Laughs)  I liked Zelma, Zelma took care of me, Zelma and Trox took care of me  during my years as Director of Student Activities. But I remember one  day, we came into a meeting   it was in this office with Abe, and it was  after I don   t know what had happened, but anyway Abe   we somehow  in the structure, those in the student activities ended up reporting to Abe,   as well as Tom Keys in the Dean of Men   s office and Duane Treux in  Allied Arts . Abe was upset about something. And you could always tell  when he was upset because he would kind of bite his lip and the red  would kind of come up at his face. And Zelma, in Zelma   s own way,  could say,    Uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh,    and never change expressions,  always    uh-huh   uh-huh    and she wouldn   t respond. So we   d go out  28  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  and she   d say,    Well, I think that went pretty well, don   t you?     (Laughter) We   d go back up there. But anyway, you know Zelma. Golly,  there   s so many. Chuck Larsen who was in counseling, Rex Finnegan  who was a dear friend that was in counseling and the list goes on.  Winston, again we   ve touched on this partially with other questions, but  what accomplishments and significant events during your tenure give  you the most pride and satisfaction? Are there some highlights for you?  (Laughs) Well, I mentioned the student side of the student development  side of the board. I felt like we were able to bring some of that back. The  ability to involve the students in the planning of our major renovation of  the food service, the development of the staff. I don   t know, it was only  ten years, so I don   t know that there was a whole bunch more that I can  think of. I can   t think of any particular event other than it   s just the  satisfaction of having an opportunity to lead the Union.  Winston, a final question, but looking back on your tenure as Director of  the Student Union, how do you hope people will remember Winston  Shindell?  I hope they remember Winston Shindell as someone who made a  contribution, who was able to maybe give back to the University, who  left it a better place than he found it, the Union. As someone who cared  deeply about the Union and the people that were a part of it, who cared  deeply about the institution, and had a great deal of pride in being a  cowboy. And who still, every chance he gets, watches them on TV  through sports or whatever you   re able to get. Someone who was honest  and very open and straightforward and what you see is what you get.  I appreciate it. Winston, anything else we haven   t thought about? Any  stories you want to share with us?  I   ve probably shared too many already. (Laughter) But no, I don   t think  so. I think we   ve covered just about everything. It   s really interesting  because you talk about specific events, specific events, and I tend to  remember more as Director of Student Activities than I do as Director of  the Student Union. Now, the specific events as Director of Student  Activities would be that whole period of unrest and being out on the  campus late at night with my colleagues and talking to students and  trying to keep the campus calm. The demonstrations that happened out  here on the lawn. The Allied Arts, that was part of my responsibility as  Director of Student Activities, brought Duane Truex in from New York  and we did some programming over in Gallagher Hall, brought some  major people in. Dionne Warwick was one that I remember that we  brought in, that was very good. I also remember bringing some people in  29  Gill  Shindell  Gill  when we had about 50 people in Gallagher Hall. That was the worst  night I   ve ever spent in my life, so embarrassed. I mean should   ve  cancelled the show. There were probably more than 50 but it looked  like     I understood there were some speakers that perhaps President Kamm  didn   t agree with as well.  That   s right. I forgot about that. Abby Hoffman being one and there was  quite an uproar about that and there were some films that probably were  shown that people weren   t too excited about. We finally brought  Hoffman and I remember, I think I might have been Director of the  Union then, I can   t remember the exact year he came. But I remember I  was over there and backstage and the guy was so bummed out on drugs.  It made no sense whatsoever what he was babbling out. Hubert  Humphrey was another person that came in during that period. One that  I should remember and now that you mention speakers, was that we  were the last campus that Richard Nixon spoke at. I   ll always remember  that and the security and all that was formed. Another one, Colin Powell  I remember being here at a reception, Jimmy Carter being here are some  of the people. (Laughs)  It was funny, with Richard Nixon, the Secret Service, I remember they  were very professional wonderful people to work with. Then, the White  House Staff came in just a few days before and it was not wonderful. For  them it was a media event and how do you project the best side of the  president. I can remember them requesting that seats be removed down  on the field at Lewis Field and the reason that they wanted to do that, it  was so for TV purposes it would show that more people were attending  than there were seats for. I mean, a crowd. It was all this message that  was to be implied and the University didn   t do that and I   m glad they  didn   t. But I remember being over here the day that Nixon was to speak  and all of a sudden there were these people in the building. After you   ve  been in the building awhile, you sort of know the crowd who fits and  who doesn   t. All of a sudden we had these Latino people in the building  dressed as Latinos and they kept putting their hand up here. It was the  Secret Service communicating. I guess they assumed they were coming  to the Southwest (laughs) but they didn   t do their homework very well  because we weren   t that far south or west, I guess, for them. It might  have worked in New Mexico or Texas but not at Oklahoma State, so I  remember that. And I remember how impressive it was when the  presidential helicopter came in and all of us had jobs to do over there.  Winston, were there any instances here in the Student Union during that  time of social unrest and some racial issues, there was the Vietnam  issues, anything here     30  Shindell  Gill  Shindell  Gill  No, one of the things that a union should do, one of the very important  things, should be a forum where both sides can be discussed and you  never want to put yourself in a position of being on one side or the other.  You   ve got to be neutral. You   ve got to provide an unbiased platform  where views can be shared. I think this union did a very good job. Both  when I was Director and also when I was Director of Student Activities.  I remember a student by the name of Jan Cloyd who was president of  AWS  Association of Women Students  and this is when they were  demonstrating against hours. They had this big demonstration down on  the garden terrace. They were demonstrating against Zelma and so we  moved everything up to   we usually tried to take those kinds of  meetings and move them into the ballroom and that was fine. That   s the  role that we should play. That   s the important role of the Union, to be  that open area, the unbiased area where all points of view can be  expressed in a hopefully civil manner.  What have we missed? Did we cover everything?  I don   t know. I think that   s probably it. (Laughs)  I appreciate it, Winston. Thank you so much.  -------  -------
