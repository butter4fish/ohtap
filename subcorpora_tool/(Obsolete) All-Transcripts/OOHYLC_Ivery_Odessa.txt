Ivery He worked in International Harvester about thirty years, or thirty-five.  Finchum Doing mechanic or what?  O. Ivery He was janitor.  Bishop How did you meet your husband?  O. Ivery (Laughs) He was going down the street. Me and my girlfriend was  going to visit her sick boyfriend, and we were standing at the bus stop.  He came along and asked us if we wanted a ride. She said yes. I wasn   t  9  too, I wasn   t too quick to get into the car when I didn   t know the  person. She said,    We   re going to get in.    I pushed her so she would get  in first. He said,    No let her get in.    I said,    She is the one that wanted  the ride, let her get in first.    I didn   t want to be next to him, but he said,     You get in next to me.    I got in. Then she went to see her boyfriend.  Oh, he asked me where I lived, and I wouldn   t tell him. She told him  my address. He wanted to know what my phone number was, and she  told him that. That   s how I met him. He said,    I   ll call you.    I didn   t say  anything, because I wasn   t particular whether he did or not. I didn   t  know him. He called me the next day. He kept calling, and finally he  took me to the show. We went to the show, the theatre. From then on,  we was off and on, and finally we got married.  Finchum Do you remember what movie you went to see?  O. Ivery No, I don   t. It   s been so long ago.  Finchum Well, do you remember how he asked the question? How he popped the  question?  O. Ivery (Laughs) Well, that   s been so long ago. I think he said,    I think we need  to get married.    (Laughs) And I said,    I guess so.    We got married in  about two or three months, not after I met him, but two or three months  after he asked me.  Finchum How many children did the two of you have?  O. Ivery Five.  Finchum Five.  Franklin Six. You just have five kids?  O. Ivery How many do I got?  Franklin Who are you leaving out?  O. Ivery I don   t know, let me see. I have to count them first: Junior, Erma Jean,  (that   s two), you, Ann,  Robert  Charles, and Louise. I got how many?  Finchum That   s six.  O. Ivery My youngest daughter passed. Seems like yesterday.  A. Ivery Two years ago.  10  O. Ivery It don   t seem that long.  A. Ivery Almost three, two and a half years.  Finchum Let   s go back when you were growing up in Pottawatomie County. Did  you have chores that you had to do around the house?  O. Ivery Well, the house we lived in was a little shack. It rained in there more  than it did outdoors. (Laughs) When it snowed, the snow would be on  top of my mother   s bed. She had an oil cloth to catch it to keep it from  soaking in. It wasn   t a very good place. Then, we had one window.  Really, it wasn   t a house build for people. It was built for storage in my  grandmother   s yard. There was a backhouse out back where they stored  the food and stuff. I think one room was the smokehouse where they   d  smoke the meat. That   s where we lived. My grandmother lived in the  big house.  Finchum How was it heated?  O. Ivery In the country?  Finchum Uh-huh.  O. Ivery Wood stove .  Finchum Wood.  O. Ivery Wood   s all they had.  Finchum How did you get water?  O. Ivery We had a well.  Finchum So you had to pump or lower the bucket?  O. Ivery Draw, had to put the bucket down in there. Best water you ever tasted.  Finchum Did your mother sew?  O. Ivery Not really.  Finchum Not really.  O. Ivery She was just a housewife.  11  Finchum Your grandparents, were they born in Pottawatomie or had they moved  there from somewhere else?  O. Ivery They came from Texas, moved from Texas to Oklahoma. I think my  grandpa was a slave in Mississippi, somewhere down there in the Deep  South.  Finchum Deep South     O. Ivery Uh-huh.  Finchum Your grandfather on your mother   s side or your father   s?  O. Ivery Mother   s side.  Finchum Mother   s side.  O. Ivery He told me a million stories about slavery times. He said they used to  whoop his mother every day because she wouldn   t go by the rules.  A. Ivery Sounds familiar. (Laughs)  Finchum Remember anything else he told you about that?  O. Ivery Oh yeah, I got a lot of stories.  Finchum Tell us a couple.  O. Ivery Well, he said they whooped her just about every day, because she  wouldn   t go by the rules. His old master liked watermelon. He went out  to a pasture, pulled a little bitty watermelon, because he didn   t know  any better. He piled them all inside the main fence, wood fence, built  like that. He told him,    I got the watermelon so you won   t have to go  out in the sun.    The men that gave them the whippings said they were  going to give him a whooping for pulling all of them. Said he ruined the  vine picking all these little watermelons. They weren   t big enough to  pull. So he said,    No, don   t whoop Tom. I can   t let you whoop him. He  was thinking he was doing something for me. That   s my little nigger.     He said he would never give him a whooping, but he whooped his  mother all the time.  My grandfather got to be a preacher. He read to me all the time out of  the bible. Told me about slaves and how mean and how good they was.  His master was good to him. People always whooped his mother  because she didn   t go by the rules.  12  Finchum So, your grandfather was a preacher?  O. Ivery Uh-huh.  Finchum On your mother   s side or your father   s side?  O. Ivery My mother   s side.  Finchum What about on your father   s side?  O. Ivery Never saw him. Didn   t know him, as a grandpa.  Finchum Okay. The grandmother on that side?  O. Ivery I didn   t know any of them people.  Finchum Didn   t know them. Okay.  O. Ivery I just knew my mother   s parents. She had fourteen children, my  grandmother. My mother was the oldest child, oldest girl. A brother was  the oldest boy. Seven boys and seven girls she had.  Finchum That   s a lot of children.  O. Ivery Umm-huh. Yep.  Finchum Did any of them serve in World War I or II? Go to war?  O. Ivery I don   t know. They just served in the war. I know Uncle Henry and  Uncle Joe, and Uncle Johnny. I think three of them did. I know because  I heard them talking about it. I don   t know if any of the rest of them did  or not.  Finchum And they made it back?  O. Ivery Yeah.  Finchum When we were here before, you were talking about someone in a  cornfield.  O. Ivery That was Grandma. (Laughs)  Finchum Tell that story for us.  O. Ivery Henrietta Morgan was her name. She had that Uncle Johnny, and two or  three of the boys were gambling. She catched them and talked to them  13  about it. She didn   t want them doing that. They were doing it again out  in the cornfield. She walked up on them, and she shot the shotgun over  their heads into the corn, and it cut off a lot of the corn top tassels. He  said they fell on the ground all about them. He said,    We throwed them  dice down and money and everything else.    He said he hadn   t had no  dice in his hand since. (Laughs) She made them boys mind. Grandpa, he  didn   t do no discipline. She   s the one who disciplined. Can   t say my  speech right, can   t get my words right, anyway     Finchum She was the one that gave the     O. Ivery She was the one that disciplined everybody.  Finchum Disciplined them.  O. Ivery Her bunch and my family too. (Laughter)  Finchum So you didn   t mess with her then?  O. Ivery Oh, no. She was my buddy though. We were real close.  A. Ivery Tell her about when you went fishing.  O. Ivery (Laughs) Oh, she and I used to go fishing often. She would sit there  hours and hours and wouldn   t get a bite. We wouldn   t have nothing get  on the hook. I said,    I want to go home, I   m tired.    She   d say,    Let   s  stay a little longer, we might catch something.    So, one time we went to  fish right after it had been a raining a lot. It was real slick around creek  beds, side of the creek     Finchum Bank?  O. Ivery Bank. That   s what I was trying to think of. We stood there fishing and  she said,    Well I guess we better go. We haven   t caught anything.    She  went to get up, and she   s sliding off down in the water. It was so slick.  It was just mud and stuff. She was just slipping down. She took her  pole, and there was a tree there, and throwed it around the tree. She  said,    Go around on the other side and catch it and hold it. Don   t turn  loose.    I did. She pulled up that way out of that mud, because she was  slipping. Bank was so steep. She pulled on out by the pole and got out.  We came home. We walked about a mile then she said,    Child, do you  know that you saved my life? I would have drowned.     Finchum Maybe you could get away with a few things after that?  O. Ivery (Laughs) No, I didn   t get many whoopings. When I did     14  A. Ivery Didn   t she hide you under her skirt tail when     O. Ivery Yeah. We moved out in another house way down there, down in the  bottom, they called it. My mother was canning that morning. She  wanted me to watch the baby. She give me food, oatmeal to feed the  baby. She just ate so slow, and couldn   t ever get a teaspoonful down her  mouth, so I throwed it out. (Laughs) I throwed it out in the grass, and  the baby   s crying. She said,    Did you feed that baby?    I said,    Yeah, I  fed her.    She said,    Why she crying so much? She act like she   s  hungry?    I said,    I don   t know.    I wanted to go out and play with the  rest of them. She went outside,    Here   s this oatmeal out here. You  throwed it out.    Of course, I didn   t like it. (Laughs) She said,    I   m  going to give you a whooping. That baby   s hungry. You ought to be  ashamed of yourself. I   m going to give you    .    I took off and run off  and went back up to my grandma   s.  Momma come to get me. She said,    Where is she?       Where is who?     She said,    Where is Baby Doll?    That was her name for me, my  grandmother always called me Baby Doll. She said,    She   s not here.     She was fixing a quilt, making a quilt, and she told me to go up under  the quilt. She had it on her lap, so I went up under the quilt, hiding.  (Laughs) She made me come home. She didn   t whoop me, but she gave  me a good talking to.  The next time she gave me the oatmeal to feed the baby, I ate it.  (Laughter) It took so long for her to eat. The baby wouldn   t swallow a  thing, so I ate the oatmeal. Every bite I took, I almost threw up because  I didn   t like oatmeal. I still don   t like it. That stuff my daughter gives  me now. She said,    Eat this oatmeal. It   s good for you.    I said,    I don   t  want it.    (Laughs) But I eat it every time she gives it to me, because I  know it is good for me.  Finchum Put a little sugar on it     O. Ivery Put a little sugar and a little butter and I go ahead on. I know now that I  do need to eat something that is good for me. I try not to aggravate her  too much. She gets upset with Momma when she don   t think I   m doing  the right thing for my health.  Finchum Well, you figured out a solution to your problem with your mother and  the baby.  O. Ivery Yeah, I figured she sure can   t find it if I eat it. (Laughs) I   d almost  throw up every time I   d take a swallow, but I got it all down. She didn   t  15  know what I did with it, but she sure didn   t think I eat it, because she  know I didn   t like it. (Laughs)  Finchum So your grandmother quilted?  O. Ivery Yes, she made plenty of quilts for herself, for her family.  Finchum Did she teach you how?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. Yeah, I   ve quilted, and I like quilts. When I was younger, I  said I was going to make one, but I never did. She   d put all her pieces  together, and some of them was really pretty that she made. A thing  called Dessert Plate, had all the tips on it, a round center, like that. Then  you have little tips out there, different colors. She had all kinds of  material. I   ve helped my grandmother quilt. In the wintertime, that   s  what she would do with her hands, to keep them busy.  Finchum Did they move to Tulsa when you all did?  O. Ivery My mother had passed. I moved up here with my grandmother.  Finchum With your grandmother     O. Ivery Uh-huh, and I started to school. (Laughs) I   ll tell you this, I went to  Dunbar. All the kids had lunch money to eat and buy their lunch, but I  didn   t have any lunch money, so I took my lunch to school. Grandma  would have a biscuit   she made biscuits about that big. (Gestures) I   d  take them. Kids laughed at me.    What is that you eating? Come look at  what she   s eating.    They laughed at me, so I was ashamed to take them  for my lunch and sit at the same table with the kids cause they made fun  of me. So I brought it about halfway to school. It was in a little paper  sack, and I buried it in the grass and I said,    I   d eat it when I come  home that evening.    When I got let out of school, and went and picked  the sack up, it was full of ants. I couldn   t eat it. I hadn   t had nothing  since breakfast. I had to go home and eat because I couldn   t eat my food  because it was full of ants. So from there on when she fixed it and give  it to me, I eat it on the way. (Laughs) Kids laugh at you.    What is that  you eating? Is that a biscuit? I never seen no biscuit that large.     Another thing I   d do, I put myself up, cause I was way behind. I put  myself up in the right grade, so I would be with the kids my size. I  didn   t learn nothing because I hadn   t learned the way up, you know. I  hadn   t learned all the books I should have learned, so I didn   t do any  good. But then after I got married, I started going to night school. Then,  I didn   t go but one year, then the next year I was expecting a child.  After I had him, I couldn   t go, because I didn   t want anybody to keep  16  him because I was just worried about my baby. I couldn   t find nobody,  because I didn   t have a mother. My grandmother had gone too, passed. I  just didn   t go to school anymore. That   s as far as I got.  Finchum Well, it sounds like you were pretty good at problem solving along the  way.  O. Ivery (Laughs) Had plenty of them. Had plenty of problems. I didn   t get any  further than about the sixth grade, where I went. I kept saying that I  wanted to go. I thought the most important thing you could do was go to  school and go to college. I was really particular about it. I was hard on  my kids about it. That bunch, all of them, said they wasn   t going to no  college after they finished high school. (Laughs) But everybody went.  They didn   t all finish.  Finchum But they all finished high school?  O. Ivery They finished high school, but they did not want to go to college. They  didn   t want to go to  college  at all. I didn   t even have a school to go to.  I thought that was just awful. Now, she (Eleanor) says she wished that  she   d went on. She went to college, but she didn   t finish.  A. Ivery I didn   t finish when I was supposed to.  O. Ivery    my youngest son, he went to school. Went about three months. When  he came home, I took him shopping, bought him a lot of clothes and  stuff, so he   d look nice. It wasn   t long and I saw him walking up the  driveway. I said,    Is something wrong?    He had just left here. I said,     Where you going?    He said,    I don   t want to go to school. I   m just  going to quit and get me a job.    So he just quit. He really got some  good jobs. He was lucky, very good paying job, and stayed on for years.  He was lucky. And Eleanor, she quit. She didn   t go back and finish. She  went a while, but she didn   t graduate.  Franklin I graduated after I was married and all my kids were grown. I finished  then. (Laughs)  Finchum Just a little delayed there.  Franklin You don   t remember my graduation service?  O. Ivery Yeah.  A. Ivery You have an associate   s.  Franklin Uh-huh.  17  Finchum So you lost your mother at a young age.  O. Ivery She was forty-three when she passed. Yeah, when I was young.  Finchum Then, you lost your grandmother pretty young?  O. Ivery My grandmother lived to be a hundred.  Finchum She made it to a hundred?  O. Ivery Uh-huh.  Finchum Wow.  O. Ivery She went to stay with her son, Uncle Johnny, in Oklahoma City. They  took care of her until she passed.  Finchum You   ve got some good genes there since you   re still here.  O. Ivery She was a little lady. Seemed like to me my grandma knew a little bit of  everything. I thought, when I was younger, she knew everything.  Finchum And she had come from Texas?  O. Ivery I don   t know where they came from before Texas, but they came from  Texas to Oklahoma. My grandpa, her husband, was a slave. I think they  lived in Alabama somewhere down there. I was used to them telling  stories. He had a brother, and they sold him to somebody else, and he  finally found him. He lived in Texas. I kind of remember him going to  his funeral when he passed.  Finchum When we were here before, you mentioned someone with Italian blood?  O. Ivery Oh, that   s my dad.  Finchum We don   t have to go there.  O. Ivery I didn   t know anything about his people.  Finchum Okay.  O. Ivery He wouldn   t tell you about them. They was white or Italian or whatever  it was. He didn   t talk about them, he was ashamed of them. He came  home one day, he went off and got him a nip. (Laughs) He come back.  He said,    Where is Doll?    He come to me.    What do you want with  18  me?    I thought I had done something minding my business and he was  going to get after me about it.    I want to tell you something. My dad  was a white man. I don   t care any about them white people. They lived  in the front, and I lived in the back.    I never could find out whether he  had any sisters or brothers lived in the front half. That family was white  in the front so I didn   t know if he had any brothers or sisters. He never  did tell us. He told me,    As long as I live don   t ever ask me about them  anymore.    He said,    I don   t want to talk about them.    I never did  because he just wouldn   t talk about it.  Finchum He called you Doll?  O. Ivery Baby Doll.  Finchum Baby Doll.  O. Ivery He did call me Doll. They knew who he meant when he said Doll, he  always called me.  Finchum Did anyone call you Odessa?  O. Ivery No. Not while I was growing up. (Laughs) After I got up here, in Tulsa,  they called me   well, just about everybody did call me, cause my  people said Baby Doll. Only time people called me Odessa was when  somebody I would meet that I would tell them my name was Odessa.  Just about everybody called me Baby Doll.  Finchum Well, Tulsa has changed a lot since you moved here hasn   t it?  O. Ivery Oh boy, it sure has.  Finchum I can see a tall building through your window back down through there.  O. Ivery That   s downtown.  Finchum We are pretty close.  O. Ivery I   ve seen times, if you come out here, you couldn   t come out here  because the white people would get after you. They didn   t want you out  here. Then they started moving out, and the blacks started moving in.  Franklin Now the whites are moving back.  O. Ivery I remember when we first moved out here, a lady lived back of us there,  she came over. We had picked up a lot of stuff in the backyard and  thrown it in the alley. She come over and throwed that stuff back up  19  beside our house. I said,    What she doing?    My husband went out there  and asked her what she was doing? She said,    You throwed all this and  we keep the alley clean. We don   t put no junk in the alley.    He said,     This is my yard and I   m paying for it. Don   t you come here and bother  nothing else.    She lived back of us two or three years. Oh my goodness,  we picked this stuff up, that was before we moved in. I said,    Here it is  all back against the fence, against the house.    She said she picked it up  and throwed it back over in our yard.  Finchum When did you moved here?  O. Ivery Out here? Oh, lord. How many years I been here?  A. Ivery Nineteen sixty.  O. Ivery Huh?  Finchum Nineteen sixty, does that sound right?  O. Ivery I guess so. My youngest son, he went to school from here because I  looked out in the yard and he was coming back from school. (Laughs)  He didn   t want to go.  Finchum You mentioned your grandmother   s biscuits, your mother   s biscuits,  grandmother   s?  O. Ivery My grandmother   s biscuits.  Finchum Did you learn how to make them?  O. Ivery Yeah, I used to make biscuits all the time, every morning.  Finchum Did you make them that big?  O. Ivery For my family? No, they were about like this, (gestures) but hers was  great big.  Finchum Do you remember how to do it? What do you put in yours?  O. Ivery You put your flour, baking powder, little salt, little sugar     Finchum Sugar?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. Just very little, because you don   t want no cake. (Laughter)  Finchum How much shortening or lard or whatever?  20  O. Ivery I never did measure nothing. I mean I just knew what I wanted to put in  there.  Finchum This and that, okay.  O. Ivery Yeah, I can make some biscuits now. (Laughs)  A. Ivery I never could master it.  O. Ivery Huh?  A. Ivery I never mastered that one.  O. Ivery I tell you one thing I couldn   t make. I couldn   t make. I   m still disgusted  by it. It   s pie crust.  A. Ivery Oh yes you could.  Finchum Pie crust?  O. Ivery They said it was fine, but I know good pie crust and mine wasn   t the  best. Everybody said it was good, but I know my auntie could make pie  crusts with her eyes closed and turn out better than mine. She was a  good cook. I make good crust and I put the shortening in there, because  they say you have to put a lot to make it tender, not be tough. I   ve made  some real good pie crusts, but it   s still, I was never sure whether it was  going to be really good or just be eatable. (Laughter) That aggravated  me. I wanted to know I could make good crust, and know what it would  look like and would turn out good like Alberta   s all the time. She  cooked good pie crusts. My mother too. I never did.  Franklin I don   t know what you talking about. It was always good to us.  O. Ivery That   s what all you all said, but I know I   ve eat some good pie crusts.  My grandmother and my mother made good pie. You eat Alberta   s.  Franklin Didn   t taste no better than yours to me.  O. Ivery It didn   t? Well, I know living with them.  Franklin I quit trying when they started making that unfolded Pillsbury already in  the package. (Laughter)  O. Ivery Long as I was cooking, I never did buy the ready-made crusts. I always  made mine.  21  Finchum What were some of the other dishes that you were good at?  O. Ivery Well, my family thought I was a good cook. I thought I was average.  My husband used to brag on my cooking. The kids bragged on it, so I  guess that   s good enough, but I know good cooking. I know when it   s a  good crust and when it ain   t.  A. Ivery Caramel cake     O. Ivery Huh?  A. Ivery You made good caramel cake.  O. Ivery That was Daddy   s favorite.  Finchum Caramel cake, that sounds good.  O. Ivery It was good. I never liked a lot of sweets. I like pie better than I do cake,  apple pie and peach pie. Apple is my favorite.  Finchum Well, if you made biscuits, did you do much cornbread?  O. Ivery Every day.  Finchum Every day?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. I made patties on the stove, on top of the stove or inside  cornbread. I made good cornbread.  Finchum On top of the stove?  O. Ivery You can make a patty.  Finchum Oh, and fry it?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. That was good too. My uncle learnt me to make that. That  was   the kids always liked it and I always thought it was good too. If  you wanted to cook something quick, didn   t have to wait on cooking in  the stove, you cook it on top of the stove.  Finchum You put sugar in that too?  O. Ivery Yes.  Finchum Just a little?  22  O. Ivery (Laughs) Yes, put a little sugar.  Finchum Did you have a garden growing up?  O. Ivery Oh that   s my favorite, the garden. I   ve had a garden since I   ve been  here.  Finchum Did you can your vegetables and stuff?  O. Ivery I canned some, when my kids were small.  Finchum What would you do for fun?  O. Ivery Entertain my kids. My kids were my fun.  Finchum When you were a kid, what would you do for fun?  O. Ivery There wasn   t any fun. (Laughs) Picked cotton and chopped cotton, all  that. I said I was going to run away when I lived in the country. I hated  the country. (Laughs)  Finchum You had to pick cotton?  O. Ivery Yeah, pick cotton, chop it, and everything too. I was big enough to do a  lot of farm work. My daddy, we had to help him with the farm.  Finchum Did you have a team of horses or mules?  O. Ivery We had a team of mules.  Finchum Do you remember their names?  O. Ivery No, but I know one, (laughs) when he was letting all the kids take a  little ride on, I was the last one. I run up and said,    I want a ride.    He  put me on the mule. That mule looked back at me and by the time I got  on his back, he went to bucking. (Laughs) Throwed me off and hurt my  arm. I was through with the mule. I   d always ride the horse after that.  All the kids had had their rides. He just standing there. By the time my  daddy put me up there, he looked around at me. I guess he thought,    Oh  no you   re not.    (Laughter) He just went to bucking and I fell off.  Finchum How important was church when you were growing up?  O. Ivery Very important. My grandpa read to me out of the bible all the time  because you couldn   t get none of the rest of them to sit down long  23  enough. I   d come sit and he   d tell me stories. Tell me about different  parts of the country, teach me how to read. He tried to learn me how to  read, and he   d read the bible to me.  Finchum Would you go to church service?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. He went to church every Sunday. Our church was seven miles  from where we lived. We had to ride in the wagon. We went  everywhere in the wagon. There wasn   t nothing else. I came to Tulsa in  the wagon.  Finchum You did?  O. Ivery Uh-huh.  Finchum How long did that take? Do you remember?  O. Ivery I know it took a whole day. I don   t know if it was any longer than that  or not. We slept in the wagon. I imagine we got here in a couple a days  because we rested along the way.  Finchum Was it during the winter or summer?  O. Ivery It was probably about the fall. I mean spring.  Finchum Spring?  O. Ivery Uh-huh.  Bishop Did you have Sunday dinner?  O. Ivery Huh?  Bishop Did you have dinner after church?  O. Ivery Oh yeah.  Bishop What was that like?  O. Ivery That was nice. That was the only time you had a nice meal, if you had  anything to cook. My grandmother would always kill a chicken. She  would catch one, keep them in the little coop, the ones she was going to  eat. She said she didn   t want them eating everything if she was going to  eat them. She always kept a couple of chickens in the coop.  Finchum Did she have a method of killing them?  24  O. Ivery She would just wind their heads off or pull them off?  Finchum Wring their necks?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. I couldn   t, if I had to pick a chicken, and pick his feathers off  of him, I couldn   t eat it because I couldn   t stand to smell those feathers.  It smelled terrible.  Finchum That   s what I   ve heard.  O. Ivery I   ve picked them. I   ve killed a few. I didn   t like killing chickens, but the  chicken was really better when it was first killed.  Finchum They taste better. That   s what I   ve heard too.  O. Ivery Yeah, in the store, they   ve been in there ain   t no telling how long. Of  course I always eat fresh chicken in the country and they taste better  than the ones you have to buy in the store.  Finchum Well, when you moved to Tulsa, did you have chickens here?  O. Ivery No, we didn   t have any chickens, after we moved to town.  Finchum Well, did you have Christmas when you were little?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. (Laughs) I just fell out with Santa, because me and my mother,  we went to town, and we was looking in windows and stuff, and I saw  this doll. I said,    Dad, tell Santa Claus to bring me that doll there.    He  said,    I   ll tell him, I don   t know if he is going be able to bring it or not.     And when he came that Christmas he brought me a doll, but it wasn   t  the one I wanted. The little girl that lived across the creek from me, I  went to visit her. She had the doll that I told Santa Claus to bring. Little  white girl, wasn   t no black folks down there. I just got through and went  home.  I told her mother, I said,    Santa Claus made a mistake because that   s the  doll I asked him for, told my mother for him to bring me.       No, she  asked him to bring her one.    I thought,    Why did he bring her one and  didn   t bring me one?    I just went home and I didn   t play with her no  more there. I told Momma, I said,    Santa Claus brought, Elsie was her  name, he brought her the doll I wanted. Why did he bring her one?        She probably asked for it.       Well, I asked too. Why did he bring her  the doll and didn   t bring me one?    She said,    Maybe he got mixed up.     I was just through with Santa Claus. (Laughs) I said,    He just like white  people better than he do us.     25  The white people were first, you come second. That was when I lived in  the country. Since I got grown I knew better. I just thought everybody  likes white people better. I didn   t go to school like they did. Wouldn   t  let us go to school down there. I was living close to the white school,  and there wasn   t a school for blacks.    We can   t go to school with those  children.    They wouldn   t let you go because you were black.  Finchum That was in the    20s?  O. Ivery It wasn   t good to tell me that. I just got a really bad thing in my mind  until I grew up and knew better. Elsie, that little girl, they had just  moved in down there. Hadn   t been too long, so she started   I was only  somebody her age, and we pushed the babies. She would come to my  house and play, and I   d go over there.  A. Ivery When your mother passed away, her mother was real nice to your  family wasn   t she?  O. Ivery Huh?  A. Ivery After your mother passed away     O. Ivery Oh, that   s not the same people.  A. Ivery It   s not the same?  O. Ivery Mrs. Heatley was the one that seen after us after my mother passed. She  had a girl my age and one younger, so she would go to town at Easter  because she knew that my mother always got Easter dresses for us girls.  She bought material, made her girls    dresses, and bought me the same  material, me and my two little sisters. She made all of us Easter dresses.  She said,    I know Minnie would want you to have some for Easter. She  always bought you some.    She   d make a coat. She bought the same  material she bought her daughters, different colors. She   d say,    Which  color do you like?    I would pick. She   d say,    You and Helen are going  to be just a like, because I bought enough to make two dresses.    She  had a different color for my little sisters. She made all those dresses for  us on Easter. She was a sweet lady.  Finchum What about shoes?  A. Ivery Oh lord. Tell about those too little shoes     O. Ivery We went shopping for shoes. School hadn   t closed up then. You   d go  shopping about once a year. You didn   t have no money to be buying  26  stuff all the time. Me and my mother   I saw these shoes. Red and  black, the top part was red and real high tops. Prettiest shoes I ever  seen. (Laughs) And she brought them out. My mother said,    I think you  need half a size larger in these.    I tried a large, and I didn   t say anything  because I did. She said,    Well, we don   t have them any larger but we  have these.    She bought out ugly shoes. (Laughs) They were brown,  and I didn   t like that because it wasn   t cute.    I want those small size  ones.       No.    She didn   t have them. I kept at it.    Well them is too little.  We have to buy some more.    I said,    No. I can wear it.    I talked her  into buying that shoe, and I couldn   t hardly keep it on my feet it was  hurting so bad.  I knew she wouldn   t   kids, the parents, when they buy them the first  pair,    That   s all I   m buying, not buying something you shouldn   t wear.     I told my brother,    You wear it and see if you can stretch it.    He said,     All right    and puts it on.    No, they hurting my feet. I can   t wear it. It   s  too little for me, too little for you Sis. You should have let Momma buy  you a larger shoe.    I said,    They didn   t have no more like that.    He  said,    Well I can   t wear it. You can   t either.    I had to let it go because I  couldn   t wear them. My little sister had to wear them later when she  grew into them.  Finchum Well, did you get another pair?  O. Ivery When they could get some more money. (Laughs)  Finchum Took a little while?  O. Ivery Yeah. I had to wear raggedy shoes around until they could get some  money.  Finchum Maybe a little bit of a stubborn streak in there.  O. Ivery I was determined. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s a better word.  O. Ivery My daddy said,    They gave us the wrong baby. You   re a rich man   s  child. Nothing pleases you.    (Laughter)  Bishop Did you always like to shop?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. Yeah.  Franklin Did he say you had champagne taste with beer money?  27  O. Ivery Yeah. Uh-huh. He said,    They gave me the wrong baby. You should  have been a rich man   s child. You are never satisfied with just  anything.    I ain   t. I never have been just satisfied. It   s a curse, you got  no money and always want the best. (Laughs)  A. Ivery Mother would go in there and pick out the most expensive in there,  every time. (Laughter)  Finchum Do you shop for bargains?  O. Ivery All the time. I had to, I had all them girls. I started a whole year buying  stuff for Christmas. To find bargains, you have to look a long time  because you don   t find bargains every day. I   d find some good ones.  My youngest daughter, that passed, she was a good shopper. She   d go  with me everywhere. It didn   t bother her. All these others, they didn   t  like to, but she would follow me and shop. She had good taste. She  could buy beautiful things where I couldn   t find, she could.  Finchum Well, if you bought in January, could you remember it come December,  that you had it?  O. Ivery Oh yeah, I put it a certain place.  Finchum You had a system?  O. Ivery Yeah, I put it in that cedar chest.  Finchum They knew not to get in it?  O. Ivery They didn   t go in there because it was locked. (Laughs)  Finchum Oh, okay. I was going to say, how did you know they didn   t go in there?  O. Ivery (Laughs) They didn   t go in there because I had it locked and the key in  my pocket. I had things that I didn   t let them see. Come to find out,  some of the stuff I had in the drawer, they did see, (laughs) because  they talked about it when they got grown.  A. Ivery You talking about the little man? (Laughs)  O. Ivery Yeah, Dad bought you the little man.  Bishop Christmas was a big time? You bought for Christmas?  O. Ivery I really enjoyed Christmas with my family because I   d shop nearly all  the year in order to get everybody something, and something I liked,  28  you had to shop all year and put it up. I knew what I bought, and I  managed to get everybody a nice Christmas, nice clothes. I was  determined that my kids weren   t going to look raggedy like I did. I was  real funny about that. They always asked me,    You got more than one  child? I didn   t think you had but just one child because they look so  nice.    I went all out for it. I didn   t want them to look like I did. My  mother didn   t want me to look like it, but it was the best she could do.  Finchum Well, where would you shop here in Tulsa?  O. Ivery Uptown.  Finchum There were department stores then?  O. Ivery All of them were uptown then.  Finchum Were they?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. They used to have a Kress    (five-and-dime store) up there.  There ain   t no Kress    on Main now.  Franklin I don   t even think they have stores to shop in downtown now.  Everything is in the malls.  O. Ivery Nearly all the stores that were uptown, they moved down south there, in  another shopping center.  Finchum Would they give you a hard time? Were you allowed to go in any store?  O. Ivery Yeah, we were allowed, but they followed you like you were a criminal.  At Brown Dunkin   s, when they first moved down south, I was shopping  there on the ground floor then I went upstairs. This man kept following  Erma. My oldest daughter looked and said,    I believe he   s following  us.    He said,    Yes ma   am.    I said,    Why are you following me?    I said,     People stealing downstairs. All them white people down there  stealing.    They did. A lot was going on while they   re watching black  folks. I said,    You better remember that. Help yourself watching me  cause I ain   t never stole nothing. I   m the one need to be stealing  because I didn   t have nothing, but I don   t steal.     Finchum What was the name of the store?  O. Ivery Brown Dunkin.  Finchum Brown     29  O. Ivery Brown Dunkin   s.  Finchum Brown Dunkin   s.  O. Ivery Do they still have Brown     A. Ivery They call it Dillard   s, though. It changed to Dillard   s.  Finchum Dillard   s.  O. Ivery Yeah, Dillard   s. I guess someone else bought it. They used to have  Vandevers. It was uptown. That was expensive. There   s another store  that was as high as that, but I can   t think of the name of it.  A. Ivery Renberg   s.  O. Ivery Huh?  A. Ivery Renberg   s.  O. Ivery Yeah, that   s a store black folks couldn   t go in. You couldn   t afford it.  The stuff was too high.  Franklin Dorothy   s too.  O. Ivery Huh?  A. Ivery Dorothy   s     O. Ivery  Seidenbach   s  I know. I went in there on the ground floor and watched  a hat. Finally they put it on sale. I went in there to buy it really, because  I knew I liked it. I went over to the mirror and was about to put it on.  Lady hollered so loud she scared me. My oldest girl was with me. She  was about two. She hollered and went on so. She said,    Do you want  that?    I said,    Yeah I want it, but I want to try it on.    She said,    You  can   t try it on.    I said,    If I can   t try it on, I don   t want it.    But I liked it  and had been watching the hat in the window, to put it on. I put the hat  down on the counter with some more hats. I knocked three or four of  them off, and I came on out and I cried. My little girl said,    Mother,  why are you crying?       I wanted to buy the hat, but she wouldn   t let me  try it on.       Why don   t you just buy it?    I said,    I wanted to try it on.  She wouldn   t let me.    She was a clerk and of course they had rules in  the store. Blacks couldn   t try on. I didn   t go upstairs. We were on the  street floor. I didn   t go up there, blacks weren   t allowed to go upstairs.  A. Ivery Blacks had to go in the basement.  30  Finchum You weren   t allowed to go upstairs?  O. Ivery Oh no, not inside there. You couldn   t go upstairs. You could walk in  there on the street floor maybe and buy something, but they wouldn   t let  you go up. You weren   t allowed to.  Franklin What about the white and black water fountains?  O. Ivery Kress    had one for blacks and one for whites. Do you all remember  that?  Franklin I do.  A. Ivery I do.  O. Ivery I know Erma Jean does because they stopped her from drinking. Here  and in Texas too.  Franklin In Texas, yes.  Finchum At Kress   ?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. The man asked her, when we were in Kress    in Texas. He  caught her by the arm and said,    Can you read?    I said,    What   s the  matter Erma Jean?       He wouldn   t let me drink.    He said,    Can you  read?       Can   t you read?       Why?    He said,    That   s the white fountain  there. Go to the black fountain.     Erma was three years old.   A. Ivery How old was she?  O. Ivery The last time we went to Texas   you wasn   t born, were you? She was  just a little thing. Anyway, on the way down there you couldn   t get  nothing to eat. If you had, you couldn   t go in the front of the caf  , in the  front door. So Daddy would go around to the back and get some food. I  said,    We can   t travel with our children. There are too many of them,  and folks are too mean.     Franklin Then you couldn   t find anywhere to rest.  O. Ivery Huh?  Franklin You couldn   t find anywhere to rest either.  O. Ivery No. On that trip I was just miserable. I was scared they were going to do  something they had no business doing.  31  Finchum What time period are we talking, what years? Is that in the    50s and     60s,    40s?  Franklin The    40s     O. Ivery That was in Dallas.  Franklin Tell them about when your mother died and you were in the back seat  of your neighbor   s car.  O. Ivery That same lady that made us all those dresses. I had been in Oklahoma  City to stay with my uncle a week. She come to pick me up at the train  station to bring me back out in the country. Mrs. Mary Heatley stopped  by to pick up her girl. I was setting in the car when Helen came right up  to the car and her friends came with her.    Helen you got a nigger  sister?    She just turned red. She and her mom didn   t say nothing. She  was just out done, it embarrassed her. All the way home, nobody said a  word. Then after that, Helen quit coming over to play with me. We  weren   t playing. After being treated like that, she didn   t come over. She  quit coming. She begin to play with girls her age, white girls.  Finchum That   s about the time you moved here?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. Yeah     Franklin She was fine with you until her friends saw her.  O. Ivery I can understand that. She had the right to visit with her race but I  couldn   t. She quit coming over to see me.  Peer pressure won out.   Finchum Hard lessons, sad lessons     Franklin You can kind of understand her too.  O. Ivery Oh I can understand her good. Growing up, she needed to visit with her  kind. She had to have friends. If she was visiting me, they probably  wouldn   t want to have nothing to do with her. Her mother couldn   t  handle that, her family being treated like that. It was rough. It was  rough on her, and now that I   m older, I know how rough it was.  I can   t  blame them.   Bishop Despite all the hard times, what do you attribute your long life to?  What   s your secret to longevity?  32  O. Ivery I don   t know. The good lord. The man above, he let me stay here for  some reason. I don   t know, but I   m still here.  A. Ivery As you say, worrying the hell out of everybody. (Laughter)  O. Ivery What did she say? (Laughs)  A. Ivery That   s what you say.  O. Ivery What   d she say?  A. Ivery I said you always say,    Worrying the hell out of everybody.     O. Ivery Yeah, that   s what I   m doing. I can   t do nothing for myself now. I know  I   m nearing the end.  Finchum I understand you delivered a grandchild.  O. Ivery I delivered that baby (gestures to photograph) in the front seat of my  car. We was on the way to the hospital. He just came on. I said,    Oh my  goodness.    And that   s the way she  Eleanor Franklin  was born, without  a doctor. Then she had a child in the front seat of my car. And I think to  myself,    How did that happen?    I don   t know what in the world we  done. How was it he was born in the front seat?  Franklin It was because we didn   t know the baby was coming, so I didn   t know I  needed to prepare for a delivery in the car.  O. Ivery I don   t see how that baby was born in the front seat.  Franklin I just lifted up and you just reached over there and pulled him out.  O. Ivery Anyway, he just looked around like,    Where am I at?    I was teasing  him about it the other day. He is the best gentleman you ever seen.  Franklin He   s a deacon at the church.  O. Ivery He   s really sweet.  Finchum You had your child at home, one of them at least?  O. Ivery  Yes, all six of them . Eleanor, she was born and the doctor came to the  house for the birth. My doctor did. I thought I wanted to go to the  bathroom, and I didn   t. It was her coming. I had to hurry up and get  back in the bed before she hit the floor.  33  Finchum Was she your first or     O. Ivery No.  Finchum So that   s your third. Okay.  O. Ivery Eleanor, yeah, and her daddy, I told him to go next door, across the  street, to use the phone and call our doctor, and tell him I had had a pain  and he better come on out there that morning. When he came back,  (laughs) I said,    Go back and tell Ms. Foster,  a neighbor,  to come over  here. The baby   s already born.    He just stood in the middle of the other  room. (Laughs) He wouldn   t even come in there. He said,    I told  you   .    He hadn   t told me nothing. (Laughs) He was just standing  there, he wouldn   t even come in there. (Laughter)  Franklin He was probably scared.  O. Ivery He was.  A. Ivery Now a days the fathers are in the room watching.  O. Ivery He wasn   t because he didn   t want to, he was just scared. (Laughs) Then  he went back to call a doctor to tell him the baby is already here. It  tickled me him just standing in the kitchen, the other room, peeping in  there. (Laughs)    I told you, I told you.    He didn   t tell me nothing, I told  him. (Laughter) I ain   t never seen nobody that scared. (Laughs)  A. Ivery Mother, tell her about the time you went up in the tree and your dad had  to get you out.  O. Ivery (Laughs) Yeah me and my brother. I always wanted to follow him, the  boys.    You don   t need to follow us. You a girl. Go back.    I went along  with them.    You going to follow us too? Go up and climb up in that  tree.    I was stupid enough and went on and climbed up in the tree,  climbed way up. Then I was scared to come down. (Laughs) And I said,     I   m scared. I can   t come down.    They said,    Well we going on.     A. Ivery Didn   t he dare you to go up there?  O. Ivery Yeah, he dared me. Told me if I didn   t go up there I couldn   t go with  them. So I went up there, because I wanted to follow. I was tired of  staying home. There wasn   t nothing to do. They wasn   t doing nothing  either, but I wanted to follow. He called Papa. My daddy said,    Look up  and don   t look down. Just hold and back down.    He finally got me  down. He said,    I   m going to give you all a whooping. What you doing  placating that boy and going way up there?     34  A. Ivery Uncle Monnie.  O. Ivery We fought. All the time we   d fight. He would try to tell me what to do.  I wouldn   t do it. (Laughs)  A. Ivery And you looked like twins.  O. Ivery Picking cotton.  Monnie would say,     You all go ahead and pick your  cotton. I   m going to take a nap.    (Laughs) And he   d take a nap,  wouldn   t be doing nothing. He was always trying to tell me,    You all go  ahead and work.     A. Ivery Tell him about the time you tried to out pick your sister.  O. Ivery My sister, the one just under me, she could pick cotton so quick. She   d  have a sack full before we   d know it. I   d pick all day and all I   d do is  the burrs would be sticking and my nails would be bleeding. Of course,  she could pick a whole sack full of cotton before we   d know it. I just  couldn   t beat her, and she was younger than me. I would pull the whole  boll off and put in there sometimes trying to outdo her, have more  cotton than her and still wouldn   t beat her.  I wasn   t a good farmer. I never did learn to milk a cow. The rest of  them could milk a cow. I never did learn how to milk the cow. I  couldn   t pick as much cotton as the rest of them. I said,    I didn   t belong  in the country.    (Laughter) I just wasn   t no country girl. All the stuff  that you had to do was too much. The only thing I liked about the  country was my grandma   s garden. She always had a nice garden;  mustard, turnips, beets, onions, and all that stuff.  Franklin Did you tell her about the time your father, you didn   t know who your  father was when he came? You thought he was a white man.  O. Ivery We were up on the hill playing. When we come home, we saw this man  standing in front of that little shack, right there where we were living.     Who is that? I don   t recognize them. He must have come across the  field.    So we got closer. My dad didn   t like to bathe. He had took a bath  and because he was three shades lighter, I thought he was a white man.  I said,    Papa, we thought you was white. You took a bath.    My mother  would tell him,    You going to have to get out of my bed. You can   t  sleep in my bed if you don   t take a bath.    (Laughter) She was very  particular about it. We only had two planks in that shack. She scrubbed  them every day.  Finchum Only two plates?  35  O. Ivery I said, the way the house was so raggedy we   d have two planks  together.  A. Ivery Boards     Finchum Planks.  O. Ivery Uh-huh. She used to scrub them. She always liked to keep a really nice  house. She sure was clean, her bed was snow white all the time. We   d  be in there, but we didn   t touch it.  A. Ivery You said that you all didn   t have but one change of clothes.  O. Ivery Uh-huh. She would wash them at night and dry them.  Finchum How did she wash them?  O. Ivery On a rubboard. Ever seen a rubboard?  Finchum It   s been a long time.  O. Ivery The rubboard, that   s the only way I washed until I got a washing  machine, on a rubboard. I used to have a rubboard when I moved out  here. Somebody must have stolen it. I don   t know what happened to it.  Finchum When you     A. Ivery Did you all have bluing then?  O. Ivery Yeah.  Finchum Bluing.  O. Ivery We put that in warm rinse water, the last rinse water, for the whites.  A. Ivery It was blue liquid.  O. Ivery It would make the white clothes whiter     Finchum But it was blue?  O. Ivery    after you get through washing it. You wouldn   t put that much in  there. It didn   t make them blue, it made them look brighter. They don   t  even make that nowadays, do they? What would they make it out of?  36  Franklin I don   t know what that stuff was made out of.  O. Ivery Now that   s what I would like to know.  Franklin I think they have some variate rinse, whitener that people use that  whitens it up or something. It   s blue. Probably made out of the same  stuff.  Finchum When you got your washing machine you did the happy dance?  O. Ivery (Laughs) The first machine I bought, the name was   well, you know  the big ones, you don   t have to have the wringer. It   s in the machine.  It   s going round and round, and you stick the clothes in. I got my hand  stuck it in there. (Laughs) The wringer was separate from the washer.  Finchum What do you think has been the biggest invention during your lifetime?  O. Ivery Huh?  Finchum The biggest invention during your lifetime?  O. Ivery Hmm   .  Finchum Refrigerator or cell phones?  O. Ivery Well, the refrigerator is something that is important. I had an icebox for  years. You buy ice and put in it.  Finchum Here? In Tulsa?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. When we lived in the house before we moved out here. We had  a refrigerator before, didn   t we?  Franklin We had one in the house we were born in. Next door they didn   t have  one. They had to put their stuff in ours.  O. Ivery That house wasn   t even modern.  Franklin The iceman would bring a big ol    cube of ice.  O. Ivery Yeah.  Finchum By modern, you mean it didn   t have an indoor bathroom?  37  O. Ivery No, it had it outside, the toilet. It had water in it. Where I lived in the  country it had just a little house, usually no water. The only water you  had was water in the well.  A. Ivery We had a modern. You sit down, and when you get up it flushed.  O. Ivery Yeah, I wonder why they didn   t put that on the inside. That was a rent  house.  Franklin That was not the house that I remember.  Bishop Today, what   s a typical day like for you today?  O. Ivery Today? I just set on the bed all day.  Finchum What time do you wake up?  O. Ivery Oh, about seven or eight or something.  Finchum Then, go to bed at night at what time?  O. Ivery Sometime, we can be up all night looking at a program. (Laughs) Some  nights we go to bed early.  Finchum Just whenever you want to, huh?  O. Ivery Uh-huh. Of course I   m in the bed all the time anyway.  Finchum You had your stroke when? How long ago?  O. Ivery Eleanor, when did I?  Franklin What Mother?  O. Ivery What year did I have the stroke?  Franklin Two thousand.  Finchum You   re doing good then. So you watch your programs? What   s your  favorite type of show?  O. Ivery What   s the name of the show?  A. Ivery Soap operas, The Bold and The Beautiful. (Laughs)  Finchum Soap operas.  38  O. Ivery Yeah.  Finchum As the World Turns     O. Ivery I used to watch it.  Finchum The Young and the Restless.  O. Ivery Uh-huh. I   ve watched all of them. I forgot about it, it   s been so long.  Young and the Restless.  Bishop You said you had always enjoyed reading? Do you read today?  O. Ivery No, I don   t do too much reading. I just look at the television. I would  like to try to read. Some of the words I couldn   t pronounce. I just look  at television.  Finchum Do you have anything left on your bucket list that you want to do?  O. Ivery One thing that I have always wanted to do is finish school and finish  college. I know I ain   t going to do that. That   s what I used to think all  the time, I   d keep going to school until I get all my education. That   s  one thing I was very particular about. I gave it up now that I   m so old.  What you going to do with education at a hundred years old, but sit on  the bed and can   t do nothing. (Laughs)  Bishop It   s never too late.  O. Ivery Well, I don   t have the ambition no more. I had it all my life. I wanted to  finish high school, then go on.  Finchum Get your GED?  O. Ivery I had that notion. I pushed my children. I think I turned them against  education. (Laughs)  Bishop Well, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  O. Ivery That I was a good person, loved everybody and treated everybody right.  Well, we got a doctor out of the bunch. The oldest boy is a doctor or  dentist, and his daughter is   what is she?  A. Ivery OBGYN.  O. Ivery Huh?  39  A. Ivery Gynecologist.  O. Ivery Gynecologist, one of them.  Finchum Any OSU in there?  O. Ivery OSU?  A. Ivery The dentist got an Aeronautical Engineering degree at OSU, before he  went to dentistry. Then he went to the University of California, then got  his dental thing. She   s got a grandbaby at OSU now...  Finchum There   s some orange in there.  A. Ivery    in the vet program.  O. Ivery Got two coming out of school, graduating college now at OSU.  A. Ivery She   s not coming out this year. She just got white coated this year.  O. Ivery What   s she doing?  A. Ivery Veterinarian.  O. Ivery She   s veterinarian, right?  Finchum Well the one that you delivered, what   s he doing?  A. Ivery He works at AO, AAON.  Franklin He   s a safety quality control manager at AAON.  A. Ivery They do the refrigeration for big companies like Walmart.  Finchum You were at the right place at the right time for him.  Bishop Do you have any advice for a person that wants to live to a hundred?  O. Ivery Oh boy.  Finchum Eat your oatmeal.  O. Ivery (Laughs) Yeah. No, I don   t know what to tell them. Treat everybody  right and be good. Don   t be doing stuff you know is not right. The  world would be a better place if everybody was like that. People want to  40  steal folks    stuff, rob poor people   s stuff. People want to fight. I don   t  know what all that   s going on. I hear on television every night  somebody gets killed, or they   ll rob somebody. I don   t understand it.  Finchum Well, did you ever think you would see a black president?  O. Ivery No, never. I sure wish my husband had lived to see this. We always said  there would never be a black president. Surely wouldn   t happen I  thought. I couldn   t believe he got in there. How did he get in there?  A. Ivery Because these young folks don   t think like these old folks do.  O. Ivery There must have been a lot of white people vote for him.  Franklin Black one running for Republican this time.  Finchum Now we are going to see if a woman can get in.  Franklin That   s what I want to see.  O. Ivery I like Hillary. I would vote for her.  Finchum There you go.  O. Ivery I think she knows how to be a good president. Now, whether she would  be, I   m hoping she would be.  Finchum So, you keep up with it a little bit?  O. Ivery Yeah.  Finchum Anything else you want to add before we close out?  Franklin You raised some pretty good kids. You didn   t only get a dentist. You  got a school teacher.  O. Ivery Oh yeah.  Franklin A business administrator, a beautician. What is Robert?  O. Ivery Did you all see that write-up about my birthday celebration in the  paper?  A. Ivery I   ll give them a copy.  O. Ivery Here   s one over here.  41  Finchum You   ve had a very good life.  O. Ivery You think so?  Finchum I think so.  O. Ivery Well     Finchum Your determination.  O. Ivery (Laughs) I was determined, I know that. Kids tickled me to death. Used  to have to help. I kept a clean house. Once a week you had to wash the  windows and I had all the kids to help me. (Laughs) They   d say,    We  just washed them last week.     Franklin We had to wash baseboards. (Laughter)  O. Ivery Washed the woodwork and door faces, honey, people going in and out.  I wouldn   t have had all this stuff.  Finchum Anything else you want to add before we say thank you very much?  O. Ivery I can   t think of nothing.  Finchum You got a good sense of humor?  O. Ivery Yeah.  Finchum You do? Play practical jokes?  O. Ivery Yep. I   ve had a lot of fun with my kids. My husband was just the  opposite.  Daughters He was real serious.  O. Ivery Yeah. He would get after us about doing silly stuff. He   d tell us to be  serious. (Laughs)  Finchum You get the last laugh, though, don   t you?  O. Ivery Oh yeah, and I laugh a lot too. Thank you. It   s funny to me, you got to  laugh. He didn   t see nothing so funny all the time. All you got to do is  talk to the good Lord. When you do, wouldn   t have all this stuff. A lot  of folks don   t believe in God. I feel sorry for them. Something wrong  with them. What do they think they come from? Who made this world?  42  Man didn   t make it. Man can   t do nothing bout nothing. I heard the  weatherman,    Ain   t no rain out there.    You don   t know if it   s going to  rain or not. Sometimes it rains so bad or something. (Laughter) They  think they got signs to go by. The Lord doesn   t have to let the signs be  the same all the time. He   s the one that runs stuff. He let   s the sun come  up and the moon come up, and the sun go down, the moon go down.  I don   t care how many millions of dollars you got, wouldn   t help you  none. We   d all starve to death. The food wouldn   t grow. We   d all starve  to death. Money don   t mean nothing. If you have tubs and tubs of it and  plenty of money, how are you going to eat it? If there ain   t nothing  growing to eat, I don   t care what it is, has got to be something to eat.  Wouldn   t none of us live. I don   t care how nice a place you live in or  how much money you got. If you got everything, you ain   t got nothing.  You don   t have anything if the good Lord ain   t   he   s the one you   re  working with. He   s the reason why everything   s growing. Reason why  the sun come up, reason why it get dark. He says when it   s time for us  to go, we go. Time for us to be born, you   re born. You can   t make  yourself live no longer. You can   t ask for changes to make yourself stay  young. (Laughter)  A. Ivery Tell Hollywood that.  O. Ivery He   s running everything. Of course I know a lot of folks say that   s  ignorant. They don   t believe in that. They   re the ones that are ignorant  because when we don   t believe in God we sure are ignorant. Just sit  down and think about it. What did you do? You can   t make yourself  live no further. You can   t make the food grow. If you ain   t got it, I  don   t care how much money you got. You can   t eat your money. You  can   t make the sun come up. You can   t make it rain. We got to have all  them things.  Finchum Got to have more like you.  O. Ivery (Laughs). Yeah. I think I got just normal sense that everybody ought to  have.  Finchum Well, I thank you for sharing your stories with us today. You   re great.  O. Ivery Thank you.  Finchum Thank you.  O. Ivery I appreciate you all coming.  Finchum It   s been fun.  43  -------  -------
