 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, October 22,  2015, and I   m interviewing Patsi Smith for the Cowboys in Every County  interview series sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program at Oklahoma State University. Patsi, you were an animal science  major at OSU. You   ve used your degree throughout your life as a rodeo  person and someone who raises cattle and horses. You   ve combined your  love of animals with a love of education and service, and you and your  nephew run the Nix Foundation. I look forward to learning more about you  and your OSU memories. Thank you for speaking with me. When and where  were you born?  Smith I was born in Oklahoma City, and I have a very special birthday, Christmas  Day, 1940.  Little Thunder Aw, or a curse, see? I know people who consider the Christmas birthdays  hard. (Laughs) What did your parents do for a living?  Smith They were in the pneumatic and hydraulic supply business. They had a place  on Interstate 35 and one in Tulsa on Sand Springs Road called Nix Supply.  Little Thunder Brothers or sisters?  Smith I had an older brother that was killed in a drag racing accident several years  before my parents passed away.  Little Thunder Sorry.  Smith Awesome gentleman, though, even if he was my brother. (Laughter)  Little Thunder You   re part Cherokee...  Smith Yes, ma   am. Proud of it.  5  Little Thunder    and I understand you have an old family cabin here in Tahlequah.  Smith I do. It   s been passed down. When my great-great-grandmother (I should   ve  gotten that corrected) came over on the Trail of Tears, then she met a doctor  that was stationed at Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, at the fort. He was  considerably older than she was, but they married. They had several  children, and let   s see. Ms. Crafton   let   s see. They had, which would   ve  been my Aunt Louise and my grandmother and my Aunt Sue, and they   re  what brought me to Tahlequah more than anything because so much of our  family history is here.  Little Thunder Can you describe your, Oklahoma City, I guess, growing up a little bit? You  weren   t here in Tahlequah yet. Am I right?  Smith I was here more than what you would believe. I was real fortunate when my  dad went in the service in World War II. Then my mother had the  opportunity to go be with him before he shipped out. So many of your  World War II gentlemen were not coming back. Two old maid aunts took  me to Tahlequah when I was three years old, and my brother went off up to  our grandfather   s because the two little old ladies didn   t feel like they could  handle the male side. My aunt (awesome lady) bought me a Shetland pony,  and she bought it at the sale barn. The men stuck it in the back of a 1940  Ford, and we came home with it. It came out, and Aunt Sue would walk all  over town.  Said it was her way to get her exercise, and I rode the Shetland pony. Then  as Mother would allow me to come all the time   in fact, my dad was  stationed at Fort Smith. Therefore, they could, when he got stationed some  of the time there, then this was the natural meeting place. Then my mother  and dad were very kind to me, and every time there was a vacation, a state  fair day, anytime I had any extra time, I came to Tahlequah. I grew up with  a lot of the Tahlequah people as well as I grew up with the Oklahoma City  people. Not that I don   t have ties to Oklahoma City because my parents     business was there, but mostly I almost identify with Tahlequah. It was  always I would live in Tahlequah.  Little Thunder During those periods that you were gone, your aunt took care of your pony?  Smith Yes.  Little Thunder That   s your first thought.  Smith Yes, that was the best thing.  Little Thunder Oh, what a wonderful gift. (Laughs)  6  Smith It was a wonderful gift.  Little Thunder Well, can you describe Tahlequah a bit then, the way you saw it? Has it     Smith As they say that it   s changed, it was a nice, sleepy little town. When I was in  the second grade, Bill Willis, who   s the former Speaker of the House of  Oklahoma, moved in with his family, and I rode over in my little Shetland  pony. I said,    Do you have any children that can come out to play with me?     They had five at the time, and I hooked up with one of them, Joyce. I stayed  in the log cabin. I have a log cabin that was built in 1833 that my family  were in until the year of statehood, 1907, when they had built a new two-story  house. Still have both those homes. She and I and several other friends,  Paula and Judy and different ones, we would stay in the log cabin at night,  and Aunt Sue would come down and hook up this huge fire. It was really, it  was a log fire, but it was a freestanding fire. If we had someplace to, church  or were out with other high school friends or whatever, she would always  have the cabin always warm for us, and we kept our saddles and things in  what was formally the little kitchen. It was just an ideal growing up time.  When we originally started staying in it, it still had the outhouse. The  outhouse went away, too. (Laughter)  It   s just awesome time here. Fortunate, we grew up when we could   as I got  older and had a horse then, then we would climb on our horses in the  afternoon, and we would ride the three miles out to the Illinois River. The  bunch of us would go swim our horses in the river. Now then, they would be  fearful of the children, something happening with the children because they  could have pulled us under. We could   ve gotten kicked. We were three  miles out. There were not any phone calls. No one knew where we were, but  it was an ideal life. I could spend my time. I could get back here. Aunt Sue  fed us at night. We ate at the Willis   s at noon because Aunt Sue was  working, and that way Aunt Callie, the elder Aunt Callie, did not have to  feed us at noon. We would go over there with which eventually became  seven children of Speaker Willis, and they treated me like one of their own.  Aunt Sue did the same thing with Joyce and Paula and Judy, all of us  combined. I had as much time in Tahlequah   we always attended the  seminary had a reunion, and because all of my two aunts and my  grandmother went to the reunion for the seminary, May 7, every year, then  I   ve always attended that.  Little Thunder That was the Cherokee female seminary?  Smith Yes. Thank you. That is the Cherokee female seminary, and that was a great  deal of our lives. We were proud of our Indian heritage. Aunt Sue grew up  attending anything that the Cherokees had. Now, must admit the Cherokees  were poor back then prior to the new revolution of, as they want to say now,  Native American. Aunt Sue was never ashamed of being an Indian, and she  7  was always proud that the    Redmen    were the    Redmen    for Northeastern   State University . Grew up with that proud Cherokee heritage, grew up  horseback, and grew up working in Oklahoma City. Whenever I lived in, the  time, school that I would spend in Oklahoma City, my mother was a math  teacher, and both are part of my lives.  Little Thunder Were you involved in 4-H in school?  Smith No, no. Got involved in livestock and everything. When I first went to OSU  in 1958, which was the first year that it became Oklahoma State University  (it had been Oklahoma A M prior to that), and I started off in business  education because my father felt like if you had a business, you were  always, there was going to be business. If you had education, Mother said I  could always teach, but Aunt Sue   s side of me came out. (Laughter) The  horsey side of me came out, and I ended up over in agriculture. Ended up  over in animal science. The sciences were difficult for me, but I loved the  animal side, part of it. We had junior judging. You learned a lot, and during  that time, I joined Block and Bridle. That   s well-known at OSU.  Little Thunder The riding club or the rodeo?  Smith No, Block and Bridle was not a riding club. It was an animal science club.  Little Thunder Oh, okay.  Smith I   m scared to say it. They might correct me. The block stood for the meat  block, and the bridle, it   s been a long time. I   m going to think it had to do  with the haltering of animals. I got to show my first shorthorn. His name  was Killer, and I was very happy in animal science. I lived, which no longer  exists, at a place called Coed Apartments, which was, at that time, just  south, Brumley   s there now. At that time, the horse barn was straight across  the street from us. Therefore, that put me close to the horse barn, and the  steer shed was down from that. The cattle barn was back where your OSU  clinic is now. The clinic was over north of North Murray. I don   t know  what   s there now. It was south of the home economics building, the new  home economics building. There was an old home economics building  across campus. It   s been a while since I was at OSU. Things have changed  considerably. I just became a strong cowboy, and I truly, truly was. It  enhanced more of my agriculture side of me where I have horses now and  cattle, raise hay. It was a side of me that really wasn   t my parents, but they  gave me the strong values and the work ethics and everything I needed from  that side. I just leaned toward the agriculture side.  Little Thunder Now you did rodeo, too, though?  8  Smith The rodeo, yes. The rodeo side came from the Willises. After I rode over on  my little Shetland pony, then that started their interest, and those girls, being  here all the time, became Miss State Rodeo, Oklahoma, and went out and  competed for   . I tagged along with them. If I got to barrel race, it was on  one of their horses because my horses weren   t trained. When I went to OSU,  I could go into goat tying and only borrow a horse to get down to the goat  tying. Most of mine came from the background of the Willises, and then  when I got to OSU, I could do the goat tying. Of course I   d ridden a horse. I  could carry a flag. Then I somehow got kidded into, I don   t know how. I  only did it at the Block and Bridle rodeos. (Laughter) Oh  I even took some  ribbing from the instructors on this one, but the Block and Bridle rodeo let  me sit down on a junior bull.  I did it twice. I will never do it again. (Laughs) I never did it again.  (Laughter) It was good conversation. How about that? (Laughter) Then I did  not do anymore for several years, and I got into team roping because I   d  ridden a horse all my life. For a while, we would come over here and ride  from Tahlequah to Fort Smith to their Frontier Days or whatever they call it  in May. I have done trail riding. I   ve spent a lot of time in the saddle. I went  from that then to team roping, and I only teamed rope for about ten years. It  was later on in my life, and I did win a saddle. I don   t have to be ashamed of  that. (Laughter) I have a friend that told me to be positive. (Laughter) I did  like my team roping, but I think it   s based, you know what I   m saying?  Back.  Little Thunder What led you to choose OSU, as opposed to a closer college?  Smith I guess there was never any doubt.  Little Thunder Because of other family?  Smith There just never was another doubt.  Little Thunder Because of other family members that came here?  Smith No, not really. I was the first one to go to OSU. My folks were very pleased  with OSU. Mother had actually attended OCU  Oklahoma City University   and that other university off down there for a while. I don   t know. OSU     there was never any doubt. I guess the best way to explain it is I have a  great-nephew, and it   s been three years ago. He was dating a young lady that  was a twin and her boyfriend and a fifth person, and they all went down to  the other university. They were all going there. They visited one day. The  next day, all five of those kids went up to OSU.  Little Thunder Did they explain why?  9  Smith OSU had the better feeling. That was one of our instructions when we  started is when you walked across campus, you said,    Howdy.     Little Thunder As orientation, you mean?  Smith As orientation. When you went up there   at that time, you took all your  ACT tests and things in the summer, and you had three days, two and a half  days that were up there. Then you had a one-hour orientation class, and that  was what you were supposed to do. You spoke to everybody, you smiled,  and that comes easy with me. I   ve always been a smiler. I have a friend that  says that she can go someplace and speak to someone, and by the time she  turns around, they   re my long-lost friends. (Laughter) I like people. I like  people. OSU really was where that fit.  Little Thunder Were there a lot of other women animal science majors at the time?  Smith No, no, there were not. I was one of three, and the other two dropped out. At  that time, there was one female for every seven men on campus. Now three  of those men were married, but it   s still, that was the percentage of women  going to school. Yes, it was different for me. At that time, you could not  wear jeans into the library. You had to wear dresses if you went into the  library. Now if in the winter you had a long coat and you rolled your jeans  up, you could get away with it. (Laughter) Obviously that   s something I did,  but seriously, it was more about being ladies. I went back and worked in the  home economics, and Dean  Lela  O   Toole   s, one of her instructions were,     We   re going to lead the way on campus. Therefore, we will always be  ladies and wear dresses.    I   ve never experienced OSU except mostly in a  dress, except when I could go to my agriculture classes and I could go to my  labs. We would be outside. I had the privilege. That was another neat thing,  as far as I was concerned. That   s another thing agriculture did for me.  Little Thunder That freedom.  Smith That freedom. I just think it was just always OSU.  Little Thunder Do you remember what the rest of the learning environment on campus was  like, maybe outside of the library or the animal science department?  Smith Tough. We didn   t have online things. Therefore, we had a great deal of labs.  I don   t say they don   t still do labs now, but I hear so many, the young people  around here saying that they go online. They do this. They do that. We had  so many hours in our classes, and you really didn   t cut classes. I was just  over at the physical fitness center yesterday working out, and this young  lady came up to their boss, the executive director over here. She says,    So-and-  so didn   t come in. I will call my professor. I   ll e-mail my professor and  tell him that I have to work,    and I   m thinking,    Wait a minute. You   re here  10  to go to school, young lady. This isn   t about work. I know the fitness center  just opened. I know you probably need the money, but class.    Classes were  very much stressed. You didn   t cut classes. They literally still took role in  classes. You had ten minutes between classes, and you basically weren   t  late. You didn   t stop to do something else. I guess I want to remember that  the Y-Hut was there, which is long gone now.  Little Thunder Explain about them again.  Smith Well, I   ve got to explain it because my mother   s twin sister was totally  blind, and Ralph, I   m going to draw a blank on her name. I want to say  Thelma, but I don   t know. He was totally blind. My aunt had dated him  when he was younger. I would go by the Y-Hut as opposed to the Union.  Another thing in the past is that you will go to the library, and to take your  break, you go to the fourth floor of the Student Union and dance. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Wow.  Smith Yeah, it was fun.  Little Thunder It was ongoing? The dancing was ongoing?  Smith The dancing was ongoing. It was always jukebox. Do people remember  jukeboxes where you punch buttons?  Little Thunder Oh yeah. (Laughter)  Smith You danced, as far as jukeboxes, and the big thing that you did outside of  classes was you went to dances. Morrison used to have a wonderful dance,  and I had been back up there within the last ten years, say. Morrison still has  their dance and a lot of little old characters, but you know what? I didn   t  think of them as old characters back then. (Laughter) You studied hard. You  had your date nights on Friday and Saturday night, period. You may have a  date to go study at the library, and you   ve got in a little bit of Coke time or  dance time on the fourth floor. Do they still dance on the fourth floor at the  Student Union?  Little Thunder I think they have special events     Smith Oh, does it? Okay.  Little Thunder    but yeah, yeah, the dance floor is beautiful. It   s still there, of course.  Smith Is it? I will have to go up next time I   m there.  Little Thunder Yeah, you   ll have to go up and look. (Laughs)  11  Smith I will.  Little Thunder Where did you live? What dorm did you live in, or did you live off campus?  Smith No. I started off in Stout Hall, but I didn   t last a week because I pledged  Delta Zeta. I lived in the Delta Zeta house, which, Delta Zeta   s no longer on  campus, and then I moved out to Coed Apartments. Once again, I could  wear my jeans because Coed Apartments, you were in individual apartments  with wonderful roommates. I lived in Coed Apartments, and then I dropped  out for a short period of time. My parents were building a new building, and  I went home to be of help. When I went back, I finished it up. It was on  Knoblock. It was just south of Gallagher Hall and right across the street  from the tennis courts at that time. I   m sure the tennis courts aren   t there  now, but it was right across Colvin Center tennis courts. Then I was right on  the corner of Knoblock, but it was only because I only had a short period  of   it was get back to school and finish up. (Laughter)    Yes, ma   am.     (Laughter) I will say this. At that time, you could not live off campus until  you were twenty-three, and I was younger than twenty-three when I rented  this. I came home from class one time, and here was the note from Patchin,  Dean  Zelma  Patchin, saying,    You need to come to my office.    (Laughs)  Little Thunder They had found out.  Smith They had found out that I, as a student that was not of age, twenty-three  years old, was living off campus. Wouldn   t happen now, but back in the  early    60s, it happened.  Little Thunder What was the conversation with the dean?  Smith It was a good conversation. She was a lady. Dean Patchin was very  important. She was about the sororities, but she was about all of the  independents and one thing and the other. I did not stay in the Delta Zeta  sorority. I probably played too hard, and I dropped out after a year. That   s  when I went to Coed, but we discuss the fact that my parents knew. She said  she would send a letter to my parents acknowledging the fact that I was off  campus and wasn   t supposed to be. Just such a gracious lady. I can   t really  tell you. I got to continue because I   d already contracted for the apartments.  My parents knew it. I had been out a year, a couple of year, a year and a  half, a year, whatever. Therefore, it was time, it was okay to be on my own.  Does that make sense?  Little Thunder Yes. Who was one of your favorite animal science instructors?  Smith Dr. Bob Totusek. Dr. Totusek passed away two years ago now. We had an  awesome   at the Cowboy National Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, we  had, they   d already had one service for him in Stillwater, and then they all  12  migrated to Oklahoma City. We came from miles around. Saw a lot of my  classmates. Now I was real fortunate. This great aunt that bought me my  Shetland pony, she went back to riding in her later years. She never married,  but she met a gentleman. He got her back horseback. One time she was  down at Cedar Lake in southeastern Oklahoma, and she met Dr. Totusek or,  as she referred to him, Bob. She had to lay out one year. She had had some  surgery. They all signed this big, huge get-well card and brought it up, and I  open it up. Because I knew so many of them, I   d ridden on the rides also. I  looked at that, and I said,    That says Dr. Totusek.    She says,    Who?    She  looks at it, and she says,    That   s Bob.    I said,    No, ma   am. That   s Dr.  Totusek.    (Laughs) Then in later years I did a lot of trail riding with him  down at Cedar Lake. Big mentor with me, big mentor. I could probably  name you all of my   Dr. Noble, he   s deceased. He was head of the sheep  barn at the time. No, I wasn   t into sheep, but he was my advisor. Awesome  gentleman. Dr. Totusek was my junior judging teacher.  Little Thunder What   s the most valuable thing he taught you, Dr. Totusek?  Smith Be proud of who I was, and I don   t mean to say whatever I was. Be proud of  who I was. The connections, that connections will always longtime pay off  for you. I don   t mean you make connections because of it, but don   t lose  connections. Don   t just let them pass through your life and keep going.  Maintain those connections. He believed in hard work. He believed in  students, bigtime students. I remember at his dedication down at the Hall of  Fame the gentleman that had taken the Brahma bull up on the fourth floor of  the Student Union in the elevator, and he attributed Dr. Totusek as to getting  him out of that situation. Dr. Totusek knew his students. He taught you to  know people. It was great interaction, I guess. I   ve always been an outgoing  person, but I have to say that if he encouraged anything besides studies and  connections, it was the interaction.  Little Thunder That   s cool. What about Homecoming? Do you remember?  Smith Oh, that was awesome. That was awesome. Delta Zeta, the year that I was in  Delta Zeta, they had orchids because they knew one of their alums had  orchids shipped in from Hawaii. Our whole float was about orchids.  Little Thunder What was Delta Zeta   s mission?  Smith They were a sorority on campus, and they actually, their   that they helped  with back then was Gallaudet College  Washington, DC , which is a hearing  college back east. I eventually took a lot of   you said a while ago. Using  my agriculture, I went from OSU and went to Texas Tech and worked in  their animal science department. Now I was on the financial side. I never  taught, but I did do all the financials for the barns, all of the feed, all the  getting bids, everything that kept the farm management going.  13  Little Thunder This was after you graduated?  Smith At Texas Tech, yes. I went from Oklahoma State and started work at Texas  Tech doing that, but it was all, once again, within my agriculture, within my  financial background. That   s what got me the position.  Little Thunder What did you do after the work at Texas Tech?  Smith Where did I go after Texas Tech?  Little Thunder You weren   t having access, I suppose, to horses, at that point.  Smith I bought a horse while I was at Texas Tech. (Laughter) They had a  veterinarian on campus. We didn   t have a veterinarian school, but they had a  veterinarian. (Laughter) I bought my Frosty horse. I met a gentleman. Was  married for thirty-eight years. I transported him back to Oklahoma.  (Laughter) He graduated from Oklahoma State University in veterinary  medicine. Then I spent my time putting him through school, at which time I  worked in the registrar   s office, and I worked at the college of home  economics in student services and then in family relations and child  development. Dr. Stromberg was very influential in my life. I worked there,  and since he was in veterinary medicine, then that was a natural thing for me  to migrate to. We came back. He got his degree. Then we went to Texas and  set up a veterinarian practice and worked that. He was highly allergic. We  sold our practice and moved back to Tahlequah. (Laughs)  Little Thunder During the practice then, you were helping run the practice?  Smith Yes, yes, yes, yeah. One of my favorite stories about that is when you pull a  calf and you   re doing a C-section, if you can do the C-section standing up,  it   s better. Okay. He would go in, and he would put nylons on their legs. I  would stand back there and hold the nylon so he could get down inside the  cow to bring this out. Now if it   s a natural birth, it   s different, okay? Okay.  I   m standing there, and I have my feet propped up against the chute. I   m  holding on. One of our clients, and we were closed that day because we  didn   t open until one on Wednesdays. One of our clients walked up, and he  saw me doing that. He says,    Doc, can I be of help?    and he said,    Well,  you might take that nylon.    He ambles over because I   m braced, okay? He  reaches up with one hand, and that calf just, I mean, they   ll suck you back in  in a heartbeat. Mama   s not letting go easy. If it comes out as it   s supposed  to, it   s an easy thing, but if you   re doing a C-section, she isn   t giving up all  that umbilical cord and everything.  It just jerked him forward big. Boy, he took hold with both hands and  backed up, and he thought,    Okay. I see.    Another good story, we were out  doing a C-section. This one was down, and we were losing the cow. The  14  farmer, the man had come in that was young, and he said,    Patsi, go get a  syringe, and fill it with blah, blah, blah, blah. We   ve got to, you need to put  it, it needs to go into the jugular.    He turned to the man who he knew had  worked with cattle, and he just felt like he could do it. He said,    Make sure  you get it into the jugular.    The guy looked at me, and he says,    I can   t do  that. What?    I   d seen Butch do it enough that I walked up, and I thumped it.  I put the needle up in there, and he literally stopped what he was doing. He  turned, and he looked at me. He said,    Did you just give a shot?    and I said,     You do what you got to do. Did you not want the shot in the jugular?    He  said,    Thank you.    and he went right back to what he was doing. (Laughter)  Yes, it was right up my alley.  Little Thunder Once you got back to Tahlequah, what did you do?  Smith We were team roping at the time, and we had 400 acres outside of town,  managing it. Then that was   .  Little Thunder Cattle and horses?  Smith Cattle and horses. Our horses were more for fun. They were our team roping  horses, and the 400 acres, it was easier to cover. In Cherokee County, it   s a  lot of trees and a lot of rock. It was easier to cover the place and look for  your cows horseback.  Little Thunder You had purchased the property?  Smith Yes. We actually had purchased this before we came back. We had the  opportunity and left it leased out. Didn   t do anything. Then when we came  back, we started doing what we wanted to do, and then we, it was at least  thirty minutes out and back. Not really, but by the time you got to the farm,  got through the gate, did everything, that   to go out to the 400 acres. Then  not the foundation but another section of our area helped us buy some land  here in town. I have 170 acres in farm and cattle, and then I lease another  forty acres. I have about fifty head of cows. I got sixteen new babies at  the   no, I do not. I have eighteen. Another little baby was born. I have  about 110 acres in hay and work. That is what got me tied up with 4-H and  everything. When we came back, I believe in the students doing their  livestock and everything. Something you   ll like, and here I   m going to put it  on tape, right? You can edit this out.  After Butch left, then I really didn   t want my name out, okay? I didn   t want  someone to think, oh, here   s this lady that has money living here by herself.  I would go to the livestock auctions in the spring, and I wouldn   t want to  just designate one. There would be eighty, and they do what   s called add-ons.  I would add on a certain amount, but I wouldn   t let them put my name  up. I   d put    Anonymous,    and they make all these 4-H students and FFA  15  students write thank-yous. Then they have a big meal, and they serve all  those, those local banks, Spring Hollow, which is a local feed store, all these  people that support. Then they thank them. They go up to the front, and they  put their name out because they   re very proud of their Spring Hollow and  their BancFirst and everything. By the way, our local BancFirst is a graduate  of OSU Ag economics. Mark   s mom   anyway. They had a sign for me.  Said,    Anonymous.    (Laughter) All these students would write,    Dear  Anonymous.    (Laughter)  Little Thunder Oh, I love that. Well, tell me a little bit about the foundation. As I  understand, it was started by your parents.  Smith Yes, ma   am. To be real honest with you, my dad was a workingman, and the  foundation was done after him, okay? Now it wasn   t after him. It was  created in his latter years, and my nephew and I, Jimmy, we   re more about  doing for other people. This was going to give us an opportunity. The  attorney set up where, they set up a whole, I don   t know what you call it, but  there   s a partnership. There   s a foundation. There was my mother and  daddy   s. There was mine, my nephew   s, his children, so on and so forth.  This foundation gave us an opportunity. My dad never got into it. He was in  the last of his life fighting cancer pretty hard. He never got the opportunity  to see everything it did. Now my mother did, and she enjoyed it. Our CPA is  very active not only in his church but in different organizations.  He   s been very helpful in our foundation, and he would go talk to Mother  when she was at the retirement center. It   s made a big difference in Jimmy   s  and my life. It   s given us opportunities because my mother   s twin sister was  totally blind, and the college of optometry is here at NSU. Don   t mean to do  that to y   all, but we have done a lot with the college of optometry and have  bought them machine. At the time we bought it, it was only the second one  in the state of Oklahoma. My dad was about Oklahoma, okay? He was very,  very, very proud he was from Oklahoma, and he never made any bones  about it. Anyplace he went, my brother, when he was drag racing, was  known as the Smiling Okie. We   re Oklahomans. Everything that our  foundation does, we do it for Oklahoma.  Little Thunder Well, you   ve certainly benefited OSU as well. I understand you have a room  at the new Spear s  Business Center that   s going up and a scholarship, an  endowed scholarship for professorship that was started in 2008.  Smith We have supported 4-H, but it   s been more with contributions. We didn   t  create something. We   ve just donated to that on campus. Once again, that   s  my love. The foundation has done a little with the animal science  department, very little. Most of what goes to the animal science department  comes from me, but without what was created, I wouldn   t be able to give.  16  Little Thunder Right, and you go down there pretty often. I guess you keep in touch with the  animal sciences program. You went down for a barn naming not too long  ago.  Smith Yes. One of the most exciting times to me, we were up there two years ago  for the Spears dedication. Now I have a friend here in town, and I   m going  to preface this a little bit. She was talking to someone, and the someone said  something about,    Now does Patsi teach, or where would I know Patsi  from?    My friend said,    You either know Patsi or you don   t know Patsi.     (Laughter) We went to this Spears deal, and there was a father and a  daughter. She wants to become the Spirit Rider or be on the equestrian team.  Awesome. Payton   s going to be an awesome asset to OSU, but we   re  walking around all these new facilities, seeing, they had pictures where  we   re out on the ground of the football field and in the different places. This  young lady behind me says (it   s on the back of my hat, and you   d see that),     Will you tell me what Block and Bridle stands for?    I turned around and  started talking to her, and I called up Kim (I can   t come up with his name  right now; sorry, Kim) out at our animal science barns, our arena out there. I  said,    I have a young lady that   s interested in our animal science side. Are  you there? Could I bring her out?    There was a break, and everyone went  over to the business building at the time. They did the hors d   oeuvres, and  my nephew went. His wife went, and the two kids went. Payton and I and  her father head out to the barns. We have exactly an hour. My nephew gets  almost upset with me. I go out there.  She got the opportunity to talk to the coach as the equestrian team. She got  to have her picture made with the Spirit Rider. Once again, I float out there,  and I say,    Hey, Kim, we need to do some recruiting here.    We get back.  We park. I was with them. We were in his truck. We slide through the  business building to pick us up something to drink. I meet someone, young  man standing there. It takes me about that long, okay? This young man,  somehow my niece   s name came up, Jamie.    Oh, I just texted Jamie. I was  at the School of Business with her, blah, blah, blah, blah.    He said,    I   ve  even met her parents.    I said,    Well, her parents are outside waiting on me.        Oh, I   d love to see them again. Tell them hello.    We go out, and I   m still  with this other father and daughter. Jimmy   s over there, and he   s holding  this chair. Because of our donation, we   re in a special area. This young  man   s up talking to the president of OSU at the time, and I said,    Oh wait, I  just met so-and-so.    Kelly and Jimmy look at me like, what? I said,    I   ll go  get him.    I walk over there, and soon as he finishes with the president, I  said,    Jamie   s parents are right over here.    We walk back, and he reiterates  how he   s glad to see them again. He   d just texted Jamie, blah, blah, blah.  Then he leaves, and I sit down. Jimmy turns, and he looks at me. He says,     How do you know him?    I said,    I walked through the same area he was  standing in.    Does that not make sense? (Laughter) What can I say? What  can I say? (Laughter)  17  Little Thunder How would you summarize how attending OSU and earning your degree  has impacted your life?  Smith All of the difference in the world. It   s hard to cover that many years since I  left OSU. It   s hard to speak about the friendship that was made. I   ve talked  to Revelle and Caretha, both former roommates. I talked to Caretha   s niece  here in town. When she came here to go to school, her mother says,    You  got to go see Patsi.    (Laughter) It is the education. You can   t say,    Oh, I was  taught this. This is how it helped me in this particular incident,    but you  know that all the education you had was built where you are now. It   s made  you who you are now. It   s become part of my life. It   s a part of my  conversation. It   s something I can rely on. It   s not only who I am. It   s so  many of the memories, and this doesn   t really come out positive. I love our  football team. I was there when it took nineteen years for the golden toe of  Charles Durkee to beat OU. (Laughter) It   s who I am. It fit into my lifestyle,  and I fit into its lifestyle. It   s brought me a long ways.  Little Thunder Would you say there   s a strong OSU community here in Tahlequah?  Smith I think so. (Laughter) There   s never any doubt in their mind. Yes. I have  local cable TV, and I can   t even get the OSU ballgames. People I square-dance  with are all OSU. Their daughter went to OSU, and I   m always  invited out. Everything that pertains to OSU, it   s migrated me that way, as  far as these people are concerned, and I   m going to bring it up. I may not get  this nomination, but Dr. Isabel Baker, who is former president of the board  of regents of OSU, the very first Homecoming game, I met my nephew and  them. She was riding in the board of regents    car. As she drove by, my  nephew of course didn   t have any idea who she was, and I said,    She   s from  Tahlequah. Dr. Baker.    She turned around, and I said,    Tell him that you   re  from Tahlequah.    She says,    Patsi?    because she knew my aunt.  This Leoser family   s been here a long time. She knew Aunt Sue, and Dr.  Baker   s boys grew up out here in Aunt Sue   s pasture. I   ve been invited on  an educational board for the Cherokee Nation, on their foundation because  of my history here. Aunt Sue knew the boys. Dr. Baker   s son is chief of our  Cherokee Nation. We   re real proud of that. She   s got two boys that are  attorneys, and one time I needed to see one of her sons. He just stays booked  solid. I went in and didn   t ask for any favors and made an appointment. It  took me about thirty days, three weeks to get in to see him, and when I went  in to see him, all Dr. Baker   s son talked about was my Aunt Sue. I told him,  I said,    Man, you   re a hard gentleman to get in to see,    and he pulled out his  card. He wrote his cellphone number on the back of it, and he says,    You   ll  never wait again.    Good folks, yes, have attended OSU here in our  Cherokee County.  18  Little Thunder What advice would you give to OSU students today or faculty or  administrators?  Smith Well, the young freshman that   s going there now, that her family   s all about  that other university. (Laughter) In fact, her father just told me,    I wore my  first orange shirt.    (Laughter)  Little Thunder You made a convert. (Laughter)  Smith What can I say? I   m loyal. (Laughter) You don   t rub elbows with me and  not know that OSU exists. I told her to go, as Dr. Totusek said, go make the  friends that   ll last you a lifetime. Go study hard. Take all the education  they   ll give you. Don   t pass up any opportunities. Don   t think,    Oh, I want  to get out of this class.    You   ll be amazed at what you   ll learn in the  different classes. As you can, as much as the administration will mix with  you, rub elbows with the administration. If they   re having something, you  go be at it. It   s a contact that   ll do you good, that   ll be on your resume, that  they   ll get to know you. To the administration, don   t forget the students are  the ones who pay your bills. Yes, I know a lot comes in from outside grants  and money, and everybody brings in money. I know we have the T. Boone  Pickens in our life, but literally if you don   t have students, you   re not going  to be teaching. You   re not going to be doing your research because you  won   t have that. Administration, don   t just think of it as a place to work.  Think of it as a place    I have a very, very dear friend that I met in FRCD,  in Family Relations and Child Development. They don   t call that it  anymore, but very loyal. She liked to go to the ballgames. Neither one of her  sons went to school there, but both of them know how loyal she was. Get  involved. Be a part of the university. It   ll give you back so much more than  you can ever give it.  Little Thunder What should a visitor coming to Tahlequah know or see or experience?  Smith Well, my log cabin, of course. (Laughter) We   re still a small town. We can  still wander the streets. They do a Thursday-night function where you  wander the streets. They have a lot of outside that they bring in. We have  what   s called the Red Fern Festival. You   re not going to find a Red Fern  Festival, and some people may be offended by the fact that the coon dogs,  the coon   s up in a cage. They   re not going to get to it, but they   re really a  part of life. There was a huge book written on the Red Fern Festival, and it   s  brought a lot of attention. We   re a community that wants to get to know you.  If I see someone going up to look at my log cabin, I   ll leave my house and  walk up there and welcome them and tell them about small-town Tahlequah.  Maybe Tahlequah doesn   t want to be small-town, but they are. You can  reach out and know your neighbor. You can reach out. Know your neighbor.  You can know your   there   s a lot of families that stay in Tahlequah, even  though they   ve gone off to get their education somewhere else.  19  Little Thunder They come back.  Smith They come back.  Little Thunder You are taking a young person out riding this afternoon, as I remember.  Smith Yes, ma   am, that   s   .  Little Thunder Tell us a little bit about that.  Smith Well, it first started with Dr. Giesling, and he   s my dentist. He moved into  some new quarters, and he was going through these pictures with his  daughter. That   s not true. That   s not true. It started with the Oklahoma  Children   s Home, Oklahoma Methodist Children   s Home, but anyway, he  says,    Okay. This is Rachel, and she loves horses.    I leave his office, and I  know she   s homeschooled. Her mother   s at home. I knock on the door, and I  said,    I understand Rachel likes horses. Want to go riding?    (Laughter)  There was a couple, and he was OSU. Jason Charles, and he had to actually  move to Tulsa so he could do more on his PhD. His daughter wanted to ride.  My aunt Sue gave me my Shetland pony, and what goes around comes  around. I think it   s the nicest honor I can give her would be to pass on that  love of animals that she gave me. By the way, it   s OSU people that are  coming out this afternoon, that they   re bringing their granddaughter out to  ride. (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s wonderful. (Laughs) Well, is there anything you would like to add  that we didn   t cover today?  Smith No. (Laughter) You can cut this out. You can turn it off. I   m flattered. I   m  flattered that someone suggested me when I know there   s so many other  great cowboys here in town that do a lot of things, OSU cowboys. Let   s get  that one straight. (Laughter) Yes, I like doing things for OSU, yes, I   m  going to be up to the dedication of something that   s going on at the dairy  barn, and yes, I come back for the animal science reunion, but I didn   t  expect this, okay? I do a lot of things, but I didn   t expect this. I guess the  answer is still no. I don   t know what to say. (Laughs)  Little Thunder Thank you so much for talking with us today.  Smith You   re welcome. Oh, I know something we didn   t get in.  Little Thunder Go ahead.  Smith The lady that used to live here, when I came back twenty-two years ago, she  was the aunt to Edmon Low of our Edmon Low Library.  20  Little Thunder That   s funny.  Smith Now she never went to the   she never went to school, but once again, you  never know how the university is going to reach out and touch you.  Little Thunder Thank you for remembering to add that, and I think I want to get a picture of  your cowboy boots, too, before we close. (Laughs)  Smith Okay.  Little Thunder May need to move the camera a bit.  Smith I   m all cowboy from toe to top, top to toe.  Little Thunder Let   s see. There. Yes, beautiful. Yes. (Laughter) All right. Well, thank you,  Patsi.  Smith I don   t know. (Laughter)  -------  -------
