Story_ID: 166031
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you some questions about your family.  Can--I'll start first with your mother and then with your father, okay?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's full name was Cora Elizabeth Becton Jarmon, C-O-R-A E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Becton, that was her maiden name, B-E-C-T-O-N, and, of course, she married my dad, Jarmon, J-A-R-M-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, she was born in Lenoir County [North Carolina] and, of course, ended up in Kinston [North Carolina], the sort of city then or them, North Carolina, as I said, in 1890, '89 [1889], I believe.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  Now, did your mother or your grandparents have any stories about what the family, what her side of the family was doing in, in the, you know, before the Civil War, or, or during reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't recall too much other than they were farmers.  I don't know whether you could call them sharecrop farmers or, but you know, in that part of the country, they raised tobacco and that sort of thing.  So they were out there farming, farmers, and for the most part, they--the women, of course, were homemakers for the families.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, did they pass down any stories at all about, you know, what life was like, you know, before the Civil War or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, I never heard too much about--before the Civil War and that sort of thing.  But there was always this feeling of uncertainty, and what's coming next and that sort of thing.  And they were very, they're religious people and they felt whatever came, they, they would survive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I knew my, my mother's father who was also a farmer and a carpenter.  And we, late, in later years, we brought him up here when we got some property out there in Virginia, Fairfax County.  And he built a home and that was in the '30s [1930s], '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], and I remember him.  And, of course, we had a twenty-five acre place and eight of it was cleared.  The other, all tall trees.  We sold trees to the, the telephone company, oh, very tall trees on the place.  And, but he could not be content with those eight acres that were cleared for him to put this corn in it.  Oh, it grew.  It was just beautiful, but he had asthma and that one August, he caught a cold and passed, but just trying, taking up stumps and stuff like that to have more ground to put in more corn.  But I remember him very vividly, and he was buried out there in Vienna, Virginia.
Story_ID: 166032
Speaker 1: What was your mother [Cora Becton Jarmon] like?  What, what, what kind of personality did she have and what did she do?
Speaker 2: She was a, she was a, a jewel.  She, of course, she--I was the only child, and I got everything that there was to get.  And she was the financier of our family and the manager, and she knew how to, to stretch a dollar and make things go more than my father.  And he just let her do it because he, he knew she was better at that.  And she was a very demure kind of person, loving, and industrious, 'cause she was first a beautician with Madam [C.J.] Walker agency.  And oh, she went up and down as an agent when she would go to those conventions.  And I just met that great, great-granddaughter.  And, anyway--
Speaker 1: [HM] A'Lelia Bundles.
Speaker 2: Lel-, Bundles, yes, uh-hum.  And then she became a seamstress and where we lived, why, she was the seamstress for that whole apartment, 2400 16th Street.  It's now on Boyles [ph.].  It's changed names and hands, many, many, ownership, many times.  But the man who built it was Kennedy, Kennedy Brothers, and they built Kennedy Warren [Kennedy-Warren Apartment Building] and all those big buildings.  But my father [Ozias "Otis" Jarmon] was sort of appendix of the family, yes, he, he worked for them for years.  And she was a seamstress for that whole building.
Story_ID: 166033
Speaker 1: Now did she [Groomes' mother, Cora Becton Jarmon] have a chance to go to school much when she was coming up?
Speaker 2: Well, no, grade school.  She didn't go beyond the grade school, such as they were, you know, in that time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the school that she went to?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, uh-uh.  As I said, I've been from there, from Kinston [North Carolina].  I would go back at graduation time.  And I remember once I went back, when I graduated from college to get my birth certificate because I had to send out these applications, you know, to teach.  And the doctor was still living, so I got it that way, but they didn't have any record of it, you know, in the, the courthouse, you know, as they do now.  But I, and we go back at funerals of persons in the family and that kind of thing, but I've been up here ever since I was about a year old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've been in--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You've been in [Washington] D.C. since you're about a year old?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --right in D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you weren't really raised out there in Kinston.  You weren't, you weren't raised in Kinston?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I wasn't raised in Kinston.  Well, I guess I left there and I do remember that homestead.  And since I've been back, I, I took a picture, went back, took pictures of it, but I remember the porch and there are one or two things I remember, you know, going back as a child.  But, no, I've been up here most of the time.
Story_ID: 166034
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father's side of the family.  What was your father's full name and can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad, Otis Jarmon and, in fact, they called him Ozias, O-Z-I-A-S, but he went as O-T-I-S, Otis Jarmon.  And he was one of thirteen children, was that three boys and ten girls, I believe.  And he was the older of, of all the children and they looked to him as, as big brother, 'cause daddy was gone very early in life.  And when he came up here, why, they'd come one at a time to find a job.  And they would, they'd live with big brother, and he'd look out for them.  He was a very religious man and he had a beautiful voice, and I've always said that he was just born about thirty or forty years too soon.  He would have been a Nat [King] Cole.  Oh, he had a lovely voice and he was ordained in 1920 as a minister here in Washington [D.C.].  And from that, why he traveled up and down Virginia, and where else, in North Carolina, but they wouldn't ask for him to preach.  Let Reverend Jarmon sing--oh, he had a beautiful voice, and so well liked and he loved and he was beloved.  So and very, very protective of me because I remember when I finished Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], I got an application, a call for Fairview, Texas.  He said, "No, that's too far away.  I can't have you going that far away."  Then I got another one, oh, forgotten where that was.  Well, the third one, he allowed me to go, and that was Asheville, North Carolina because it was North Carolina.  And he said, "Oh, yeah, well, you're going up there," but I went up there and I came back the following week.  I went a week before school was to open and where they had chosen for me to stay, this was a widow.  She had recently lost her husband and you could look and that's way up there, you know.  You could look and see a crack across that room, and they had a fireplace for you to, to make your, your heat, you know in the winter.  And that's up there in the mountains and it was tall pine trees.  I said, "I can't stand this," you know, out of a steam-heated place.  I said, "No," so I came on back.  I couldn't take that.  I said, "No, the best thing for me to do is go on back home," and he was glad to see me come back.  He never wanted me to leave me really.  But momma said, "Well, she's got to, she's got to make her own way" and, but, no, he was very protective of me.
Speaker 1: Did, did he have any stories in his family of life in, in the 19th century before the Civil War or, or that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, I never heard him speak of anything beyond the contemporary, his contemporary, you know, era.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet his grandparents?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you meet his grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I can vaguely--I think it's mostly from pictures--
Speaker 1: Or his parents?
Speaker 2: --see his father picture, but I never saw a picture of the momma and, you know, taking pictures back then wasn't, you know, a common thing.  And I, I don't, I don't recall any, but that family of his, he's one of three.  He was a big brother and I met, knew all of them.  There was one pretty close to me because when we were up here and I was in Bruce School [Bruce-Monroe Elementary School, Washington D.C.], I had an aunt that was the younger of the daughters of his, his sibling.  And she was maybe about three or four years ahead of me in, in elementary school.  I remember that--Hannah [ph.].
Story_ID: 166035
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents [Cora Becton Jarmon and Ozias "Otis" Jarmon] met?
Speaker 2: How they met, no, no, I don't know whether it was first sight or what.  Were they (laughter)?  Anyway, it was one of those long marriages till death do us part and one of those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were, were, were you the first child in the family?  Were you--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Were, were you the first born in the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was the only one--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the only one.  I was.
Story_ID: 166036
Speaker 1: So, shortly after you were born, they [Groomes' parents, Cora Becton Jarmon and Ozias "Otis" Jarmon] moved to [Washington] D.C., right, they moved to Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, can you reflect back on your upbringing and give us an idea of some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, now, as far as I can remember, as I said early on, I went to Bruce Elementary School [Bruce-Monroe Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  Then from there, I think we had a residence somewhere around Otis Place because some of those halls, Kennedy [Edgar S. Kennedy and Sr. Monroe Warren] built.  They were the persons that my father worked for all the years.  And from there, we came up here to 2400 16th Street [Washington, D.C.] in that apartment.  And I went to Wilson Elementary School [J.O. Wilson Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] there up to the eighth grade, graduated from there, and went to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.].  And, of course, that was a long stretch from 17th [Washington, D.C.] and, and between Euclid [Street, Washington, D.C.] and Kalorama Road [Washington, D.C.] where Wilson [the President Woodrow Wilson House] was, to walk to Dunbar High School.  But we did it, and that was long before, of course, Henderson Castle was there, but there was no Roosevelt Hotel that you see now.  That was just a lot.  Well, you cross that lot, and keep on over to New Jersey Avenue [Washington, D.C.] and down New Jersey.  That was our trail to high school.
Speaker 1: And what is, what, what was Henderson Castle?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was Henderson Castle?
Speaker 2: Henderson Castle, oh, that was a woman who owned so much of 16th Street and didn't want ethnic people to come over this far nor come up that high.  And the, the wall is still there, and now it's--I'm trying to think--some, City Place.  I don't know what the City Place name, but they have condos, high rise condos there between Florida Avenue [Washington, D.C.] and Crescent [Place, Washington, D.C.], BC--Florida Avenue and Belmont [Washington, D.C.] because 2400 is Crescent, the next street, cross street, 16th, you know where the Meridian Hill Park is.  All in, well, that's on the opposite side, on the west side of 16th Street, Henderson Castle.
Story_ID: 166037
Speaker 1: Now what would, what did your neighborhood look like when you were growing up?  And how would it be different from what it looks like today?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that neighborhood, with exception of her castle [Henderson Castle] being torn down and, and condos, high rise condos over there, the wall is still there.  Of course, Meridian Park hasn't changed.  Well, it's been, you know, landscaped, and it has a waterfall, and it had Joan of Arc statue.  I remember when they put that up there.  And that was across the street from where we lived.  And that block between Euclid [Street, Washington, D.C.]  and Florida Avenue [Washington, D.C.] on the east side of 16th Street, well, that was my playground for the most park because my people wouldn't allow me to have a bicycle, thought it was too dangerous, but skates.  And that's one of the longest blocks in Washington, from Euclid, 16th and Euclid, down to 16th and Florida Avenue.
Speaker 1: So you would skate (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: And I was up and down that, oh, yeah.  No break in it at all, you know, just all the way down.  And then when I got into high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington D.C.], why, the park was a place, we'd go and sit on the benches and, and meet the boys, you know, and all that sort of thing.  It was a, just a wonderful place.  And 4th of July, that was the place to go over there where Joan of Arc statue is, and look all the way down and see the fireworks downtown because at that time, Roosevelt High--Roosevelt Hotel--was not built.  Well, that was built sort of high, and it was not as good a view downtown to see the fireworks down on the monument ground.  But, and then now across, between Belmont and Crescent, that was nothing but a lot.  And, you know, that's where Agnes Meyer's [Agnes Ernest Meyer] home is, and that's where the International Meridian Center [Meridian International Center] is.  Well, that was my playground.  I'd go up on that, that acres, I guess, I guess, about an acre or more with my doll, my doll carriage, right across the street from where I live.  And it just weeds and, you know, a lot, that's all it was.  And just, I, I often think of this, the fact that after I became an adult and I joined the Kennedy National Symphony Orchestra Committee, and they had an affair there.  And I went that Meridian Place and, oh, the landscaping and Agnes Meyer, you know, got her home there toward 16th Street [Washington, D.C.], there back toward Kalorama [Road, Washington, D.C.]and the end of the lot, that center.  And I stood on that veranda and said, now, there, that was my playground down there when I was a child.  And it, it was, it was awesome, yes, to even think that things had come to that.  Here, I was now an adult and volunteering and, you know, that sort of thing, and it just all came before me--
Speaker 1: It's (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --as a wonderful experience.
Story_ID: 166038
Speaker 1: Those days, you, you probably didn't know anybody that, that had been in that building, I guess.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, indeed.  And it, it's, it's quite a celebrated spot now.  And not so long ago, I rode through Crescent [Place, Washington, D.C.], and I could see where they changed that end of the building.  Now that 2400 where my father [Ozias "Otis" Jarmon] worked, Kennedy [Edgar S. Kennedy] built, they had a, a driveway that went straight through that building towards the back of the building to Kalorama Road [Washington, D.C.], from Crescent to Kalorama Road.  And to the left, they had a large garage and they made their own electricity.  So I remember that, that TV I got around radio, rather, I got around there in the dining room, my father bought me that on one birthday and it had eleven tubes.  Oh, and that was some, that was some radio, and it had to be all changed because they had their, they made their electricity direct current, I guess, or whatever.  But in later years, since the building has changed ownership, they've cut off that garage that went through to Kalorama Road.  It went from Crescent Street right straight through that building to Kalorama Road, and that's where my father had his terrific accident.  He and another fellow, who was much older than he, had backed the truck.  He drove the truck at a place where the cinders from that plant that they had, electrical plant, would dump into the, into the truck.  And on this particular day, something malfunctioned and to get out of there, they had to come out on their hands.
Speaker 1: What the, it was actually--
Speaker 2: Force--yeah, that was dumped down into the truck.
Speaker 1: The only way (simultaneous) to the truck.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, but, anyhow, it spilled over and was all on the floor, and they had to come out on their hands.  My father was burned up past his wrists, but the older man, he was too slow coming out, and he was burned almost up to the shoulder.  He died, but it was at that point that my mother [Cora Becton Jarmon] knew then that she had to, to take charge of things.  And at that time, she got E.C. Hayes [George Edward Chalmers Hayes], $50 an hour, whoo, that was never heard of.  But that was the lawyer she got because they said that we couldn't stay there and sue them.  But she said, "I can't allow myself to accept something when I have a child here and I don't know what my husband's health is going to be."  So, they came to an agreement and E.C. Hayes [George Edward Chalmers Hayes] advised her what to do, and so he got a very good settlement.  And that's when we bought out there in Vienna, Virginia, but that was terrible.  And as a child, I must have been--I hadn't gotten to high school.  That was in the '20s [1920s], 20--, '-4 [1924] or '-5 [1925] or '-3 [1923], something like that.  I had to walk from 2400 over to Freedmen's Hospital [later Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] over there, you know, where that was, W Street [Washington, D.C.], 7th [Washington, D.C.] and W, to carry him.  See, he was all right other than his burn.  And the minute you entered that hospital, you could smell that flesh.  Oh, it was terrible, but he wanted those biscuits and those greens.  And momma was a good cook and she would have me trotting back and forth carrying this food to him to the hospital.  I'll never forget that but sweet potatoes, all that kind of stuff, but he got along very well, and recovered.
Speaker 1: Did he use his hands or--
Speaker 2: Huh?  Oh, yes.  They were, you know, like a burn scar is.  That never got its color back, but it was spotted, light and brown, but, yes, he got, got, he recovers.  And it was miraculous though.  It was very miraculous, but that he did, but he was young when they got out quicker, but the other guy perished.  And there were several people--I remember his wife was a real stout lady who took it so hard.
Story_ID: 166039
Speaker 1: What did you like to do when you were a little girl?  What, what kind of little girl were you?  What kind of interests did you have?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was into everything.  And I was, I was athletic inclined.  And at that time, they had what you call slog ball, and it was a, a game that you had a ball sort of the size of a basketball.  But you hit it and you had sides.  You'd hit it and, and bat it with your hand, like a bat, and you'd run to those bases and back.  And whoever got the ball, your opponents, if they get the ball, they, if they hit you, if that ball came into contact with your body, you were out.  But I remember traveling from here, way over there on the other side of Freedmen's Hospital [later Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] to [Lucretia] Mott [Elementary] School [Washington, D.C.], and oh, and they would throw that ball and I'd jump, and it would go between my legs.  And I'd bend and it would go in my head.  Oh, I was a great slog ball player.  And as I said, I never got to ride a bike, not to this day, but I did skate.  I skated--
Speaker 1: So you never learned how to ride a bike?
Speaker 2: No, they wouldn't allow me to have one.  They said, it's too dangerous, but I did skate.  Oh, yeah, I loved skating.  And I didn't do too much with tennis, but, of course, we didn't have to play tennis and a place to play tennis.  But other than that, I was occupied so much with my church.  I belong to Metropolitan Baptist [Metropolitan Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.], came up there in the primary department, and I belonged to everything in the choir.  And I was also in the choir when [Robert] Todd Duncan first came to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And he directed our choir there, the, the junior choir, and he was doing a beautiful job.  And I, it was way in late years after he had left Metropolitan and given up the choir that I learned when it was over, and it was because the pastor said that he'd have to join in order to continue to direct the choir, and that was the basis of his leaving.  But it was a very well-known choir and we did some wonderful singing.  It had some beautiful voices in there 'cause I was just one of the voices but, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your father [Ozias "Otis" Jarmon]--
Speaker 2: Solo voices.  Huh?
Speaker 1: --did your father, was, was he a member of that church?
Speaker 2: No, no, he was a member of Salem, Salem Baptist [Church, Washington, D.C.].  Now those people, most of them came from Virginia.  And he going up and down Virginia and that sort of thing, he became very, very close, and he, he was a Salemite.   Now, my mother [Cora Becton Jarmon] belonged to Metropolitan and I belonged to Metropolitan, and I was kept busy in this Red Circle Girls Club, in the choir, and in this, and everything there all the time.
Story_ID: 166040
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about Bear Becton.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, that was the story that, oh, it made your eyes open and your ears.  You were listening for every word that they were saying because this was an occasion when the men went to a meeting.  And I don't know what kind of meeting or just a group meeting or some church meeting or something.  And on the way back, this--my grandfather met this bear.  And he always carried one of those canes made out of hickory, I guess it was hickory or oak, with a knot, you know, had a knot on it.  And he fought that bear, but that bear fought him.  And he came right down his back with his claws, just like a knife.  And he finally got home and fell up in the door.  And they brought him on in, and he told of his experience.  And so, they said, "Well, we've got to do something about it because the children, you know, out here, going through the woods," and that sort of thing.  So they got a little posse and went out looking for this bear, all of the men of the area.  And finally, they found the bear.  The bear was killed.  He beat him so that he was, yeah, so they all, from that time on, they called him Bear Becton.  And, yeah, now listen, that story led into my--when I learned of our terrible situation here.  It was a school system and about several years ago, they got [HM] General [Julius] Becton to come here.  He was here from Prairieville [sic, Prairie View, Texas].  He was president [of Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University, Prairie View, Texas] out there a while--come here and work with our school system.  Well, I told this story to him, but it was two years later after he had left Washington [D.C.] that I got in touch with him.  I finally got the nerve of it and I wrote him.  And I told him that I had--I knew each meeting that they had him, he was confronted from all sides, you know, as most public officers here in Washington.  They've got a lot of people to, to account to.  And they, they--it, it's so, so much bureaucracy here that it's very difficult to work.  So each meeting I'd go to at the precinct or at one of the schools, they were hitting him so heavy with these questions about the school system.  This is breaking down and we need this, and other that.  So I said, this isn't the time.  I wanted to get with him and ask him about the Becton side of the family 'cause all I knew was my grandfather, my mother's father.  I never met any of the rest of them and they were from Kinston [North Carolina] or from North Carolina, that part, Lenoir County [North Carolina].  So when I wrote him, he immediately wrote back and he said it was very interesting.  He says and there's no way that I could--my family could be in Lenoir County, down in North Carolina, and not be connected with them because they were just maybe a mile away when he was trying to determine, you know, the spot.  So, he, he made an appointment, and he said he was coming past and picked me up and take me to Fort Myer [Virginia].  Now I had had occasion to go to Fort McNair [Fort Lesly J. McNair, Washington, D.C.] so many times, every year and through the year, to affairs at officers' club here and all that sort of stuff (unclear).  So he did, and I said, "Well, it's selfish of me to have you come here, and not have my, somebody in my family here to greet you when you pick me up."  So I told him about my daughter and my grandson in the area at the time.  So he said, "Oh, of course, they're invited," so he took us to Fort Myer.  He and his wife came and picked us up.  We went out there, and we met his daughter, her husband--his, his historian.  He said, no, he hadn't gone into genealogy, but he had a historian who happened to have been his cousin.  And so we were there at this table together, and at this affair, this luncheon, 'cause he asked me if I wanted to go night or day, I said, I'm, I'm a day person.  So we went to luncheon, and he had his historian to bring that book.  And he gave me that, and they go back to eighteen something with, with all of those names of relatives, some they had, maybe partial (unclear) of them.  But anyway, it was so interesting and the man that send it over and he said, "Don't pay any attention."  He says, "Don't take up your time and look into that.  I'm going to have him send you that" so he did.  He had it and so, General Becton, they had this relationship somewhere down the line.  And I was really elated over that and I told him about that Bear Becton, that story.  He said, no, he hadn't heard of that, but he said that sounds just like them down there.  He say, yeah, they had plenty of bears and things.

Speaker 1: I don't know, things have recently been falling into place in the past fifteen or twenty years, you know, that I never thought would come to past that I've, I've been able to, to witness.  And I witnessed a whole lot of history, you know, from my uncle, my mother's [Cora Becton Jarmon] brother.  And there were only two of them, my mother and her brother, and he, he was in World War I [WWI], Elias Becton.  He was named after my grandfather [Elias Becton].
Speaker 2: Did he talk about the war?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Did he talk about the war?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, he talked about it, and he was sort of a timid kind of a guy and he was very emotional.  He didn't like to, he didn't like to talk about it too much, but he did occasionally.  And he's very quiet and unpretentious and, yeah, he, he was with us quite, quite a number of years--our family, you know, close, when he came back.  He didn't go back to North Carolina.  He stayed in Washington [D.C.] and he was around my mother most of the time.
Story_ID: 166042
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about--oh, you said that the name you had in the choir, that Mr. Duncan [ph.] called you English?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, now why did he call you that?
Speaker 2: I told you, he can call that because I was always correcting the, the English of those students, you know, the people in the choir, choir members.  They were saying all sorts of things and I'd correct them, and he smiled and, finally, he started calling me English.  So at that wedding that we went to years later, I asked him if he remembered that.  And he said, "I think I do," but I think he was just being polite.  I don't know whether he remembered that or not, but he, yeah, he called me English.  And, you know, for some reason, all of the older professional people would give me a nickname.  Now, my doctor, I, I was not really sick through life, but my husband [Ogden Groomes] was, my second husband, he, he was operated on by [Charles] Drew , Drew and Musick [ph.].  Musick was his primary doctor and he'd always get the best surgeon.  And Charlie Drew operated on doctor--on Ogden, and it was, I think it was about a six-hour operation.  He had ulcers and he took a part of the stomach, you know, the intestine out, and all that sort of thing.  Oh, he was, he was an ace.  So, anyway, Musick would always see me and he started a hospital over there in Africa some place.  And I worked on his committee and he always called Miss Thelma (laughter).  They'd always give me some kind of a nickname.  I don't know, but all through life, he called Miss Thelma, yeah, Miss Thelma so and so and so, and he was very jovial all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166043
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to go back to grade school and just ask you about what your, what, what your favorite courses were in school and some of your favorite teachers.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, my favorite subject was English and social studies.  And my teachers up there, as I said, one was [William] Leo Hansberry because he was teaching something that, oh, just seemed so out of--in space to us.  He, he was an archaeologist and, of course, history, and--
Speaker 1: Now, this is in grade school?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: In grade school or in college?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, that's college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, now, grade school, one--
Speaker 1: Let, we, I want, I want to get, make sure we get back to William Leo Hansberry because he's really important but not now.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: I wanted you to talk, talk about grade school first--
Speaker 2: Grade school, well--
Speaker 1: --go from grade school and high school.
Speaker 2: Well, the principal of our school, which went to the eighth grade, we, we were in the 844 plan [ph.], and was Dr. Cordozo [ph.].  Now, I don't know, but I don't think he made the medical whatever it is because he became a principal of a school, but he had almost an office over there at Wilson School [J.O. Wilson Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  And if you got a scrape or something out there on that playground, he'd have you in there bandaging you up.  I'll never forget that.  And later on in life and I realize--now he was training to be a doctor or something.  I don't know what happened but he was a principal of that school at the time.  I thought a lot of him.  And then when I got down there in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington D.C.], why, Neville Thomas [ph.], he was a great historian.  And he said, don't rely on these little books you got.  Go to the original source.  And then he would tell you about the assorted lives of these great leaders, these presidents and stuff, and the things that carried on from George Washington on up.  And, oh, he just kept you on your toes listening to these stories, you know, go to the source.  Don't, don't listen to these little historians around here.  They don't know from nothing.  Go the source and you'll find out.  Now Neville Thomas and Bertha McNeill in English, they were good.  And I never directed myself toward science or anything like that (laughter) because we had--now this is one of the reasons.  We had a chemistry teacher--trying to think of his name now, can't think of it.  But he had dis-, discolored skin condition, and we always thought it was from an explosion down there (laughter).  And nobody wanted to take chemistry or anything--none of those subjects, so I never took any of that.  I did take a little botany, something like that, but he was, he (laughter).  Oh, we had all sorts of premonitions and prejudices, you know (laughter).  I don't know where they came from, but we manufactured them.  But, anyway, those were Bertha McNeil.  And I loved my, my gym teacher.  But the, the other lady, I never learned to swim because that woman never got in the water.  She, she (laughter) taught, she taught swimming down there, but she--I don't, I don't recall a day that she ever got in that water.  So, to pass it, you had to go down at the bottom and bring up this brick.  And I don't know how I did it.  I must have been in the shallow end of the pool.  And I held my breath long enough to go down and get that brick and brought it back up.  But I never learned to swim, and I, I charge her with that.  But I had a pretty good relationship with my teachers.  And that Freeling Highson [ph.] lady, now she was an English teacher, very, very strict, and very demanding,  And I'm glad I had her because when I got up there at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], why, went up there unconditional--
Story_ID: 166044
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about high school.  Now you went, you went to [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, Dunbar from what I understand, was a, had high standards.
Speaker 2: Very high standards, and in addition to that, since I've had my grandchildren, they had a reception for my granddaughter.  And there was man there who still lives in that condo, who asked me point-blank at one of the tables--he was sitting there at one of the tables.  He said, "How'd you get to go to Dunbar High School?" I said, "Because I was a, a good student."  He said, "Yes, but you know as well as I do, that a lot of us were good students, but we didn't get to go to Dunbar."  And it was who you knew, who your parents were, and a lot of that was into the whole mix.  And I said, "Well, my, my people weren't professional people and I had no problem."  And all of us I remember--I always keep up with my classmates and there were thirteen of us in that class.  And how I kept up with them, I don't know, but we walked from 17th and Euclid, Wilson School [J.O. Wilson Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], down to Dunbar Theater [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.], you know, where there is 7th [Washington, D.C.], it was 7th and S [Washington, D.C.] or T [Washington, D.C.], 7th and T.  And that was our recreation.  And that day that we graduated, and the water was this high at, at the corners.  The sewers, ice or it was snowing, and it wasn't snowing that day, but the snow was there and the ice was there.  And we walked from there down to Dunbar Theater, went in and got this pop.  I never liked pop.  I never got the popcorn.  I got peanuts and stuff like that.  We went in there and had a ball.  That was our recreation for graduating.  And one of the boys had--now you may have heard of him, Newt Jackson [ph.]--well, anyway, Newt (laughter) had his mother's insurance money.  I think it was insurance--yeah, it was insurance money.  And he spent most of that money on this refreshments for us.  And he had a brother named Charles [ph.] (laughter) who was about two or three years younger.  And Charles came back to school to tell us how his mother reprimanded him for using her money to buy us all this popcorn and stuff.  And Newt, oh, he hated that so much.  But, oh, he got, he got his, his share of the, the licks that day.  But I'll never forget that.  And I think five of us went do Dunbar.  The others went to Armstrong High [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School, now Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.]. But I had no problem and I'm, I'm glad that it, it wasn't a problem for me.
Speaker 1: Now, when, when you were at Dunbar, when you were on the verge of graduation, did you, did you know that you were going to go to college?  Did you have an idea of what you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was what, as I told you, they, they wanted the best for me.  I was the only child and I knew I was going.  I didn't know where but, of course, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] was the place and, yeah, I knew I was going.  I graduated in '25 [1925] and I, from grade school, and graduated from, from there in '28 [1928], and went on up there to Howard, and came out in '32 [1932].
Story_ID: 166045
Speaker 1: Tell us about Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I mean, what was it like for you when you went to Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, Howard was wonderful.  However, there's only one regret that I have through life.  I said, I don't have many regrets, and this is one, that I didn't get a chance to stay on campus because, you see, you, you were so divided.  Here, I was so involved in Metropolitan Baptists, all of those organizations, and choir and stuff like that.  And then you have to go home in the evening, whereas if you're on campus, you get intimate contact with the professors of all of their little conferences and, and little sessions that they had.  You miss those 'cause you're going home.  And, you know, one of those things.  And I always said that if I had children, I, I would see that they would live on campus, but one didn't want to live on campus.  She just wanted to go D.C. Teachers [College, later University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] and 'cause she was looking at some little boy at that time (laughter).  Before I knew it, she was getting ready to get married.  And the other one, she wanted the campus, but she didn't want to stay in Washington [D.C.], so she went to (unclear) State (laughter).  But I was determined that if I could, I was going to see that they stayed on campus because I think that means a lot.  It, a part of time, at least, stay on that campus and get that intimate contact with those professors, those people who mean so much, you know, in your life.
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.  Let me--
Speaker 2: That I missed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 166046
Speaker 1: Let me ask you.  And you, you started to tell us about William Leo Hansberry.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And he had a profound influence on you and--
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: --he was unique as a historian in those days.  And tell us a little about it, who, who he was and, and what he taught.
Speaker 2: Well, as I say, when I was up there at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], you know how young college girls are.  He was a very neat man and nice-looking fellow.  He was soft spoken and what, what he talked about was so different from what we'd heard.  And he was telling us about archaeology and, it was an introduction to archaeology, you know, and then historical references and that sort of thing.  And you just--he had no discipline problems 'cause everybody had their mouth wide open and listening for everything that he was saying because it was just so interesting, you know.  And I'll never forget him.  And then, later life, I met the daughter and we are very good friends now.  She's the one who introduced me to this business, this HistoryMakers.  Yeah--
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Gail--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --[HM] Gail Hansberry.  And she belongs to the Howard Women's Club [Howard University Women's Club].  I brought her on into that and because I, I was one of her staunch supporters.  And Dorothy Porter Wesley also, I think she's about the age of Dorothy Porter's, Connie [Constance Porter Uzelac], her, her daughter.  But she became the CEO [chief executive officer] or executive secretary of the ASALH, Association for the Study of Afro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] for several years.  I guess about two or three years.  But she had inherited, many, many problems when she went into it, and didn't get maybe all of the support that should, she should have gotten from those who had been in--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I, I wanted to ask you about other professors at Howard.  Who else was at Howard at that time?
Speaker 2: Ohhh--
Speaker 1: E., E. Franklin Frazier [Edward Franklin Frazier], did you have any classes from him?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a course under E. Franklin Frazier, but he was there and a very influential person.  As I said, Wesley [Charles Harris Wesley], I had him.
Speaker 1: Charles Wesley?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.  And, what's that guy's name is, (unclear).  He was one of the youngest professors.  He was into poetry, Lavelle [ph.].  He, he was very, very good, and I enjoyed his courses immensely.  And I was enamored with Maryrose [Reeves] Allen who was head of the physical ed department [Department of Physical Education] and Dean Lucy Diggs Slowe.  Yeah, those two, I, even then, I could see what they were doing.  Now, before you heard "Black is Beautiful," Maryrose made that very--that was her subject, "Black is Beautiful."  And she was another one who kept those young girls coming from home, first time into a big city, from being what--given the idea that these fellows who were riding around in the cars, they perhaps weren't even on campus, but they, they weren't a big attraction to them.  They, they, they kept you on an even keel with the world, worldly kind of things, and kept you there, thinking about those subjects and your studies.  Dean Slowe was, was mammoth in that kind of, in that regard.  And I always have deepest respect for both of those two women.  And they didn't have an easy time 'cause Howard, at the time, was not female oriented and whatever you did or wherever you went, you had to fight for it up there.  It was a man-oriented kind of situation, but Dean Slowe held her own, and I'll always respect her for that.  Now, I'm trying to think of who else.  Dean [Dwight Oliver Wendell] Holmes was head of the education department at the time.  And I'm trying to think of that.  Oh, I should never leave out Miss Coleman [ph.].  Now she was an English teacher that nobody or very few would elect her courses because she was just so strict and things, as it were, and she was very, very classical in her approach to you.  And she also told me that--I hadn't had German--she says, but you come down to my place and I'll, I'll instruct you in German enough to get your master's.  And oh, she was outgoing and very strict, but I, I took many courses under her, several courses under her, and enjoyed them.  But most people tried to scoot around her because she was so strict.  And she was a deformed individual, but very eloquent and very stately, yes, indeed.  She was one of the jewels up there in that English department.
Story_ID: 166047
Speaker 1: What kinds of activities were you involved in at, at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Up there at Howard, well, I'll tell you, by the time I got those courses and got home, and got into those things I was involved in at church, I didn't do too much other than the Howard Women's Club.  I got into that.  Now, this was a thing that it was not something that you chose to do.  But Dean [Lugy Diggs] Slowe, who was the first dean of women up there, it was a mandatory thing, and she taught English al--, also.  She was very close to her students.  She lived on Kernish [ph.] Street.  She and another lady bought a home.  And she had them come down, and sit before the fireplace and read poetry and, you know, that kind of situation where, in many instances, students don't get this kind of intimate relationship with their professors.  But she, she did this, and I'll never forget it.  She, she started this women's dinner.  And it was just awesome to see four or five--and it wasn't, it wasn't maybe.  If you were a woman up there, undergraduate woman, you went to that that dinner.  To see four or 500 young women dressed in their little black dresses that they brought home, from home, and a string of pearls, a pair of white gloves, and a handkerchief, come into that ballroom, and there were no men in there, other than the waiters.  And it was way up into the years before they allowed Mordecai [Wyatt] Johnson to speak to us from the balcony.  That was one of the, ohh, it was something else.  It was really a traditional thing.  And then, of course, after she died, in her demise, in 1937, why, of course, in '25 [1925], she started the dinner in '22 [1922], '25 [1925], the Howard Women's Club was organized.  Now, that I've been a part of ever since.  And we sponsored the dinner every year, other than a year, maybe that the dean and her staff would sponsor.  And in several, about four occasions, they didn't have it just as a dinner.  It was a weekend.  They had consultants and speakers from all over, community-wise, and other cities to come, from other universities, and that sort of thing.  It was a weekend thing, and then it ended up at the chapel on the Sunday following.  And they had a luncheon and all of that kind of thing.  It was a weekend on--
Speaker 1: Who were some of the speakers that, that--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --that came to address you?
Speaker 2: For the most part, these speakers were women.  She started out with the dinner--were speakers from universities or and, and sometimes two because she'd have a younger person who had just gotten out into the, you know, the world of work, and they'd come back and tell you their experiences.  So down through the years now, they've had, oh, I can't even recall all of those speakers.  They had Dr. Fuhavee [ph.], the lady who, the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], they always have some representative from there.  And there's a sweet little Y.  Of course, one or two of the--we didn't have too many presidents of universities in, but we have those persons who were outstanding in, in various universities.  Let me see, some of those names escape me now, but I'm writing the history of the Howard University Women's Club.  It's in, in print now, part of it, and I have covered, I have saved maga-, programs from 1947 on up to, to 2000.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you ever have Mrs. [Mary McLeod] Bethune or, or--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have Mrs. Bethune.
Speaker 1: Mary Church Terrell or--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Mary Church Terrell.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I presented her with--she, of all of the years that we've been in operation, we've had only one honorary member.  And I brought that to their attention this last time and Mary Church Terrell was one of them.  And I presented her with that, that citation, oh, yes.
Story_ID: 166048
Speaker 1: Mary Church Terrell, can you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was she like, what was she like?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a no-nonsense person and very outgoing.  And I, I learned a good bit about her when in late years when she started this protesting, you know, the discrimination here in Washington [D.C.] because they would meet every Saturday.  My husband, Ogden Groomes, was a union man and, of course, he was at all of these things.  He was right there.  And they would march from maybe restaurants or wherever, and go in to be served and all that sort of thing.  And they would meet at the church down there, I think, at Grant Circle a lot of times.  But anyway, she was as, as hearty and as agile as most of them.  She was with them.  And she was sincere, a very sincere person.  And I don't know, at her age, you just couldn't, you couldn't believe this, that she had the energy that she has, oh, yes.  She was, she was a marvel.  And when we gave her that citation, Howard Women's Club [Howard University Women's Club], and I presented it to her--I have a picture of it that I'm going to give them.  And I, I was endeared to her.  Mary Terrell, you know, and recently, I haven't asked her, but I've had, had occasion to talk with Judge Mary [Ann Gooden] Terrell.  They call her Terrell (pronounced with stress on second syllable), and most people call Mary Church Terrell, Terrell (pronounced with stress on first syllable).  And I don't know whether down the line, they are related or not.  But she is a judge here at the, in the court system, and she has started a, an organization to work with--she calls it the High Tea Society [High Tea Society Inc.].  And they work with inner city girls, showing them that there's no alternative to the kind of thing that they're confronted with in communities.  So I joined that in past year 2002, I think, and they have taken over the area and the home that the Baker's Dozen years ago.  Those were a group of social workers here in Washington [D.C.] who had this home over on 4th Street, and they are occupying that to work with these girls as one of the, the activity houses.
Speaker 1: The Baker's Dozen?
Speaker 2: Huh?  Baker's Dozen, yes.  Most of those girls were social workers and they banded together and they worked for many, many years with inner city young women.
Story_ID: 166049
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, now are there any other activities at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] you want to tell us about that, that we may have forgotten about, or we, we didn't discuss?
Speaker 2: Well, other than the Howard Women's Club [Howard University Women's Club] and the Friends of the Chapel [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I belonged to that, and, of course, that's spearheaded by the dean of the chapel.  And, of course, I was under with, with [HM] Dean Crawford for many years.  He's still living now.  He's the interim dean of School of Divinity [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] you know, and Dean Richardson [Dr. Bernard L. Richardson] is a dean of the chapel now.
Speaker 1: Now was, was Howard Thurman on, on campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] when you--
Speaker 2: Yes, now I was not very active.  I wasn't in the Friends of the Chapel at that time.  Thurman [Dr. Howard W. Thurman] was.  He was the father of the whole group and, you know, we had, we dedicated a window--got an artist to do this.  In the chapel, and it has the likeness of each one of the deans, very, very, good likeness of each, and it's on the west side of that chapel.  And when we dedicated, why, I remember that was a date that, of course, I'd lost my husband [Ogden Groomes] by then.  I lost him in '96 [1996], but I had met this friend who became a companion, Dr. James Timms [ph.].  He had retired from the School of Divinity.  He was professor emeritus there.  And, but that Friends of the Chapel, I continued to make as many meetings as I can because they, they bring back Vernon Jordan [Vernon Eulion Jordan. Jr], [HM] Jesse Jackson [Sr.], [HM] Wyatt Walker--what's this other guy there?  I can't ever think of his name, but these are heavyweights, you know, and whenever they have that, they can't have in the chapel.  They have to have it in, in Cramton Auditorium [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to accommodate all those students 'cause they're there.  They get out of those beds on that weekend and they come to that chapel and it, it's a good thing because they get this contact, this immediate, this intimate contact with these, the best that we have coming back.  And they, they give them some good messages, too, oh, yeah.  That, I remember this last year when, when Vernon Jordan came.  And, of course, he has a lot of his books and they signed them, brought up from the library, not the library, it was a bookstore, and he sold most all of them really.  But that, I get a lot of pleasure out of attending.  And I'm their minitor's [ph.] chairman of the Friends of the Chapel and I have been for many years.
Story_ID: 166050
Speaker 1: So your experience at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] basically, you know, you became involved with Howard as a lifelong--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, ever since I graduated, I've, I've been involved up there in some way.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the campus, I considered my community, my community.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I've known and met many, many, many of the outstanding people up there.
Speaker 1: Now, now what did you do--well, tell, tell me about graduation and what happened afterwards?
Speaker 2: Graduation was a time.  You're so excited, so much is happening, you don't know what's happening.  But, but anyway, I, in '32 [1932], I knew most of the local people, you know.  At a university, they're coming from every place and you don't know the--unless they're very outstanding students or had something in the student council or the student government or something like that, you don't know, or get to meet many of them.  But for the most part, I kept up with and still keep up with--I was trying to get a table for our last reunion luncheon.  It's all class reunion luncheon.  And I remember about fifteen or twenty years ago when we had our sixtieth, I was the representative of my class.  I and Charles Tibbs [ph.], the two of us co-chair our class, and when we got up there and spoke of our class of '32 [1932], why, oh, they just couldn't believe it that we'd be around that long.  And that girl who was, and Ms. Jefferson [sic, Helen Willis, played by Roxie Albertha Roker], was it a Jefferson?  Anyway, Roxie--I can't even think of--
Speaker 1: Roxie Roker?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Roxie Roker.  She came up there and she said, oh, I hope I--and she shook my hand, 'cause she's since passed.  But she said, "I certainly hope I can, I can stand up and be as, as alive as you are when, when, in the years coming," but she passed.  And we got a lot of accolades from that and I tried to keep a table, have a table, '32 [1932] table, but this year I couldn't.  And the only two that were very active at this reunion were Pervis Williams [ph.], who became our first principal of, of Spring Garden High School, and he's incapacitated now.  He's in a chair, but clear of mind, very clear.  I just went to, in the past three months, went to his wife's funeral.  They belong to Lincoln Temple, not Lincoln, but Plymouth, Plymouth Congregation Church [Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ, Washington, D.C.].  And the other one is Ethel Randolph Scott and I talked with her, Ethel Randolph--what's that girl's last name--Price, Ethel Randolph Price [ph.].  And I talked with her about a month ago and we're to get together.  She talked as though she remembered, but I didn't know whether she really did or not.  I said, "I'm going to send you a little clipping."  I said, "Don't you have your yearbook?"  I constantly go back because you changed over the years.  But anyway, the two I was trying to get to go to the all class reunion, they have it at commencement time.  But I couldn't get a table and I called Nesta Bernard, who's been the head of the alumni association [former vice president for Development & Alumni Relations at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for many years, and told him I couldn't get a table so I guess maybe I wouldn't make it this year.  Yeah, I keep up with that and it's a good way to, to renew your, your acquaintances, and it's a really good reunion of other classes that you know people in other classes, other places, cities.

Speaker 1: Do you remember who your commencement speaker [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was in 1932?
Speaker 2: No, indeed, I, I got all the programs.  I got the programs (laughter).  I don't remember.  I should have looked that up, too, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what, what did you do after graduation?  Now, you, you majored in English (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: English and social studies.
Speaker 1: English and social studies, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I went into government.  When they tore down those temporary offices where the mall is now, that was during the World War I [WWI], I guess they were put there.  Anyway, they were there and commerce building had workers to come in.  They had three shifts, morning, noon, and night to come in and put that material on those cards, those--what do they call them--they didn't have the kind of thing we have now, discs and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Those punch cards, those computer punch cards?
Speaker 2: Punch cards, yes, and I got on that shift.  I was still up there at Howard.  That was my last year.  And I was in a section of thirty six people under Mr. Hartman [ph.] from Virginia.  And we worked from, oh, around four o'clock until about midnight or something like that, eleven o'clock, something like that.  And we covered that in about three months because I went from that job to--it was a three-month thing--to the Bureau of Engraving [United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing] and I was there about three months.  Then after that, I got a call from the labor department and I went in as a machine operator over there on F Street under the Department of Labor.  And from there, to the main building, and got my permanency through civil service.  And when I graduated, this is the thing.  They told me I could not take the, the junior high examination for the schools, D.C. [District of Columbia] schools, because I had practiced under a person who had a senior high certificate.  That was Louise Lovette [ph.] and at that time, they were trying to make a Cardozo High School [later Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.].  They were taking business out of Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington D.C.] and business, some business courses out of Armstrong [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School, later Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.], and creating a new high school, strictly business, Cardozo.  And it was then on New York Avenue [Washington, D.C.] and the building and I practiced under her.  And I could not take the senior high examination for the schools because I'd, I was a junior high, you know, applicant.  So this went on--I was at labor and became permanent worker, and it was good all through the war.  And, do you know twenty years later when I went home, my mother said, you had a call today from Franklin Building, a Mrs. Gropp [ph.] called, and she want you to get in touch.  I got in touch with her.  They were apologizing to me.  Now, see, if this is in this day, I could have sued (laughter).  But they were apologizing because they had made an error.  Louise Lovette had a junior high certificate, the one under whom I had had my practice teaching.  And I was eligible to take an exam twenty years prior, but I was denied it.  So they told me to come down.  And I went down to Franklin Building and took examination, met the board, had their oral, and within a year, I was appointed at Hine Junior High School [Washington, D.C.].  At that time, it was called horrible Hine, but they later got this new building there between 8th and 7th, that new building on Pennsylvania Avenue.  And that's where I retired from in 1972.
Speaker 1: So you, you started in what year?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You started there in what year?
Speaker 2: I started there in '59 [1959], I believe, in '59 [1959].
Story_ID: 166052
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in, in the meantime, well, tell me about your--the [U.S.] Department of Labor, what, what, were there any interesting stories from the Department of Labor?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  That was interesting and I guess things just worked out well because at that time, I had the two daughters, Janette [Paret] and Julie [Vass].  And I was still working, employed, while I had to find out a way to keep them occupied until I'd get home in the evening.  And I had a lady on the, the adjoining street, Tosworn [ph.] Street, to keep them and until I got home in the evening.  And then I'd put them in that junior school of music, the older girl, to, and she had her practicing, you know, there in the apartment.  But at the Department of Labor, I was in the statistical unit and had very good supervisors, but as you know, with children getting the measles and the mumps and the this and the that, I was not in one of the agencies that could not allow you to be, to take leave as, as other agencies, the other agencies, the war agencies.  I couldn't have done that, but I just happened to have been in the Department of Labor, and I could get off on those occasions to look after the youngsters in emergencies.  And I experienced a very good working relationship there and had good supervisors although we couldn't, we couldn't be promoted, elevated because usually they had someone over you who had skilled in whatever they were doing.  But one or two couldn't even pass the, the minimum, you know, exam.  And that irks you a bit, but anyway, I stayed there until I got that call and went down to Franklin Building [sic, Franklin School, Washington, D.C.] and I left there and went to the school system.
Speaker 1: Now, now, would the federal government in those days, was, was it fairly easy for black people to get along in federal government in those days?
Speaker 2: Didn't hear you.
Speaker 1: Well, was it, was it, was it easier to work for the federal government in those days as a black person?
Speaker 2: It was, I'll say it was tolerable, but you didn't feel fulfilled because you had been trained for something else, but you did your job and that was employment.  And many who had quite elevated educational ability couldn't find jobs at that time.  And so you, you respected the position you were it, and you accepted it and did the best that you could, and but always hoping that you would get into a position that would be fulfilling, and you could use that which you were trained to use and to do.  So I, and during the war, I was the news person for the Department of Labor.  Those employees who were called into service, why I kept up with them and what they were doing and, and those who were recently inducted into the service and that sort of thing, and kept a running record of them.  And I was looking at some.  I had a scrapbook and, of course, the printed page is yellowed now, and the, the adhesive that kept those articles in there.  But I was the representative, the reporter for the Department of Labor at that time.  And that was interesting on the side.  And, of course, as I said, my husband [Ogden Groomes] was a union man, strictly union, and he saved many, many jobs of about eleven cases that he had.  And he be-, he became the president of the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations] there, and he had a hard time because they were not as cordial to union workers then and especially the leaders as they should have been.  And if he didn't receive the promotions and things, he should have.  If, if he found a job through the grapevine or however, by the time you got there, they knew about you before you got there, you know, that kind of thing.  This is a union man and he's disruptive and that sort of thing.  But, of all the cases that he had, he lost only one, and he saved many jobs down there at the, those charwomen down there at the Bureau of Engraving [and Printing], who had been there for years and years.  And he, that was his pride and joy, whether he got promotions and that sort of thing or not, he stuck with his union, a strictly union man, union man.
Story_ID: 166053
Speaker 1: So was he [Ogden Groomes], he was an organizer?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: A union organizer as a--
Speaker 2: Did he organize?
Speaker 1: Yeah, was he an organizer?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, and he went to all the delegates, conventions, and that sort of thing.  And he teamed up with a guy who was of the other race, and they encountered all kinds of discriminatory and negative attitudes and people, even at those conventions, 'cause one man stood up on one occasion, he was telling me.  And he said, he took the glass that he was toasting and threw it up against the, the fireplace and said, you know, there were years that I couldn't bring myself to do this, but they were, many of them were converted that this was the right thing to do, and to treat those employees as employees and forget about the, you know, discrimination and all of those negative things that they had to endure.
Story_ID: 166054
Speaker 1: Tell me about school when you, were, were you excited to be able to start a career as a school teacher?
Speaker 2: Was I excited?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh (laughter).  Oh, when I, when I resigned from [the U.S. Department of] Labor and went--well, that summer, I got my mother [Cora Becton Jarmon] in my car and I drove around this horrible Hine [Hines Junior High School in Washington D.C.].  And when we (laughter), when we got around there to the front door, we saw all these young fellows.  I guess about five or six of them in the vestibule of the school over there at 7th and Southeast [Washington, D.C.], shooting crap (laughter).  And momma said, "Whoo, are you crazy, where are you going to teach?"  I said, "Oh, yeah, they're, they're not school students, they're not students."  I said, "They're just in front of the building doing what they're accustomed to doing."  But I was really excited when I went in.  I wasn't as confident and sure of myself at the beginning because I inherited a person that the teacher's program who had just left, whose position I had, you know, been put into.  And he was a teacher of, of a business, and I wasn't a teacher of business, so I had to keep ahead of that.  Well, that didn't happen, but maybe a year or so, one year, and I fulfilled that as best as I could, and I wasn't a bad teacher.  And I, I was, being an older person, not just a young person put into that teaching position, I didn't have problems as some of the teachers had with discipline because, see, I was an older person.  I'd been in government, and here I'd come as an older person into the classroom, and they respected that.  And in many instances when they would bring students from Caesar Knowles [ph.] who problems students and put in my room, I didn't have any problem with them.  And it ended up that I got a lot of them that I didn't, I shouldn't have had.  I had too many of them, but it worked out well, for me and for them because I, I, I had the maturity to deal with them and let them know that life was much more than they were seeing right there at that time.  And they could, they could make an impression and, and be fulfilled in whatever they chose to work at and, and actually be committed and, and dedicated to their, you know, their studies and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now when did you, were you able to teach social studies and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, then I got my, my own program, English and social studies.  Then later on, I enjoyed it because, and it was exciting, because I not only worked with them in the classroom, but I sponsored the Red Cross [The American Red Cross] group, the Charmette [ph.] Club.  I had extra, I just took on extra stuff and worked with the students and they appreciated that and I see a lot of them now.  They see me and know who I am, but they have to tell me, "Oh, I was in your class" and such and such thing.  And even when I went down to jury duty, there were one or two down there--said, "Didn't you teach at Hine?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "I was in your class," and she had her little youngster along with her.  And that, that's a rewarding kind of thing when you meet these students and they remember, you know, you and your relationship with them in the classroom.  That's a rewarding thing about it all.
Story_ID: 166055
Speaker 1: Now, now you got involved, among the other activities that you were involved in, you were involved in an Association for the Study of (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Association for the Study of Afro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I got involved in everything.  The Friends of Liberia, I became the president of that and, and in '71 [1971], '72 [1972], I was the guest of the, the country.  As president, I went over there, and at the inauguration of President [William Richard] Tolbert, and, and but that was a sobering kind of a, and a sad thing two or three years later, you know.  They were, they had that uprising, and most of those leaders that you had met over there--New Year's, they all congregated to the, the home of the district attorney or whatever the head, they call their head there, and they had a delegation to go from here at his inauguration.  Mrs. [Thelma Catherine "Pat"] Nixon headed it and Max Robinson [Maxie Cleveland Robinson, Jr.] headed the, you know, the, the media and stuff.  And during that time, why, I was supposed to go on the Ghana, but it wasn't advised, advisable that I go down there because they were having some disturbance.  So I came on back, but that entourage went on to Ghana 'cause they had protection, I guess.  But most of those leaders were, you know, as you know, killed, thrown into common graves, and all that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 165278
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, now you had a--you, you were a member of that for many years and still a member, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You, you knew Dr. Carter G. Woodson, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I met him on one occasion.  He was lecturing, and he was a convincing type of person, and very--he had a, a countenance that made you feel that he was in authority.  And, and he, yeah, he made you feel that, even authority, and the more I read about him, why, the more I became interested in his life.  And he, he was really--he dedicated himself to what he was doing, and he was a very frugal person.  He, he didn't waste any, any money and all that he had, he put into his, his--both of his, the, the printing, as well as the publishing side of, of his work.
Speaker 1: And, yeah, he published--many people today don't, people today, I don't think realize that he published so much, but he published his own books, right--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Associated Publishers.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And then he also had the Journal of Negro History and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the, he had another publication, too, it was a foot, a--
Speaker 2: The bulletin.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Negro History Bulletin.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a bulletin, yes.
Speaker 1: The Negro History Bulletin, yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And so that, you know, seemed very active and busy.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then the conference every year was a big deal.
Speaker 2: Now, they're going to make that his home site, there on 9th Street between P and Q [Washington, D.C.]. It's going to be a historical site [Carter G. WoodsonHome National Historic Site], and I think the park service [National Park Service] is going to take over.  But we say that they organized, the McClellans [ph.] organized, and many members got together and became the friends of ASALH [Association for the Study of African American Life and History].  And they campaigned and got money to pay off the debt, the indebtedness on that house, but it never was restored the way it should have been.  And it wasn't until they, the national, was about to lose it, that we were informed and took over that project to save it, but it's, has not been cared for as it should have been.  Great historian as he was, it just wasn't, and everything deteriorated around there, you know.  It was closed up and the--what do you call it--the conditioning wasn't proper for preserving those books and things they had in there.  And I'm, I'm glad that it is going to be taken over and refurbished and, and updated because it should be a place that you could go and visit, you know, open door kind of thing as a monument to his work.
Speaker 1: Now, one of the projects of Dr. Woodson was Negro History Week.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And this would have to profoundly affect any school teacher teaching social studies and history in the school.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: So, can, how did it affect you when you taught school?
Speaker 2: Well, it was fine because I worked closely with Ms. Myles [ph.] who was over that associated business for many, many years.  And the material, the kit that they put out and put in the public schools, or any, any subscribing school, anybody that wanted to buy it, was updated each year.  And it was a tool that you could work with and even though it, it should have been in every school system, it didn't get the publication as it should have gotten.  But I did a lot of volunteer work down there at the headquarters at 14th Street [Washington, D.C.] where, where was that Vermont Avenue [Washington, D.C.] criss-cross between P Street and the Avenue.  And much was lost in one of the flooding that they had down in the basement.  And there was a very--I'm trying to think of her name.  I can't think of it now, but she was a, a Catholic sister who came from Baltimore [Maryland].  And she and this relative, Marion Jackson Pride [ph.], the girl who I said we were at high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington D.C.] together in the same class, and a relative of his.  We went down there and spent many hours trying to get a library there on that first floor of that triangular building that the headquarters that they had.  And this lady was dedicated.  She passed some several years ago, but she was one of the Catholic sisters, and was very dedicated.  And we all worked towards trying to establish a, a library there in that building of his work and so.
Story_ID: 165279
Speaker 1: Then, later on, succeeding me as president was Lieutenant Colonel Brooks [ph.].  He also, he didn't, he lived about six or seven months after he became president, but he passed.  But he also got his unit in the, in the Army to work as tutors there at Hine Junior High School [Washington, D.C.].  They come there and they were--he sponsored that, that program that they had and he became, he succeeded me as president of the Afro, Association for the Study of Afro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History].
Speaker 2: Now, when were you the president of the [Washington] D.C. Chapter?
Speaker 1: Oh, let's see.  I guess in '78 [1978] or something like that.  I think it was '78 [1978].  These, these years are, since I've gotten into this millennium, I, I can't even think (laughter) about those other years.  They're escaping me now--the exact years, but it, it was, it's documented that, you know, as president of it.
Story_ID: 165280
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, so you've been a part of the celebration of Negro History Week, and later, African American History Month?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, month, yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Since 1972, I guess, and I mean--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: But you, did they, did we have Negro History Week when you were in grade school and high school?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.  But, at Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington D.C.], this was a regular thing because those professors, we had professors down there, you know, they weren't just teachers.  They couldn't get into the colleges as other professors, but we had the best that there was.  That's why it got the reputation that they had.  They had Ph.D.s and that sort of thing and they knew their subject matter.  And what they would have carried to a university, they brought to those high school students.  And we were, we were very well blessed in that regard.  And so, that Negro orientation, and what we were doing, and what we were about, and where we came from, that was always a part of our upbringing there at Dunbar.
Story_ID: 165281
Speaker 1: What were some of the other highlights of your teaching career?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  Well, I'll tell you, I became involved with the Middle States Council of Social Studies [sic, Middle States Council for the Social Studies].  And later on, I became the treasurer.  Now, that was taking in all the Eastern states, Maryland, then in New Jersey, New York, all of them, their colleges and their libraries.  It dealt with their work, and informing them, and disseminating materials, and that sort of thing.  So, I was the treasurer for that organization for several years.  That was a highlight.  And in addition to that, the Middle States Council always sponsored in the spring and in the fall, sessions.  I got a chance to go, too, and we stayed on campus to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], to West Point [U.S. Military Academy, West Point, New York], all of those places.  That's where we'd have meetings.  And, oh, this was enlightening to ride up that Hudson [River] and, and stay on that campus, and see all of those--oh, this was a sight to be seen, to see the, the war ships, dead soldiers, they call them, all lined up that they had, I guess, in World War I, all lined up there in the Hudson as you go up the, that drive, you know, on the way up to West Point.  Oh, that was, that was something, a sight to see, all of those ships that they had during that time.  Yeah, and, and you look forward to that, going to these various places, all up and down the Eastern seaboard.
Speaker 1: There's a lot, a lot of interesting that work--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --so, so volunteer activity leads to a lot of experiences that you were there ordinarily.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, some, there's a long list of organizational affiliations for you.  And beginning with the Zion Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.], the Association for the Study of Afro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History], the PUSH For Excellence [Inc., PUSH Excel].
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: PUSH--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I went to Nineteenth Street [Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.], housed the branch of that.  [HM] Jesse Jackson's business excelled, and I worked there, did a lot of volunteer work there, Nineteenth Street Baptist.  It's on 16th Street, but it was, you know, at 19, they call it Nineteenth Street Baptist.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were a teacher during the height of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, oh, yeah.  I go way back there to that--what do you call it--that Resurrection City, when they came here to Washington [D.C.], you know, and that, that was really inspiring.  You got to meet these people from the states, especially from the South who--and they were gung ho with this kind of thing.  It was in their, in their system.  And it was a rainy season, too, I remember, because oh, the, the tent grounds down there was just sogged with water, and that's all in the tents.  It was bad living but they endured it all.
Speaker 1: I want to--
Speaker 2: --but they endured it all.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Story_ID: 165282
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you were when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] died and, and how you found about it?
Speaker 2: Where was I?  I was here in Washington [D.C.], but that day, I don't know about that day, but I know it was a sad, sad day.  Everybody was in tears and you just--seems the sky was falling, you know, you just didn't know what to expect next.  I, I don't recall where I was that particular day, but I know it was a sad time in my life.
Speaker 1: So you decided when, when the Southern Christian Leadership Conference decided to come to Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --with the Poor People's Campaign--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --which was part of Martin Luther King's agenda--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --before he died, you decided to become a part of that then, and to, to really volunteer and--
Speaker 2: Well, now this other thing was in '63 [1963] and then--
Speaker 1: That was a--
Speaker 2: --the later march was '83 [1983]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--
Speaker 2: --yes, twenty years later.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the march on, you were, you were part of the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  In fact, I, I kept up with all those things because I even remembered in '39 [1939], I was down there when Marian Anderson was singing from Lincoln Memorial.  And at that time, I was pregnant with my first daughter, and I was out there in that audience and I shouldn't have been down there.  And I was praying that my daughter would have come here for a voice like Marion Anderson.  And she can't (laughter), she can't even carry a tune (laughter).  I'll never forget that.  Ohh, if my daughter would just come here with a voice like that.  And those people were--what I'll say--all over that, that area.  I'll, I'll never forget that, that experience.
Speaker 1: Now, what about the March on Washington in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was there, yes, indeed, I was there.
Speaker 1: Now, did you meet some interesting--
Speaker 2: Then, in '83--huh?
Speaker 1: No, did, did you meet some interesting people in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I met, I met that Hosea Williams.  He, he has since passed.  And [Ralph] Abernathy, and, oh, years later, I met in--with another colleague of mine, I met Mrs. [Juanita] Abernathy.  Oh, that was some fifteen or twenty years later, but she's a lovely person.  And who else was that down there that, there were so many of them.
Story_ID: 165283
Speaker 1: Now, I've, I've been told that you, you met Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer?
Speaker 2: Jerry Moore--oh, yes, yes, indeed.  She was a favorite of mine and, you know, I got very intimately involved with her because I belonged to the Business and Professional Women's League [Business and Professional Women's League Inc.].  And they had Founders Day and I was the chairman of that, so I wanted to get Fannie Lou Hamer here as a speaker.  Of course, she didn't--down there in Mississippi, she didn't have a, a secretary, somebody to keep up with the correspondence.  And, finally, when she confirmed that she would come, the organization said that they didn't think that they could afford--she, I think she stayed at Dupont Circle, one of those hotels that she always, when she came to Washington [D.C.], she stayed there when she was going up to the white colleges getting money to go back to get this pig bank, you know, started and that sort of thing.  And they couldn't afford her fare and to pay for her lodging there at that hotel.  So I arranged, I--she stayed here in my guest room.  Then, and I got a big sign in there, I had a sign at that time.  Fannie Lou Hamer slept here (laughter), over the bed, and all that.  But she sat on that organ stool, kicked off her shoes.  And I wish I'd had--many days, I said, oh, if I just had a camera, one of those, you know, Dictaphones or something to capture the stories that she told, sitting on that, she kicked off her shoes in her bare feet.  And she went through her life history, and nobody listening to her, but me and my husband.  You know, Ogden [Groomes] and I, and I said, ohh, isn't this some history.  But the, the way they treated her in the courts down there and put her, jailed her, and, oh, the inhuman things that they did.  And it was really something, and I gained, oh, so much respect for that Fannie Hamer.  But at that time, she wasn't as famous, you know, so these women, they didn't know that she was Fannie Lou Hamer.  And she became, and when she came up here--when was that, in '68 [1968], was it '86 [1986] or '60 [1960]?   When she came up here with her delegation, you know, to, to unseat the--
Speaker 1: '64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: Yes, it, yes--
Speaker 1: --it was '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: --yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: It's when they (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Why, then they knew, they knew her importance.  And, and she was an unlettered woman who had--well, I guess, it was just intuition and, and guidance, divine guidance, or whatever, but she had it.  She was an unlettered person, but she, she knew what to do, and she knew how to, to influence and, and attract people.  And she'd come back with the money from those white colleges, and go back down there, and build up that pig bank and all that kind of thing.  We really didn't, really until later years, realize her importance, and that she was really a historian and she was a race woman.  Yeah, that Fannie Lou Hamer, I have the greatest respect for her.
Speaker 1: She could sing--
Speaker 2: As I do for Butthoon.
Speaker 1: --yeah, she, she could sing, too.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Fannie Lou Hamer could sing, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: She had a powerful singing voice.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.  And I have a picture of her and the president of the Business Women's League.  Julie [Vass], where you are?  Get that picture and hand it in showing and I, oh, you know, it wasn't, it was about, six to eight years later that I saw that picture.  Now they took a picture--I, I, I became disenchanted with the Business and Professional Women, their attitude towards her, and putting her up in the hotel where she should be.  So I was a national member, and I just came out of the Washington [D.C.] Chapter.  And Kerta [ph.] Mae Turner [ph.], who was the president, tried her best to get me to come back to that Washington Chapter.  And so, on a Father's Day that I took my husband down to the Chinese places he loved to get his fan, fan-tailed shrimp.  That was a dish that they fixed.  We went down there and that president of that Women's League, said, "Thelma, you know, I have a picture of Fannie Lou, you, and myself, and I want you to have it."  And she says, "I'm going to get a copy of it and send to you."  I never knew that because I just, I was so enchanted--disenchanted with those people.  I didn't go back to any of their meetings since they denied her the privilege of staying at the hotel and I put her up here in my home.  And when I saw that picture, I was so elated.  She brought it, gave it to me.  It was in color and I was happy to have her get that, Fannie Lou.  And I did, I had some correspondence with her after she went back down there.  But then when I was reading about her life towards the end, it wasn't the life that she should have had, and the recognition that she should have had in her last years, it wasn't at all.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Ella [Josephine] Baker by any chance?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Ella Baker.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: She was an organizer in the South, too.  I just wanted to know.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, no, I never met her.

Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you were talking about Resurrection City, the tent city, they, that they erected during the Poor People's Campaign down in the [National] Mall [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the rain that kept coming down and made it a really a mess down there, right.  And it became a mess down in the mall though, but tent city--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, it was a mess down there.  It was a rainy season and oh, it was a mess, mud and stuff, and all.  But, anyway, I was, in 19-, I, I think it was '86 [1986] [sic, 1968], '86 [1986] [1968], I was in the (unclear), in one of their newsletters of the D.C. school system, they printed my--I became the Woman of the Year through the Afro-American and the Grey-, Greyhound.  I think it was Greyhound or Trailways, one of them.  They sponsored this Woman of the Year campaign and at the same time, the same year, I was the Woman of the Year, and they had cited me for my work there at Hine.  And in that article that they have, I have a copy of that, they mentioned the fact that I had bought a tent down there and--
Speaker 1: For Resurrection City?
Speaker 2: --I had worked daily, uh-hum, with that group, Resurrection City.  And I, it was, it was just a part of me and, you know, through life, my father [Ozias "Otis" Jarmon] never got me a Caucasian doll.  They had Caucasian features, but they were brown dolls, you know.  I always had a, a, an African American doll and they had this long, black curls and stuff.  And I, this year, when, I guess it was 2000 when I entered the millennium, I have a friend who said, you know, I said, I'm trying to get an 18-inch colored doll.  The one that I had was in the attic, and the porcelain or whatever the, that was made, it cracked and I, I had to destroy it.  It wasn't any good.  But I said, she was eighteen inches in length and I wanted an eighteen-inch colored doll.  And she said, you know, I have one up in my attic and that was Rev. Hales [Rev. Dr. Phale Dophis Hale, Sr.] you know, he was a great NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] man and a preacher, and he was an OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Center] under--
Speaker 1: Leon [Rev. Leon Sullivan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-hum.  And she brought me that doll.  It was a beautiful thing.  It's over there in the corner now and I dressed it in honor of my mother [Cora Becton Jarmon] who was a seamstress and my two daughters [Janette Paret and Julie Vass].  And something else came to mind about that.  I can't think of what it was now, while I was mentioning that, but it's been an interesting life, interesting life.
Story_ID: 165285
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, did you meet any members of the Uni-, Universal Negro Improvement Association [UNIA], Marcus Garvey's group?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, and listen, wasn't anything started that my father [Otis "Ozias" Jarmon] and mother [Cora Becton Jarmon] didn't get into.  For instance, that improvement association [Universal Negro Improvement Association], the, down there, the Elks home at 10th and U [Washington, D.C.], when they bought that, that building, the Whitelaw Hotel, anything was black-oriented, he was a part of it.  And I have some old crumbled-up (laughter) chairs and stuff that's no good now.  And when they had this market, they started the market, and even when they started the market for [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] after his assassination over there on North Capitol [Washington, D.C.], why, all of those things just come, they flourish, and then they disappear.  But that, that was a great thing of my, my father's.  He, he belonged to--he'd take out shares in this and my mother would take out shares in that, but they were, they were dedicated ethnic people, I'm telling you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, that was a part of me.  Yeah, and that place at 11th and U [Washington, D.C.] that where Crystal Caverns [ph.] used to be.  Now that belonged, all of that belonged to, to us.  And that's where I met a lawyer--what's his name--Belford Lawson and his wife [Marjorie McKenzie].  And across the street was--what's that guy's name--he had the, the best and the most outstanding restaurant in town right across the street.  And that's where they met, Belford Lawson [Belford Vance Lawson, Jr.], and, I think she became a judge, Lawson, then married him.  The two of them met right over there and they used to eat at the dinner table.  At that time, my mother had retired and had gone out into Vienna.  And so, I was taking my meals at that restaurant and that's where I met them.  And across the street was the Crystal Cabins and all of that was Afro American-owned as the Whitelaw Hotel was and all of that.
Story_ID: 166056
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, now when did you retire from the [D.C. State] Board of Education?
Speaker 2: In 1972.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I would have stayed longer, but my husband [Ogden Groomes] was ready to retire from the [U.S.] Department of Labor.  And I, at that time, I had been detailed downtown to the main building, 12th Street [Washington, D.C.], to form a--I was a part of a committee that the superintendent, Benjamin Henley was then superintendent, and he formed this committee of teachers pulled from various schools in the city to go around to the other junior and senior high schools to teach reading.  Reading had gotten to such a point that they needed some help to teach the teachers how to teach reading in their discipline, whatever that or whatever, how to go about it.  And so, from that group, I got a chance to get to most all of the schools.  Then, for that two years I was down there, they sent us back to our buildings, and Hine Junior High [Hine Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], a new building, and could accommodate a cluster of schools.  They were going to set up a reading unit and they were going to get all of these machines and that sort of thing, but they had to have provision for them to have those machines secure.  And so they had a long going across that whole building, Hine Junior High, the front and the back, but the art people had that room, both of those rooms.  They wouldn't give it up.  And we were trying our best to get that reading center in there for the cluster schools.  And they--oh, I had every little spot where this machine would go and the plugins and all of that, and was working diligently.  And I went over to the Eckington Place [Washington, D.C.] where the National Geographic [Society] gave away all of those--they were getting rid of their storage, and they gave away just cartons of their magazines that had never been opened.  And they just asked any teachers who wanted it, and most of them were these Catholic people from Virginia.  They came in with their station wagons and loaded those books up and took them out.  And I had my large back of my car and I had the little boys put those in and took them down to--all of this was going into this reading room.  But we didn't get it.  So I, I became disgusted after that.  And I said, here we can't even get the room and have the reading after they've planned it.  So I said, I'm going to come on out.  And I came out in '72 [1972], the both of us, my husband and myself.  So after that, why we just traveled and did volunteer and did what we wanted to do, and made life--life was comfortable for us.  And, but to this day, I don't think that art department ever gave up that room, but they couldn't afford but one art teacher, you see.  But they didn't give up that room 'cause every year they would invite me back to the teachers' end of the year luncheon, you know.  Sometimes we'd go to Mr. Henry's [ph.] or all up and down Pennsylvania Avenue [Washington, D.C.] to, for the luncheon, and come back to the school.  And but they, and I'd inquire.  I said, have they given up that room yet?  And, because if they had, and we'd set that up as a, as a reading center, why, I'd, I would have stayed, I know, at least three or four more years to see it, you know, it, in its fruition.
Story_ID: 166057
Speaker 1: I know you do a lot of volunteering and you're always in the community.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my biggest hope, and still is, and I don't see it.  I wish we could, as a race, get our priorities straight, you know.  There--material things are fine, but there, there's much more than that.  And we just don't, and with our youngsters, we aren't letting them know.  We're keeping so much from them or giving them material things, and we're not telling them our history as much as we should.  And this is--I, I think our priorities could be changed a bit and I wish we would.  And I tell you somebody who was on the road to that, and that was [HM] Walter Fauntroy.  When he was down there at Congress, he put out a little book and it was the plan.  That's what he called it.  And in that, he outlined things that, as a race, we should do.  And those are priority things.  We should at least belong to one or two of our old line organization, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and the Association for the Study of Afro American Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History].  And he said there were certain things that we should help sponsor.  We should not, we shouldn't have to be begged to belong, and just because maybe we gave a little pittance in a church or an organization for that organization, we should have a membership in those organizations.  And I thought that was one of the best things that he ever did, but as a rule, we haven't followed it.  And we tried to keep some of the, the negative things away from our youngsters.  And they should be told the whole history and, and let them know what our roots are, and where we've come, and where we are, and where we still have to go.  This, this should be paramount.  That's, that's--
Speaker 1: Some, some people say, I've heard some young people say that they, you know, they don't want to hear about slavery, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I know, I know.  Do you know I've had, and some of these were, were teachers who said when they were highlighting "Roots" and Alex Haley's stuff, and, and pictures of that nature--movies, oh, I can't stand--these were teachers saying this.  Oh, that's so depressing and all that kind of stuff.  I couldn't, I couldn't understand that, you know, looked out the more they would know about it, the more it would become, become a part of them, you know.  You know that this is, this where we were.  This is what it was then.  And, and this is what it is now.  And it should be a little better a little later on.  And we should work towards that, but some of them--no, they don't want to do that.  And parents, many parents, no, they don't, they give over all this time.  They call quality time looking at certain silly things on TV (laughter) and stuff, like comedy stuff.  No, I, I think we should be a little bit more serious minded with our youngsters, and let them know what we know because we haven't written it, you know.  We've neglected to write much of our history.  For instance, you know, it was a pity to, to learn how many boxes of material and, and documented stuff that Mordecai [Wyatt] Johnson never got around to, to writing about, you know.  And we wait until we get into senior life and we forget a lot of it.  We don't get around to--towards the end, he had somebody putting it on disc.  And I think Lavelle was doing some of his work, too.  I don't know, but we wait too late.  We should write all along, just like I say, in life, don't wait for a certain year, I'm going to do so, and I'm going to do that, and enjoy life.  Do a little bit as you go along.  Take your vacation time and make that quality time, and do something that you could--happy about writing home about letting the children know about it, and bringing them up that way.  That's the way I feel about it.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, when you look back on all the things that you've done, what would you consider as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: What I consider--
Speaker 1: Is your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  I don't know.  I think being a very, a, a person who wanted to be a part of all, and know about those that I have met along the way.  I don't know of an organization that I haven't been a, a host to several times, large groups, forty and fifty, right here in the house, and when we were all in 4301 17th Street, same thing.  And, no, no organization, if, if we needed a place, and we couldn't go up there on the hill, come right here.  Friends of the Chapel, ASALH [Association for the Study of African American Life and History], I entertained them all, and always had them around.  And even though Julie [Vass] went off to school, she went and she had a lot of the time, but Julie, Janette [Paret] was around, and they helped me in this kind of thing.  And some of the times, I'd take on more that I should after I met my companion, James Timms [ph.], Dr. Timms--why, each time I invite the Friends of the Chapel, all of them, to come, he said, "May I be your co-host?"  I said, "Yes, you may" (laughter), and he joined me on two occasions at least.  And I've gotten a lot of pleasure out of that, having these people around me, and letting them talk and, and express themselves.  And that little old--what I call gallery downstairs, that just brought to mind, they see these pictures and they say, oh, yeah, when I met this guy, and he was doing this, and they, you know, it just helped the conversation, yeah.
Speaker 1: Let's focus on that for a minute.  You have a gallery in your basement?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us a little bit about this.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that became with some pictures that I would have in my classroom.  And I had a good many of those when I left the classroom and came home.  And I said, well, I'm going to continue this, and I'm going to put it on the walls of my rec room.  And I got them on the walls of the rec room, the washroom, everywhere, they're on there.  But as I would go to these conventions and things, and the, the caucus business, you know, and exhibits that they would give all of these pictures and things, and books and things.  I would get them and I'd put--most of them are at least eleven by, or eight by eleven size pictures of our achievers.  Then, when I retired, I said, you know what?  I'm going to devise a game that I think will be--now that's going to be my legacy, I hope, too.  This game covers 300 of our black achievers.  And I had my girlfriend, who was an artist, but she was in the Geodetic [ph.] Society.  That's where she worked.  She's from Kansas City, Kansas, but she could capture a, a continence or likeness.  And when I found out I could not use the little pictures of these achievers unless you get the permission, you know, any picture, get the permission.  I had her get them that size, just capture that picture.  And I have them of all 300 of those achievers.  And it's a game, an educational game, played sort of like Pokeno, you know, where you have your boards, and then you have your clue cards, cue cards.  And I have, covering so many, there are twenty five in each set.  And I said, there's no way I can cover all this in my lifetime 'cause I, I entertained a lot and I pushed this stuff back.  And then when I bring it out, I have to find out where I was when I left off, and that sort of thing.  And then I have, I have not been a person to be--what do you call it--did I say my grandson?  I have a great grandson who is as--what's, what's the word I want--but you've got to be focused on certain, whatever you're doing, and have that focus, and nothing deter you from it.  And I have been exactly one of those persons, you know, I get off on this little thing, and then I get carried away with this little thing, and then I come back to that again.  And I've had through life so many projects going, and all of them in an incomplete stage (laughter), all my project, jumping from one project to the other.  But this, this will be my legacy, that game, and I have up to date, and I've brought Julie in on it.  She has done the cue cards for two of those sets.  There are twelve sets.  And I said I, no way I can get copyright and all this, but what I was trying to do, get the copyright business because you have to pay each time even though it's the same game.  You have to pay that same fee, you know, for copyrighting.  So I have finished two sets, which covers fifty people, and I hope to get to get on the market as soon as I possibly can.  So that will be part of my legacy.

Speaker 1: Do you think that, that oral history is important, like this project that we're doing here?
Speaker 2: Yes, oral history is very important, but we don't have what is called those griots, you know, to who's trained to do that, and got memories that never fail because as you grow older, you--some things, the dates and the, you know, the continuity of things gets a little beyond you.  But I, I really think what we should do as a race is to put it down in black and white, and preserve it that way but (unclear), that's wonderful if we could get them to sit still long enough to listen (laughter).  Doing that, that's, that's a job, too, in itself.  They get carried away with the instant stuff, TV, and they graduated from the radio, but that TV, and there's so much on there, it's just--takes too much of our time, I think.

Speaker 1: Now, did your parents [Cora Beston Jarmon and Ozias "Otis" Jarmon] get a chance to see you become successful and what do they think you being a (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, my mother got a chance to see me go into my profession and she was happy about that.  And my father, of course, 'cause she predeceased him.  She died in '63 [1963], and he died in '69 [1969].  But they both, I think, were happy with the way things turned out for me.  And then my children [Julie Vass and Janette Paret] also, and they got to see my grands-, but not my great-grand.  But I think they were pleased and, and how life treated us all.  We, I think, were very fortunate and very blessed throughout life 'cause we were very religious, of course.  And we expected things to turn out right and, and, for the most part, they did, they did.  And I feel very, very blessed and thankful.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much, ma'am.

Speaker 2: Uh-hum.  Well, this is a photo of an affair that--Founders Day observance of the Business and Professional Women's League here in Washington [D.C.], and it was in May 27th in 1970.  Now, here we have the famous Fannie Lou Hama [Fannie Lou Hamer] who was our speaker.  And the president, that's Fannie Lou, and this is the president, Serga [ph.] Mae Turner, the real estate state millionaire, who's great benefactor of Shiloh Baptist Church [Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church], and this a picture of me.  I was the chairman of this affair, and I did the presiding.  This was at Peoples Congregation Church [Peoples Congregational United Church of Christ] in Washington, 13th Street, 13th and--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Ms. Turner's--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's all right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) blew this.
Speaker 2: Julie, come with a wet sponge.  She'll get it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Julie!
Speaker 1: JULIE VASS:  Yes.
Speaker 2: Come with a wet sponge.  That'll sop it up--two or three of them.  Put it on the table anywhere.  You put it there on the table.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: JULIE VASS:  All right.
Speaker 1: Thel [ph.] Jarmon (laughter).  And I guess I must have been about three at that time, and you see the fancy dress I have on with all that embroidery and stuff.  Well, that's the way my mother dressed me until I was in the third grade, elementary school [J.O. Wilson Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], all way--because she was a seamstress, and she put the best on me, and I, until I started coming home with them all torn off and muddy from playing ball.  Well, that's Thelma.  Oh, now, that's (laughter), when I was in high school.  Now, that I didn't like the way that guy took my picture.  It, I don't know, it just didn't--the face is okay, but the hair didn't look--it must have been a bad hair day (laughter).  That was Skirlock [ph.], but he's been my photographer for many years.  Yes, I was in high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Washington D.C.] at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And like--
Speaker 2: All right, we can go to the next one.
Speaker 1: Oh, now that's when I was up there on, on the campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And I guess that must have been in 1931 or '-2 [1932].  And I felt very sophisticated then, you know, you know everything when (laughter) you come out from college, looking wise.
Speaker 2: 1932, okay.
Speaker 1: Let's see, here we go.
Speaker 2: You got that upside down (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) we put them sideways.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Turn that up the other way.  This is the head down there.
Speaker 2: It's, it's okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, you, oh, you know what you're doing.  Okay, I thought you, uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, that's my, my first husband, Jerome Vass, and myself, and we were in New York, I think at that time.  And he's the father of my two daughters [Julie Vass and Janette Paret].  And we were together thirteen years.  And we separated amicably, and we, all through life, we were very, very close to those two daughters.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Now, that's in early adulthood when, where did I go on that occasion?  I was going someplace.  But I think that was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], but anyway, we were traveling.  We usually motored through the country and went up there.  And I think we met a cousin or an aunt or somebody related to my first husband up there at that time.  Yeah, that was, oh, in the '40s [1940s].  Oh, now, this is a group of girls who worked in the Department of Labor [U.S. Department of Labor].  And they were, came over from--well, they were hired in the, in the Census Bureau [Bureau of the Census].  And do you know all of them are gone now except three that I know of.  And this is one of my very close girlfriends.  We lived together there at 2400 16th Street.  Her family and my family were together.  And this is me here.  And this became a colleague.  She was in the school system and most of them.  And this girl went out to California, but as I said, they're all gone.
Speaker 2: About, about what year is that?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: Oh, that must have been about '40 [1940], between '40 [1940] and '45 [1945], something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a picture of Mary Church Terrell [Mary Church Terrell] receiving this citation.  I'm presenting that to her at one of the Howard University [Washington D.C.] Women's Dinners.  And that was a wonderful occasion because she was, she was then, and still is--we don't have, we haven't named another honorary member of the organization.
Speaker 2: Can you tell us the year?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Can you tell us the year?
Speaker 1: The year of this one?  Yeah, when you're (unclear).
Speaker 2: Let's see, what year was that?  That had to be about, oh, '60 [1960], '68 [1968], I guess, somewhere around that time.
Speaker 1: That's good.  And could you spell the name of the woman who's receiving the award?
Speaker 2: I didn't hear you.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know how to spell the woman's name who's (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Mary Church Terrell?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, Mary, M-A-R-Y, Church, C-H-U-R-C-H, and Terrell, T-E-R-R-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: This is in the '70s [1970s], I guess.  We were living then at 410-11 Shepherd Street, Northwest [Washington, D.C.].  This is my husband [Odgen Groomes] in the front and I'm next to him.  And this is Lynette [ph.]--who's that girl's name--but she was in the school system.  I can't even--Lynette, I can't think of her.  And this was a fellow who had a yacht down there.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) pointing but lean your head back a little.
Speaker 1: What'd you say?
Speaker 2: Lean your head, tilt your head back a little while you point.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: So we could see your finger.  Go ahead, point again.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.  And this guy, and the girl who's taking the picture were the--it's a couple that I travel with for many, many years.  And she was the artist who did the work for my game.  I'm calling that game "Kin" K-I-N.  That's going to be a part of my legacy.  It's covering 300 black achievers in an educational game.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Kin from Kinston (laughter).
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.  Huh?  Oh, oh.  That chair, soon after we got here and at 4301, that's my husband and myself sitting out on the porch.  That must be around--the years are escaping me now--gave me such a (unclear).  It's about '70 [1970], in the '70's [1970s], about '75 [1975], I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Getting older and wiser (laughter).  Oh, now this is a, a surprise birthday party that they gave me out in Maryland at the--what'd they call it?  It was operated by an own, by a fellow who started--don't worry about that--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --who started his restaurant business here in the district.  But he later got a place out there in Maryland, Montgomery County.  And these, this is my granddaughter.  That's my oldest daughter.  And this is Julie.  That's Janet, the oldest daughter.  This is Julie, the youngest daughter.  Here I stand, and this is Ogden, my husband.  And the cake is there.  And at that time, we're looking rather askingly [ph.] because I was trying to change the numbers on the cake.  It was in '69 [1969]--what was it--'67 [1967].  And I, I was trying to change the '67 [1967] from '76 [1976] (laughter).
Speaker 1: From '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us your granddaughter's name.
Speaker 2: Huh?  Oh, the granddaughter, Marlenę Davis.  She's the one that's giving me three great-great-grandsons.
Speaker 1: Oh, excellent.  How does she spell Marlenę?
Speaker 2: Marlenę, M-A-R-L-E-N-Ę, with a cedilla over the "e", last "e".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Story_ID: 165292
Speaker 1: Can you describe this one for us now?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's back there in the '30s [1930s], I guess, young adult, looking, looking very (laughter), I don't know what you must say, demure.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You look very (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter), yes, indeed (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) and this one.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's later in life.  Yeah, that's my coming on up here in the '80s [1980s].  I'm trying to think where I was going at that time.  I remember that suit very well but, yeah, that's from the '80s [1980s], '86 [1986] or '-7 [1987], something like that.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we're going down there to the Kennedy Center [John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.], I guess, we were going someplace.
Speaker 1: That's you and Mr. Groomes?
Speaker 2: And my husband, that's Ogden [Groomes], and myself.  And they always kept me with these beau-, it must be around Christmas time.  We were going to some kind of gala.  Poinsettias, beautiful poinsettia, and I'm crazy about flowers and they always kept me supplied with them.  And this is the family, yes, indeed.  This is Marlenę [Davis] and this is her husband, Michael Davis [ph.], with the, the oldest son.  That's the oldest son is--I can't even think of (laughter), Michael, Marcus, that's Marcus [ph.].  And this is Myles [ph.], I guess, over here.  I don't know who this is.  This is Julie [Vass].  She's holding someone else's child.  I don't know who that is.  And this is Janet [Janette Paret].  And this is Ogden, my husband.  And who's that in the back?  He's, oh, that's Serge [Serge Joseph Paret], that's my grandson.  That's Marlenę's sibling, it's her sibling.  And those are just friends, friends in the back.  And then, yes, except that little Myles, Myles Davis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, this is over there in, in London [England] in front of the big gate.  I went over there before Julie came back.  She was over there for three years.  And I went over to London and went to Paris [France] and went to Rome [Italy].  I spent almost a month, a week in those places, and she was staying at that time in Plymouth, Portsmouth [England], rather.  The big gate.  And what is that?  Oh, yes, this is one of those Christmases that the great-grands were brought to Washington [D.C.].  And I'm sitting there with some gift.  And this must be Myles, I guess, oh, I don't want to move that.  And that's Myles, I guess, and that's Dr. Timms [ph.] in the back.  He was a part of the family from the time I met him, and he enjoyed those children so much.  That was at Christmas time.  We had the gifts all around.  I don't know who this is sitting here--somebody, but anyhow.  That's what that is.  Oh, what is this?  Yeah, oh, ohh, this is over at Julie's apartment.  And it must have been Mother's Day or something.  And this is a grandson, Serge Joseph Paret, and this is Janet, his momma, my daughter.  And I'm in the center.  Yeah, this is way, late here, this, here in front of 1901 Parkside.  And I think we had just come from a--this is Easter time.  She's at--hanging baskets out there.  That must have been around Easter time--come from church or something.  And they just snapped me out there on the porch in the '90s [1990s].  Now this is going back to--oh, we got all three of the boys here now.  This is Michael, the daddy, and this is Myles, this is Marcus, and this is Malachi [ph.], and this is the granddaughter.  And, of course, that's her husband.  This is Marlenę.  And I'm sitting back there in the white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On one of those rare occasions that they had the grandchildren here.  Oh, now, this is a my daughter, Janet.  This is my grandson, Serge Joseph.  This is his wife, Cheryl, and this is her son.  And this, of course, Thelma Groomes.  And we were--oh, they were here on some occasion.  We always get together when Janet comes back, comes back.  That must have been in about '95 [1995] or '-6 [1996].  Oh, now, this is, they're returning us home.  As I told you, General Becton [HM Julius Becton, Jr.] and his wife [Louise Thornton Becton], after we had come from the luncheon, they came back and we took a picture out front.  And that's Julie, myself, and that's Mrs. Becton, and that's General Becton, General Julius Becton.  That was in 2000, 2001, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With this, this is '03 [2003].  It must have been 2002.  Oh, that's momma there, Cora Elizabeth Becton Jarmon.  Yeah, she's a dear one.  She was the matriarch for many years of the family.
Speaker 1: Now, about what, when, when was this picture shot, do you think?
Speaker 2: This picture was--I think when we were at 4301 17th Street in that home there, the corner home there.  That's where it was shot in there because she died there in 1963, but that's one of her very good shots.  It was during the time we were living there.
Speaker 1: Yes, she's very pretty.
Speaker 2: And that's Papa [Ozias "Otis"] Jarmon.  Yeah, he's big brother to all of his siblings and he was the preacher and the very beloved guy, just a matriarch, the patriarch, of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, he's a very religious man.
Speaker 1: He's the one that had the voice, right?
Speaker 2: Loved his family.  And very race-conscious man.
