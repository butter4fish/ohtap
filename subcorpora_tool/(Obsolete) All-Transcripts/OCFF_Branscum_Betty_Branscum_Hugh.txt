 Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Today is September 24, 2012. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We   re here in Kingfisher, Oklahoma to speak with  Betty and Hugh Branscum, regarding their centennial farm. This is part  of the Oklahoma State University Library   s Oral History Research  Program. It   s one of our projects within that program. So, thank you so  much for having us in your home today. Let   s start with having one of  you or both of you tell us how the family came to own this particular  piece of land.  Well, my grandfather came from Champaign, Illinois, and he came on  horseback first to the saloon here in Kingfisher. He knew no one in  Kingfisher so he   d come to the saloon. He met a Mr. Pappy and Mr.  Bollenbach, and in the conversation and everything he was telling them  that he was looking for a good piece of land that had plenty of good  water. They said,    We know just the place,    and so they took my  grandfather out east of Kingfisher nine and a half miles to this place. He  saw it, and he liked it, and he bought it then. And my grandfather raised  horses. He liked to work with horses and everything, and he always  raised real good quality horses that people liked to buy from him.  When he came, was he a bachelor or was he married?  He was already married and he had five children at the time, four boys,  older boys, and a daughter that was six months old, and that was my  mother. Then after they came here, they had   let   s see   they had four  more children. They had another daughter and a pair of twins and  another daughter, who died at fourteen months old.  And what was his name?  The grandfather?  5  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Yes.  Felix.  Felix, okay. And then your grandmother?  Lena.  And then your mother and your father?  Lewis and Louise Bamberg.  Okay. And then how did you two end up with the property?  We bought it from my aunt. My aunt and my mother inherited it from  my grandfather and grandma. My aunt had two-thirds of the place and  my mother had a third of the place.  I think we bought it in 1966     From my aunt.     from her aunt. We give thirty-five thousand for two-thirds of it. Okay,  the third was in her name and like I told you earlier, the reason that it  didn   t have it on our plaque there is because her name wasn   t ever on the  abstract. The Bamberg was never on there.  My mother   s name.  But her mother, that was between her sister and her, see? That   s the way  it   d be. When we got that plaque in 2000 they said,    No. We won   t put  the Bamberg on there. We   ll leave it off.    So, we wanted them to and  didn   t get it done. But nonetheless, then later years, well then we bought  that place in 1966 for thirty-five thousand from my wife   s aunt. And  then in later years, why, when the folks passed away, why, then my wife  inherited that third. Of course, then they had a house in town, here. They  had two children. They gave the son the house in town and they gave us  the third of the land and that made it about equal in money. That   s the  way they divided that up.  There   s never been a mortgage on the farm out there. It   s never been  mortgaged.  And when he come and bought it that fall, he gave eighteen hundred  dollars for the quarter, 160 acres.  6  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Wow.  And that was an enormous amount of money because there was people  just a few years before that, would leave from here with a grubstake and  team and wagon. They wanted to leave because it was so dry and it was  hard work. But he stayed put and he was the third generation to buy that  place. There was two before him. One homesteaded, and the guy that  homesteaded sold it to another fellow, and her grandpa was the third  owner. He gave eighteen hundred. Now, I don   t know   I can   t  remember what the others. It   s in the abstract.  When he went back to Champaign, Illinois, he brought the family, his  family, back to Guthrie, and he bought a team and a buggy and brought  the family onto the home place out there.  Was there already a house built or did he have to build one?  One-room building.  There was a one-room building and then my grandfather, in the spring,  built the two-story part to it.  We got the pictures over there. See that picture over there on the floor?  (Gestures) That   s the home place.  Is it still standing?  No.  No, it   s not standing.  We rebuilt in 1979 and    80. We finished the house in    80. My husband  and three other farmers, with the help of other farmers along that helped  maybe a day at a time, built the house.  7  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  I can show you. See that little girl? (Gestures) That   s the aunt. The one  right there is the aunt that we bought the place from. This is my wife   s  mother, right here. (Gestures) That picture was taken about 1903. But  this barn was there when we moved there. That   s a straw stack sitting  back there. (Gestures) But her grandpa built this house that you see here.  He built that after he come.  Two-story.  That two-story part. Back behind there was just a one-room with a lean-to  on it. Of course, I tore this down, and there   s a picture today.  (Gestures)  Did you spend much time in this house growing up?  Yes, I grew up there.  She grew up in that house, yes.  Can you talk a little bit about the inside, then? Where was your room?  My room was upstairs. I had the very south room upstairs. It was always  a room that was, in the summer, cool, because always a cool breeze. You  could open the windows up and it was just really nice sleeping, nice up  there.  How was it heated?  It wasn   t, the upper part. It was just the lower part, the living room and  dining room area. And it wasn   t a dining room area. At one time, it was  a kitchen and dining room together. My dad and another farmer built the  walls between the kitchen and the dining room and the living room, and  that was the heated part. It was that way even   well, when we tore it  down and rebuilt, it was still just heated, the lower part, like that.  8  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H.

It was heated with coal before we got the butane.  How did you stay warm upstairs in the wintertime?  With lots of covers on and a hot water bottle. (Laughs)  Her grandpa heated with wood, I think. Didn   t he? He heated with wood,  Betty.  I don   t know. There wasn   t that much wood around Kingfisher.  I think they got a wood stove at one time there because I can remember  hearing your dad talk about them stoking the fire up at night, so it   d be  some coals left for the morning. When they   d get up, then they   d throw  some wood in there. I think your dad burnt wood, if I   m not mistaken.  I   ve heard him talk about it.  We had coal.  You had coal, too.  I can remember the coal.  Yes, well, I think people had both. They burnt some coal and some  wood.  It was probably whatever they could get at that time.  Yes.  Yes, corncobs, too. There was a lot of corncobs burnt. There sure were.  Well, we didn   t. We never had.  A lot of people did burn them, though, Betty because they raised corn in  that country at that time, and they   d feed corn to the horses. They   d shell  that corn, see, and they   d have the cobs. They burnt a lot of cobs up  there. Your dad talked about throwing cobs in the fire.  They used whatever they could get.  Yes.  9  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H.

Yes.  Had your mother or grandmother made them?  Yes. And we had comforts, and they was thick. They was tied. They  weren   t quilted. But she had quilts, too.  Had your grandfather raised horses in Illinois before he came?  I think he probably had.  He farmed with horses back there.  Yes.  And he never did have a tractor. He farmed with horses, here. He left the  farm out there in 1920 and moved into town here because of his asthma  condition. I don   t think he ever had a tractor that I know of.  I don   t think my grandpa did.  No, he   d always just farm with horses, but he had to quit farming  because of his health. And her parents got married in 1922, and they  moved out on the farm and they started farming in 1922.  And what did they farm?  Wheat.  Mostly wheat. Well, all wheat.  Yes, he raised some hi-gear for hay and then had grass pasture for the  cattle to run on. But it was mostly wheat, is what it was.  And they got that in    22. How long did they stay?  They stayed until 1963. They moved to town in     And we moved there.  We moved there in 1963 on the place.  We was married in    56, and we lived west of town, and then we moved  east of town and lived in a little house. And then we moved to the home  10  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  place in    63.  And what did you raise?  Wheat and hay. Yes, wheat and hay was all we ever raised.  And how long did you do that?  We did that until 1998, from    63 to    98. We moved into here in 1998.  Well, you still farm some.  Well, I farmed after we was in here for a few years, but we moved off  the place in 1998.  Hard to give it up?  Yes, hard to give it up. There was this daughter by us and her family  lived in a trailer house. We have the quarter out east of this quarter, and  they lived on it. They had three boys and they was getting up to pretty  good enough size where they were bouncing off the walls in the house,  so we just moved into town   a little earlier than we anticipated. This  area here come up for sale, and our neighbors over here     It was just being developed, this little area, this cul-de-sac.  Eighteen houses in here.  Yes, eighteen houses.  So, we moved in here.  And we stopped at one of the neighbors here and visited with them. We  had drove buy the property. We knew the property and everything and  drove by the property. You said,    When we move to town, this is where  I   d like to be, this area.    So, we stopped in at the neighbors over here  and visited with them. They were telling us about the area and  everything, and we decided,    Well, we   ll check into it.    We checked  into it, and this where our house is standing, we decided, was an ideal  area. It was the only area on this side that didn   t have a house on it yet.  Yes, we was the first to build on this side.  So, we had two years. The guy that sold the property said two years  was   and then you had to build on it. So, we decided,    Well, just as  well go ahead and build.    So, we did and we moved in here in January  11  H.

Branscum  of    98, and then our kids moved into the house out on the farm in April,  I think it was.  Something like that.  Anyway, a couple months later.  That second picture is the home place, today, right there. It   s behind  there. (Gestures) That   s what it looks like today.  It   s a bigger house than what this is, but then we decided we wanted a  smaller house because we weren   t really getting younger. We knew that,  and we knew as we got older, we didn   t want all that upkeep. My  husband said he didn   t want to have to mow lawns. We had a big lawn at  home. So, we decided on this place, and we got it all cement so he don   t  have to mow. (Laughs) And I got a smaller house. Lots of times, I wish  for more room because I got stuff stuck everywhere.  If you want to play in the dirt, you can go back out to the place.  Yes, well, I got these little flower beds. I play in the dirt here. (Laughs) I  always had a big garden at home, did lots of canning.  And how had you learned to do that?  My mother.  Did she can?  Yes, and I   m sure she learned for her mother.  Oh, if it hadn   t been for the garden, we might   ve starved to death. We  had to raise our food, a lot of it. The generation before us, they didn   t  hardly buy groceries. They bought just necessities   salt, pepper and  sugar, coffee. They raised what they ate. And the generation before that  is her grandpa. He used to buy sugar by the 100-pound sacks, carry it  upstairs for storage in that house. They stored it upstairs, and he   d buy  apples by the wagonload. He   d go across the Cimarron River and buy a  wagonload of apples, two dollars. Used to be a lot of orchards over by  Dover.  Three dollars. It was three dollars.  Well, anyhow, he   d get a bunch of apples, and they   d bring them back  over here. They   d slice those, put them up on the chicken house, on a  sheet     12  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  On a screen.     and they   d dry those apples from the sunlight. I don   t know what kept  the birds from eating them, but they must   ve had some way     I don   t think they had the birds, then, like we have now.  But they dried the apples, and they pretty well raised what they ate  because they didn   t have any money. It was pretty rough on them in  1900. (Laughs)  Did they have a cellar?  Yes.  Yes, they had a cellar. We raised a lot of potatoes and had a big garden  out there, just south of the house there is where the garden was. We did  that too, and we just raised two children. Yes, we used to milk cows, and  we made our living with our milk cows and their baby calves. That kept  us going.  Had a dairy, or just   ?  No, it wasn   t a real dairy. It was just enough that we could survive on.  We sold cream.  Yes, we sold cream and     I can remember fifty-six dollars   the cream check was fifty-nine dollars  for two weeks. We got the check and I   d come to town and I   d buy  groceries. It   d take care of all our groceries and everything, because I  canned lots, too.  Yes, it   ll do it. We seen some pretty rough times, but nothing like the  generation before us. And then her grandparents went through a lot  more. I was born at Okemah. I don   t know if you know where Okemah  is or not, but I was born there, and I come to Kingfisher in 1948 and  worked for some people here in wheat harvest. That   s the reason I come  to this county. I was looking for work, see. I come up here with three  other buddies, and we worked for people out there. And then I   d worked,  been up here. And then in 1950, why, the folks I worked for wanted me  to stay there with them and help them do chores and finish my last year  of high school, had a little consolidated school out there called Big Four.  So, I helped them do their chores. They milked, I think, nine cows. Her  13  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  knees was bad. She couldn   t get down on a milk stool and milk. Milked  by hand. Didn   t have milking machines, see. So, they wanted me to help  them do chores, and they sent me to school my last year of high school.  So, that   s how we met, really, is she was a senior and I was a senior that  year. I don   t know if she winked or I winked, but the other one winked  back.  Oh  (Laughs)  I don   t know how that happened. (Laughter) But that   s where the start of  it. Yes, but in school, that   s how I come to Kingfisher.  And what year were you born, then?  I was born in 1932.  1932, and roughly the same   ?  I was    33, yes.  So, you got married when?     56.     56, yes.  So, a little bit of a courtship, then? (Laughter)  Yes, I was married in 1956. Of course, I was overseas before that. I was  drafted in the army, in the Korean conflict. I was drafted. Then when I  come home, I think it was about a year, year and a half, something like  that.  Yes, we were married then. (Laughter)  Yes, it was something all right, but then we made it. As far as our health,  she   s had a little bit rougher time than I have. I   ve been knocked down  with cancer. I had twelve inches of my colon taken out in    99. We   d  been in here about a year, a little over it, and I was sowing wheat that  fall. I had a terrible pain and noticed in the stool, blood. I said,    Well,  I   ve got to finish sowing,    and I didn   t realize what the problem was.  See, I thought,    Well, just something broke loose in there.    I got through  sowing. I didn   t even put the machinery up. I just pulled everything  home, went to the doctor the next day, and they found out what the  problem was. In two days, they took twelve inches of my colon out. So,  that was a knockdown for me, then. And then I   ve had another operation  14  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  since then. It didn   t amount to much. But she   s had a little more  problems than I have. Betty   s had her chest opened twice, bypass  surgery     Two different times.      and she   s had her back surgery now. The 30th of July they cut about  eight inches.  I   ve got a pacemaker, and they   ve also just this year, before I had my  back surgery, they had to put a balloon and a stint in my heart     Arteries.     or they wouldn   t operate on my back. That   s why it took so long. I  was in the nursing home from the last of April until about the first of  August. I had my surgery, back surgery.  It   s better that you were here than on the farm, then.  Yes.  Well, do you remember when electricity came to the farm?  1938, I believe it was.  Where I was born, we didn   t get electricity until about    42. They was a  lot later in that area. But I worked as a little boy. That   s one of the first  jobs I ever had away from the farm. I was raised on a farm, myself. One  of the first jobs I had was when they come through the country building  the electric lines, some of the big trees, they   d just side-trim them, cut  the limbs off of the side. They wouldn   t take the whole tree out. They  called me the paint boy because I was real small and I could take a can  and paint. I   d skim up that tree and paint those knots where they sawed  the limbs off. For six days, I got thirty-five dollars. I was in tall cotton,  six days of work.  That   s pretty good.  Yes, we worked Saturdays and all. They was coming through and  putting electricity through the country.  And the purpose for the paint was   ?  Well, they didn   t want the trees bleeding, so I guess they thought   it  wasn   t really a paint. It was some kind of preservative.  15  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Creosote, probably.  I don   t know if it was creosote. I can   t remember what it was, but it kind  of kept the trees from bleeding. They   d be green, see, whenever they   d  cut the limbs off. I   d paint those sides where they cut it off. I   d paint  that. That   s the first job I had away from the farm. And then I guess  when I got a little older, I must   ve been about fourteen. Back then they  didn   t worry about kids being too little. You could just work. If you get  a job, you   d work. Now, you   ve got to be a certain age before you can  get a job. It wasn   t that way back then. Then, I guess, come to  Kingfisher then in 1948, working in wheat harvest.  When we got electricity, I think one of the first things that my mom got  was an iron, and we got a washing machine and a radio. We didn   t get a  refrigerator until it was 1946. The reason for that was the war, in the  meantime, broke out and rationing and everything. You had to have your  name on a list, and I   m sure the list contained people that had   there  was preferences. But anyway, I can remember for harvest, for the guys  that   what do I want to say? The guys that did the     Well, they threshed with a threshing machine.  Threshing, yes. Threshing was what I was trying to think of. Momma  and Daddy would get two 100-pound blocks of ice and put them in our  basement. Our basement was always cool. And they   d wrap them in     Quilts.     comforts and paper to insulate them. They   d have ice for during  harvest, and she   d make homemade   she   d make her own lemonade and  everything. It was delicious. For the men, at that time, we   d feed them  breakfast, dinner, and supper.  The men would stay, usually, when they was threshing they would stay  on the place where they was working. They   d have to bathe in a horse  tank, didn   t have facilities back then like they do now. Some of them  had a tank up on the building and they   d get under it and just let the  water run on them. But that   s the way they did for cleaning up. Like she  said, they had breakfast, dinner, and supper. That   s whenever they was  threshing. And then they   d move on down the road to the next neighbor.  That   s a lot of work for everyone.  Yes.  16  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Well, the women, back then, shocked wheat   do you know what   they  bound it from the field. They used a binder, and they   d make a shock.  Do you know what a shock of wheat is?  Kind of, but...  Well, it   s a bundle about this big around, and the wheat would be about  that tall. (Gestures) They   d have a carrier on that binder, and you could  carry so many bundles. When you got the carrier full, then you   d drop  them off. And then the women would help, and they   d come just gather  that wheat up and they   d shock it. It   d stay in that shock until the  threshing machine come along, see. There wasn   t a lot of them. You   d  just have to wait until you could get somebody to come thresh your  wheat. It might be August before you get it threshed. It   d depend on  when they come around. But what she   s saying is they had that ice there  just for harvest. They didn   t keep it that way all the time.  No, not all year around.  Now, in the wintertime, if they wanted ice they   d go to the pond and  break ice off the pond. I know we used to go get ice for my mother, and  she   d make us snow ice cream out of snow, if you ever heard of that.  The snow would have to be clean. We used to have big snows, it seemed  like, years ago, but we don   t have much anymore. She   d make ice cream  for us and we   d have   she   d also make it in the freezer, too, but we   d  have to get the ice from a pond, break ice. You didn   t buy ice in town     or we didn   t. (Laughs)  Speaking of ponds, how many ponds were on your place, the family  place?  Okay, there   s one big pretty good-sized pond, and the other pond joins.  Half of it is on one of our places, and the other half is on the other.  It   s right on the half-mile line.  Yes, it   s on the half-mile line. It   s a bigger pond. That   s where the cattle  would drink.  Were they manmade or were they natural? Do you know?  They was manmade.  Manmade.  Yes. Her dad built the one that she   s talking about. When he bought the  17  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  quarter east of where the home place is that   s when he built the pond,  because the draw run down through there and it was right on the half-mile  line. So, he built this pond pretty good size, but it   s built on two  quarters. The pond just separates the places.  So, if you went to sell it, it might be an issue then?  It   d be an issue.  Yes, it could be.  Of course, we   ve got it fixed where it won   t be sold. It   ll come on down  to the kids that was just here. Her and her family will get that, and then  we   ve got other land for the other daughter.  The other daughter. We have two daughters.  She teaches school, and her husband, at Enid, and so we got it all     everything is fixed out so if we die they know just what   s what.  Well, that   s good.  Yes, it   s all been fixed out several years, hadn   t it?  Oh, yes.  We tried to do it like the folks before us done. Betty, like I say, it   s her  side of the family, but she agreed to everything. She has a brother and  her folks had a half-section, and so they gave her brother a quarter of  land, and they gave her this quarter that joins the home place. So, we   ve  got a half-section together out there, and that   s how her brother got his  quarter. It was where her dad was raised, and his name is Bamberg so  they give that to him.  Well, see, my aunt owned most of the place we   re talking about.  The home place.  And my mother had a third. Well, I got the third. And then my dad  bought what we call the east place, which joins the home place, which  makes a half-section. So, I got the east place, and my brother got the  Bamberg place where the Bambergs settled.  That   d be her father, yes.  Yes, my dad   s place. And he also got the house that Mom lived in here  18  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  in town.  Plus, some cash. They gave him some cash.  Well     To make it even.  Did you have chores when you were little?  Oh, yes. My chores were to go after the cows to bring them up, and that  was exactly five o   clock, every evening. I   d go get the cows up, and I   d  help milk. I   d gather the eggs, was my chores.  Didn   t worry about black snakes?  Didn   t worry about snakes. (Laughter) I can   t remember having snakes.  We had   my dog went crazy if he saw a snake. I mean, he   d grab it and  shake it in his mouth and sling it. Oh, boy, you better be out of the way  when he slung it. (Laughs)  Yes, she had a collie dog that went with her a lot to get the cows.  Oh, yes.  Her dog was a collie dog.  Did your brother have chores a little bit different than yours?  Well, yes, he did. He helped hay the cattle. I can   t remember   I was  little when my dad got rid of our horses. My dad never would let me  down at the barn near the horses. He was always afraid when the horses  got in the barn that I   d get trampled or something. He was afraid I was  going to get hurt. He never would let me down there with the horses, so  I   m sure my brother helped with that. My brother was six and a half  years older than me, so he got to help Dad with the farming and  everything. And then later, as I got older, I helped on the tractor and like  that. In fact, one year I put the crop in because my dad had been  operated on. The doctor told him not to do any heavy lifting or anything  for six months. So, dad would hook the tractor up for me, and I went and  I worked the field and sowed the wheat that year. But it was just one  year that I sowed wheat, I guess. No, I helped   Dad had two tractors,  and I helped him then, later.  I think it was in 1942 is, he said, when they quit using the horses. He had  a tractor before that, and I think your uncle was working for your dad,  19  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Betty, if I remember right. George Bilger was working for your dad. He  broke a tug on the harness, and he come across the field telling her dad  what happened. He said,    Well, just unhook them. Drive the horses to  the house.    So, they pulled the tools out of the field with the tractor and  they never did harness the horses up no more. I believe in 1942, the last  they did work in the field with horses.  Tractors were something people really remember.  Yes.  Yes.  That very first one they learned to drive.  Yes, they come out on those steel lugs   you know what lugs were. Then  they   I can remember when they come with rubber tires, a lot of the old  timers said,    Well, that will never stay. Those lugs will just tear off  those tires. They   ll never stay.    If they could see today how wrong they  were, you know, because the tread stays on the tires. But they thought  that tractor would just pull those tread off the tires. They   d been used to  those old steel lugs being on the wheels.  My dad got his first tractor, I think, in the late-   20s. I can remember  Mom telling about they spent more time working on the tractor than the  tractor worked in the field, because it was always broken down. And  then he got a better tractor and just kept a better tractor, then.  It was a major investment, too.  Yes, it was at that time.  Yes, I think they was around eight hundred dollars, if I   m not mistaken.  In 1937, your dad bought the W30 and it was a good tractor. In 1937,  they were better then, and it didn   t break down. In fact, in the business,  that   s what we started farming with. We bought his machinery when we  started farming. The way he set us up   I didn   t have anything, see.  When they quit farming, he said,    I want you to farm,    and he offered it  to his son. His son said,    No, Dad. I don   t want to be a farmer.    He   s  more of an electrician. That   s what his line of work was. So, he come to  us and he said,    Do you want to farm?    and I said,    Well Lou, I can   t  buy your machinery. I don   t have the money.    So, we sat down at the  eating table, and he wrote it out, every item and what it   s worth, and he  shoved it across the table to me and he said,    You pay me when you  can.    (Laughs) I think I paid him in two years, didn   t I?  20  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  I don   t remember how long.  Something like that. I paid him in two years. That   s how we started  farming, but we started with his machinery, a    37 model and a    49  model. Two tractors is what we had.  And when Hugh bought the first Case tractor, he gave forty-six hundred  or forty-nine?  I think it was forty-six hundred for the tractor and a full-bottom plow.  That   s the first new one I bought.  A neighbor told us we was going to go broke because we spent all that  money on that tractor.  Well, we had to borrow the money, see. We didn   t have the money, but I  borrowed the money and bought it. One of our neighbors   of course,  he   s gone now   but he said,    Hugh, you   re going to go under. You can   t  make it giving that much money for machinery.    Now, then, you   re  looking at over three-hundred thousand. (Laughs)  It was nothing but up all the way from there on.  They just kept going up it seemed like.  Was it a hard decision to spend that much?  Well, no because the tractors we had     It was needed.     was getting so bad shape, they wouldn   t be able to make a crop with  them, see. I still got the one Oliver tractor, I   ve still got it. Of course, I  got rid of the W30. It was a    37 model. But I got the Oliver out there  now, and it still runs. In fact, I raked alfalfa hay with it not long ago. I  don   t farm anymore. When her back give out, see, I had to quit farming  this year. I don   t farm anymore. Had to rent the land out, and so I put up  the alfalfa with that little tractor, used it on the rake. It still runs good  and everything.  Did you learn how to do the repairs yourself?  Yes, we used to take the pan off and we   d take and pull the cylinders out  and put rings on there. Her dad helped me do that, too. We had to work  the heads over because every year in a gas motor, the valves need to be  ground. Yes, you had to do your own mechanic work. But I was   the  21  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  last time it was worked on, I brought the tractor to town and I had  George Howard do it for me. You remember George Howard, Betty, as  well as I do.  Well, yes. I should.  He did that work for me on the Oliver tractor. He overhauled the motor,  and that   s the last it   d been worked on. But it hasn   t been used much.  Well, in high school, had you planned to be a farmer?  No, in high school I didn   t know what was going to happen to me  because I   see, like I say, I was born at Okemah and I come up here  looking for work in the wheat harvest. When I got out of high school, I  didn   t go to college, but I was put in class 1A. They were drafting boys.  The Korean conflict was going on, and I was in 1A. I couldn   t hardly  find a job because of my classification. Finally, I did get a job with the  Oklahoma Highway Department working on the highway. And then in  about a year I was drafted. I had to go to the service. I didn   t ever go to  college. And then like I say, when I come home from  Korea , I worked  a short period with the highway department. And then we got married  and I started farming on a smaller scale. I farmed one quarter for how  many years, there, Betty? Several years, you remember?  I think four or five years.  I run a motor grater in construction work. Four or five years, we just  farmed one place. Then when her father, in 1963, said they were going  to move to town, that   s when we started farming two more quarters.  That was three quarters that we started out with farming.  Had you always hoped to stay with the family farm?  Yes.  More or less?  Yes, we had it kind of in our system. She did not go to college, either.  She worked in a bank, and she worked in a courthouse after she got out  of high school. I don   t know. It wasn   t   all the kids in our bunch didn   t  go to college, did they? Two or three of them went to college, I think.  There wasn   t but twelve   no, eleven in our class, wasn   t they? We went  to a small school. There was just eleven graduated out of our senior  class.  Was it very close to your home, the school?  22  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  Yes, just about a mile and a half.  And how would you get to school?  Well, I rode the bus, but lots of times I   d walk to school. My brother and  I, we   d just walk to school because the bus, we was I think the last on  the route to be picked up. So, we   d just walk and it was nothing to us to  walk.  Did your parents have jobs off the farm, or did they just make   ?  No, my parents just had the farm.  No, folks never had a job off the farm. It   s altogether different, now. But  they just stayed on the farm and worked all the time.  And then when you two got it, did you work other jobs, too?  Yes, I did. I worked as a carpenter. It was seventeen years I did  carpentry work. If I wasn   t in the field, I   d be doing something else  because I had two kids in college at the same time, and I was short of  money. (Laughs) I did seventeen years of carpentry work. The house,  there, me and three neighbors built that house right there. (Gestures)  That   s when we built it, in    79. Now, when we moved to town, the  fellow that sold us the land, he was a builder and he wouldn   t let us  build. We had to let him build it, so we didn   t actually build this house  here. It was hired done by the guy that owned the land. Yes, I done that  seventeen years and that   s my off-farm income, call it.  I worked for the bank until my first daughter came along, and then I was  a stay-at-home mom with my girls. I had first the oldest girl, Kathy, in  1957, and then Linda was born in    58.  The one that left here, yes.  Yes, and then I had another one in    59, and she was stillborn. Then I  stayed at home and helped Hugh   he always needed help with the  farming, with the machinery or something. Always had to help him do  things. I canned, and I   I was always busy. (Laughs) It kept me busy.  Were the daughters in 4-H or FFA?  Yes, both of them have been in 4-H.  And were you?  23  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  Yes.  Did you go to Stillwater for Roundup?  No, I never did, and I don   t think the girls did.  I don   t remember.  I don   t think they ever did.  I was in FFA. In    49, is when they started FFA at Okemah. I   ve got a  program that we had. I   ve still got it in there. It shows the menu of what  we had for supper that night, in the program, that we had in 1949. Do  you know anyone at Okemah at all?  No.  Well, the FFA teacher that taught me is still alive. I think he is. He   s  getting up pretty good in age, but he   s still alive. They started the FFA  program in    49, and I think they had it here at Kingfisher a little quicker  than that.  And what was his name?  Ray Holman. Ray Holman, H-O-L-M-A-N. He   s still alive. He taught  us, and there was quite a bunch of us that took FFA?  Take things to the county fair?  Oh, yes. Yes, I had a project. I had a Poland China pig was my project. I  was just in just a couple years of FFA, there. Then when come up here,  they didn   t have FFA at the school where we graduated. It was just 4-H.  Do you remember some of your projects?  Well, I got, I think, grand champion on my peaches that I canned and a  blue ribbon on a suit I   d made. I made from, I think, one of my dad   s  suits. I don   t remember.  So, sewing was part of it?  Sewing was part of it. Sewing and canning.  So, you enjoyed sewing?  24  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Oh, yes.  Make the girls    clothes?  I always made the girls    clothes until my oldest daughter, when she was  about an eighth grader, she started sewing. And she wanted to make her  own clothes, and she did. She did through high school.  Where would you get your fabric in Kingfisher?  Well, at that time, we had several local stores that sold fabric. We had  lots more stores than what we have now. I don   t think we have a   no,  we don   t have any place here in Kingfisher that sells fabrics.  No.  So, we have to go to like, to Hennessey or to Enid or to Oklahoma City  to buy fabric.  Do they still sew? Either one of them?  Neither one of them has the time to sew. The youngest one, Linda, that  just left a while ago, she never was much on sewing. She made a real  nice jumper one time for FHA, and it was really an attractive jumper.  But she sat at the sewing machine and I mean she made that thing zip,  the seam, and it turned out real nice, but she never would wear it then.  (Laughter)  Did you teach them how to can?  Well, no, not to extent. Neither one of them, I think, cans.  Not today, they don   t. Kathy helped you, when we was on the farm, in  the garden.  Well, yes, she did. She always helped.  She helped with the garden stuff.  Linda would help out on the tractor and stuff like that, but Kathy was  always afraid of the tractor and everything. She   d stay to the house, and  she liked to fool in the garden and in the kitchen. She was real good help  in the house. But Linda could do the same, too. I mean, she was real  good in the kitchen.  The oldest daughter is a teacher at Enid, is what she does. Son-in-law is  25  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  retired. He taught thirty-two years, and he   s retired now. Our daughter  dropped out when her children was born and she   ll drop out, maybe  retire two or three more years. I don   t know when she   ll retire.  She said really, she could retire in three years, but she   d like to go ten.  (Laughter) So, I don   t know what she   ll do.  I don   t know what she   ll do.  And Linda is a nurse, and she just   she   s not working right now. And it  was a good thing, because she   s really been a blessing to me during this  summer. She   s really helped me a lot.  When your parents had the farm, can you talk about some of the  buildings that were there when they had it?  Well, there really isn   t any of the buildings there that was there when  they had it, except the big round tin barn. There was a granary that you  could drive through and it had bins on both sides. Dad would store his  wheat and oats and whatever else in those bins. During the winter, we   d  butcher a beef, and he would from the     Rafters.     rafters, tie a rope and hang the beef there. We   d eat off that beef for,  oh, probably a couple weeks or so, and then my mom would can the rest  of it. She   d can beef roast and hamburger patties and different things. I  can remember coming home, and it was kind of late one time. She  opened a can of the beef and it had kind of a gravy on it. I thought,    I   ve  never tasted anything as good as that.    (Laughs) It was really good. She  canned an awfully lot.  As far as the buildings, there   s two buildings that your dad built out  there standing, Betty. The round top barn and what we call a washhouse.  He built it in    48.  Well, yes.  Those were the only two buildings that your dad built. The only thing  that   s out there from her grandpa coming in 1900 that   s standing is the  windmill. It was there when he come. The well is 100-foot deep, and it  was drilled. We don   t know how it was drilled or how they done it, but  back then they done a lot of hand-digging wells. On the quarter east of  where we live, that well is sixty-foot deep and it   s hand-dug.  And the water is delicious.  26  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  It   s good water.  We   ve had people from other places come. Some young guys, they was  from Shawnee, they said,    That   s the best tasting water I   ve ever tasted.     I don   t know. It was just water to us, but it did taste good. It was good  tasting water.  We always had plenty of it, but we never did waste it. I don   t know at  the times I went special, make a trip, just to turn the windmill off. We  had several windmills out there in different places. We had five at one  time. I   d make a trip just special to turn the windmill off so it didn   t  waste water. When the tank gets full, you   re just wasting water. So, we  always was conservative. But the home place, now it was right there  easy. Just go out there a little ways and turn the windmill off, so it was  easy to control that.  Was the washhouse just for washing or   ?  Yes. Well, we had a place we could shower. That   s before we built  the   Mom and Dad built a bathroom in the old house. We had a place  that we showered in there.  Had hot water, then?  Yes.  Yes, had hot water, had hot water heater out there in it. In fact, it   s in  that picture there. (Gestures) It   s right east of the house, there. I don   t  know if you can see it or not. It   s still standing.  And was there an outhouse?  Yes.  Well, it was     A one-seater or two?  It was two-seater. (Laughter)  That building you see right there in front of you, right there, that   s the  chicken house. (Gestures) That   s one of the first things her grandpa  built. Of course, it didn   t look like that. I tinned it and everything. It was  just a wood, built out of one-by-twelve   s. But that   s the chicken house,  and we raised chickens in it ourselves and her parents did, too. But the  27  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  building that we   re talking about, the washhouse, is this building right  here. (Gestures) It   s got trees there. You don   t see it real good, but right  there was our shower on that north end. It had a basement in there, too, a  cellar. And then on the east side of it is the garage where we put the car.  It was away from the old house. It wasn   t attached. This house here now  has a garage right here on the north end. This driveway comes around  and you come into it from the east side. This is the front of the house,  here. (Gestures) That   s the one we built in    79. The round top back  there, you see, her daddy built that. The one to the south, over there, that  other barn, that   s one. I built that. I guess I built just two buildings there,  didn   t I, Betty? Just the house and the hay barn?  Yes.  I moved the granaries. Those three granaries you see sitting back there, I  put those up myself. I tore the chicken house down.  Looks like you   re using round hay bales instead of the squares?  At that time, it was round bales. When they come in, well, we got to  where we couldn   t get help putting little bales in the barn. Got good barn  for small bales, but they   re not   you know, you can   t get real high with  those round bales so I just stack them outside, there. Since the round  bales come in, people don   t use a lot of the little bales anymore on  account of the labor part of it, you know.  Well, it looks like there   s some oil?  Yes, that   s the quarter south of us. That   s not on our place. That   s the  land south of us.  Have there been any on yours?  Yes, you don   t see it on there.  On both places. On the east place and the home place.  Yes.  And did that make a difference in the household finances when they  came in?  Oh, my gosh  All the difference in the world, yes.  Was it during your time or during your parents    time?  28  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Well, it come in during my parents    time, but we   re still getting it.  We share in it now. Yes, the oil income has been real good for us  because without that, I don   t believe we could   ve bought the land like  we have. We bought   well, we   ve got five quarters. Without that oil  money, it would   ve been a lot harder to do it, because that just makes all  the difference in the world. Like I was telling you earlier, when my kid  was in college, it was seventeen years that I pounded nails and I needed  money, bad, to stay afloat. So, the oil has been a real big thing in our  life, as far as financially.  Do you remember when your parents were approached for them to drill,  if it was an issue? Did they even think,    Do we do this or not do this?     No, I don   t think it was an issue.  Well, they come to lease the land and they was really happy to do it  because they   d never had anything like that before. People in our  community didn   t know too much about it, because some of the oil  companies, they   d pull shenanigans such as giving a blanket lease. That  allowed them to put a pipeline side-by-side. People has learned a lot  since then. We never would do anything without going to an attorney  and letting him fix it up. But there was some people that got a blanket  lease signed and didn   t know what they was signing. But it was a good  thing for this area. It helped a lot of people. Without the oil money, they  couldn   t have done what they have done, is what it amounts to. I don   t  know where you was raised. Was there oil where you was raised?  No, east Tennessee. No.  Oh, east Tennessee.  Oh, well... (Laughs)  Well, it   s a big thing in this area. I guess Oklahoma, as a state, it   s a big  thing for the state of Oklahoma.  Do you remember them getting their first check and what they might   ve  spent it on?  No, I really don   t.  Didn   t take a vacation or buy a new tractor?  My folks never took that many vacations. We have never taken many  vacations. I don   t think we   ve ever taken a vacation until the girls was in  29  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Nykolaiszyn  high school, and we went to see his friend in Illinois. I think that was  about our first vacation.  I can remember her dad saying,    If we could just get a fifty dollar check,  oil check, how that would really help,    and they didn   t have it, because  there was none. But they come in and started leasing, and they drilled  out there on   before he passed away, he got a few oil checks before he  passed on. It was pretty good checks. He didn   t know what to do,  because he didn   t have anything like that before. He never spent   I  think he traded cars, didn   t he? He had a stroke and he did trade his car,  Betty, before he passed away.  Yes.  The car was pretty new when he passed away, but he didn   t have no  need. He didn   t spend it because he never did have it before. He didn   t  know what to do. He just more or less, kept it. (Laughs)  I can remember the folks talked about every generation has it easier than  the one before. I don   t know if your folks ever talked to you about it, but  my grandpa come from South Carolina. They come from England, hit  South Carolina, come into Arkansas. Now they   re all the way to Hawaii.  But they had some rough times   rough times. My grandfather had  cancer and it bursted on his throat and he bled to death. I never did see  my Grandfather Branscum. He passed away before I was ever born. I  think my father was seven years old when he died, my dad. But times  was rough. They come   my parents come from Arkansas into Okemah,  and they come in a wagon and mules. Now, my dad was just a young  boy. He wasn   t married, and he come in, that   s the way they come. Like  I say, folks are all the way to Hawaii, now. But getting back to this area,  here, her dad never did have the money that he got   when he first got  his oil money, he talked about how nice it was. But the only thing that I  can ever remember him doing that   s different is he did get a new car and  he said,    I want Mom to have a new car.    So, he traded cars, didn   t he?  (Laughs)  Yes.  That   s about the only thing I can remember he done. I can   t remember  the amount of money he got at all. I can   t remember that.  I can   t either. I mean, I don   t know that they told us.  Betty, did your parents trust the banks, or did they hide money in the  house?  30  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Nykolaiszyn  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  No, they trusted the banks.  They did, yes. They trusted the banks.  We had a real good banker. My dad really liked him and he seemed to  like my dad lots, too.  That   s the bank where she worked.  Yes.  She was come up in, yes. (Laughs)  And how did they keep track of records through the years? How has that  changed?  Well, back then, they do it kind of like I do it now. They   d keep it down  on a book. They   d write things in a book. We   re not computer people  yet. Now, our kids are. We   re computer     Everything is computer with them. (Laughs)     we   re computer illiterate. I keep my records in a ledger book about  this big. (Gestures) We get our bank statements from the bank each  month, and what I spend I put down, that   s tax deductible. If there   s  something that   s not tax deductible, then I don   t put it in my book. And  then I go, usually, we got to do our taxes in February. It has to be  completed in February, a farmer does. I take it to this fellow and he  figures it up for me. We always pay our taxes in the month of February,  Internal Revenue and state tax. It   s different, we don   t have no  computers. It   s all done with a ledger book. (Laughs)  Your children, they   re farming the land now? No, you lease it. Do you  lease the land?  Lease it to them, yes. They don   t own it yet. They will own it behind us.  Like I say, we   ve got it fixed in a trust. When we croak out, it   ll be  theirs. (Laughter)  But they   re not farming themselves?  No, not farming it right now. They have farmed it, but the son-in-law,  he   s got an oil job and he   s tied up quite a bit. He   d always talk about he  didn   t have no time for anything. They send him to Utah sometimes for  a couple of weeks or so with his work, and so he didn   t want to farm it  no more. He told me to just rent it out to somebody else. But I may have  31  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  a grandson that   ll farm someday. He just started being a highway patrol.  He was in the class that graduated in August, and he   s out at Beaver  now. He   s on the job, Beaver County. He   s a highway patrolman. He   s  twenty-four years of age. I think there   s some indication he might farm  someday. I got two older grandsons, could care less. They   re computer  people.  Well, I don   t know. Kyle might be, but     I don   t think they   ll ever farm.     Drew isn   t.  We got one grandson lives in Austin, Texas, works for ONEOK Gas  Company. His wife   s a schoolteacher. I don   t think they   ll ever be  interested in farming. But the one that lives at Guthrie, our oldest one, he  might if he gets the opportunity. I don   t know how it   ll be. He married a  farm girl from Boise City, out in the Panhandle. She   s a farm girl. So, I  don   t know. But we might have a grandson that   ll farm. They want to  build a house out there on the east quarter someday for him. I don   t  know whether they need to or not. We think that one house on there is  enough. But when we   re gone, they   ll do what they want to do, see.  (Laughs)  I   m sure they enjoyed coming back to the farm for holidays and things.  Oh, yes.  Yes, they do. They like that.  Yes, one of the farms has a creek that runs through it, and our grandsons  always liked   I always told them we wouldn   t go until it frosted where  there wasn   t any snakes or any     Ticks.     thing to bother us. They liked to go down there, and we would walk  the creek and just talk and see different things, see tracks, turkey tracks,  and deer tracks. I   d point them out and show the boys, and they really  thought that was something. And then they liked to gather up wood, and  we   d have wiener roasts. They looked forward to that. My grandson     one grandson would call up and say,    Grandma, let   s have a wiener  roast     and I   d say,    Okay.    (Laughs) I had to keep all the stuff on hand  out there at the farm so we   d be sure and have for wiener roasts.  (Laughs) They always enjoyed that.  32  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  We didn   t hear about wild hogs so much. Now, there   s wild hogs in our  area, now, but we didn   t hear of them till a few years ago. But there are  some wild hogs in that area. Not bad, but some.  What would you do for fun, back when you were a little girl there on the  farm?  As a little girl?  Yes.  Oh, I use to, I don   t know, make believe everything. I   d see a movie and  then I   d go out behind the barn or behind the chicken house and act out  the movie and    Crazy kid  (Laughs) But that   s kids for you.  Would they let you swim in the ponds?  No, I never did swim in the pond.  We   ve got a tank out there, a stock tank, it   s pretty good along. I think  it   s about twenty-foot by fourteen wide, and you   d swim in that a lot.  Yes, I did, as a little girl I   d get in that.  They   d clean it out, and that   s where the men would take their bath.  Yes, they   d clean it out every so often in the summertime and run fresh  water in there.  From the windmill.  That   s where I swam.  I swam in the creeks and the ponds when I was little. For my recreation,  I rode horse a lot. We   d, the neighbor kids   we didn   t have money, but  we really had a good time together. We   d ride our horses, and we   d play  different games and made our own entertainment. We played a lot of  mumble peg. Have you ever heard of that? And spin the tops, mumble  peg you   d do it with a pocketknife. You   d have to get down and pull that  peg out of the ground with your mouth. It was quite a deal. We  entertained ourselves with different games, because we   d go to town  once a week. Sometimes, we wouldn   t go then. Usually, on Saturday  was the day we went to town when I was growing up as a little boy. My  mother would never go to the grocery store until she got her cream  check. She didn   t have no money, see. She   d wait and get her cream  check, then she   d go downtown and do what little bit she had to do.  33  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  All the stores stayed open in the summertime     Especially on Saturday.     until about, I guess about ten o   clock. As a little girl growing up, in  the summertime, especially   not in the wintertime, but in the  summertime we   d come of an evening to town, if it wasn   t harvest time,  and we   d go to the movie. And then there was an ice cream parlor just  off Main Street, and I can remember getting orange sherbet as a little  girl, and I thought, oh, that was the best stuff I ever tasted  (Laughs)  Yes, we had homemade ice cream on the Fourth of July a lot of times  because     We had it about once a week when I was growing up.  We didn   t have it that often.  Because we had our own cream and eggs and milk and plenty of it. We  always had ice cream every so often.  And angel food cake?  Oh, yes. Yes, my mom would make from scratch, dozen eggs, usually, it  took, great big   your big eggs, the whites of them. Oh, she made good  angel foods   good anything. My mom was a great cook. (Laughs)  We had chickens for a few years when we got married and moved out on  the farm, there. We would always take a thirty-dozen case of eggs and  we   d go to Cashion, which is over southeast of here. You   ve heard of  Cashion?  Yes.  We   d go over there and Betty would   he   d buy the eggs from us, and  Betty would buy the groceries from him. She   d always have extra  money to have on hand from the eggs, but we never sold cream. Our  cream went to Enid, up at Gold Spot  Dairy  at Enid, is where that went.  But my mother would always   what money she   d get from the cream,  she   d come home with enough money, because through the country,  then, there   d be a Watkins man come around or a Rawleigh man. He   d  have a horse and buggy, maybe, or latter years he might   ve come in a  car. He   d sell, oh, pepper and all spices, different kinds of spices, and  she   d always buy some little something from him. I don   t know   didn   t  they have that here, too, Betty?  34  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Oh, yes.  They   d come through the country and want you to buy     Oh, yes.  Did they do that back in Tennessee?  Not in my recollection, but I   m sure they did.  Yes. Well, she   d always have enough money, and then they   d have  enough money and a little bit for Sunday school.  Door-to-door salesmen?  Yes.  So, was church important, then?  Yes, church was at the schoolhouse. See, I went to a one-room school  when I was little, and it just went one through eight. Well, it was called  primer grade. We went through the primer grade, which is like  kindergarten, now. But it was just a one-room school, and that was  where they had church. It was a gathering   everything was done at the  schoolhouse for the community. Now, in town, they had a different way  of life in town. They had different churches in town. Our school was  just   everybody went to the schoolhouse to go to church on Sunday and  on Sunday night. They   d have revivals and they also, once in a while,  they   d build a church arbor out there on the school ground. Do you  know what that is? They   d just gather a bunch of brush and throw it up  on some poles, and they   d have church under there, singing and  everything. They called it a church arbor. That was on the school  grounds, though, is where they had it.  What denomination?  We was Baptist. I don   t know what denomination   everybody went to  the same place.  Yes.  I don   t think it was   it wasn   t   well, I don   t know. In our community  there was no Catholics, I don   t think. Now, Betty, her grandpa     In our community, there was Catholics.  35  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Yes.  They, of course, went to church here in town.  They come, and her grandpa lived out there, nine and three-quarters of a  mile. He was real staunch Catholic, her grandpa was, and he raised his  children as Catholics. They   d have to come to town with horse and  buggy, from out there they come into church. They used to talk about  how thirsty they   d get going home. The roads would be dusty and it   d be  so hot in the summertime. They   d just have to take their water in a jug  and it   d be hot to drink. They persevered. (Laughs)  Took them a while to go nine and a half miles, I guess, on their horses.  Yes. They had what they call a trotting team. They were just bred to trot  and pull a buggy. They had a two-seated buggy with a top over it, and in  the winter they had side curtains they put on it. That   s the way, their  transportation. But they could trot and never get tired. They would trot  all the way from town out home, and then they   d just go   (gasps)   and  that was it. They   d just take one big breath. They was bred for that. They  called them trotting teams. The workhorse, now, was different. They  were big. But these horses were small, and that   s what they call a  trotting team and they was bred for it and just pulled the buggy and just  trot right on down. Have you ever been around any of the Amish  people? Well, there   s an Amish settlement in the southeast part of  Oklahoma, and then you go up to Missouri, east of Springfield. There   s  quite a settlement of them, and they use those horse and buggies, yet.  You see them. They   re always trotting. They don   t walk. Those horses  are trotting. They   re bred for that, and that   s what   s her grandpa had  then was his trotting team. (Laughs)  So, they   d come home from church and have what to eat, usually?  Well, I can remember Mom saying   well, my daughters have the  crocks, now   but she said,    My mom would always, on Saturdays, bake  nine apple pies.    At that time, I   m sure those were littler tins, you know,  you can remember those little tins. And she said she   d bake nine apple  pies and a five-gallon crock of donuts and a two-gallon crock of sugar  cookies, and that, I guess, for the week. She said it was always so good.  They always had people around. We always, it seemed like   well, my  mom and dad, anybody that stopped in around noon, they was invited to  eat dinner.  Stay for dinner, yes.  36  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Yes. Lots of times, the guy that delivered gas would manage to be there  at noon. (Laughter) Just different   we always had company at noon, it  seemed like. My mom always was prepared, it seemed like. We did, to  some extent, have extras quite a bit of the time.  Yes, when we built that house there, in    79, Betty fed the crew dinner  every day.  Yes.  They   d come and she   d always have dinner for them. Of course,  whenever we   d have people helping with hay, why, always fed them.  That was a tradition.  We fed them dinner and supper, usually.  Yes, they   d usually eat dinner and supper. But the boys that helped on  the house, there, they just ate dinner, there. They didn   t eat supper.  They   d go home for supper. But we always fed   and we was raised that  way. If you worked for anybody, you eat with them.  Now, people don   t cook like that for helpers that come.  No, they don   t do it anymore.  I don   t anymore.  Would you vary the menu, or would it be chicken every day?  Oh, no. It   d be varied.  Varied.  Yes.  Yes, we always butchered. When we lived out on the farm, we had  chest-type deep freeze and we had plenty of beef. She could have     And chicken.  Yes, we had chicken and beef, and sometimes she   d get some fish. That  was kind of a treat for us to have fish. But also, she   d buy a pork once in  a while, too. We   d have some pork chops. But we had plenty of chicken  and beef at all times. But that was kind of tradition, if they worked for  you, you fed them. That   s the way it was.  37  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  So, you canned extra, knowing that you would be doing that, too?  Yes.  Yes, you   d have extra.  Always have extra on hand. Always run to the basement and get  something, pickles or your vegetables or anything like that. We even dug  our own potatoes. Usually, by summertime   well, you could dig  potatoes during the summer, but during the wintertime we   d store them  for as long as they kept and as long as we had any. We could just go to  the basement and get some potatoes, and it wouldn   t take too long to  have potatoes.  My folks and my grandparents, too, they had a tradition. When it come  mealtime, the old folks ate first. They always would put them at the  dining table. And whenever they get through eating, then the kids could  eat. Now, other people done it just the other way.  Yes.  They   d feed the kids first and the old     My folks always fed the kids first.  Yes, that was different tradition, see.  And then the adults could eat.  But now, when we have people here, we set up card tables in here or else  they could eat out on the back porch at that table. We all eat at the same  time, now. But back when I was a kid, I can remember standing around  and I   d look in there,    Are them people ever going to get through  eating?    (Laughter)We   d have to wait, see. As little kids, we always had  to eat last. I don   t know why the folks   that was a tradition. All the  neighborhood did that way. You didn   t put a kid at a card table or  another place. The kids ate at the table, but they   d have to eat after the  older folks. It was just different tradition. It was the way they was raised.  Fed the ones who worked the hardest first, I guess.  I guess they was providers, they got to eat first. (Laughs)  Well, my family, the kids was fed first.  Yes. We was talking earlier about the way you killed chickens. My  38  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  mother didn   t do like Betty   s mother did. She would pick up a chicken, a  fryer, and she   d just twist that neck like that and throw it out there and  that was it. She   d wring their neck. But Betty   s mother would cut their  neck off with a butcher knife. She had a different way of doing, see.  Everybody had their own way of doing things. We didn   t have  electricity. The folks would butcher   in the wintertime, we   d butcher a  pork. We always raised hogs, and then they   d salt it down and it   d keep  till we eat it up. Usually, in the spring it   d be gone, but we   d have pork  all through the winter because it   d be in the smokehouse. And it   d keep  out there in the smokehouse. No refrigeration at all. (Laughs) We made  it fine, though.  Well, my folks used to have hogs when I was just still little. But Mom  got sick and the doctor told her to lay off of pork, not to eat pork so  much. So, Dad quit raising hogs, then, where we used to have the pork  and the beef and the chickens.  Like I say, if we got fish, that was a treat.  Where would you get the fish?  Out of the pond. You   d have to catch them. Yes, the folks didn   t buy  fish. (Laughs) It was mostly just catfish   mudcats we call them. That   s  what we   d have. That was a treat, though, to have fish.  Homemade biscuits and scrambled eggs for breakfast?  Well, we had     Oh, breakfast, Mom always   my mom always fixed a big breakfast. She  believed in that everyone needed a good breakfast to get the day started.  I still think, probably, and I think it   s proven that kids do better in school  if they start out with a good breakfast. Anyway, my mom always saw to  it we had plenty to eat. We had eggs, however you wanted to fix them,  and bacon usually, or ham, something like that.  Yes, that was a tradition.  And usually, homemade bread. She would make four loaves of bread  every other day. And it   d be gone during that length of time. Of course,  like I say, we always had quite a bit of company. For breakfast, she  would toast the bread. And lots of times, I can remember milk toast. To  me, that was really good. I really enjoyed it, the hot milk on the toast, it  soaks up and you eat it and put sugar on it. And I   m not positive, but  probably some. Just different breakfasts, pancakes. And I can remember  my mom making apple fritters for Sunday night supper. She would slice  39  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  the most apples. She   d slice them in rings about that thick and sugar  them and let it kind of juice up. (Gestures) Then she   d use a juice in the  batter, and it was kind of like a pancake with an apple in it, and then you  sugar it real good. We   d have a platter stacked high, and the four of us  could eat that platter of apple fritters at one setting. (Laughs) It was so  good. But I think probably on Sunday evening, that was probably all we  ate, was the apple fritters because usually, Sunday evenings you ate a  big dinner and everything. So, that was our supper.  My mother was a little bit different. She would have biscuits for  breakfast, but for dinner and supper we   d have cornbread. That was what  she was raised on and that   s kind of the way she raised us. We had a lot  of beans. We ate a lot of beans and cornbread and onions. We   d put  vinegar on our beans. Vinegar tastes good on them. My mother was a  great hand to feed us spinach. She liked to feed us spinach. Have you  ever heard of poke salad? My mother fed us a lot of poke salad, too. We  liked that stuff. It was just a little bit different tradition than what her  mother was raised on.  Yes, my mom, when we had beans we always had potatoes and gravy or  fried potatoes and meat and a salad and then of course, fruit. We were  big fruit eaters.  And there were fruit trees on the property.  Well, no not really.  We just had apricots.  She might. I know one year she canned, it was fourteen bushels of  peaches. Now, that   s just peaches. She canned fourteen bushels of  peaches, put them in quart jars. And lots of times, half-gallon jars is  what we   d have them in. She canned apples and she canned pears and  applesauce, and she   d make pickles, the peach pickles, all kinds of  cucumber pickles and beet pickles, and I don   t know what else.  We   re that way today. We like beets. Her and I really love beets. Now,  our kids are not so much on them, but we like beets.  Oh, they do, too. They both love beet pickles.  Well, the grandkids, I don   t know if they care for them that much.  Well, I don   t know whether they eat them that much.  But Betty and I eat beets. I really like them, yes.  40  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  They go good with pinto beans and cornbread.  They go good.  They   re good with anything. (Laughter)  That may be some of the difference, since yours came from Arkansas and  you   re more north, come down. So, maybe that   s the difference.  Yes, different traditions. My folks talk about the older folks   it   d be my  grandparents, I guess. Like I say, I never did know them because they  passed away before I was born. But they had a tradition. When they   d  have beans, Grandma would fix a bowl of melted hog lard. She   d heat it  up and melt it, and she   d put a tablespoon in there. Whenever they sat  down at the table, they   d take that tablespoon and they   d throw a  spoonful of that hog lard on their beans and their cornbread. Now, you   d  think they wouldn   t live to be old people. They didn   t live to be too old,  but the oldest one lived to be ninety-four. But that was tradition back  then. People up in this part of the country here never hear of that, using  hog lard on   just melt it and put it on there for seasoning, make them  taste better. When Betty makes beans today, she buys pork and puts little  chunks of pork in there for seasoning. She don   t do like the older folks  used to do.  Like fat back? I grew up with fat back in the beans.  Fat back, yes. That was good seasoning. Good tasting, yes. (Laughs)  And just butter itself isn   t too bad. (Laughter)  No, it   s good seasoning. They talk about the school kids being obese  today and they   re changing their diet so much in the schools. I don   t  know how that   s going to work. The kids nowadays have too many  different choices. We used to eat what was in front of us. I don   t know     it   s kind of a going thing now at the schools. They   re changing their diet  around. The agriculture department is interested in that, too, because it   s  coming from the agriculture department. They serve breakfast at the  schools now, and I don   t know if they   re giving them enough, really, the  right kind of food or not. But they   re giving them what they want them  to have. You girls are over there at Stillwater. Do you hear much about  that at the schools?  I haven   t.  You haven   t heard much about that? It   s been changing nationwide. I  41  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  think the administration talks about the obese school children.  Well, I know they talked about taking away machines, vending machines,  and changing what was in them to get healthier choices.  Yes.  Yes.  Might be for the best. I don   t know whether it is or not.  Well, back in you all   s youth, you worked it off.  Yes, we did. We sweated a lot.  No matter what you ate, you worked it off.  Yes, now then, the kids don   t sweat. They are in air conditioning. Even  the farmers, they go out to the field, they   re in air conditioning in the  tractor cabs. The kids don   t sweat anymore. They got air conditioning in  the cars. We used to do a lot of sweating putting up hay. We did a lot of  it, and the folks before us did more than we did. And then the generation  before, like her grandparents, they had no air conditioning, never heard  of it. They might   ve had a fan. At church they give you a fan. When you  went in, you done like this. (Gestures) That   s the only cooling you got  was just to fan yourself. That   s all they had. And then whenever you left  church, you left your fan there. You didn   t take it home. You left it  there. (Laughs)  For the next time.  Yes, use it next time. They   d pass out those fans when you   d come in,  set there and do like this while the preacher was preaching. (Laughs)  Well, that   s the only way they could keep cool.  Yes, it helped. That   s the way they done.  Well, we   ve covered a lot today. Is there anything else you want to add  before we sign off?  Oh, I don   t know anything I want to add. I just often wonder myself, as  many changes as we   ve seen, how many more there   s going to be, we   ll  never know. But there   s going to be change, there always has been. We  seen them in the    60s when they went up in the air. I   ve seen a lot of  different machinery changes. Like I say, a combine today is  350,000  42  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  dollars, bigger machines, do more work. I bought a new one in    75, give   20,000, new combine. And I thought that was an astronomical amount  of money. And it was for that day and age.  My mother was born in 1900, and she died in 1996. She saw everything  from the horse and buggy to the man on the moon.  Yes. Airplanes come in     And just all in between. (Laughs)  Gosh, I can remember as a little kid, being outside and a P-38 would  come over. I thought I   d never seen nothing looked like that. During the  war, they   d fly those P-38s. There was two   they had two bodies to  them. Did you ever know what a P-38 is? Well, it   s a different kind of a  plane, and I thought,    Boy, that   s really something,    they could build  something like that, stay together. Instead of having just one straight  body, this one had two side by side. It was called P-38, and you don   t  see them anymore. Now, it   s all jets. But that is something to see a go to  the moon and the way things have been. I often wonder what another  fifty years will be or another hundred, but we won   t know, see.  Might not. But they   re talking about reversing some of that by bringing  the trains back. Trains were important out in this area for a long time.  We get a lot of trains come through our town, here. They go from up  north here   I don   t know how far, but they go all the way to Houston I  think, and they haul a lot of wheat on the track here. They come from  Enid and they take wheat down to the Gulf and ship it out. There   s a lot  of trains come through, more than there used to be. All of our stuff     about all of our food is shipped by truck, anymore, though. They used to  haul a lot of food on the trains, too, but I think most of it   s done by  truck. I don   t know what changes we   ll see. We may see a day coming  whenever you get on an apparatus and it   ll raise off the ground. You   ll  just fly over the houses and come back down. I don   t know what it   s  going to be. But I think that   s coming. Transportation is going to  advance, I think.  I don   t know whether I   d learn to drive one of those or not. I had a hard  time driving one of those carts in Wal-Mart. (Laughs) I couldn   t use the  walker at that time in the Wal-Mart. I rode one of those carts and I  thought,    Boy, if we had to have a driver   s license for this, I   d never  pass.     One of those motorized deals they got at Wal-Mart, she got on that. She  never did operate one.  43  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  Finchum  B. Branscum  H. Branscum  Finchum  I had never even seen one operated, how they operated it.  They   re electric.  I think Linda got a laugh out of me. She had to take a picture of me on it,  anyway.  Quite a ways from a tractor, huh?  Yes. (Laughter) Anyway, I   d never pass a driver   s test on that. (Laughs)  Well, if there   s nothing else, we thank you so much for sharing your  memories with us today.  You   re quite welcome.
