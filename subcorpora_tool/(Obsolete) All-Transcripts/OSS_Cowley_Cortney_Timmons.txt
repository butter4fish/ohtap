 Gill. Today is January 12, 2010, and I   m interviewing  Cortney Timmons Cowley on the Oklahoma State University campus in  Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project  in the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Cortney, thank you  for taking time off from your winter break to be with us today in  Stillwater.  Thank you for having me.  There are a lot of questions I want to ask you about OSU, in particular  about your scholarship career at Oklahoma State. First of all, though,  can you tell me a little bit about your early life, where you grew up,  about what you did in school, your parents and family?  Sure. I grew up in Ada, Oklahoma. I was born May 9, 1986, and I have  an older sister who graduated from OSU with a degree in advertising  and a younger brother who is currently at OSU-OKC getting his  paramedics license and getting his degree in firefighting. So, we   re all  very proud Oklahoma State fans. My mom is a junior high and high  school librarian, and my dad is Vice-President and Human Resource  Officer at Vision Bank in Ada. Throughout high school, my grandpa was  always   he was kind of a cowboy, one of the true cowboys. He was a  ranch manager and rode horses, and he plays the fiddle. So, I always  really looked up to him and would go out feeding his cattle with him,  really getting an appreciation for agriculture, and not only that, but the  resources that sustain agriculture, like water and land. So, then, once I  got into junior high and high school, I started doing science research  projects dealing with environmental sciences, and I was also an active  member and actually a state officer in FFA. So, those two things  combined led me to an overall appreciation of the environment and  5  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  agriculture, which is what brought me to OSU to eventually study  biosystems and agricultural engineering with an emphasis in  environment and natural resources.  What high school did you go to?  I attended Byng High School.  Can you tell us about some of your activities there?  I played basketball; I was on the varsity basketball team. I also, like I  said, was involved in FFA, where I competed in livestock shows. I  showed steers and heifers, and I even showed rabbits there for a little  while, (Laughter) and I actually did the best with the rabbits that I had. I  also, like I said, competed in science fairs and Oklahoma Junior  Academy of Science, where I was able to compete at the National Junior  Academy of Science in Washington, D.C. one year and the International  Science and Engineering fair. Those things   I think the combination of  playing basketball and competing in science fairs gave me a real thirst  for competition. (Laughter) I really like to compete, which when I came  to OSU I wasn   t good enough to play basketball, so I found myself  desiring other avenues such as academics, scholarships and even  competing in the science research competitions.  Cortney, before we get into your OSU experiences, I want to ask you,  what are some values or lessons you learned growing up? You shared  some of these, but are there some other values and lessons that you  learned growing up that helped shape your values and your life later?  Definitely. I spent a lot of time with my grandparents, and one thing I  always noticed about them was that they didn   t have more than an eighth  grade education but they always valued education. My parents and my  aunts and uncles all have college degrees. My grandparents made sure of  that, and they always supported us and everything we did. And another  thing I learned from them was hard work. From the time that I could lift  a hay bale, I was hauling hay. We had a wood heater at our house, so  every winter before it got cold we would go and chop wood and haul  wood, and I would always complain about it. My dad would tell me the  story about an ant and a grasshopper and how the grasshopper didn   t  prepare and the ant did. (Laughter) So, just really what hard work and  preparation can do for you and just being a woman and a girl growing  up, you always worry about what you   re wearing or material things, and  my mom would always tell me,    You don   t have to worry about what  people think of you. Just be yourself. Things like that don   t matter. It   s  what   s inside and it   s what you do for others that really matters.    I   ve  always been a sympathetic person and just the values of helping people,  6  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  people that maybe don   t have as much as you do, or even helping  others   like, I was always good in math, so if I could help one of my  friends in math and they could help me in another subject. To me, I was  never the smartest, but my parents and grandparents always told me that  you don   t have to be the smartest as long as you are willing to work hard  and do your best. Then, that   s what is really important.  Now, your older sister attended OSU before you?  Yes.  How far ahead of you was she in school?  She   s only a year ahead of me in school. We   re eleven months apart, so  we were always really close. That was a lot of fun when she came up  here, and we were able to     I guess, in addition to your FFA work, you were probably on campus for  events. So, did your sister coming to Oklahoma State influence you to  come to OSU as well?  The FFA was definitely a big reason for me to come up here. My sister  spent her first two years at East Central University in Ada. So, I guess I  was kind of the one that influenced her to come up here. (Laughter) She  came up here and just absolutely loved it, so she wished she had been up  here for all four years.  What state office did you hold in FFA?  I was the Southeast District Vice-President.  Fantastic. Do you remember when you came on campus as a student,  some of the first impressions of the OSU campus in Stillwater?  Yes. I don   t think I could have gone anywhere else but OSU and  survived, because I was so homesick my whole first year, (Laughter) and  the people that ended up   I mean, I was really sheltered my whole life,  and my parents always took care of everything. And, so, I was up here  all by myself and missed being home, even though I was only two hours  away. It seems kind of silly now. There were so many people at OSU  that just really cared about me, even as a freshman, you know. I hadn   t  done anything to deserve anyone   s notice or their special attention, but if  I ever needed anything, I knew there were certain people, even  professors, I could go to. And they just really took care and would tell  me I need to do this certain thing, like pay a bill or enroll in a class. How  do I do that? Everyone here is so friendly and so nice. They just really  7  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  care. Professors really care. They want to mentor you. They want you to  learn things to the best of your ability, and they want you to take those  things and go out and make a difference in the world. By the time I  graduated, there were so many relationships that developed, which is  why I love coming back here and seeing everyone.  I remember one instance exactly. Since I was a state officer, I couldn   t  attend classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Those were our FFA days,  and there was a class I was supposed to take my second semester,  biosystems engineering, that was on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I just  didn   t take it. The professor that taught that class   at the end of the  semester we were at a banquet, and he was kind of grilling me as to why  I wasn   t in his class. So, I started talking to him, (his name is Dr. Glenn  Brown) and I was really intimidated by him at first, but then we just got  to talking, and I told him about my background and competing in  science fairs and being involved in FFA. Then after the banquet he gets  up, and he   s like,    Cortney, come with me. There   s someone I want you  to meet.    We walk across the room, and that   s when I met Dr.  Robert   Graalman for the first time. Dr. Brown ended up being one of my  greatest mentors here at OSU. I worked on a research project under him,  and he wrote letters of recommendation for me. That was dead week,  and then the next week, finals week, I went and spoke to Dr. Graalman  in his office.  This was your     This was my freshman year.  Freshman year, second semester?  Yes.  Did you know what you wanted to major in when you first came to  Oklahoma State?  Yes.  So, did you just select a major and stay with it? What was that major?  My major was biosystems engineering.  Is that in the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology? But  you also took some classes in agriculture, as well?  Yes, I was able to be a part of both colleges. It   s funny because I came  to a science camp up here the summer after my sophomore year, and it  8  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  was an environmental science camp, and I had had an interest in   well,  even before that I came up here for a 4-H State Roundup my freshman  year in high school. I went on the tour for engineering, and we just so  happened to go to the biosystems engineering lab, and Dr. Marvin Stone  took me on a tour of the lab, and I loved it. Then the next summer when  I was up here for that camp, I met with the recruiter in biosystems  engineering, and she gave me a lot of information on it, and from then  on that   s what I wanted to do. I got here, and I started in biosystems  engineering and finished and never wanted to do anything else. One of  the greatest assets, I think, of what my major was, was the fact that I was  in the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources and in the  College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology. I could be a part  of any organization in both colleges. I had two wonderful deans that I  could pick their brains (Laughs) about different things and benefit from.  I was on the CEAT  College of Engineering, Architecture and  Technology  Student Council, and I did more in the College of  Engineering, but I still really valued being in the College of Ag as well.  You described earlier about resources on the farm and learning things  in the environment. Did that impact your decision to go into biosystems  engineering?  Yes, definitely. And I knew that I could do really anything, like  environmental science and the College of Ag or something like that, but  I always really admired engineers for their ability to analyze and solve  problems and to be able to build things and design systems, and I felt  like taking that avenue would be the way that I could really do more for  the agricultural industry and the environment.  Great, put a couple of loves together. You indicated your strength in  math and sciences, and then put your love of natural resources and the  environment     Yes, it was kind of the perfect marriage.  Just a natural fit for you.  Yes.  That   s great. You mentioned Dr. Brown and some of your other  professors, particularly, earlier in your career that influenced you and  supported you.  Are there any others  that you recall?  Yes, definitely. Dr. Brown was a huge supporter and mentor of mine,  and then I also worked with Dr. John Solie and one of his two PhD  students, Stewart Reed, on another project the year after I had done the  9  Gill  Cowley  first one with Dr. Brown. With both of those (those were Lew Wentz  Research Projects) I won the Wentz Research Scholarship, which is  given through the Department of Scholar Development. That was just a  great experience. To be able to do good research at a university level  was really important to me, and to be able to have that opportunity under  those two professors who I respected so much and who are respected in  our field nationally, it was quite an honor. And, of course, Dr. Graalman.  I can   t imagine my college experience without Dr. Graalman and Gail  Gillilan, his secretary in that office. Just between doing Wentz research  projects and studying abroad through that office and taking Dr.  Graalman   s class, which is Windows to the World, it just really opened  my eyes to all the possibilities that OSU has to offer a student away  from the classroom.  Dr. Graalman and Dean Reid in the College of Engineering, who I went  on a study abroad trip to Japan with because I was in CEAT Scholars,  and then Dr. Ed Miller, who I knew in high school because of his  involvement with FFA. He   s a very visible figure to a lot of really good  high school students across the state, including me, and I just always  looked up to him because he was so nice and he remembered so many  students    names, (Laughter) and I would just go talk to him. I remember  one day I didn   t know who else to go to, and I was trying to make this  big decision in my life, and I went in to Dr. Miller   s office and he got  this piece of paper and wrote down both the situations, the pros and  cons, (Laughter) and we made that decision right there. There were any  number of people at OSU that I could have done that with. Even people  like Jana Moore, who is the secretary in biosystems and ag engineering  support staff. She was like my mom here. There   s all kinds of people  like that that just really care about students.  Talk to me about some of your non-academic activities and your OSU  experiences: organizations, activities, experiences on campus.  Yes. Like I said, this may not sound like it goes, but it does. Whenever I  came to OSU after being involved in FFA my freshman year, I was fully  prepared to be involved in everything the college of ag has to offer, but I  met a guy, (who I   m now married to, who   s an OSU grad) and he had a  friend who was from his fraternity that was the President of the College  of Engineering, Architecture and Technology Student Council. So, the  very first day I was here I went to this club and society fair, and he just  took me by the hand, basically, and introduced me to the CEAT  Freshmen Council leaders, and really the rest is history because I ended  up being involved in not just CEAT Freshmen Council, but I was a  CEAT Ambassador and I was in CEAT Scholars, and then I eventually  was in CEAT Student Council. I actually served as the President of  CEAT Student Council. So, I just completely went with the College of  10  Gill  Cowley  Engineering route, which I don   t regret at all, because the year I was  fortunate enough to be President, our council won best engineering  council in the nation, and they also won again the next year, not because  of anything that I had done but just because CEAT Student Council just  gets better and better every year, and we were really benefitting off of  people who had kind of brought me up through those ranks.  Then I was also involved in Student Government Association when I  was a junior. One of my really good friends decided to run for SGA  Vice-President, and it was funny because on one of Dr. Graalman   s trips  that we had gone on, me and her and then the guy that ended up running  for President were on a train, and that   s when they started talking about  running for SGA President and Vice-President. We were discussing  strategies and things that they wanted to do, so I ended up helping with  their campaign. And I told them,    If you guys get elected, you should  form a recycling or some sort of sustainability committee through SGA.     They ended up getting elected and formed a recycling committee and  asked me if I would be the chair of it, and I was like,    Of course. I  wanted you to do this.     So, I was the Chair of the Recycling Committee which is now called the  Sustainability Committee under SGA, and that was kind of the avenue  that I was able to   I thought that if OSU was going to have something  like that, it needed to be under SGA so that it could have the funding and  the voice to really get things accomplished. That was also the summer  after I had won the Udall Scholarship and met a student from the  University of Missouri, and he told me about this tailgate recycling  program that they had started at the University of Missouri, and that was  my first initiative here as Chair of the Recycling Committee. I wanted to  do tailgate recycling at OSU football games. I had actually heard about  that before I met this student, because Dr. Graalman had graded his  Udall Scholarship application and when he got back told me,    This  student did this, and you really need to meet him and get to know him  and find out about this program.    Then we also did all kinds of other  things, but that was the main one.  Can you tell us a little bit about the recycling program, what it consisted  of and what were the components of that?  Yes. At the beginning of every home football game, we have volunteers  that come, and we meet about four or five hours before kickoff and pass  out green bags. We knew that the bags we passed out needed to have  some sort of distinguishing features so what better than green to promote  sustainable thinking. And, actually, the first year that I started it, it was  me and two volunteers. Two girls showed up for the first day. We went  around with these green bags, and we also made these little flyers that  11  Gill  Cowley  were quarter-sheet flyers that one side talked about our program, and the  other side talked about why you should recycle, the benefits of  recycling. So, the first year was just kind of to initiate it, and I really  wanted to educate people about the program and about recycling and  why it was important. It was really interesting. From the first year to the  second year it was just amazing at how many people caught on. Really  in the first year by the last game, people were looking for us, and  tailgaters were like,    Well, we were waiting for you to bring us our  bag.    If we didn   t get there soon enough they would have little piles of  aluminum cans and plastic bottles just sitting there ready for us. So, it  was really interesting, and the program is still going.  After we passed out the bags, we would just leave them out there, and  people would put their recyclables in the bags. And any time you have  alcohol involved, sometimes we get bags that are a little dirty. People  put trash in there, and we   d have to sort through it. So, after the game,  we would go pick up the bags, take them to a centralized location, sort  through them, get them all cleaned up   aluminum cans in bags, plastic  bottles in bags and glass bottles in bags   and we would take them to a  recycling center. Now, the last two years, they   ve taken the aluminum  cans to Habitat for Humanity for their Cans for Habitat program. So, we  don   t benefit from this program at all. The Sustainability Committee  doesn   t. That was one of the things that we really wanted to do, was to  use the cans to benefit someone else, and we   ve formed a great  partnership with Habitat for Humanity. One reason we wanted to do that  was because people know that they   re not just recycling, which is great  for the environment, but they   re also helping someone else by doing it.  It   s been a really great partnership, and people enjoy it.  So, from the first game the first year, from Cortney and two other  people, how much did you grow? How many people when you left were  involved in the program?  It was the three of us for quite awhile, and interesting enough, one of the  girls that was there is now the chair of the Sustainability Committee, and  she is also a Udall Scholar. That is just kind of a side note. By  Homecoming, I show up at Homecoming, and there were ten people  standing there. So, it was kind of the three of us all the way up to  Homecoming, and we   d have a few people show, but then I get to  Homecoming and there   s ten people standing there waiting to help,  which is kind of rare for a game like Homecoming, because usually we  don   t get as many volunteers because there   s so many activities. So,  then, for the rest of the season we didn   t get any more than twenty. Then  the next year one of my vice-chairs became the chair, and she had the  idea of including the PLC, President   s Leadership Council. So, they  would come and help us, and from that we would get a few students that  12  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  would stay on when they didn   t have to be there. Now, I think they  consistently have between fifteen and twenty volunteers, sometimes  more, especially if they have PLC helping them. It   s really grown, and I  think that it will hopefully continue to.   What were some of  your favorite hangouts on campus and off campus,  places to be, hangouts, stores, whatever? What did you enjoy most?  It really changed, my on-campus hangouts, from year to year. In the  beginning, I really liked the library and the fourth floor where it   s really  quiet, and then sometimes I really liked the Reading Room. My mom   s a  librarian, so I was always drawn to the library. I think it   s the most  beautiful building on campus, so I liked to sit in there and know that I  was in a really beautiful building, maybe. Then Ag Hall because in  biosystems engineering we have an undergraduate computer lab. So, I  spent a lot of time in there, just because I had access to computers and  printers, and all my friends from my major were always in there, and it   s  really close to some of the eating places on campus. So, in my later  years on campus, especially in my last year when I was working on the  senior design project, I called that my second home.  Off campus, I really did not have a typical college experience in terms of  off campus, because the night that I graduated was the first night I ever  went to the Strip or Eskimo Joe   s. (Laughter) And I know that   s really  sad.  Surely not  (Laughter) Come on, you   re kidding.  No, I   m not kidding. That was the first time. My fianc   at the time took  me, and we went to Eskimo Joe   s and to the Strip. I just never felt like I  had time, and so many other things were more important to me. But, my  favorite places were   there   s a new Japanese restaurant downtown. It   s  called Tokyo Pot, and I really like that place. It   s probably my favorite.  That and Bad Brad   s are my favorite eating places in Stillwater. I would  go to friends    houses and hang out. I mean, any time that I had to spend  and just hang out with people, my friends, I took full advantage of it.  And I love to go to sporting events, especially when my brother was  here. We did not miss a basketball or a football game, or even a soccer  game. (Laughs) So, I really liked going to the OSU sporting events. That  was really my fun. That was where I really had a good time.  What are a couple things that most people would not know about  Cortney Timmons Cowley? One of them, I think you said, that you never  went to the Strip until you graduated.  Yes, they wouldn   t know that I   m not a party animal. (Laughs)  13  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Are there a couple of things that people wouldn   t know about you?  Oh, that   s a good question. One of the things may be that   you know  everyone has a food that they just won   t eat or that they don   t like or that  they   re picky about. Well, my whole life I will eat anything. I really like  food, (Laughs) and I don   t know if that is a really unique not knowing  about me, but truly I am not a picky eater. Because people always   you  know, you go over to their house, and they try to cater to what you like,  and I   m just always like,    Really, you can feed me anything, and I will  put it away.    (Laughs) People that don   t know me may not know that I  have a miniature dachshund named Isabella. Well, she lives with my  parents, but she is like my    When I go home it   s like me-and-her time.  She   s really a horrible dog in terms of when other people are around.  She hates other people. She really likes me and my mom, and so I   m  definitely an animal lover. I don   t know. Surely there is something more  interesting about me that people wouldn   t know. I   m also very accident  prone. (Laughter) I am clumsy, and I have scars all over my legs to  prove it.  Well, Cortney, maybe we   ll change our conversation to talk a little more  about the Scholar Development and Recognition Program. You  participated in the program, including you competed for prestigious  scholarships like the Udall and Truman Scholarships, which is quite an  accomplishment and an honor. You gave a little bit earlier, but could  you share with us how you first learned about the Scholar Development  Program? Was that started with an introduction to Bob Graalman that  you were talking about earlier?  Yes, and I think before that, even, I knew about the Scholar  Development Program, because my freshman year was when Ashleigh  Hildebrand and Joel Halcomb won Gates Cambridge Scholarships. That  was a really big deal for not only a school to have one of those, but two  Gates Cambridge Scholars. So, I remember seeing that all over OSU  headlines and in the news and wondering and reading about Ashleigh  and Joel and just being so impressed by everything that they had  accomplished, and especially hearing about Joel   s story, about what he  came from to what he accomplished. It was really inspiring, and just  wanting to know how to be involved in something like that, how to  make my college experience that interesting and that inspiring and  knowing that they had done that through Scholar Development with Dr.  Graalman, and wanting to learn more about them and the things that they  experienced. I mean, how you could get a full-paid scholarship to go to  Cambridge, England, I thought that was really cool.  So, when Dr. Brown introduced me to Dr. Graalman, I had the  opportunity to speak with him and to learn about some of the other  14  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  former scholars that went through the program. It was really very  intimidating, (Laughs) because you don   t really think   I mean, the  whole way through, I never really thought that I could live up to what  some of the former scholars had done. I really looked up to Shannon  Ferrell and Chris Stephens, who are Truman Scholars. Chris was a  Marshall Scholar, too, so I was like,    There   s no way. If they did it,  there   s no way I could do it.    But then meeting with some of the former  scholars   and one person that I got to meet was Bart Fischer who was a  finalist for the Truman and the Marshall but actually didn   t win them,  and he was kind of the one that really   Chris Stephens and Kyle Jones,  who was a Pickering Scholar, really motivated me and said,    Yes. You  can do this. There   s no excuse. You at least have to try.     So, I thought it was really cool to be able to take who I was and what I  had done and put it on paper. I learned so much just about writing from  Dr. Graalman, and so it was interesting to kind of see the history of the  Scholar Development Program, what students had done and just finding  out through Dr. Graalman and others that I could be, kind of, put in that  same group.  So, after your intimidation factor, the old competitive side of Cortney  came out, right?  (Laughter) Yes, exactly.  Good. Well, can you share a little bit about some of the activities and  different components of the Scholar Program? For example, I guess you  weren   t a Freshman Scholar     No.     but then you were a Wentz Research Scholar your sophomore year,  and that was a Wentz Research Project that you did with Dr. Brown?  Yes.  Could you tell me different components of that? Coaching, the  application process. Then we   ll talk specifically about the two  scholarships that you won, but generally could you just share with us a  little bit about the different activities and components and parts of the  Scholar Program?  Sure. With the Wentz Research Scholarship, specifically   well, there   s  also a Wentz Leadership Scholarship that I got my last year here. With  these processes, they send the applications in the early part of the spring  semester, and they   re due by February. Or they may send them out in the  15  Gill  Cowley  Gill  fall semester, but you fill out an application for the Leadership Scholar.  It   s very basic. You write an essay and fill out information about  yourself. For the research scholarship, each student is expected to come  up with an idea for research and then find a mentor or professor who can  help you and mentor you and find the resources you need to complete  that project. They actually encourage you to go outside of your field and  maybe work with another professor or in another field and get a new  experience. So, after you   ve found your professor, you write a proposal,  and I always found the process very scientific. I thought that I was really  doing something, writing a proposal for a research grant, so it kind of  teaches you that process. Then you submit your application, and once  you receive it, you get money to work on this research project for the  whole next year with your mentor. Then you have to submit a middle-of-the-  year report on what your progress is. The next April, you develop a  poster of all your research and your findings, and you present it at Wentz  Research Scholars Day. That   s a place where everyone comes together,  and you get to present your research, and it kind of took me back to my  old science fair days, (Laughs) so I really enjoyed it.  This is through the Scholar Development Office?  Yes. And then some of the other programs that they have   Dr.  Graalman developed a program, I think, alongside Blaine Greteman who  was the first Rhodes Scholar at OSU, to where they could take a group  of OSU students over to the UK  United Kingdom  every year. It started  out at Oxford, and then they moved the program to Cambridge. That was  always a great experience. My first year we spent two weeks in  Cambridge, England, studying seventeenth century English news books.  So, for an engineering major it was a lot of   because, actually in high  school, my best subject was always literature and grammar, English,  things like that. That   s why they always sent me to scholastic meets, at  least. So, I really enjoyed getting back into those sorts of things, being a  little more well rounded and learning literature, humanities and getting  back to writing.  Then the next year we studied biology, James Joyce and the Irish  Revolution. I just remember we studied James Joyce and things like  Darwin and evolution and comparing that to James Joyce and some of  his writings, if he was influenced by Darwin and his ways of thinking.  So, we spent two weeks in Cambridge, England, and then one week in  Dublin, Ireland, since that   s where James Joyce is from. Every year they  come up with a new and exciting program like that through the Scholar  Development Office.  Going back to your research, what was the title and the subject content  of your research in those couple of years?  16  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  The first Wentz project that I did was over the impacts of human land  uses on soil microbial populations. Well, it was the impacts of human  land use and soil structure on soil microbial populations. So, I took soil  samples in five different types of land-use areas like residential,  agricultural, forestry, native grass prairie and industrial, I think. Then I  would analyze the soil. Take soil samples from macro pore structures in  the soil matrix, then analyze them and see the chemical and physical  composition of the soil. I would also analyze the microbial populations  of them to see how, basically, humans impact the overall soil  environment and how they impact soil microbial populations as an  indicator of environmental degradation or things like that.  Then the next year for my project I used a wireless sensor attached to a  cow   s tail to study if   you can use a wireless sensor to identify bovine  urination and defecation, basically. Every time I tell someone about this  project, I feel like they probably think that I   m crazy, but nonpoint  source pollution from cattle in an open range is a big deal. In Congress  they always talk about confined animal feeding operations and pigs and  cattle and chickens and how they impact the environment, but those are  all point source, and I feel like the bigger issue to me is the nonpoint  sources from cattle in the open range. So, they had already developed  these sensors in biosystems engineering and were using them for other  things. One of the PhD students was putting them on halters to identify  grazing and patterns like that for his thesis and dissertation. So, I was  like,    Well, how about I put the insert on the other end and see.    So, that  combined with GPS and other technology. If you know exactly where  the deposits are occurring and what   s going on, that would give an  agriculturist a way to put best management practices or other  environmental structures up to help control nonpoint source pollution in  surface water.  Interesting, Cortney. I didn   t know     Yes, (Laughs) maybe that   s the interesting thing about me.  Did you take honors classes and work in the honors program at all?  I was not in the Honors College which, looking back, I wish I would  have at least tried it or enrolled in it at first and tried it, because I think  that it is so beneficial to the students who are in it. The one Honors  College class that I took was Windows to the World with Dr. Graalman  through the Scholar Development Program, and that class was just an  open   every day we would talk about a different national scholarship. It  was one day a week. Then two students would come in with a current  event and give a presentation, and the entire class would debate about it.  It was a class to teach us to understand current events and actually seek  17  Gill  Cowley  current events out through reading reputable news sources and then  developing opinions on them, then be able to voice our opinions  eloquently and debate with other people. So, it was interesting, and it  helped me so much, especially preparing for my Truman Scholarship  interview and being able to think on my feet.  Can we move into those scholarships a little bit? You won the Truman  Scholarship first. Could we talk about the process and how some of  these things   you talked about the Windows to the World class and some  of the coaching the faculty did, learning how to write, your essays and  your research program, how that came together. Could you start with  the Truman and what was the process?  Yes. To begin with, the Scholar Development Office comes out with a  Truman Scholarship application, which is a lot like the actual Truman  Scholarship application from the Truman Foundation, but it   s a little  shorter. So, you fill that out all on your own, pretty much, and I can   t  remember if we had to have letters of recommendation or not, but then  you submit that to Dr. Graalman   s office in Scholar Development, and  they review it and pick finalists. From the application process they select  finalists to be interviewed by a panel that includes Dr. Graalman and  then a representative faculty member from every college. So, I was  lucky enough to make it to the interview for OSU, and then I think there  were six of us that interviewed my year. So, we go into a room, and  there   s a thirty-minute interview where all of the faculty members ask  you questions about your application, current events and then just really  anything else that they feel like.  Then after that interview process, Dr. Graalman notifies those of us who  are OSU nominees. For any of these scholarships, you have to be  nominated by your university. So, after that, there were three of us that  were nominated from OSU, and we immediately started the application  process, which it should be fairly easy for most people, but for me with  the Truman Scholarship, it   s a little different, because with most  scholarship applications you have to write a personal statement,  something about you, and actually the Udall is a little different, too. But  for the Truman Scholarship you have to write a policy statement, where  you are a writing a letter to a Congressional person or someone in the  government, and you   re writing about an issue. You tell about the  problem, and then you tell them what you think should be done about it  and then any major obstacles that may come into contact. So, the whole  Truman application is just about things that you care about. They ask,     What do you think is the biggest issue facing the world today?     basically.    Tell us about your greatest leadership accomplishment.        Tell us about your greatest service commitment, the greatest  commitment that you have to community service.    And, so, it   s all  18  Gill  Cowley  leadership and community service, and the policy statement is really  important, and it   s all online, too, with the Truman Scholarship. Then  you submit that to the Truman Foundation.  Through the whole process, I would write an essay, either the small ones  or the big policy statement, and then submit it to Dr. Graalman, and he  would mark it up, and anytime I would submit something to him, I  would always go to his office to pick it up, because not only would he  need to mark it up, but we would discuss it and talk about   he would  want to know what I was thinking when I was writing it, basically. So, it  was really good, because he didn   t just give me back a paper where he  had marked it all up, but we would talk about what needed to be done,  how it could be better and how I could get my ideas out there more  clearly. To me, even if I hadn   t won any scholarships, that was so  beneficial to me as a person, because I think written and oral  communication are so important in whatever job or career you have and  whatever you   re doing. That was really an interesting part of the process.  And then when you   re through, then you submit it online?  Yes, online, and then they send the finalists an email, and they send non-finalists  an email. I remember when I got the email, because I was  expecting to get a letter, and I didn   t think that we would get an email. I  didn   t know how they would notify you, so I had to read it a bunch of  times, because I didn   t really believe it at first. (Laughter) I was in the  lab working on one of my Wentz projects, and I had to run and get one  of my friends that was in there and have them read it just to make sure I  wasn   t imagining things. Then, of course, I called Dr. Graalman. So,  after that, there is so much more work to be done, because they notify  you, I believe, on the first of February, and then you just have so many  weeks to prepare for your interview. I had already been preparing, just in  case. I was reading The Wall Street Journal and The Economist and  catching up on my current events and making sure I knew everything  about my policy statement that there was possible to know, preparing for  any question that they could ask me. Also, Dr. Graalman sets up a panel  of interviewers so that I could practice. Quite honestly, the practice  interview that I had was much harder than the real interview that I had  with the Truman Scholarship committee. So, I felt like they really  prepared me for the interview really well. I went to Denver for my  interview.  Actually, my year we had two finalists from OSU, so we both went  together to Denver for the interview at the Tenth District Court of  Appeals. When you   re in there, they had us downstairs in this big room  where all the candidates sat, and the first person goes and even after they  go, they can   t leave until everyone is done. All the finalists are just  19  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  sitting in this holding room thinking about what   s to come. I was the  second-to-last person to interview the whole day. (Laughs) Looking  back, it   s really kind of funny, because the person that goes two before  you comes down and to send you up, and you get in this little bitty  elevator, go up to the next floor and walk down this really long dark hall  and sit in this little chair outside of the interview room. (Laughs)  Kind of like being at the principal   s office.  Yes. The person before me came out, and she was from OBU,   Oklahoma Baptist University  and Fred Slabach, who   s the Executive  Secretary of the Truman Foundation, said,    You just wait here. We   ll be  with you in a minute.    So, they were really serious, and you go in, and  they   re all sitting at this really big, long table, and you   re at the very end  of it.  How many were there?  There were five on our committee. On most Truman Scholarship  committees at the regions where you interview, there are six or seven, so  we had a little bit smaller one. The committee members   one of them  was the Judge of the Tenth District Court of Appeals, and there are  college professors and the Executive Secretary, former Truman  Scholars. You never know who you   re going to have on your committee.  So, you just compete against other people in your region. That   s the only  level?  Yes.  You don   t go to the national level?  Yes, my region was Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, and each region  selects   if there   s a candidate that is worthy of receiving the Truman  Scholarship, they try to pick one from each state, and then they pick so  many. I believe they pick fifty,  one  from each state, and then fifteen at-large  positions.  Did you know on that day? Before you left, did they notify you?  No. Well, all the panel comes back into the room with all the finalists,  and they say, I mean, you know, that they   ve selected. They tell you that  they   re very happy with the people that they selected, but they want all  of us to know that we   re winners, basically. Then later they   it was  Spring Break, and they notify your faculty representative, which is Dr.  Graalman, or Dr. Graalman   s counterparts all over the nation. At OSU  20  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  they like to surprise us. Most schools I don   t think do that. Most schools  just bring them into their faculty representative   s office, and they tell  them. Here, they like to make it a big production. (Laughs) I was here  for Spring Break working on my Wentz project, and Jana Moore, the  secretary in biosystems, calls me one day, and she   s like,    We need a  picture of you and your mentor for your Wentz project for our BAE   Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering  newsletter.    And, so, she   s  like,    You need to dress nice tomorrow and come ready to take this  picture.     The next day I went, and my mom just so happened to be in Stillwater.  (Laughter) And it was funny, because since I was here for Spring Break,  a long time before that she had said she wanted to come spend some  time up here, because she wasn   t going to get to see me. She just so  happened to be here, but she knew by that point, so she was going to be  there. So, I go to Ag Hall. I was over in the BAE lab, and me and my  mentor go over to Ag Hall, and she takes the picture. It was funny,  because she was trying to get me over to the Dean   s conference room,  and I was like,    Hey, why don   t we go to the Dean   s conference room,     because it   s really pretty in there, and I thought it would be a great place  for a picture. She was like,    Yes, let   s do that     So, we go over to the  Dean   s conference room, and she opens the door, and I come around the  door, and there   s Burns Hargis standing right there.  The President of the University.  Then I walk in a little further, and I see all these other people: deans, my  mom, support staff and my department head and professors.  I bet by then you had a pretty good clue.  Yes, then my heart   s beating pretty fast, and Burns Hargis says,    On  behalf of the entire OSU system, we   d like to congratulate you on being  named OSU   s fifteenth Truman Scholar.    So, that was really neat. It   s  interesting how they do these surprises. It   s always a lot of fun.  How did you decide which scholarships to pursue, because there are  several prestigious scholarships, and you pursued those two? How did  you decide on that as opposed to Gates Cambridge or something else?  Well, when I took the Windows to the World class with Dr. Graalman,  on the very first day he talks about the different types of scholarships.  There   s the Truman, the Udall, which are the leadership ones, and then  the Gates Cambridge, Marshall, Rhodes, which are the more academic  scholarships. I kind of already knew I would lean more towards the  leadership. He described it as,    If there   s something going on at campus,  21  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  like a rally or a protest or an assembly going on, and you   re the type of  person that will grab your sign and go down there and be right down  there with them, protesting the cause and just right in the middle of the  action, then you   d be the type of person that would apply for a Truman  or Udall Scholarship. But, if you   re the type of person that would be the  type to sit back and think about the issue or read about it and analyze it  on your own to understand it and then maybe  have  a casual, quiet  debate, then you   d be the type that would apply for the Marshall or the  Gates Cambridge or the more scholarly ones.    I was like,    I am  definitely the person that would grab my sign and go down there and be  right in the middle of the action.     I actually, my last year here   I guess just after the success of the Udall  and the Truman, we thought, well maybe I should just go ahead and try  for a Gates Cambridge or a Marshall. I did apply for those but wasn   t as  successful. But I believe everything happens for a reason, and I ended up  at Colorado State, and I   m very happy there. I did actually also apply for  a National Science Foundation Fellowship and was fortunate enough to  obtain one of those, so I was very happy that I was at least able to pay  for grad school.  Were you surprised at your success in competing at these national and  international prestigious scholarships?  I was, because the process is so long. I felt really fortunate just to be  nominated from OSU, because there were so many students that   of all  the students that applied, I respected them all and knew that they had  done great things. Then just to make it out of OSU and then to be named  a finalist   because I knew that it   s   I think that 12,000 students across  the nation apply for the Truman Scholarship, at least last year. Then they  knock that down to 200 finalists. Just in the numbers game (I   ve always  been interested in statistics) I was like,    Statistically, this isn   t very  likely.    (Laughs)  The final selection number is how many?  Sixty-five. They select sixty-five Truman Scholars, so I wasn   t sure. I  thought that my policy statement was very unique and it was what I truly  believed in and was really passionate about. So, I thought that maybe  someone may not agree with me, or just in terms of the numbers, I didn   t  feel very good about it. Kind of like everything. I knew that I was going  to go in there and do my best and prepare as much as I could and not  have any regrets. I feel like I was lucky. I mean, I think that there   s a  little luck that goes into it and that there were   I couldn   t have done it  without Dr. Graalman and so many people helping me. I am very  thankful, because I know how important letters of recommendation are.  22  Gill  Cowley  Gill  I never read a letter of recommendation that anyone wrote for me, but  knowing how important they are, I am very thankful for those who did. I  didn   t really know what to think, but after going through the process, I  feel     Cortney, let me ask you a different kind of question. You   ve indicated  that there   s a couple of scholarships you applied for that you were not  successful with. What about students that competed unsuccessfully for  scholarships? What do you tell them? Do they still benefit from being in  the Scholars Program? If so, how?  Oh, definitely. Just getting the opportunity to work with Dr. Graalman  one-on-one will help you, no matter who you are or what you do. Once  you apply for a scholarship, maybe that   s the first thing that you do in  Scholar Development. Usually a professor will identify a student that is  exceptional and recommend them to Dr. Graalman. Maybe if the first  thing you do is apply for a scholarship, then after that, Dr. Graalman and  Gail will know who you are and are able to tell you about all the other  programs that they have, like studying abroad or applying for a Wentz  Research Project. The process in general   a lot of students that apply  for these scholarships are probably going to go on to grad school,  especially if it   s a Truman or a Gates Cambridge or a Marshall.  Applying for graduate school was so easy to me, because I had already  thought about everything that I had done through these projects and  learned to write well. I had written personal statements for the Marshall  and the Gates Cambridge scholarship, and I needed personal statements  for my graduate school applications.  It   s kind of like I told Savannah Smith, who was a Udall Scholarship the  year after I was. When I approached her I said,    You should really think  about applying for a Udall Scholarship.    She was like,    No, I would  never win that. I just don   t feel like I have the credentials.    So, I said,     Trust me. You do, and even if you don   t win the scholarship, it   s worth  it enough just to know Dr. Graalman, to have that closer relationship  with your professors that you develop through needing them to write a  letter of recommendation for you, and working with them on that, you  develop such a great relationship with those professors. It   s well worth  it.    So, she applied and ended up winning the scholarship. I always tell  people,    You   ll never get a scholarship if you don   t apply for it.    With  all the benefits of just applying, it   s completely worth it.  I   d like to talk about the program and your perspective on that and  where you see it going. From your unique perspective, having been  involved in it closely, what do you feel are the strengths of the Scholar  Program at Oklahoma State? And you   ve probably had the chance to  talk to a lot of other participants at other schools and find out about  23  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  their programs. How do you think OSU rates, and what do you think are  the strengths?  I definitely think that it   s one of the greatest programs in the nation,  because I know that Dr. Graalman and a faculty advisor from the  University of Arkansas and some others, I   m sure, were very  instrumental in forming NAFTA, which is the National Association of  Faculty Advisors  NAFA, National Association of Fellowships  Advisors . Just from that, from Dr. Graalman being so involved in that,  and they have a whole listserv, so he is able to not just tell other people  about what we do, but learn from other people and what works for them  and what could work for us. That was something that even I learned was  really important just from being involved in SGA and learning from a  student at the University of Missouri. So, I think that is definitely a  strength, that Dr. Graalman is so willing to be out there and know people  who are his counterparts and interact with them and exchange ideas. I  think we benefit a lot from that. I   m sure other schools have benefitted a  lot from Dr. Graalman telling them about what we do.  I think that the greatest strength of our Scholar Development Program is  the way that they work with faculty and professors and the way they  involve faculty, because as great as Dr. Graalman is and for as much as  he does, he knows that he can   t do it alone, and he knows that there   s so  many other people out there that can help students, and that their ideas  and how they can benefit students are important, too. So, he goes a long  way, with the Wentz Program, and even asking faculty to come over to  Cambridge and teach the classes that they do and with the Freshman  Research Program, just involving them in a way that they feel like they  are so important and that they can really make a difference in students     lives. Just to have that benefits so many students in such a big way. The  innovativeness and the other strength, I think, is the fact that he is not  afraid to try new things. Like with the Cambridge experience for  students. He started that. That would be a pretty difficult thing, I feel  like, to start. Kind of intimidating, but to try it then get other people, like  donors and sponsors, involved I think is a great strength.  How important is the research component, the Wentz Research  Program, to developing successful candidates?  I think it   s really important, because, for instance on my Udall   not so  much important for maybe the Truman scholarship, but for all the others,  I think it   s very valuable and almost necessary, completely necessary,  because at least on the Udall application there is an essay where you  have to write about your research experience and what you   ve done. It   s  something that is very scholarly to do. So, in terms of the Gates  Cambridge and Rhodes and Marshall, they like to see that you   ve  24  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  pursued out-of-the-classroom scholarly activities, and research is the  best thing that you can do for that. It gets you to where you can find a  problem or objective and develop your own way of solving it.  It also helps your relationships with the professors.  Yes, definitely.  How can it be improved? It   s good; how can it be even better? Are there  some things you see that we could do to enhance the program?  I think that while the program reaches a lot of students   I wouldn   t say  a weakness is the number of students that we reach, because I think that  with the Wentz programs, the office reaches tons of students. But, if  there were other programs that maybe could get other students involved.  Maybe they   re not interested in research, but there   s something else that  they could do that would motivate them or inspire them to get going,  solve a problem, kind of like the Creativity Initiative did. Something like  that. Maybe partner with the Creativity Initiative. That would be  something that would be really good to think about. I think that the  Henry Bellmon Endowment has been really good, because I think it   s a  way that Dr. Graalman could make sure that once he   s gone, which  would be a very sad day, the program still continues on and still keeps  going. I think that   s very important.  What would be critical for the Scholar Program   s continued success?  Well, of course, financial backing is very important, especially after  we   ve seen how the economy can go up and down. But I think that  they   ve taken great strides to take care of that. One thing that I tried to  do while I was here, since I had already won a couple of scholarships, I  felt like it was kind of my duty to help other students who are pursuing  scholarships. So, maybe a scholar mentor program, kind of like Kyle  Jones did for me. He helped me. Whenever I was applying for my first  Wentz scholarship he gave me some example proposals, like what he  had written or other people had written. So, maybe a scholar mentor  program would help, because students know students. And maybe a  scholar who is involved with something with other people, like I was  with the two Udall scholars after me. I could see potential in them that a  professor in the classroom couldn   t, because I was in outside activities  with them, and we were doing extracurricular things and not classroom  work together, because one of them was two years younger and the other  was in a different major. I think that to get scholars involved who have  been successful to kind of expand, help other students who they think  may also be successful or benefit from a program in Scholar  Development. That was something that I felt really strongly about.  25  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  How has your participation in the Scholars Program influenced your  life?  Oh. (Laughs) It has influenced my life a lot. If it hadn   t been for it, I  probably wouldn   t be in graduate school right now, because I just, one,  found ways to pay for graduate school. I don   t know how else I would  have paid for it without going back to work and maybe working while I  was going to graduate school. It enriched my undergraduate experience  so much just by the research activities and just making me an all-around  more informed and better person with an emphasis on knowing what   s  going on in the world around me and really caring what is going on in  the world around me, and knowing about things like seventeenth century  news books and James Joyce and having all of these different  opportunities that I could pull from to take with me after I graduate and  in my future career that I can look back on and remember what I learned  that may impact some sort of situation that I   m in or problem that I   m  trying to solve. I think it just went a long way in enriching my education  and making me more well rounded.  You mentioned Colorado State. You   re working on your master   s now?  Yes.  Can you share just briefly about why Colorado State, what you   re  majoring in, what research you   re doing?  Yes. I am majoring in civil and environmental engineering and, actually,  when I was looking at graduate schools, I didn   t think about Colorado  State until one of my professors said,    You know, for what your  interests are, you might want to look at Colorado State and think about  going there.    So, I got to noticing that a lot of my professors in  biosystems engineering had civil engineering degrees from Colorado  State, a lot of professors that I really respected and felt like were  excellent teachers and researchers. So, I did. I looked into it and found  that for what I wanted to do, environmental engineering work,  specifically dealing with water and energy and things like that, Colorado  State is one of the top programs in the nation. They are also a land-grant  university, which has always been very important to me. I won   t go to a  university for an education that is not a land-grant university that has its  core values in agriculture and educating the masses. Since that was a  priority and I knew that Colorado State was one of the top universities in  the nation and they   re considered the    green    university, (they have a  high emphasis on sustainability) I thought that I could learn a lot from  them and how they do things. My research there deals with emerging  contaminants, which are things like pharmaceuticals, antibiotics,  steroids, hormones and personal care products.  26  Gill  Cowley  Colorado State is interesting because it   s a very arid state, which I never  thought about it as that before, and they   re a water source for a lot of  other states like California, Nevada   with high populations   Arizona,  because the Colorado River starts there. They have a lot of issues with  water quality and quantity, so I   m doing a full watershed analysis on the  river, (it   s called the Poudre River) and trying to identify the sources and  transport mechanisms of these new emerging contaminants that they   re  finding in the water. Then once we find that, ways to help mitigate and  control them and if they   re really a bad thing. I mean, do they really  impact people   s health, or are they that bad for the environment? So,  trying to study that and figure out those things. The watershed that I   m  studying is interesting, because since it is an arid climate and it   s in the  foothills, it starts in a very pristine area up in the mountains near the  Continental Divide. Its basic source is snow melt, and then it flows  down through Fort Collins where it gets urban impacts, and through a  predominantly agricultural area and then through another city before it  goes into the South Platte River, which is a big source for water in  Nebraska and Kansas for agriculturists. Identifying ways that different  land uses and landscapes impact the water and what the sources are and  then, of course, since there are no tributaries, all of the diversions and  inlets to the river are from irrigation ditches and agriculture. The  hypothesis is that the irrigation ditches are the transport mechanisms for  these contaminants, so that is what I am trying to figure out, if that   s  true.  I know you   re trying to get your master   s finished, but what are you  thinking academically? Are you interested in pursuing your PhD, and  are you thinking about where and your subject matter?  Yes, I would actually like to pursue a PhD, and I would like to come  back here to do it, and a big reason for that is, one, it   s really practical,  because my husband is getting his degree in equine science at CSU, and  he hopes to come back to Oklahoma. He has an internship with Lazy E  Ranch this summer, and he would like for that to maybe turn into a full-time  position. I want to be back in Oklahoma someday, anyway, so if he  is going to do that, then I was like,    Well, I   ll just go back and get my  PhD at OSU.    I would like to get my PhD in either agricultural  economics or environmental science. I like the PhD program in  environmental science here, because it   s interdisciplinary and it pulls  from a lot of different departments, and I think that   s interesting. Or  agricultural economics, because when I was here I actually took quite a  few ag econ classes, just because I thought it was interesting, and I think  it   s important to not only know the science and engineering behind  problems but also with the money issues and the economics behind  them. (Laughter) I think that in terms of what I really want to do, an  economics degree would help me more than anything.  27  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Would you see yourself in an academic road, teaching or in business  and industry? Have you thought that part out?  Well, I think that one day I would like to come back to teach, which is  one reason why I   d like to get my PhD, but I think that for my  experience, my best professors were the ones that had some sort of  experience outside the academic world. I know for sure, after I use my  Truman Scholarship (I haven   t used it yet) I have to work in public  service for four to seven years, which is a stipulation. I feel like I would  do that anyway, just because I think public service is very important. So,  I hope to maybe work at the state level, maybe in government or some  avenue like that, maybe the Department of Agriculture or something in  the environmental area.  So, you would use your Truman Scholarship for your PhD studies?  Yes.  Did you use the Udall for your master   s program?  Udall is actually an undergraduate scholarship, so I was able to use that  in undergrad.  Oh, okay great. Priorities in your life   what   s important to you?  Well, I guess I missed this back with my parents and grandparents. One  thing that   s very important to me is my faith. Of course, living in the  Bible Belt, I guess it would sound like that   s what everyone would say. I  mean, it really is. I grew up in a church called Church of God of  Prophecy which is very small. It was very close, everyone from the  babies to the elders of the church, and I learned a lot from them. Since I  went up to Colorado State, that was one thing that was a priority was  finding a church and people to fellowship with. I just so happened to get  involved with a student organization there called Chi Alpha Student  Ministries, which is affiliated with the Assembly of God Church. So,  just making that a priority and learning how to use my leadership skills  in that area to help administer to other people, so that is something that   s  been very important to me.  Family   I mean, I love my family. My husband and I, we took the  whole break to stay here, because we wanted to spend as much time with  our families as we could. My grandparents are getting older, so just  being over there. I spent the night with them, and just hanging out. My  grandpa gave my husband his fiddle, because he   s learning to play the  fiddle, and he said he   s getting too old and he   s got arthritis, which he  played it for us. Like I said, faith, family and education. I think that one  28  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  of the greatest things that we can do for ourselves is educate, lifelong  learning and always learning new things.  Picking up on some of your comments, is it too early to think about what  you hope to accomplish with your life? The legacy you   d like to leave?  That   s a really good question. (Laughs)  A Truman Scholarship question. (Laughter)  That   s a question I   d like to ask a lot of people. I mean, to me, I   ve  talked about this before. My husband and I, we grew up and didn   t have  a lot of money growing up, and that never   I was always happy. I didn   t  know my parents didn   t have a lot of money. I thought that we were just  fine. I played outside a lot, and so I know that money won   t be a source  of happiness. I thought,    What will? What is my life goal?    I think that I  want to somehow improve   I mean, I talk a lot about the environment  and agriculture, but I really do want to make a difference in that. I   ve  struggled with it a little bit, because that   s a huge issue, nationwide,  worldwide. How can one person really make that big of a difference? It  takes a lot of people. I want to be one in a lot of people that make a  difference and make agriculture more environmentally sustainable but in  ways that are also good for agriculturists. I don   t want to shut people  down. I want to build them up and not only make them more sustainable  but more productive, and make it better for everyone. I don   t know if I   ll  leave that big of a legacy. I don   t know if that will ever be attributed to  me, but I want to be a part of that, to make a difference in that area.  Looking back, what are some of your favorite OSU memories? People,  places, times. Obviously, it   s not the Strip. (Laughter)  Well, some people may not really remember all their times there. When  I was in Dean Reid   s CEAT Scholars class, when we were preparing to  go to Japan, that class was always on Tuesday nights. At the end of  class, Dean Reid said,    Okay, who doesn   t have season  basketball   tickets?    So, I raised my hand, and this guy that I was sitting by raised  his hand. So, he handed us tickets to the game that night, because it was  really icy outside, and him and his wife didn   t want to go. I knew I  couldn   t drive because it was really icy, so I walked from my house,  which was way down on South Jefferson, all the way to Farmhouse  where this other guy  who  was going,  lived  and then we walked to the  gym, and it was all in ice and snow, and it was ridiculous. I fell a couple  times, but finally got there. It was the night that OSU played Texas, and  Kevin Durant was on Texas, and Dean Reid   s seats are right behind the  press box, like center court, third row up on the second level. I mean,  you can hear the coaches. Great seats. It was the game where it went into  29  Gill  Cowley  triple overtime. Byron Eaton hit the really amazing shot. That was a  great memory of mine, because we ended up beating Texas, and I was in  really good seats. So, that was kind of cool. Usually, it   s pretty hard to  get seats as a student, because you really have to fight for them.  I think that I really treasure all of my study-abroad experiences, but  especially the first time I went to England, and one of my friends that  was on that trip, Emilee Lehenbauer, who was actually SGA President a  couple of years ago, she knew a family that lived at the Air Force base in  Ely, which is about fifty minutes from Cambridge. So, we take the train  to this house, the two of us and three other students, because these  people had a car that they were going to let us borrow. (Laughs) We  wanted to go to Edinburgh, Scotland. We take this car, which the  steering wheel is on the other side, you drive on the other side of the  road, and nobody else would drive but me. (Laughter) It   s supposed to  be a six- to eight-hour drive to Edinburgh, and it ends up being like a  ten- to twelve-hour drive, because we took this really big detour through  the countryside and finally ended up there and stayed in a youth hostel  that was really kind of creepy. It was so much fun driving randomly  through the English countryside and spending time in Edinburgh and  seeing the sights. Also, the two weeks that that weekend was in between,  getting to learn so much and make relationships with really great OSU  students and scholars, so that was pretty entertaining.  Cortney, last question. You might have partially already answered  earlier. How do you hope OSU people will remember you?  I know that people that don   t know me may remember that I won the  Udall and Truman scholarship, but I hope that people that actually knew  me remember that,    She not only won those scholarships, but she was a  really nice person and didn   t let it go to her head and was humble about  it, really cared about not what that did for her but what that did for the  University.    Because I always looked at it as this scholarship is not only  great for me, but I think it   s great that by me winning this scholarship, it  shows that OSU is that great of an institution, that we are a Truman  Honor institution. Students here excel in national scholarship  competitions. We get a good enough education and have that many  opportunities that we compete with the Princetons and the Yales and the  other Ivy League schools whenever we want. (Laughs) I think that was  always really cool to me, because I didn   t want to go anywhere else for  undergrad, and I always thought that OSU was the greatest school there  is, and we are up there with the best, even if the  U.S. News and  World  Report rankings don   t say it, or whatever that is. I just hope that other  people can look, maybe, at the things that I   ve done and be really proud  to be here and know how great OSU is and that they can do the same  things.  30  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Gill  Cowley  Cortney, what have we left out?  Oh goodness, those were some really good questions.  Is there anything else that you   d like to add or something that we missed  that would be important to know?  Oh, goodness. I know that once I walk out of here, I will definitely think  of something, but that was great. (Laughs)  Well, I appreciate very much you taking time to do this, and your Alma  Mater is proud of you, as well.  Well, thank you.  And I know you   re going to maintain your alumni membership, right?  Yes. (Laughs) Exactly. I went to some of the basketball games in  Denver, with the Denver Alumni Association down there, so that was a  lot of fun. It   s nice to be able to know that wherever you go, there   s  always going to be a group of OSU alumni that you can hang out with.  That orange ball is going to follow you around, right?  Yes. (Laughs)  Thanks, Cortney. Appreciate it very much.  Thank you.  -------  -------
