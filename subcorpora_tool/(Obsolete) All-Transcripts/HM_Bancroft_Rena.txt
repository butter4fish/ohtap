Speaker 1: My name is Loretta Henry.  I'm doing the interview.  Scott Stearns is doing our camerawork.  Could you please tell me your full name, first, middle and last name and spell them for us please?
Speaker 2: All right.  My first name is Rena, R-E-N-A.  My middle name is Ercelle, E-R-C-E-L-L-E.  My maiden name is Merritt, M-E-R-R-I-T-T and my name now is Bancroft, B as in boy, A-N-C-R-O-F-T [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft].  I usually sign it Rena M. Bancroft, sometimes Rena Merritt Bancroft.
Speaker 1: You have an interesting middle name, is it a family name?
Speaker 2: Ercelle?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was named by a woman who came to visit in Clinton [North Carolina] when my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] was pregnant--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: She and my father [William Merritt, Sr.] lived next door to one of my father's friends, who had a daughter who lived in Syracuse [New York].  And Aunt Rena [Rena Hawkins] brought Ercelle Harmon [Ercelle Harmon Moore], who was a social worker in Buffalo [New York], down to North Carolina for a vacation.  And my father liked Ms. Harmon.  So when I was born, he sent my sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell]--no he wasn't there when Mama started labor.  Mama was home and my s- Papa was at a meeting so he--she sent my sister who is like two and a half not quite three over to get Aunt Rena.  Aunt Rena jumped over the back fence (laughter) and when the doctor got there, he had to get her fixed and then deliver me.  So my father, when he arrived later that evening decided she needed to have the right to name me.  She did.  She named me Rena for her.  And Papa said, "What was that girl's name that came down here from Buffalo?" And she told him, he said well that's what we'll call the middle name.
Speaker 1: Oh what a good story.
Speaker 2: Well it's a better one.  Want me to tell the rest?
Speaker 1: Oh there's a--oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Aunt Rena was a very creative, imaginative person.  I spent seven years with her and you'll get to that when you talk about education, but she was not really my aunt.  She was my mother's very good friend.  When, I'm trying to remember in what order it happened, but anyway when I was a few days old and they didn't take babies out right away then, Aunt Rena said she wanted to do it.  So she told Papa to set up some blocks, wooden boxes, and she had her own naming ceremony, which is interesting because I didn't think anything about it although she told the story for years and years and years until 'Roots' came out.  She never heard of 'Roots' so sh- I don't know where she got this from, but she made Papa put the boxes in steps and she took me out for the first time, first time I went out of the house when I was about two weeks old and she took up--one step and down and she took two steps and step back one and then she stepped three steps and step back one and then she turned around and came back down.  And Mama and Papa asked her what she was doing.  She said, "There'll be a lot of times in her life when she'll go up and then she'll have to rest and then she'll come back to rest, but each way she'll always be all right.  She'll keep going."  And so that was a family legend and Aunt Rena had her naming ceremony and when 'Roots' came out and they showed (gesture) that, I thought about it and she had died by then.  I don't know where she got that idea from.  Didn't happen with my sister, it only happened with me.  But she took me up and she said, "She'll have some setbacks, she'll come back a little ways but she'll always keep on rising."
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Isn't that a nice story?
Speaker 1: Thank you for sharing it with us.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to write it someday.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Mama wasn't too sure about it but my brother [William Merritt, Jr.] said it'd be good for her--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You have speed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and so we went.
Story_ID: 397373
Speaker 1: Could you please tell us the date of your birth and where you were born?
Speaker 2: September 14, 1931 in Clinton, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's in Sampson County [North Carolina], and it's the town--county seat. I think now all these seventy some years later they don't still have ten thousand people.  It's somewhere between seven and eight thousand, so when I was growing up I knew everybody in town and because I was nosy and talked to everybody, it didn't matter what color they were, I'd talk to them.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  Today's date is?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It's April and it's a Tuesday (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's April 7 [2006].  It's Friday--
Speaker 2: It's Monday--
Speaker 1: Friday.
Speaker 2: --I don't know what day it is (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, it's April 7 (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'd have to think about it.  Some days I get up and get the paper and look to see what day it is.  Yesterday seems more like it was a Sunday because Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] had a friend who died and we spent all day up at St.--
Speaker 1: Ignatius?
Speaker 2: --St. Ignatius [St. Ignatius College Preparatory, San Francisco, California], or around the campus somewhere.
Speaker 1: Oh I see.
Speaker 2: They had a, a reception following in the library and we were up there all afternoon.
Speaker 1: Oh my.  Could you tell us the location of this interview, the address?
Speaker 2: 66 Cleary Court [San Francisco, California], apartment number 705.  They're condos.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I moved her eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay and your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired educator.  I was a teacher for many years and then I became an administrator and I did that until I retired.
Story_ID: 397374
Speaker 1: We're gonna do five very short answers, some kind of strange questions.  They're kind of like if you were in People magazine kind of questions, okay?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so just bear with us, just kind of warm up questions.  Could you please tell us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't think I have one.  I like all food.  I have a lot of food allergies, and I can't eat a lot of things.  I can eat small amounts of strawberries, which I dearly love.  Cannot eat tomatoes at all so I don't really have anything favorite, I just like food and I like to cook.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's even better.  Okay what's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Probably spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Red, oh (laughter) and if you had one place in the world you could go for a vacation, where would it be?
Speaker 2: I've been blessed in that I've been able to travel a lot so I've gone most of the places I wanted to go.  The only place I haven't been that I still want to go to is South Africa.  And I have some friends who are going this year, but Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] isn't up to a trip like that and I don't think he would be too well off if I was not here for a while.  So I won't go with them.  But eventually I'll go to South Africa and stay maybe a month.
Speaker 1: Oh, that'll be lovely.  Your fav- do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Story_ID: 397375
Speaker 1: All right we're gonna talk a little bit about your family background.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you please tell me about your mother, what was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Sadie B. Herring [Sadie Herring Merritt].  Now my sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] and I have tried to be sure which it is.  The family Bible said Sadie Blanche [ph.].  Mama always said she was Sadie Beatrice [ph.].  So there was a B, but which one was accurate, I think we go by the family Bible.  But she signed it Sadie Beatrice Herring many, many years and my sister and I laugh about it now.  She changed her own name because she didn't like it.  She'd rather be Blanche I guess, Sadie Blanche, Sadie--it was Blanche that they named her.  She called herself Sadie Beatrice Herring, H-E-R-R-I-N-G, like the fish.
Speaker 1: Where was she born?  She was--
Speaker 2: Born in North Carolina in Sampson County.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about when she was--stories from which she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh lots of 'em, lots of 'em.
Speaker 1: Could you share one with us?
Speaker 2: My grandfather had worked on the train.  He was born a slave and he remembers opening the gate when Grant [sic. William Tecumseh Sherman], when the Army [Union Army] came through on their way south and my mother told us about this.  He was a little boy five or six years old when the Army went through going to Atlanta [Georgia], burning as they went but anyway, Granddaddy worked on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was his name, do you know?
Speaker 2: George Walter Herring [George Herring].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He went to work at Wilmington [North Carolina] down on the port and he saved some money and he went to Fayetteville [North Carolina], which was called Fayetteville Normal School then [State Colored Normal School], it eventually became Fayetteville State University [Fayetteville, North Carolina] and now it's Fayetteville State University, state teachers college first and then--but he became a teacher and he started the first school that prepared girls for high school or men for college--high school and college it was called.  I should go look that up.  I'll see if I can find it afterwards.  I forgot that.  But Granddaddy started his school in 1880 something and--or '90 [1890] something and it was run as Sampson Normal and Industrial institute [Sampson County Normal and Industrial School, Clinton, North Carolina].  He went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and met Dr. Washington [Booker T. Washington], came--Dr. Washington came back through Clinton [North Carolina] and they talked about a school and he built a school that was patented after Booker T. Washington school and it was called Sampson Normal and Industrial institute.  And he hired teachers and kids came from all over the county because there was no formal school for blacks and so they used to farm 'em out to other people and a lot of them stayed at the house where he and Granny [Rosella Thompson Herring] lived.  When his children grew up he sent them all away to school.  My mother, my--his oldest child was my Aunt Bertha [Bertha Herring] who died in 1917.  I don't know anything about her I just know Mama's stories of sister Bertha.  But Aunt Bertha, Aunt Juanita [Juanita Herring] who is the middle daughter and my mother was sent to Scotia seminary for ladies [Scotia Women's College], it's now Barber-Scotia College in Concord, North Carolina.  His son went to Tuskegee, my uncle, Asa Dancy Herring and Granddaddy had a strong commitment to education so when the county decided that they could take over education for blacks, he had left, he was no longer to teach so they named the school that they built Sampson County Training School [Sampson High School, Clinton, North Carolina] and what had been Sampson Normal and Industrial disappeared.  But I have a booklet somewhere that was printed about 1913 that shows pictures of the old building and Granddaddy and the people who were teachers and what they taught.  I'm sorry I forgot that.  So you remind me I'll see if I can find the copy.  My sister found the original copy and made copies for those of us in the family so we'll have a copy of it.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a wonderful story.  So your grandfather, did he say any more about Grant, how was he the one that opened the gate?
Speaker 2: He was I don't know, I guess the Army came through and they wanted somebody to open the gate and he was a little boy--
Speaker 1: And he was just there.
Speaker 2: --and his--well on the pictures in the wall, his mother was Grandma Lina [Everlina Herring], and her husband was the coachman.  So George was their son so he was the little boy and that's the one that ran and opened the gate that let them through I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't really know.  I never thought of it before.  But Grandpa Cata [Decateur Herring] was the coachman and he handled the horses and the, and the wagon and the traffic--the transportation for the owner.
Speaker 1: Did your grandfather ever talk about Booker T. Washington (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not to me.  He died before I was able to remember.  Actually he died a couple of years after I was born but I don't remember him.  My sister has vague remem- memory of this man sitting on a porch holding her but I don't.
Story_ID: 397376
Speaker 1: We started out talking about your mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] and you told us her name and where she was born.  How would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Mama was a pretty shy young woman who was kept at home by her father [George Herring] because he needed somebody to run the farm and to take over.  He had a lot of land and he had the school [Sampson County Normal and Industrial School; Sampson High School, Clinton, North Carolina], and by that time the state was taking over the school, but Mama was responsible for seeing that the farm was cared for.  He had an overseer but she took care of all that and she didn't marry my father until she was twenty-eight.  The man she loved was a young man from New York who was--Mama always said he was a foreigner.  He was from the islands, and he was very fair and had gray eyes and blonde hair.  And Mama had his picture of--when we were kids when she'd get angry with our father, she'd put his picture on the piano and Papa would always laugh.  We had a piano that my grandfather had bought for my mother and when the man that she had loved was in college at Shaw University in Raleigh [North Carolina], he used to come to Clinton [North Carolina] to court her and he would play the piano and she would play the violin and they would sing and talk.  Okay, so whenever Mama got angry with Papa about something, she would take Hubert's [ph.] picture out and put it on the piano (laughter).  And Papa, who was older, had kind of treated her like she a little girl sometimes, said, "Oh, I see we have Hubert visiting us this week."  (Laughter) And we'd just laugh and it was a big funny thing Mama would get a little, she'd get a little, "Don't do that, Mr. Merritt [William Merritt, Sr.]," or something like that.  She called him Mr. Merritt when she was angry--
Speaker 1: Oh I see.
Speaker 2: --but he was twenty-four years older than she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh he was?
Speaker 2: --and his first wife had died--after my brother [William Merritt, Jr.] was born--from the reaction of childbirth, had two older daughters [Paulina Merritt Solice and Ernestine Merritt Lucas].  And when, when she was growing up, Papa used to come over to visit her father, my grandfather, and they talked and they were both in education and they had a lot in common.  And she played with my older half-sisters.  So they had a, a tie that went back a long way.  But when Granddaddy decided that he didn't want her to marry Hubert, that was the man's name, he made up some lies and pretended that he was in jail and he wouldn't allow him to come to see my mother and I have a packet of letters that he wrote to Mama from 1925 or '6 [1926] until she married.  And when he learned that she was married, he came to Clinton to find her and he--the final letter, he said he came and he saw her sitting in the car with Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] in her lap, and he stood and watched her and cried and said, "I'll never bother you again.  I hope you'll be very happy."  But I don't think he ever married.  He went on to t- back to Shaw, he didn't go back to Shaw, he went to New York and his father had been a dentist.  My brother is a dentist and he told me this, that Hubert's father had taught him and I can't say it correctly, but the early x-rays were called were developed by someone named Rontgen [Wilhelm Rontgen], R-O-E-N-T-E-G-E-N [sic.], and his father was a specialist in that in New York City [New York, New York], so he went on--he was supposed to go onto medical school I don't know whether he did or not, but anyway my brother had had classes from his father at Howard when he was in dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] 'cause he came down to Washington [D.C.] a couple times a week or whenever and taught x-rays--early x-rays.  My brother finished dental school in 1933 when I was two so he had gone there in 1929 after he finished Shaw, but he knew the family.
Speaker 1: So why did your grandfather object to--
Speaker 2: Because he didn't want mama to leave home.  My uncle had married and moved away.  Aunt Juanita [Juanita Herring] was married but she lived next door and the oldest daughter had died when she was very young, Aunt Bertha [Bertha Herring].
Story_ID: 397377
Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about your father.  What was your father's name, when was he born, where was he born?
Speaker 2: William Edward Merritt [William Merritt, Sr.].  I don't know where specifically he was born, but he was born in Sampson County in an area we call Waycross [North Carolina], and there's still a Waycross now, it has a little sign, but he didn't know much about his father.  His mother, Grandma Harriette Page [Harriette Page Merritt], was a midwife.  She had two sons and a daughter, Aunt Lizzie [ph.] that I never knew.  She died before I was old enough to know about her and Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt]--Papa had a brother Oscar [Oscar Merritt] and there was another brother.  Papa said he was named George [George Merritt].  He was the oldest of the family but he left and moved and went to Georgia somewhere.  They never heard from him again.  So every time we meet anybody named Merritt, I always wanna know something about them but I've never found any of his family.  Uncle Oscar lived most of his life in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and he had two daughters and a son and we used to call them the Philadelphia Merritts.  They would come down--the kids would come down summer and spend summers with my father.  Uncle Oscar had some problems after his wife died.  He became reclusive.  Her parents--her sister and husband raised the children and he just kind of went and got a job as a live-in chauffeur, handyman and lived with a wealthy family out in Overbrook, Pennsylvania [Overbrook, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He sent money back to his sister-in-law and Uncle Jake [ph.].  We call them Uncle Jake and Aunt whatever her name is, I'll think of it in a minute.  But Aunt Mary [ph.] and Uncle Jake, Aunt May [ph.], but he never could raise his children.  He had--and at times he was put in the asylum because they thought he was crazy.  Papa decided he wasn't crazy, he was depressed.  So in 1938 I think, '37 [1937] or '38 [1938], I was a little girl.  Papa went to Philadelphia and brought him down and he stayed with us for a full year and he cleaned the house for Mama.  He did everything except drive.  He wouldn't drive any more.  He cleaned the house; he helped her take care of us.  My father had had a heart attack and he helped him and then when the year was over, he went back and I never saw him alive again.
Speaker 1: Oh my, that's a wonderful story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But he did have--he was depressed.  Papa understood it but there was no care for him at that time except an insane asylum and he wasn't insane, he just needed some care.
Speaker 1: Did your father ever talk about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Papa?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, when he was younger?
Speaker 2: None, except he didn't never indicate that he didn't have a happy childhood.  He enjoyed being a young man and he traveled a lot.  I didn't know much about him.  My sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] knows more about him.  She actually has been on the computer and gotten lots of information about Papa I don't know.  But he went to Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], he studied theology, he never had a bachelor's degree that I remember ever seeing or talking about, but he took lots of classes every time there were any extension classes from Fayetteville State [Fayetteville State Teachers College; Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, North Carolina] or Shaw that was in our area, he would go for classes.  He taught sixth, seventh grade most of the time.  He and my mother always taught in one- or two-room school houses or three.  And when I remembered most Mama taught first, second and third and Ms. Powell [ph.], Ms. Bullet [ph.] taught fourth and fifth and Papa taught sixth and seventh.  And when I was a child, they would live in the community where the school was that they worked in and come to Clinton [North Carolina] where I had grown up and where I had been born and that was our regular home.  But we'd come home on weekends and just before maybe a year or so before Papa died they changed their position so that they didn't have to go away; we stayed in our own house.  I guess it was the time we started school that we started staying there all the time and then they'd have somebody come in and take care of us.  But we both went to school as soon as we could stay still.
Story_ID: 397378
Speaker 1: You have some wonderful pictures back in the hallway of your great-grandparents.  Could you tell us a little bit about them?
Speaker 2: Grandma Lina [Everlina Herring] was supposed to have been pure blooded African and she was the, the cook.  My grandfa- my great-grandfather, Decateur Herring was the son of the owner, but he was the coachman and the man all-around person and they were allowed to marry and have children (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what time was this?
Speaker 2: This was before, it was after the Civil War because Granddaddy [George Herring], Granddaddy was born before the Civil War and he was the oldest and they had a lot of children.  I don't even know all of them.  Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] has all of their names but the only one that I remember was my grandfather's sister, Lizzie [ph.].  She died when I was a little girl.  But all the rest of them are gone.  But there are lots and lots of that level of family 'cause the great-grandparents had maybe seven or eight children.  I don't really know.  Don't remember.  But they all have a lot of family and when I go to North Carolina I--(laughter) first time Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] went he was blown out the water that we were driving down toward Wilmington [North Carolina] so I have a lot of relatives down in that area and he said, "You know where you're going?"  I said, "Not the names of them; I know places that I remember and you just have to be ready to stop when I tell you to turn."  And we got almost I don't know somewhere half way down to Wilmington and I saw this little road going off to the right and I said, "There's a store back there, right?"  And he said, "Yes."  I said, "You have to go back to the store."  And he said, "Why?"  I say, "That's my cousin's store."  And he said, "How do you know that?"  I said, "Burl, from here to Wilmington, I'm related to somebody on either my mother's [Sadie Herring Merritt] side or my father's [William Merritt, Sr.] side, so just do what I said, turn around."  So we went back, we got out of the car and we went in.  There's this tall man, handsome, about Burl's size, not quite as dark as Burl, dressed in a gray shirt and gray pants and gray shoes and I walked in and Burl was right behind me and he leaned over and he said, "Ercelle [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft]?"  And I said, "Yes?" "What are you doing down here?"  'Cause he knew I was down here.  I hadn't seen him since I had--since my mother died probably.  And she died in '84 [1984].  But he was a cousin, Hollingsworth was the last name.  We have a lot of relatives who married into Hollingsworths, and they intermarry.  Burl still laughs, he can't believe that Boy knew, we called him Boy--when I said, "Turn around, I want to go back there, that's Newtons Crossroads [North Carolina]," I said, "and that's where Boy's store is."  And he said, "You think he still there?"  I said, "Just turn around."  So we got back and we walked in and that's when he said, "Ercelle, why didn't you tell somebody you were coming?"  (Laughter) Burl still can't get over it.  But he and his buddies were looking at a TV which they had dropped down from the ceiling and they were watching a baseball game and they all looking up like this.  These old coaches, (unclear) sitting around the floor and Burl, (shakes head).
Story_ID: 397379
Speaker 1: You mention Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] a lot; could you just mention who you're talking about?  Your friend, Burl (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's the man in my life at this time.  I've known him and his wife almost ever since I moved out here.  We weren't close friends, but I ran into them socially.  Melvia [Melvia Woolfolk Toler] died in 1991.  She had breast cancer.  Burl retired.  We were working together then.  I was president of what was called the Community College Centers [San Francisco Community College Centers].  San Francisco [California] has, at that point they had City College [City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California], which was the credit division and the non-credit division, which was called the centers, and there were seven of them and I was--I became president of the centers in 1985, and Burl was director of personnel for the centers.  Melvia died in '91 [1991].  Burl retired then.  But I got really furious at him one time.  We were just friends.  The man who was one of my vice presidents--Burl and I went to lunch one day and we went with Welton [Welton Meeks] because there is a mart, well they just call it the mart as far as I know, it's downtown and it has furniture and clothing and all that--wholesale.  Welton and his wife [Constance Fisher Meeks] ran a gift shop over in San Rafael [California].  He was part Indian [Native American] and mostly white, but he liked to be Indian and so we did a lot of things 'cause he talk about how people in the district were racist.  But he didn't admit to being Indian until affirmative action.  (Laughter) Then he was able--so we teased him about that but any way we went down to the mart that day, and he went to pick up some jewelry that he had ordered for his wife and we were there and there was a furrier.  We had lunch and we were getting ready to leave before we left the jewelers, Welton asked me if I wanted any jewelry because he could get it at their prices.  I said no.  And so he said, "Well let's have lunch," so we had lunch.  And then we were about leave, I said, "Is there a furrier in here?"  And he said, "Yes."  So I said, I wanna go see it.  So we went to the fur shop and the woman came out.  She recognized Welton and she said, "Can I help you?" And I said, "Yes, I want a coat."  And she said, "What do you want?"  And I told her.  And she said, "I have one."  I wanted a mink with the skins going horizontal rather than vertical coming down--the chevron in the back.  I had seen one on television on somebody one time and the men just looked at me like they thought I was crazy.  So she brought this coat out and I tried it on and I couldn't see the back so I told Burl to try it on (laughter) and he tried it on and I liked it so I said I'll take it.  So she said, "What kind lining do you want?"  They had to adjust the sleeves and arms.  When we were driving back--before we left, I said why don't you guys buy something for your wife, bring her down here.  Burl said, "She has a coat she never wears."  And I said, "Did you let her pick it out?"  And he said, "No, I bought it for a gift."  I said, "There're some things you never ever give a woman.  You give them to her, but you let her choose them because she won't wear them if she doesn't like them.  One of them is jewelry and the other is furs."  And I said, "Bring her down and let her get what she wants."  And he said, "I don't need to do that.  She has one."  And I got angry with him because I knew she had breast cancer, but he had not--either she had not told him, or it had not registered with him.  And I said, "Burl, the woman gave you six children and most of her life; she married you when she was nineteen.  Whatever she wants, you do it."  And he stopped the car he was driving.  He said, "Don't tell me how to treat my wife."  And I said, "I'm telling you this, and if you don't do it you'll live to regret it."  And he drove off and I sat in the backseat.  Welton was so funny.  We didn't talk all the way back to the office but I'd known him for a long time and he's a Taurus, he's a bull.  I mean--
Speaker 1: They're stubborn okay.
Speaker 2: --so I you know I learned to work with him.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 398612
Speaker 1: He had not yet realized she would die, I did.  I saw her and I knew that she wasn't going to make it and I tried to help him to understand and he just got, "(Unclear)--she's gonna be fine."  But you see even if I say I have a headache, he starts, "Oh you don't really have a headache, it's gonna be fine, just don't worry about it."  And I said, "Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.], I know when my head hurts.  I don't need you to tell me" (laughter).  But I'm sure that's what he did to Melvia [Melvia Woolfolk Toler] and I don't think she ever really let him know how seriously ill she was.  They had a daughter--they have a daughter who is a nurse [Valerie Toler Creary] and lived with them as well as the youngest daughter [Jennifer Toler-Fruit], the oldest and youngest were living at home with them and the girls weren't receptive.
Speaker 2: Oh?
Speaker 1: I heard them fussing one time about how dad didn't get their mother to the hospital on time and I went ballistic.  I said--
Speaker 2: 'Cause they didn't do their part?
Speaker 1: --I said, "There was a nurse right in the house, you, and you're there all the time, you should have seen the differences in your mother."  She waited on them hand and foot.  That's why they were still home.  The one who's fifty just moved out three years ago (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, so Burl is an old friend of yours, that's--and you often mention him.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.

Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Getting up early in the morning and going out to make mud pies.  And I never was conscious about my body--self-conscious, and I would take off my pajamas 'cause Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] would fuss if I was out in the yard in my pajamas.  So I put on underpants and just go out there and just play (laughter) and my brother, who was not married, and he come home from dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] and was living there, used to be upset that I'd be out in the front yard or in the backyard with nothing but my underpants on.  'Cause I woke up earlier than everybody else. And I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About how old were you?
Speaker 2: I don't know three, four.  I quite often--my brother came home from school.  He lived with us.  He actually put a dental office in the guest bedroom until he could afford to rent a place downtown.  He had terrible nightmares sometimes and he would get out of bed and walk and he jumped out of the window one time and didn't know what he was doing.  He was not drunk, just having one of these nightmares, so well either my sister or I had to sleep with him to wake him up when he'd start talking and moving.  And Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] was frightened one night when he moved and she couldn't do--so they--I slept with him many nights.  (Laughter) He still, until he died, used to tease because if he was out late and we--our house did not have central heat, small room heaters, his bedroom was often cold.  He'd come in and he'd move me out of my warm place and get in my warm place so he teased me until he died about sleeping with him and not having a heater any more (laughter).  But anyway--I don't know where I was when I got off on that, but anyway (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were talking about making mud pies in your underwear.
Speaker 2: Oh he, he was very, he was very special in my life and even as a child, a little child, he was.  Papa [William Merritt, Sr.] died of a heart attack when I was eight and my sister was eleven.  But she had always been Mama's child and I was Papa's child.  And Papa and Buddy [William Merritt, Jr.] used to go out on Saturday and--Sunday mornings not Saturday, Saturday was his busiest day.  People from all over the county came 'cause he was the only black dentist in Sampson County [North Carolina] and so when they found out he was there, they came and usually he'd be tired when he got home on Saturday and we wouldn't even see him, he'd just go to bed.  Sunday morning, he'd get up early and he and Papa would go riding all down the country, all these little places that he remembered as a child or places Papa wanted to see again.  And I'd get up and they'd dress me so that I could go with them.  'Cause I'd go in my pajamas if they let me.  Anywhere Papa and Buddy went, I went.  And so I got to be a nuisance I guess but not really 'cause I sit in Papa's lap and listen to them talking and my father had a very interesting statement that he would make.  He never altered his speech to meet our needs.  If we didn't know what he was talking about he'd say, "Do you understand me?"  And if we said yes, he'd say, "All right, tell me what I was saying."  If he didn't--if we--he couldn't--we couldn't tell him, he'd say, "All right, we'll go look it up, I'll explain it to you and then you'll know what it means."  Mama used to get upset and say, "Well they're just children."  And my father's response always was, "Sadie, you don't know what they can learn and what they can't.  You never limit their mind based on what you think, don't know how far their minds can go.  So you never talk down to them, you answer their questions and if you don't know, say, 'I don't know and we'll look it up.'"  Mama thought that was terrible 'cause children shouldn't always ask all the questions, but I ask questions all the time and he always answered them.  Then once in a while just to see, to teach me about maps, he would say--we kept big map of the world on the back of the bedroom door and he would say, "Now that's what you're asking me about."  Then he would explain it to me.

Speaker 1: And even the day of Pearl Harbor, we were at church.  When we left church Papa [William Merritt, Sr.] had died then.  He died in 1940 but nobody knew where Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii] was.  And we got home and went in the bedroom and looked on the map until we found it.  We knew it was in the Pacific Ocean and it was in Hawaii and we found it and we were the only kids in our group that knew where Pearl Harbor was until we got to school the next day.  But we talked--but anyway he was way ahead of himself and I had to remind my sister who is the librarian that you don't decide what children should read.  She thought she did.  She was a child's librarian for a while in a public library in New Jersey and then she went to work in schools after her child was born 'cause it was--schedules were coherent.  And once when she called me one night, she said, "I'm so tired."  She said, "I had to put all those books away."  And I said, "What?"  She said, "I had all those third graders in today, and I'm not ever gonna let that happen again."  He said--she said, "I'm gonna take out the books for third graders and put them on a dolly and not have them running all over my library taking books down 'cause I have to put them--I had to shelve them all myself this afternoon and I worked until five o'clock."  And I got very upset and I said, "What makes you think that you can determine what a third grader ought to read?"  "I know what they read," dah, dah, dah.  I said, "Now wait a minute, you have a child who is very bright and you got upset when he was in third or fourth grade and he had a book report to do and he wanted to read 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea' [Jules Verne] and the librarian wouldn't let him have it because she said he was too young, he couldn't understand it.  And you went to school and raised hell, and he read the book and he wrote a good book report.  Now if you allow that for your child?"  And she said, "I, I forgot that" herself, "I'm so sorry.  I'll make it up tomorrow."  So the next day she said she told the kids, these--she taught them about the Dewey Decimal System [Dewey Decimal Classification] and she said, "Try to remember where you took them from and put them on this cart when you finish and then I don't have to run around and find them and I can shelve them easily."  And it worked fine.  And she taught the students who worked in there on their periods of community service or whatever, she taught them how to help shelve the books afterwards.
Speaker 2: What was her name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--Georgetta Merritt--Bertha Georgetta Harriet Merritt Campbell [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell].  That's another story.
Speaker 2: That's another story?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  She was--she, and she's your only sister, your only full sibling?
Speaker 1: My mother's [Sadie Herring Merritt] only--my mother only had two children.  And when my mother married my father, my two older sisters [Paulina Merritt Solice and Ernestine Merritt Lucas] were married and had children that are older than us so I have nieces--
Speaker 2: Your half-sisters--
Speaker 1: --and nephews that are older than I am.  But my brother [William Merritt, Jr.] was still in school and after he finished, he finished Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and then he went to Howard dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], and he came home and he lived with us.  He got married in 1938 and built a house about four or five houses up the street from us and lived there all of his life.  And his youngest son lives there now.  His wife is in a nursing home.  My brother died in the '80s [1980s] just before his eightieth birthday.

Speaker 1: Could you share some other memories of us, like the pigs?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I love pigs (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: We have lots of cousins, I told you down in the country and my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] loved her relatives and Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] used to get so angry, "We gotta go see some cousins," and I loved all of them you know I loved to go down there, take my shoes off 'cause we couldn't go barefoot at home.  Mama didn't like us to, but down in the country when she didn't see me, I--. And I would go with the men to slop the pigs.  I would go with them when they fed the horses and I learned how to ride the old mule Sarah they (laughter)--.  She was stubborn but she didn't go very fast so they let me ride Sarah and then they do it and I help feed the livestock and I used to when they couldn't find me I'd be down there shelling corn and feeding the pigs and I just love the pigs, I liked the noises, I made noises like they did and I collected them.  And when I moved in here I gave away a whole bag--a box of pigs 'cause I thought I'm not gonna do this but I still get pigs and people give me pigs.  So I have some in my den and a few in the b- I don't think they're in my bedroom maybe a big fat pig like that, a bank, but I like them, always have.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Love pork too.
Speaker 1: Oh do you?
Speaker 2: Now that's not--that doesn't seem right if you love 'em you don't wanna eat them but I don't mind eating them.  We raised chickens when I was young and we did have pigs until the city--the little town we lived in [Clinton, North Carolina] decided that--because we were within the city limits, we couldn't have the pig any more. But the last pig I remember was when I was six, it was Papa's [William Merritt, Sr.] birthday and it must have been an important one, 'cause they had a big barbecue and my brother [William Merritt, Jr.] came in with this piglet and they made a pen out by the dr- by the garage at the end of the lot where the house was and we named her Susie and they fattened her up.  The man who was the butcher in our town was a man named Mr. Norwood Sampson.  He drank a lot but my father was never afraid of (unclear).  He kind of liked Norwood and he'd give him extra jobs to do sometimes.  My father liked lamb and not many people liked lamb at that time so Papa would buy a, a baby lamb and Mr. Sampson would come and butcher him.  And we'd hear him--you ever heard a lamb when he knows he's gonna be killed?  He does this sad (makes sound).  He knows it's time and they used to try to keep us busy with the radio on but Mr. Sampson would barbecue--not barbecue, butcher the lamb and we'd have lamb 'til Mama hated it (laughter).  But we had lamb and he had this pig barbecue.  But for his birthday they were gonna have Mr. Norwood barbecue 'em and they made their own pits, pit barbecue you know about those?  Okay.  And he would eviscerate 'em and clean 'em out and put them on poles and cook 'em in the (unclear).  He got there early that morning and we realized he came to kill Susie and we raised hell, mostly me.  "You can't kill Susie."  I ran all through the yard up and down, "They're killing Susie."  That was the last time they ever bought a pig and waited to barbecue it.  Whatever happened before that they came already cooked 'cause I had so much to say about killing Susie.

Speaker 1: What was your family life like?  You've told us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was very happy.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: When Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] and Papa [William Merritt, Sr.] had disagreements they never argued in front of us.  Papa would get his hat, he was bald, and he'd walk across the street up to where one of his friends, Reverend Murray [ph.], had a little two bit store about as big as this living room, and they would sit and talk half the night so that by the time he came home, Mama would have gone to bed.  And we wouldn't hear whatever they discussed.  I never heard them fuss.  But Papa treated Mama like she was a child.  He loved her very much, he was very proud of his children, us and his older children.  But they were sometimes jealous of us because life for them was quite different than life for us.  He was older, he was making more money, he was able to spend more time with us and like I heard him tell one of them one day, "If I had known better when I was raising you, I would have done better.  I know better now so I'm doing a better job with these.  I'm sorry you don't understand that, but maybe you will someday."  And I didn't really understand it but I asked him and he said, "Just what I said.  You know I tried to raise them alone when their mother died.  I didn't do what I might have done, I did the best I knew how to do but I can do better with you."  And he talked every--he talked to all of us like we were grown up and Mama used to say, "You don't do that."  He said, "I'm not talking to their age, Sadie, I'm talking to their mind."  That's what I was trying to get to.  Because when Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] did that to the kids in the library, I said, "Don't you remember what Papa said?"  And she said, "No."  I said, "Papa always said Mama--."  She said--he called my mother Sadie, "Sadie, you're not speaking to their age, you're speaking to their mind.  You don't know what they will remember."  And it's true.  People talk down to children and they, they know a whole lot more than you know they do (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, they do. They certainly do.

Speaker 1: Could you describe the street you lived on, your community?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I grew up in a little segregated town [Clinton, North Carolina].  At the time that I was growing up there were no more than five thousand people.  Everybody knew my folks, and half the people, white and black, either thought my father [William Merritt, Sr.] was a crazy man or that you better not mess with him 'cause he had a very fiery temper.  He never fought anybody that I know of.  As a matter of fact, he refused to fight in World War I [WWI].  He became a conscientious subjector and he became what they called the Y secretary.  Young Men's Christian Association [YMCA] recruited young men to teach African American soldiers who could not read and write, and my father was a teacher, and so he became what is a Y secretary.  They wore uniforms, but he was a pacifist.  His favorite song was "Ain't gonna study war no more" ['Down by the Riverside'] and I can tell you all the words.  If I could sing, I'd sing it to you.  Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] used to play the piano.  This was the piano that her father [George Herring] bought her and that she and Hubert [ph.] used to play together.  So when she was upset (laughter) or when she was relieving her tension at night, she'd play and my sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] and I would stand at the piano and we would sing. So I know all the old songs.  I even have some of her sheet music over here.  "What'll I do when you're far away" ['What'll I Do'], you know that one?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Have you ever heard that one?  I have the old ragged sheet music over here.  I haven't taken it out much 'cause it's so fragile, it just--the words are: "What'll I do when you're far away and I am blue," no that's the chorus.  I got, "What'll I do when you're far away and I'm blue, what'll I do?  What'll I do when I'm wondering who is kissing you, what'll I do.  What'll I do with just a photograph to tell my troubles to?  When I'm alone with only dreams of you that can't come true, what'll I do?"
Speaker 1: Oh that's a lovely song.
Speaker 2: It's a beautiful song.  And I wrote about it because I got--I'll see if can find it later but when Mama was angry or upset, I told you Hubert's picture would appear on the piano and invariably before the evening was over, we would sing 'What'll I Do' and that was her way of getting her frustration out.  Papa understood it very well.  He'd sit over in the corner and smoke his pipe and read and before she closed down the piano, he'd say, "Play my song, Sadie."  And she'd say, "Which one?"  And he'd say--which one, he had two.  'Deep River' and I told you what the other one was just now, but I can't remember right this minute.  I'll come back to it.  But the only time he would sing was when she'd play 'Deep River' and we'd hear him singing it.  You know that one?  Does he know that one?  "Deep river, my home is over Jordan, deep river I wanna cross over into campground, looked over Jordan and what did I see, coming for to carry me home, a band of angels coming after me, coming for to carry me home" and then back there--Deep--I mixed up 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot' and 'Deep River'--
Speaker 1: Did you (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that's what I just did, that's just what I did.  I mixed up the two I didn't realize that.  But they were all--those were his songs, 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot' and--
Speaker 1: 'Deep River.'
Speaker 2: --Sweet--'In the Sweet By and By.'
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: "We shall meet on that wonderful shore," and when Mama would play she'd play her songs and then we'd ask her, "Mama, do you know this?"  "Mama, play this," and then he'd, he'd never get out of his chair and join us.  Once in a while he'd come over and stand behind her while we stood on either side, sang.  But he'd sit over there with his pipe and his paper, he wasn't reading it, he would just--he read it all the time but when we were singing, he put the paper down and he put his head back and he'd listen.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was our favorite.  We didn't have a record player until after Papa was dead.  We had sheet music and the old hit parade words (laughter) you know when you learn the songs that way but we didn't, we had radios then but we didn't have a record player that I recall.
Story_ID: 398618
Speaker 1: You grew up in a very, very small town [Clinton, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I started to say--everybody knew us.  My father had a reputation for having a short, a short temper and he would tell off anybody.  And most of the people thought he was--all of my friends referred to him as Mr. Ed Merritt [William Merritt, Sr.] because he was old as their grandpa you know and he was always Mr. Ed Merritt.  Not Mr. Merritt, Mr. Ed, Mr. Ed Merritt and when we were downtown we couldn't buy ice cream at the soda fountains in the drugstores or go get any kind of--you could go to Philips' Ice Cream Parlor [ph.] and the Philips [ph.] and the Khalils [ph.] were the two families that were east--they were, they were from either Iraq or Iran or something like that.  I'm not sure what they were, Syria, Syria.  Khalil had a fruit stand and a vegetable stand and they had a soda fountain but they didn't have sit down stools.  We could buy ice cream there, cones, but the drugstores wouldn't sell us ice cream cones, you'd have to buy packaged pint, they didn't wait on you--and one of Georgetta's [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] contemporaries was older than both of us but she was very fair and so on Sundays there was always one drugstore open and Mable [ph.] could go in and buy ice cream because she looked like she was white, but they knew because all of us little kids would be standing out there giving her our nickel and she'd go in and when they got the cones made then we'd come in and say, "Ms. Mable, can we help carry that ice cream out?"  And we'd go on out and lick our cones on the way home.  But that was the kind of town it was.  I don't think I was ever mistreated by any white people.  There were children who were, but I never was.  Everybody knew Papa, everybody knew Mama when Papa died.  Everybody knew Buddy [William Merritt, Jr.].  When I needed something to wear, Mama would send us to Fleishman's Department Store [Clinton, North Carolina] if she couldn't get us there and we could get it and he'd put it on the tab and she'd pay it when she got the end of the month--we got a check.  I didn't feel endangered.  I felt safe.  Our neighborhood and the s- concrete sidewalks stopped at my brother's [William Merritt, Jr.] house.  There was an empty lot between the last white house on the corner--white house meaning house white people lived in.  Then my brother owned this land and he would put a garden in there or pay somebody to put some something in it and then he built his house.  And across the street it was the Barrys [ph.] and there was an old two story white house that belonged to a Barry family and that was the beginning of the black neighborhood.  We had a paved highway but no sidewalks.  So the kids had to skate in the street.  And once in a while they'd go over on one of the streets where the white people lived and skate until the police came and chased them away.  We weren't allowed to skate and Papa didn't let us have a bicycle.  He said he didn't want us killed.  So we had tricycles but we couldn't go out because the street that ran in front of our house was U.S. Highway 70 [U.S. Route 70] and the trucks and everything else came through.  There were no truck lanes.  So we were safe in our yard in the front or the back, but you weren't safe out near the highway because people would run off sometimes, run of the (unclear) and all that.  Later by the time I went to college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], they had paved some sidewalks.  They weren't paved, they put tar, tar down but at least there was something there between you and the street and our neighborhood as I said Mrs. Barry's house was there and my brother's house was up there and we were in this first block after where the white kids were.  We never had any trouble except with the poor white kids.  The kids in our neighborhood all knew us.  Our parents knew them.  They knew--and I can't remember we had any problem until except with the poor whites and there was a family called Nolly, N-O-L-L-Y, I guess like that I don't know.  They were poor as church mice.  They house had dirt floors and they pumped the water or they had it from a well and they called us niggers and so somebody dreamed up the idea that they were black too so somebody dropped them in some white wash (laughter) and so we made a little song about it whenever they came near us, we started singing, here they come, those lit- little white wash people.  And they left us alone.  We didn't never have any problems then--
Speaker 1: That's wonderful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) when I was a child.
Story_ID: 398619
Speaker 1: But we had separate schools and one of the things that I remember as being most demeaning was that the first day of school we had trash trucks, dump trucks, and usually there was a white man driving it and then the black man gathered the trash and threw it in there and took it to the dump.  Well when school opened, they went to the white school and they gold the old books, they put them in the dump truck and they brought them up to our school and the only grassy plot was in the center like an oval and cars could drive through and drop off kids.  But they had little chains around it.  We weren't allowed to play out there.  The dump trucks would come, dump the books that they got from the white school on the grass and then we got brought out by grade to pick out our books.  An arithmetic, the teacher had a best copy she had and we'd get the arithmetic with the readers, the English textbook, the geography and then these big pieces of rubber eraser, we'd clean them up and then Pepsi Cola Com- not Pepsi--Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] used to have these kind of stiff card- they weren't cardboard but they was stiff heaving wrapping paper and they gave them out to schools.  After we cleaned them up as best we could and we didn't have scotch tape.  You used paste and glue and whatever you had and then we put the covers on them and those were our books.  We very rarely got new books--
Speaker 2: Oh my.
Speaker 1: --except when the parents raised money for special books for what did they call it, you know the extra reading, I don't know what they call them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, enrichment--not enrichment--
Speaker 1: Well, that is what they were but they didn't call them that I don't know what they were, extra readers you know.  But Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] was a teacher and so was my father [William Merritt, Sr.] and after he died my Aunt Juanita [Juanita Herring] and Mama taught in a three room schoolhouse, the superintendent was doing them a favor, he's gonna put the sisters together because Aunt Juanita's husband was dead so they were both widows and there was a woman who works in the middle grades Ms. Powell [ph.].  And they had to go to Mr.--Mr. Carter's [ph.] office to get even a ream of paper and mostly they got the rough paper with the lines but maybe twice a year he'd give them a, a ream of five hundred pages of white paper that you could use on a hectograph.  You know what a hectograph is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm, like a (unclear) machine.
Speaker 1: It was like a--for us a hectograph was a cookie sheet filled with this funny gel--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --and you used that purple pencil and wrote it and then you pressed it down and after homework, after we had finished our homework, we had to press those pages down and every page you wrinkled was like gold 'cause Mama only got part of a ream for the whole year you know--
Speaker 2: Oh my.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) so after we finished homework we helped her with her seat work and paper was very, very precious.  Not the rough old tablet style, but the smooth like typing paper.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But I remember doing that after Mama finished cooking or cleaning the kitchen whatever she had to do.  If there was anything that we had to make copies of we had to finish our homework and then you and don't wrinkle it because you wasted a piece of paper (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.

Speaker 1: Are there any sights or sounds or smells when you come in contact with them it immediately takes you back to your childhood?
Speaker 2: When I was principal of a high school and I used to see how teachers wasted paper, I would go in the room early in the morning.  We had an instructional--I don't know what they call it, instructional lab and we had a woman who was there full-time but some of the teachers were never--they were supposed to follow a schedule and send things in and give her two to three days and of course some of them never did.  So the morning that they needed that particular thing duplicated or--. She had a mimeograph and by that time we had you know the (unclear) (gesture) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) ditto.
Speaker 2: Yeah, di- okay you could do that and then we also had tapes the big tape things and so they could tape and we also had slide projectors and 16 millimeter movie projectors and Dorothy [ph.] was the one at my school when I was principal and there were certain teachers who would give her hell.  We signed up ahead for movies so that she'd know how many she had and when the kids came who were doing extra work, they would take them to the particular classrooms.  Some teachers would come in without having signed up for anything and those were the lazy ones and they'd take somebody's film and the film and the movie camera and when it was time for their class, it wasn't there.  So I used to go over in the morning sometimes and monitor.  The other thing they do is they get to the ditto machine or the mimeograph which was a little bit more complicated and they wouldn't have signed up and somebody who had followed the rules would be standing there waiting for this person who hadn't done anything until that morning when he saw something in the newspaper and he was gonna make a lesson out of it for the day.  So I started doing that so then (laughter) somewhere I have this picture they found a picture of a woman standing by a copy machine dressed in white with flowers like she was a flower girl, maybe a wed- 'cause it had a little veil over it, and they put it, blew it up put it on the wall and said this is Mrs. Bancroft [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft] protecting the machine (laughter) so I autographed it for them.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By the time I was going to the big school, they put me in second grade.  We went to school from the time we could walk.  There's a story that my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] says--told and my father [William Merritt, Sr.] used to laugh about it, they worked at a little community called Snow Hill [North Carolina] and we went home on weekends.  And Mrs. Cobb [ph.] was the landlady and she babysat me and I cried 'cause I wanted to go to school.  I could talk but I couldn't walk.  I was lazy.  They said Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] brought things to me and I didn't have to walk.  I scooted around on the floor.  It wasn't really a crawl.  I'd extend one foot and pull myself forward.  Anyway, one morning when I acted up, Papa said, "Well if you could walk, we'd take you to school."  So I learned how to walk that day.  That's the story the way they told it.  And the next day I was ready to go to school.  So I started school somewhere between two and a half and about two, two and two and a half.  And Mama had us well-trained.  We didn't bother anybody.  But my mother always taught grades one through three and so she had her little reading groups and we always were in the lowest l- reading group at first.  And then we learned and she worked with us at home, of course.  And so by the time we went to the big school up the street from where we lived, they put me in second grade and they put Georgetta in second grade but they moved her faster.  So she ended up finishing high school at fifteen, which was way too young.  But they only had eleven grades then.  I finished at sixteen and I had twelfth grade.  I was a better student than she was and I don't know the reason why.  I always was the person who asked the questions, the persons who--the one who took care of business.  When Georgetta finished college, she was eighteen.  She went to Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte [North Carolina] and she worked a couple of summers and took classes.  And by the time she was eighteen she had enough credits to graduate.  So she graduated at eighteen, 1947--I'm sorry not eighteen, fi- she was fifteen when she finished high school, eighteen when she finished college.  Mama sent her to North Carolina Central University [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], and they had a school of library science.  So she got a bachelor's [degree] in library science.  Still she was nineteen.  Her first job was in Fort Smith, Arkansas [sic.] at Arkansas AM and N [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] 'cause nobody at home would hire her, she was too young.  Going to Arkansas was not the best place for her because the people she worked with were all older and she tried to be as old as they were and I think if Mama had any regrets it was that she didn't keep her home and either sacrificed to make her go on and take more classes and start through another degree because she got two bachelor's.  She didn't get the master's [degree] then, she got the bachelor's in library science.  I was ready to go to college but I earned a scholarship.  I made up my mind when I saw Mama crying one time because Georgetta had spent the money for tuition to buy a suit because she was runner up for queen, for Miss Johnson C. Smith [Miss Johnson C. Smith University].  And so she bought this navy blue suit and gold blouse and shoes and hat and she rode on a float.  (Laughter) And so we had to make up for it at home.  But I promised myself after I saw Mama crying about that fact that Georgetta spent the money for the tuition, she had it. The dean of women had been Mama's friend at Scotia [Scotia Women's College; Barber-Scotia College, Concord, North Carolina] when they were boarding school so once Ms. Ransler [ph.] learned about that she was a little more careful about monitoring her.  But anyway.

Speaker 1: Back to your elementary school.
Speaker 2: I went to school when I was five--
Speaker 1: Five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I guess.  I think I was, I may have been six.  But whatever, they put me in second grade and I was usually first in my classes all the way.  When I was in the ninth grade, I had an episode with the teacher and my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] took me out of that school, which was right up the street and I could walk to and I rode to school with her and took a school bus from her school to the high school, which was much smaller, but the principal agreed to take me in, and I did very well.  By the time we finished high school, there were only ten of us.  And I won a scholarship [Pepsi-Cola scholarship] to pay my tuition and books and travel for four years, based on taking the College Entrance Exam Board [College Entrance Examination Board].  And that was a fluke in that my principal was a diabolical man.  He taught all the advanced math and science.  I went there as a freshman, and he used to pick on me.  He'd always make up hard questions for me to answer 'cause see Mama had asked him to take me in because she didn't want me at school after I had that altercation with this home ec [home economics] teacher who decided she was gonna whip me one day.
Speaker 1: What'd you do to get whipped?
Speaker 2: She was talking about my family.  She was taking out her personal anger against my mother for something that I had nothing to do with and she talked about her.  She didn't call her name but she referred to me as--I can't remember, everybody in the class knew who she was talking about.  She gave me a D in the second marking period and I had all A's.  I never had anything lower than an A since maybe second grade--on my report cards had all A's.  And so when I took it home and Mama said, "Why did you get this D?"  I said, "Ms. Strickland [ph.] gave it to me."  So Mama went to ask her about it.  And she got very indignant and told my mother that it was nothing she could do about it and Mama said, "Yes there is."  So Mama talked to the principal and he--she suspended me.  That's--she was gonna hit me with her yard stick and when she raised the yard stick I broke it.  And handed her back the half and walked to the principal's office and sat there until she came down crying and said I had attacked her.  And I was about this tall (laughter).  I was twelve and she was twenty-four or twenty-five, I don't know.  Anyway he, he suspended me.  Mama went to see him and he stuck up for the teacher and that happened to be very near Christmas so Mama said, "Well we'll just transfer you.  Georgetta's [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] away in school, you'll have to come home by yourself now.  I'll take you with me and you'll get the school bus and go to Garland [North Carolina]," so I did.
Story_ID: 398623
Speaker 1: And the principal down there agreed to take me.  Now he picked on me to see if I really was a troublemaker and I really wasn't.  And his wife and he were friends with one of my older sisters so they got firsthand reports on anything I did, which I never did anything wrong.  And when it was time for graduation, not graduation but the senior year and scholarships used to come through, he called me in one day and he said, "Ercelle [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft], can you go to Raleigh [North Carolina] and take a test?"  And I said, "What's it about?"  And he said, "I have this letter" and he handed me the letter and it said that if you took this College Entrance Exam Board [College Entrance Examination Board], CEEB, you were in contention for you file for this Pepsi-Cola scholarship, which would pay for your full tuition, books and travel for four years.  And he read his mail.  Many principals didn't 'cause the principal of the high school in Clinton [North Carolina] lived next door to me and when I won the scholarship he wanted Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] to transfer me back there.  And Mama said, "Did you let anybody in your class, in your senior class take the exam?"  He said, "Well (unclear) nobody would have passed it."  And Mama said, "No, she's staying where she is."  So I went from a little high school with ten kids.  I went to Raleigh.  I was the only black kid in the testing room that day and I walked in and I looked around, my English teacher [Betsy McLean] took me home with her.  Went on the Greyhound bus Friday afternoon, Saturday morning her brother drove me out to this white high school, biggest high school I'd ever seen.  Never seen a hall locker in my life.  We carried everything in our little book bags or whatever.  I walked in and there was nobody in there that looked like me so I found a seat by a window and I took my seat and I took the test and when the test was over, my English teacher's brother was waiting to take me back home and that was in November and in March one afternoon, Mr. McLean [W.M. McLean] called me out of class and handed me this paper.  (Pause) I had been the highest scorer in the state for that particular test and for that scholarship and I won my four-year tuition, books and travel for four years--
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: --any university or college that was accredited.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's wonderful.
Speaker 1: So I went back to my English class--
Speaker 2: Take your time.
Speaker 1: --'cause my English teacher was my favorite teacher and she spent a lot of time tutoring me on the side you know essays and things like that getting ready for college and I ran in and threw the letter at her and sat down and started crying and she started crying (laughter) and the rest of the kids in class we cried all the rest of the day.  But it did what I had planned to do which was Mama wouldn't have to have any major struggle.  All she'd have to pay was room and board.  And so I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for two years and the counselor for Pepsi-Cola scholars [Pepsi-Cola Scholarship Board]--because it was a five-year experimental program and I think it was the model for the National Merit Scholarships [National Merit Scholarship Corporation], I think it was the precursor for them but Pepsi-Cola funded it for five years and there were three maybe four students who had won scholarships like me.  They gave three scholarships in all the eighteen southern states and two in all the rest of the states in the country and I won it in 1948 and it was run from '44 [1944] to '49 [1949] so I was the next to the last class.
Story_ID: 398624
Speaker 1: We had to send annual--monthly reports to Dr. Stalnaker [John M. Stalnaker] who was at University of Illinois [sic. Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] at the time and he had been at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] getting his doctorate and when he got his doctorate at Stanford one of his classmates was a man named Dr. Paul Lawrence [Paul F. Lawrence] and Paul was black.  He ended up as a counselor at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and he counseled all of us who were Pepsi-Cola scholars and I kept up with him until he died about four years ago and he died in Sacramento [California].  He was the first black superintendent of schools in California.  Because when he left here, he left Howard, he came to Stanford and got a Ph.D. and became an assistant superintendent and then a superintendent in a small black district down in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and he had eventually became--I don't know--remember there was a real nasty white guy named Max Rafferty who became a superintendent of schools here in California.  He hired Paul as associate superintendent so Paul really ran the secondary schools and so I got to know him better after I had graduated from college and was already out here.  He taught at Cor- at Hayward State [Alameda County State College; California State University, East Bay, Hayward, California], bought a home in Palo Alto [California] and he and his wife raised his children there.  But he had a lot to do with my life from the time I got to Howard.  Had just turned seventeen the week of--after my seventeenth birthday.  I used to babysit for him and his wife with the first child Catherine [ph.].  And he kind of just watched over me.
Story_ID: 398625
Speaker 1: Then my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] had a friend who was married to a woman who is my English teacher [Betsy McLean].  They gave placement exams and I came out in third group, which meant it was sophomore English, I didn't have any idea.  One of my best friends in the dorm when I first got there was a girl from Detroit [Michigan], very bright and we got to be friends and we took all those tests together that first week and she'd take my numbers and go see what I did, finished Cass Technical High School in Detroit, very bright, and when the scores got posted in math- in English I was in the sophomore English class and she was just a freshman so I felt well if I can do this I can do what I have to do.
Speaker 2: You must have had some wonderful teachers in high school [Garland High School, Garland, North Carolina] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I did.  I did.  And I came from a family that read.  And my sister-in-law, my brother's wife, had been a teacher and she tutored me.  Sometimes she was kind of harsh but I learned a lot from her.  And everybody, not everybody, the teachers from the old high school that I transferred from tutored me before I went to wa- Raleigh [North Carolina] for the CEEB [College Entrance Examination Board] and I had a lot of people who put a lot of time and energy into me.  And I'm grateful to all of them.  My principal, the day of graduation, the state superintendent of colored schools, high schools, came to deliver the commencement address because we had won the scholarship [Pepsi-Cola scholarship] and when I was saying goodbye my brother came to my graduation and he told Mama he was gonna take me shopping so she could go on back to school 'cause she didn't even get the day off from school and at that time some black teachers had to pay for their own substitutes so she couldn't afford to take a day off so she came to my graduation after I graduated and then Buddy [William Merritt, Jr.] took me to Fayetteville [North Carolina] but to buy some luggage so I'd have a set of luggage so I could away not looking like a--I don't know.  Anyhow, Mr. McLean [W.M. McLean] said to me when I got ready to leave and Buddy said come on--I had all these flowers and stuff people gave me, Mr. McLean looked at me and he said, "Ercelle [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft], don't go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and flunk out."  That's the way he was.  Now he had been my principal, my physics teacher, my biology, general science and he knew I wasn't gonna fl- he gave me the only C I ever got in, in my whole life.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: There--before there--college I had some Cs but the last marking period before we graduated, I brought my report card home and here was this C and Mama said, "What are you doing with this C?" And I said, "I don't know.  Mr. McLean gave it to me."  And she said, "Can you prove that?"  I said, "Sure.  I got all my papers.  I don't know why he did."  And Mama said, "Are you upset about it?"  I said, "No, I'm graduating next week and I got my--I've already got my scholarship so it really doesn't matter."  And then my brother always signed my card too, my birth- both Mama and Buddy signed it.  And Buddy said, "Why'd Mike [ph.] give you this?"  Now he and Mr. McLean were good friends.  "Why'd Mike give you this?"  I said, "I guess he's trying to see if Mama would act up," laughter "or if I would."  Mama said, "That's not your C baby, that's my C.  He's testing."  And so I never said anything.  When I turned in the report card both he and Mama always signed it.  Mr. McLean called me in his office and he said, "What did your mother say about the C?"  I said, "Nothing."  He said, "You sure?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said that was not my C, that was her C but it was all right.  He never said another word about it.
Story_ID: 398626
Speaker 1: Now his daughter and I, his daughter was born my last year in high school [Garland High School, Garland, North Carolina].  His mothe- his wife, her mother, his wife, was my favorite teacher and we kept in touch.  And when I would go home if Mrs. McLean [Betsy McLean] knew I was in Clinton [North Carolina], she would come.  By that time they were living in Raleigh [North Carolina].  They had one daughter, she went to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], and I got to know her.  But I didn't see her very often but I heard about her through her mother and her mother brought her to see me one time and we spent the afternoon at my mother's [Sadie Herring Merritt] house.  I fixed the lunch and we had a nice Sunday afternoon.  When she got ready to go, she said, "Can I hug you?"  And I said, "Of course."  So she hugged me and she said, "You know I was prepared to hate you."  I said, "Why?"  She said, "Everything I ever did, my dad [W.M. McLean] would say, 'Ercelle [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft] would have done so and so, so and so.'"  And she said, "I just knew I never wanted to see you and my mother said, 'The next time Ercelle's home, I'm gonna take you down there so you'll get to meet her yourself.'  And I'm so glad she did."  So Cassandra [Cassandra McLean Clay] and I became friends okay.  One day about two or three years ago I decided I hadn't heard from her for a while so I tried to call.  And I couldn't get her.  And I didn't have an address for her, but I had her husband's name.  So I told Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.], this is a longshot, but I really wanna know where Cassandra is.  So I called Boston [Massachusetts], operator, told her I was not gonna make sense, but I wanted her to help me.  I was trying to find somebody.  I said, "I have a very special person in my life and I have not heard from her, but I know she's in Boston area."  And she said, "What's her name?"  I said, "She's married and it's probably listed under his name."  And she said, "What's his name?"  And I said, "Dr. Philip Clay."  She said, "I can do that," just like that.  Rang the thing up.  It was a Sunday afternoon, Burl and I were going to something and I was holding him up.  He was getting--I said, "Leave it alone, just--."  When she got on the phone, I said, "Cassandra, this is Ercelle," and she said, "Oh, I'm so glad to hear from you."  I said, "I didn't know what to do except give your name to the operator," and she said, "I can take care of that."  And she said, "Oh," and I said, "Yes I didn't even have an address."  And she said, "What did you say?"  And I said, "I'm trying to reach Dr. Philip Clay and the operator said, 'I can take care of it.'"  She said, "Philip is the new chancellor of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]," (laughter) and I said--excuse the hell out of me, sitting right at that table.  And I said, "You're kidding?"  She said, "No, Philip is from Wilmington [North Carolina], didn't you remember any Clays in Wilmington?"  I said, "No, I left North Carolina when I was sixteen almost seventeen."  And she said, "Well Philip grew up in Wilmington, and we met here in Boston" 'cause she went to Boston University "and we've been married." I remember when she got married because I sent her a wedding gift, but I didn't know Philip had become the, the chancellor of MIT and she said, "Where are you?"  And I said, "I'm in San Francisco [California]."  She said, "Well Philip was just out that way.  He goes out there a lot."  She said, "And we were both in Los Angeles [California] because our daughter was in India and we went to see her."  She said, "She just married a student that she met in Boston and his folks are Indian so we went to India.  And if I'd known you were there--."  (Laughter) I got off the phone and I said to Burl, "This is one of those stories you would never believe but the fact that that operator said, "Oh that's no problem," and when I told Cassandra and she said, "Well Philip is the chancellor of MIT," and I said, "Well it sure is a small world," but he's from Wilmington, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Oh, it is a small world.
Speaker 1: And she's from Raleigh 'cause her father and mother moved to Raleigh and she was their only child.  They sent me pictures when Cassandra graduated from Boston University so I have pictures of her.  I've never seen a picture of Philip, but I sent a wedding gift and I just haven't ever tried to find them when I was on the East Coast so we made an agreement that the next time I'm back there, we'll meet in New York [New York] for lunch or something (laughter) you know.  Because I haven't seen her for a very long time.
Story_ID: 398627
Speaker 1: How important was the church in your growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very important.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: My father [William Merritt, Sr.] had studied theology at Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], but he was not--well, he laughed and said he was a jackleg preacher.  He wrote sermons for other people and he wrote them and put them away himself and my sister and I are very angry that when my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] was not well one of my uncles came in and burned up all of Papa's papers so we don't have any of his writings, but I remember him writing and she did too and we had read some of them.  We thought we had them safe.  And when Mama got sick and one of her brothers came to live there, he cleaned out all the papers, just threw them away, didn't even think to him and he didn't ask us.  He threw away books.  You know we had all the Bobbsey Twins, Louisa May Alcott, you know, 'Little Women,' 'Little Men.'  I used to love Jo [Josephine "Jo" March].  I thought I was Jo.  (Laughter) Do you remember the story?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, I remember Jo.
Speaker 2: Anyway Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] was Meg [Meg March], I was Jo (laughter).  Anyway, just never know, you just never know how the world's going to go.  But anyway Cassandra [Cassandra McLean Clay] and I are gonna get together next time I'm on the East Coast or next time she comes out here.
Speaker 1: So your--the church was very important in your family life? You went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very important because Papa--we went to church every Sunday.  Papa taught Sunday school.  He died teaching Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Did he?
Speaker 2: Men's day in April, April 14, 1940, he was teaching a Sunday school class.  He told the minister, "I don't think I can do it this morning, B.J. [ph.], I'm kind of not feeling well," and Reverend Johnson [ph.] said, "Well I'll be here if you need to--."  As the young class that we were in was in the middle of the sanctuary and he was in the area on the side they call the men's side.  And Georgetta grabbed my hand and said, "We gotta go to Papa."  He had a heart attack.  He'd had one and he kept ammonia in his pocket.  And Georgetta said, "We gotta go to see about Papa," and just as stood up and Mrs. Barry [ph.] our teacher was saying where you going?  Georgetta just--we gotta go see about--we heard (makes sound) he hit the floor.  He just dropped dead right there in church and we saw him fall but nobody could do anything and my sister Ernestine [Ernestine Merritt Lucas], who's the older one who had a bad mouth cursed out all those little old ladies that were trying to keep her from going to him.  'Cause she was trying--she was over there where the women were.  Men were over here and we were back here and the little kids were in the choir loft, choir room, but we did see Papa fall and I was eight and Georgetta was eleven.  But we always went to church.  Mama had been reared Methodist.  She never converted to Baptist so they used to laugh about which one was gonna get the other sprinkler or the one who had been immersed.  So that was always the joke.  Papa never preached that I'm aware of.  But as I said, he wrote sermons for other people, and he taught classes.
Story_ID: 398628
Speaker 1: The other class he taught was that they were fighting the poll tax and they were trying to get the right for blacks to vote.  And he taught in our kitchen at night little silly stuff they made you have to take these tests so we learned, "We hold these truths to be self-evident," we learned the Bill of Rights along with the people who came for classes to get ready to vote, the Pledge of Allegiance.  My father [William Merritt, Sr.] taught us all of that so we could memorize it all along with the people that he was teaching and he talked to us about it.  He died the year that North Carolina granted the right for blacks to vote, but he never got to vote.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: And he fought all his life to get the right to vote, all his adult life.  And when he died, the Raleigh [North Carolina] News and Observer had an article about his death and it was just--"Advocate for Vote for Negro, William Merritt died."  I have the--I couldn't find the book just now because it's in the stuff that I thought was important I put in a special little box and it's not under my bed.  I had a zipper little case and I was gonna get Granddaddy's [Bancroft's maternal grandfather, George Herring] book out and this little article about--Papa's and Mama's [Sadie Herring Merritt] Bible.  She had pasted the one from the newspaper in her Bible.  And I have it here somewhere.
Speaker 2: Oh my.  Gosh how interesting man your father was.
Speaker 1: Oh Papa was way ahead of his time.  He, he--I somehow felt that, sounds weird, always knew that if there was anybody up there watching over me, it was him.  And I have talked to him sometimes at night especially when I was young because he understood me, Mama never did.  She understood that she didn't understand me though so that made it a little easier.  But when I was away from home and I didn't know what was the best thing for me to do, I would talk to him as if he was there in the room and I would go to sleep and the next morning I knew exactly what I was going to do. I never heard any voices.  I rarely remembered dreams.  I don't know that I ever have dreamed of my father, but when I woke up in the morning, I knew for sure what I needed to do and what I felt was best for me and I've done that all these years.  I haven't had to call on him for a long time but I used to, talk to him like he was in the room with me.  And that was because there were just some things Mama just didn't understand, and I wrote a piece the other day and I just sent it to my sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell], or maybe it's still there waiting for a stamp, I was out of stamps.  But, the last Mother's Day well the last thirteen years of my mother's life, she was in a boarding care facility in New Jersey because she started to lose her memory.  We thought it was Alzheimer's but they didn't have CAT scans and things then.  But turned out that the breast cancer she had had surgery for the year I graduated from college [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York] had metastasized and attacked her brain, it had been slow growing and so as her memory started to fail and she got erratic, they said she had Alzheimer's, but she didn't.  They didn't know what she had but that's what they did so we eventually had to put her in a bed, boarding care.

Speaker 1: You've got this wonderful scholarship [Pepsi-Cola scholarship]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and go on to college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and I chose to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] did not want me to go to Howard and that was the first time we really had a knock down drag out.  But I told her that I was entitled to go wherever I could and she said, "Well I won't pay for your room and board."  I said, "That's all right, I can cook and I will get a live-in job in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.]" 'cause I heard about Georgetown and wealthy women that will take you in and you could work and go to school.  And she didn't know what to say because she never expected that I would say that and I said I'm not afraid of working.  So she relented and I went to Howard and it was very good for me.  I met a lot of people.  I still have friends from there.  One of my girlfriends called me the other night (laughter).  She lives in--well she was down in Tampa [Florida] now and you never know how small the world is going to be (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's true.
Speaker 2: Her--she and I lived across the hall as freshmen and we walked every morning for eight o'clock gym class for the first eight o'clock class.  She was from Reading, Pennsylvania, and we had visited Reading once many years ago when man appeared out of Ma- Mama's past who read in the paper about Papa's [William Merritt, Sr.] death and he came one summer and visited and he came the next summer and took us to Reading and it was not until after two or three years later when he died that I learned that he had wanted to marry Mama and she had denied it.  She had refused his marriage.  First of all she didn't wanna leave home.  But I learned later she put it on me because she asked me one night when we had been out to dinner with him he got a place for us to live and we stayed in Reading about three or four weeks.  We went all over.  He took us up to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], my first trip to a zoo.  We went to New York [New York] because he had a cousin who was a friend of my mother's and we visited her in Brooklyn [New York] and he took us all around New Yor- wonderful man.  Mama asked me, "You want a new daddy?"  That was the wrong question.  And I said no.  I had one father, that's enough.  She used that as her excuse to us for not marrying him but that was not the reason and I told her you don't let a twelve year old or an eight year old however old I was I wasn't even twelve then, nine who still worried about her daddy dying if she wants a new daddy and you knew that.  I didn't tell her until I was older.  And she admitted that she had put it on me because she hadn't wanted to leave home.  Uncle Walter [ph.] died of a heart attack not too long after that.  He was not too well.  I guess he knew that.  But he had been a dentist in Reading and he had a home and he wanted us to come and he would have had a family.  And it would have been fine for Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] and for me.  We loved the man.  But she didn't wanna leave home so I told the lady you don't, you don't put stuff on children like that.  It's your life, you know.

Speaker 1: Okay so you're at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and you're having a wonderful time.
Speaker 2: Had a wonderful time.  I didn't go crazy.  Everybody said it was a wild school.  Didn't you ever hear that all they do is party and the girls get pregnant and they get married and they run off?  I never had to worry like that.  My brother drove me to Washington [D.C.] because Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] didn't want me to go and she--we always packed my sister's [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] trunk and got--went to Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina] and hung her clothes up in the closet and made the bed and put the trunk in the basement.  Mama did not budge.  So Buddy [William Merritt, Jr.] drove me to Washington on a Saturday night after he had worked all night with his best friend Clifeous Brock [ph.] who was an undertaker and they talked while I slept.  We got to Howard.  He went in.  He met the dean who was responsible for the dormitory where I was gonna live.  He told me how to set up an account and he put a hundred dollars in it as money for me if I had to have a--I had the twenty-five dollars a month coming in from Pepsi-Cola [Pepsi-Cola Scholarship Board], that's more than I had ever in one life for one month you know.  Five dollars was my allowance when I was in high school [Garland High School, Garland, North Carolina], or a senior in high school.  Anyway I stayed there for the two years.  My grades weren't that good at first but I didn't really worry about it.  I didn't upset my scholarship but I learned a lot and I learned a lot from the girls I lived with because they were so different in their childhoods than I was--except my sophomore year.  In my sophomore year my roommate was Mary Frances Diggs, and she was from Wilson [North Carolina] and her mother and my mother were both teachers and they knew each other.  So we got along very well.  My first year I had some rocky roommates and it was hard.  And once, one quarter I had no roommate because one of them lost her money and had to go home.  And the other came the third quarter or whatever I don't know, last quarter.  So I had those two quarters with nobody but me and I liked having a room by myself.  I liked the privacy, I liked being able to just prop up in bed and not worry about anything and not worry about the lights out.  They didn't do that at the time and nobody tried to influence me to do anything I didn't want to do.
Story_ID: 397399
Speaker 1: So you were at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for two years and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and what happened then?
Speaker 2: Then at summer when I went home I had asked Ma- Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] the first summer to let me go to Syracuse [New York] and work but she wouldn't.  And the second summer I went home and the boy that I had known in high school [Garland High School, Garland, North Carolina] that I had never dated, I had never dated until I went to college and I really didn't date until about my second quarter, third quarter there.  But anyhow Dick [Richard Bancroft] was home on leave from the [U.S.] Navy and he wanted to take me out and Mama got livid, but I went out with him anyway.  So after we went out a couple of times I came home one day and Mama said, "I talked to Rena [Rena Hawkins] and you're going to Syracuse tomorrow evening.  You're gonna take the train and it's all night and you'll be in Syracuse and you'll spend the summer there and she'll help you get a job."  So I went to Syracuse.  I got a job working on an assembly line in General Electric and I didn't get home until Christmas.  But by that time I had made friends because that summer I went up--I met one of Aunt Rena's friends had a daughter who was in summer school and I met Muriel [ph.] and I decided that it wouldn't be a bad place to stay so it didn't matter.  Hardest part was getting used to having an over-protective woman who never had children be the cage keeper kind of like.  She thought I was gonna run out and I don't know what she thought I was gonna do but once we got it settled down it was fine.  Uncle Billy [ph.] worked as a chef over in Ithaca [New York] and came home some weekends but it was just the two of us most of the time and we worked it out.  Only problem was she loved to play bridge.  She was a social being and when I wanted to read sometimes or just go in my room and stretch out and think, she always had somebody that she needed a third or fourth, so I learned to play bridge.  I don't touch cards any more.  I hate it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh my.
Speaker 2: After--I lived there seven years, the two years for college [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York] and then I was twenty and Mama said she was still teaching so she'd pay for me to go to graduate school [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York], and so I got a master's [degree] when I was twenty-one.  And then I taught in Upstate New York for four years before I came out here.
Speaker 1: Well I'm sure you must have gone through some kind of cultural shock.  You went from your black town [Clinton, North Carolina] that you grew up in and then you went to Howard then you go to New York, and it's a different environment, isn't it?
Speaker 2: It was not so bad because I had been to Syracuse twice as a child in summer and I had met people there and unless something happens tomorrow, I haven't ever had a problem adjusting to people in different situations.
Story_ID: 397400
Speaker 1: The hardest thing was getting used to Aunt Rena's [Rena Hawkins] controlling.  She had never had a child and what she always said, "If anything happened to you, Sadie [Sadie Herring Merritt] would kill me so you can't do that because I don't know whether Sadie--."  I said, "Well call her."  You know she wouldn't do that you know.  But that was her weapon you know.  "If anything happened to you Sadie would kill me," and Mama would have probably you know.  'Cause as I said I got sick one time and she drove up there by herself sixteen hours without stopping and she had retired from teaching.  So she was a very determined little lady.  But anyway I enjoyed the days there.  I learned a lot with Aunt Rena and I learned a lot that was things I remember now and would do if I had to and other things that I would never do.  So it was a good example for me of what I would not be like.  I didn't want to be--she wanted me to stay there and join the League of Women Voters and be a red--what they call as a (unclear) lady for the Red Cross [American Red Cross] and join all The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and all the other societies that the women that she wanted to be with were with and she was with them too.  She started The Links chapter in San Fran- in Syracuse [New York] and any new people who came up there she determined where they were in terms of what happened in their social life.  And she enjoyed that role.  She did it well.  She did it very well.  But I wasn't interested in it and I knew I had to get out.
Story_ID: 397401
Speaker 1: How did you do in school [Syracuse University] in Syracuse [New York]? Was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did fine.
Speaker 1: You did fine?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When you graduate- what was your degree in when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Home economics education.  I taught education--I taught in the new high school--well first I taught in Upstate New York about thirty miles from the Canadian border in a little town called Watertown [New York], and I was the only black living there that was living and working there.  There were servicemen at Pine Camp, it was Fort Drum [New York] way up near Niagara- probably right near the Ontario [Canada] border.  Anyhow was it Ontario?  I don't know whatever border.  First time some of the kids had nev- had ever seen a black person and they wanted to know what I did with my hair and how and they--sometimes they'd come up and rub and well I have cold hands and feet often and my hands get blue and they get and it was very cold up there.  It was 15 degrees below some days and they'd come in class and my fingers would be all purple and my face would look funny and they didn't understand that.  So one time when they were worried about my hair, I shampooed my hair and did it for them so they could see it works like everybody else's hair but they didn't, they didn't know what to make of it you know so they were, they had--they learned a lot.  I stayed two years.  I worked mornings at one small high school and then I drove to another one about six miles away and worked afternoons.  I taught evening class and I taught a Sunday school class at the Methodist church on Sunday (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh my, you were busy.
Speaker 2: And I went to PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and I made potluck suppers and I set tables and I did--and I taught two nights a week to the parents you know sewing, mostly sewing, knitting sometimes.  I liked to knit and so I had sewing and knitting classes.  And I enjoyed the two years up there and then I moved back to Aunt Rena's [Rena Hawkins] house and I taught in North Syracuse [New York] in a new high school [North Syracuse High School] that had opened, and it was affiliated with the university [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York] so I had student teachers, I still had ties there.  And I had worked both summers, two summers I worked at, on campus in summer programs with Dr. Carlton [ph.] who taught economics.  I wish I had just taken straight economics because I, I had a thing for money and understanding how it worked and--but I didn't, I couldn't have gotten a job I didn't think in what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 397402
Speaker 1: And then you made a big move.  You left Syracuse [New York] and you came west (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I put as many miles between Aunt Rena [Rena Hawkins] and Mama [Sadie Herring Merritt] and me as I could 'cause by that time they were competing over where I should be.  Aunt Rena wanted me to stay there and assume her role as the grand dame and Mama wanted me to come home because she was not--Georgetta [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell], Georgetta got married the first year I was here but Georgetta had moved to New Jersey from North Carolina because she and her, her future husband had already gotten engaged and she worked up there.  So Mama did not have her as accessible because Georgetta had been in Charlotte [North Carolina].  So then she wanted me to come home.  So I decided just go, go find your own way and I did.
Speaker 1: So you came west?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you ended up in the Oakland public schools [Oakland Unified School District]--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) right?
Speaker 2: For six years--seven.  So Havenscourt [Havenscourt Junior High School, Oakland, California] four years and Montera [Montera Junior High School; Montera Middle School, Oakland, California] three--or two, two, two or three.
Speaker 1: For those people who don't know, those are middle schools, junior schools, junior high schools (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, junior high schools and I taught evenings at Oakland High School [Oakland, California] sewing and I remember being just so upset.  I had some lovely girls in my sewing class and in the summer, summer school.  I started going to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], taking a few classes down there.  And I always knew I wanted to go back and get a doctorate but I couldn't afford it and so I taught summer school and saved my money and then I started the doctorate later, but I stretched it out almost twelve years because I had to go back home sometimes.  Sometimes I took a vacation and went away but after--
Speaker 1: How was teaching in Oakland [California]?  Was it (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the schools I taught in, it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: You were (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I was in Havenscourt when it first started to integrate.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then they sent me out to King [ph.] and I was--Mrs. McQuilister [ph.], I can't remember her first name was a black woman who had taught math and there was a black man who taught Spanish and then they hired me.  And McQuilister was across the hall from me and we became friends.  She was a math teacher and I stayed there for two years and then they moved me to Montclair [Oakland, California] to Montera and I was there for two years and then I married Dick [Richard Bancroft] and came over here and never moved back to the East--yeah I moved back to East Bay [San Francisco Bay Area, California] one time but it was because my cousin who was an [U.S.] Air Force career man had to go overseas for a year and his wife and the children wanted to stay on the West Coast.  They were down in Arizona.  So I found a house over in the area around Lake Merritt and I shared the house with Anna [ph.] and the children but that year and when that year was over I moved back to this side and I never moved back over there.
Speaker 1: So you were one of the first black teachers in Oakland right?  In the '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the, in the high school, the secondary level.
Speaker 1: Secondar- in 1958, 1960s somewhere around there?
Speaker 2: Si- early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 397403
Speaker 1: And then to me you had this interesting job, I used to sew and I loved McCall's patterns [McCall Corporation].  I just loved going in looking in those pattern books, oh it was just so exciting and you got to work for them.
Speaker 2: It was kind of a fluke.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I s- how did I get that call?  I don't think anybody called--I think I saw it in a magazine or in one of those home ec [home economics] magazines.  We used to have these little McCall ladies who come out and do demonstrations to the classes and, now how did I find out about that job, but anyway I applied for it and I was married to Dick [Richard Bancroft] at the time.  I was only married to him eleven months so it was--I had quit teaching (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's his last name?
Speaker 2: Bancroft.
Speaker 1: Oh right, of course (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  He just died.
Speaker 1: Oh did he now?
Speaker 2: About I don't know last August.  They had a memorial service in October.  I was on a cruise but I found his daughter-in-law's address today when I was looking for something.  Anyway--
Speaker 1: So you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I got this job with the McCall Pattern Company.  The woman who was head of the pattern division was Ryan.  She had a book called 'Let's Sew' [ph.] or something like that.  I knew her name Mildred Graves Ryan and she had articles in McCall Magazine [McCall's Magazine] every now and so when she interviewed me for the job it was down here at the Hilton Hotel [Hilton San Francisco Union Square, San Francisco, California].  That's another story.  I gotta write about that one too.  But anyhow I didn't know any better.  It was a Sunday morning interview at the Hilton at 6th Street [sic.], 6th and Mason [Street].  I went in the side door and inside and during the course of the interview she asked me about the name Bancroft and I said that was my husband's name and she said, "Oh, what's his first name?"  And I said, "Richard."  She said, "Where is he from?" and I said, "Albany, New York," and she said, "That's little Dicky."  And I said, "What?"  She said, "His mother was our housekeeper.  My father was a physician in Albany and she used to bring Little Dicky sometimes," and she said, "When you talk to him again--," I said, "He's gonna pick me up" 'cause he dropped me off and she said, "Well please tell him that Mildred Graves is here and would love to see him."  And I told him and he said, "I don't care if I never see another Graves in my life."  (Laughter) He said, "My mother worked for them and they worked her to death."  But anyway he grew up in Albany, New York, and the, the, the marriage lasted about four months but we stayed together for eleven months.  And by that time we were purchasing a house in Diamond Heights [San Francisco, California], and I had reapplied for a teaching position and I knew I had one and one time when he stayed out and was doing what I knew he was doing but couldn't prove it, I told him that he could just take his stuff.  I had packed it in a s- (laughter) I had packed it in a sheet and tied the ends together and put it in the den.  Everything that--his clothing because that was about all he had.  The rest of the stuff was mine.  And I stayed there and tried sharing the house.  That didn't work well.  So then I found an apartment and moved out.
Story_ID: 397404
Speaker 1: I moved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you got the job with McCall's [McCall Corporation], you were hired to work for--
Speaker 1: I worked for a year--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as a lecturer and I did demonstrations in schools from San Francisco [California] down to San Jose [California] and in the East Bay [San Francisco Bay Area, California] upon the request of home economics teachers and I would come in with my little suitcase and I would set up my displays and I would do my demonstrations.  I did lectures on color and texture.  I did line color and texture mostly we talked about and I had an easel--and I didn't use--I, I wore everything that I made.  I made everything that I wore.  And those were the white gloves hat days and I made turbans to match my outfits.  I had a good time.  I met a lot of people. But what was interesting was I would go into a school and we had been taught protocol, you go in and you wait until the secretary speaks to you or you speak to her if you see her and you say you need to sign the visitors records so we have proof that you were there and she needs to know.  And if the principal is in ask to meet him and then asked to be shown to the room that you'll be working in.  And some of those secretaries would leave me standing there until I would finally say, "Do I have to go knock on the principal's office myself?  Because I really can do that."  I would have taken out my little business card with the little McCall's logo on it and put it on the--they wouldn't even come up to see.  So one time I said, "Why do you do this?"  And they said, "What?"  And I said, "Just make me stand here like you don't see me?"  "Well aren't you a parent?"  "No. Is this the way you treat your parents?"
Speaker 2: That's terrible.
Speaker 1: And they'd look at me.  And I say, "No, I'm representing McCall Company, here's my card and I have an appointment to be in room number so and so and so for the next three hours working with Mrs. So-and-So," because I had phoned.  "Oh we're very sorry.  We weren't expecting you."  I said, "That's obvious," but I would always make it a point to either come by the principal's office before or after so that they knew what I told them because that meant that that's the way they treated black parents who came in.  It was a good experience.  They would have liked me to stay on but it didn't pay enough.  They paid five dollars an hour, I couldn't live off that.
Story_ID: 397405
Speaker 1: This time are you still you know going to school at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]?  At--no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I finished my doctorate in eighty--sometime in the early '80s [1980s], '85 [1985], '86 [1986], '87 [1987] somewhere along there.  I didn't go to summer school every summer and once I got in administration, I had less time to take classes and during the time when I was principal of the high school, it used to kill me because I had four or five o'clock classes over here on this side of the Bay [San Francisco Bay] and that's the worst time to try to hit the traffic going across the bridge [San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge] and so I had to do most of it in summer because I'm not a, a night person.  And going from ni- a class from 7:00 to 9:30 and having to drive back and hit the road the next morning and go down the Peninsula [San Francisco Peninsula] to teach or by that time I was the administrator so you had to be on campus by 7:00, 7:30.  It was kind of hard.  I was the first black principal in the high school district that I worked for and the first woman, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was this Peninsula?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: San Mateo [San Mateo Union High School District], excellent high school district.  We served the area from San Bruno [California] down to the far end of San Mateo [California], where it stops being--Hillsdale [Hillsdale High School, San Mateo, California]--and becomes the next town, San Carlos [California].  Had wonderful experiences there because my principal, like he said the very first meeting, "I run a tight ship."  He had been a captain in the [U.S.] Navy and he had everything doom, doom, doom.  And I learned as a teacher that if you have a good strong principal you could use your own discretion about how you ran your classes as long as you produced and my first ad- department head at Hillsdale, I was first black teacher at Hillsdale, and that was considered the top high school at that time in that district.  Mr. Alley [ph.] had opened the school seventeen years before that and he'd been the principal all those years.  And he used to come and stand outside the door sometimes.  I left the door open a lot of time and I would see him out there and I just ignored it and went on talked.  Anyway when I first had my first evaluation, my te- my supervising teacher never taught any place but there.  And by that time I had taught in New York and over here and in Oakland [Oakland Unified School District].  So by the time I got there I didn't think there was anything she could tell me what to do.  But she wrote on my first evaluation that sometimes in her enthusiasm, Mrs. Bancroft [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft] gets very noisy and so do her children, her students.  They move around from table to table and in their kitchens you--they're just all over.  Well that's what I did.
Story_ID: 397406
Speaker 1: Well you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, that's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --that's what you were supposed if you teach cooking, you have to move around (laughter).
Speaker 2: Anyhow, when he called me in for my evaluation, he said, "Did you read this?"  And I said, "Yes."  He said, "What do you think about it?"  And I said, "I think it's funny, Mr. Alley [ph.]."  I said, "The day that I lost my enthusiasm is the day that I need to stop teaching. And if the only complaint she has is that my children move around in the classroom, that's what I want them to do."  I run a three ring circus.  I had some kids who would be cooking.  I had some kids who would be sewing because we only had seven sewing machines in the room and then I'd have another group and we'd either be doing child development or decorating or something that kept them in their seats at the table and we could work in groups and I ran three like I said I ran three ring circus and the kids had a marvelous time and I did too.  And I had people knocking down the doors to get in my classes so that the other--the department chair got angry because her classes fell off and everybody wanted to be in Mrs. Bancroft's [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft] class.  So anyway I stayed there [Hillsdale High School, San Mateo, California] for four years and I had a good time and by the end she and I had become friends but that first year (laughter) we had a supply closet between our two rooms.  We had what they call all-purpose rooms, there were sewing machines and tables so the kids could work in and the kitchens.  She would actually go in that supply closet and take the flour out, the little canisters of flour into the kitchen so I wouldn't use all the flour.  And we all had a budget you know, it was just, just simple stuff.  Anyway it turned out to be all right and last time I saw her she wanted to hug and kiss and I just you know long ago and far away.
Story_ID: 398629
Speaker 1: Okay, you were director of the--
Speaker 2: Title I.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear) Title I cl- in San Mateo [San Mateo Union High School District] and you were assistant superintendent, Sequoia's [Sequoia Union High School District]--
Speaker 2: Union High School District (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Redwood [Redwood City, California], I mean high school in Redwood, and then you became president of the Community College Centers [San Francisco Community College Centers].  Could you tell us something about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah you skipped one in there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, did I?
Speaker 2: --I'm trying to remember which one you skipped.  From the--
Speaker 1: You went to San Mateo right?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I, I--
Speaker 1: And the director of--oh, adult education?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was director of adult education for two years and that was really what got me ready for the position--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --at the college because the position at the--at here had been the adult program.  They wrapped it into the community college district [San Francisco Community College District] when they transferred the college district from the K-12 [kindergarten to twelfth grade].  So when it opened, I got calls about going and I was having a good time down in San Mateo by then.  'Cause I'd been there long enough to know everybody around and I had some things going and I had finally gotten my crazy superintendent to give me a slush fund to do some experimental innovative things with some of my principals and I had them--we were all set to go.  We had two or three big projects going.  And I got a call about this job at the college and I wasn't going to go to the interview and you asked about religion, probably thirty years ago a friend of mine who was always going for somebody to tell her what to do.  Was told about this woman who lived in Oakland [California] and she went to see her because he was going through a divorce and she came to my house directly from going over to see Mrs. Hayes [ph.] and Mrs. Hayes talked to her and she came to me because I have a good memory and she said, "I want you to remember everything I have to tell you 'cause this woman scared me to death."  And I said, "Well what was it?"  She said, "I don't know," she said, "but when I walked in she said you are very troubled, and part of it is because you don't keep your mind steady, you have to keep your mind on what you're doing and you're all in--," and she told me all this stuff and I said, "Well tell me about it." She said, "Somebody at work told me about it and I'm looking for something to help me get ready."  But she said, she invited me to come to her church and I said, "She has a church?" and she said, "Yes, she told me she had church in Vallejo [California].  Would you go up there with me some day?"  And I said, "Yes."  So two or three months later, she called me one Sunday morning and I went every Sunday to a church somewhere.  I had my favorite ones but some morning's I'd go (unclear) I went with her.  It was a small house in Vallejo that had been converted.  All the walls had come out except in the back.  She kept the kitchen and the rest room and the rest of it had become a little sanctuary.  She had a husband and they owned a fish and poultry market at s- 6th and 16th Street--or 8th [Street] and 16th Street in West Oakland [Oakland, California].  And I enjoyed the service but I hadn't really met her and then I don't know why I felt the need to talk to her.  I guess it was after the divorce and Dick [Richard Bancroft] wasn't doing what he was supposed to do and there was, I got the (unclear) the income tax people were on my tail for his taxes and I was going to have to pay for it.  By that time he was remarried and gone on with a new life and I was so upset I didn't know what to do.  So I called Sandy [ph.] and I got the name and address and I went to see this woman and she told me that she had this little church so I start going up there and I would talk to her.  She was what she called a spiritualist.  She said, "I am not a fortune teller."  So the first time I went there, she told me, she didn't ask my name.  She told me, "Have a seat" and when she came back from washing her hands and doing whatever she did upstairs 'cause her husband had a--they had a fish and poultry market and she worked in it.  She sat me down and she said, "Just lean back and relax and then start talking."  And she said, "Tell me about yourself."  And I started telling her about myself and we talked about an hour and a half or two but she told me that my life was going to change real drastically.  She said, "You're in education.  I don't know what you do but you're in a program that gets money from the government and there is some funny business with (background noise) what you're doing and what the people at the district are doing."
Story_ID: 398630
Speaker 1: She told me to have a seat and relax and then she went upstairs and she came back and she started talking.  She didn't ask me any questions, she just start talking.  She said, "You've been crying a very lot.  You don't cry that much normally.  You've got an unhappy home situation."  I said, "Yeah, but it's not home anymore."  And she said, "Yes, it's yours.  And you need to do what you need to with your life."  She said, "You teach?"  And I said I did.  And she said, "Well, you working now?"  And I said--I have applied for a job and I'm about to go back to work as a teacher.  I was still doing the thing with McCall [McCall Corporation].  And she said, "Well when you retire and you've got a good future ahead of you and a long career, you're gonna be doing something very different than what you did before.  But you're ready for it."  She says, "You're going to school?"  I said, "Yes."  She said, "Go as far as you wanna go.  You'll be fine."  Then she told me about my sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] and my relationship with her and my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt].  I never asked--she never asked me if I had one she just started telling me.  And then she told me that the reason why I was so unhappy was I was living in the house that we had bought when I was married and I needed to divest myself of all of that.  And I said, "I'll lose money." She said, "You're gonna lose money whatever you do, just get rid of it as right soon as you can."  And I think that's the only time I cried 'cause I really liked the house but I thought about it and it was hard and I needed someone to share the cost and I tried having people live in and couldn't so I listened and I wrote a few notes down and when I got ready to go I said, "Do I owe you anything?"  She said, "No."  She said, "I'm not a fortune teller.  What I do is what I feel.  Some people I don't talk to at all because they don't have the right spirit."  She said, "But come and see me sometimes.  And come to my church sometimes if you'd like."  And she said, "Just remember that your father [William Merritt, Sr.] watches over you."
Speaker 2: Oh my heavens.
Speaker 1: And I said, "My father?"  And she said, "Yes.  He's red, he's bald haired and he has white hair like cotton around the bottom of his head.  And he--when he laughs he holds his stomach like this and he's smiling.  He wasn't smiling when you came in but he's smiling."  She said, "You're gonna be all right."  She said, "Tell me about your dad," and I started to cry.  And I said, "You got him."  She said, "Yeah he's right there on the stairs, you can't see him, but," she said, "it's all right you're gonna be all right because he'll always be there to watch over you."  Almost blew me away you know.  I didn't know what to say.  But I got ready to leave and I said, "Do I owe you anything?" And she said, "No.  This is God's work, this is not mine."  She said, "My husband and I run the store.  I do this just because every now and then somebody calls and I hear the distress in their voice.  I don't talk to everybody."  I sent people to her and she wouldn't have 'em.  She had one or two people that I sent over to talk to but sometimes she said, "No I'm sorry.  I can't--I've got my husband."  Anyway they both have died now.  But one of the best experiences I had after that was he was hit by a car in an accident and had to be hospitalized and I stayed over at her house with her for six weeks and we used to pray and talk together and she reinforced what I felt about myself and my own religious beliefs.

Speaker 1: I'd say she was one of the best influences in my life because I still remember things she said but she told me (laughter) that my life was gonna be very different than anything I ever imagined that my last days would be my best days but I have a whole lot of work to do before and I said, "What kind?"  She said, "I don't know, I don't know how education goes."  She said, "But you're gonna go from job to job to job almost to the point like people think you get pushed out but it's because you need to get to the next level."  And she said, "When you retire you'll have a wonderful life."  And I thought, oh you know that seemed like a long time away.  But she said you're gonna be fine.  I said so when I got ready to go; she said, "What's your name baby?"  And I told her and she said it over a couple of times.  And she said, "I'll remember it."  She said, "Call me sometimes."  Well I didn't call her for a very long time and then I had a thing happen at work one time and I didn't know what to do about it.  This was my first administrative job and phone rang maybe like ten o'clock at night and she was on the line.  And I said, "What's the matter?"  She said, "I don't know what you're doing now but it has to do with federal money.  You know something that you didn't know yesterday.  Don't say a word."  She said, "It will all be revealed and when it comes out you will understand it, but act as if you don't know anything that's happened."  I had just gone through my books and the books from the previous director in ESEA [Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965] and there was some discrepancies.  But I hadn't called her.  She said, "People always try and cheat the government.  You just keep two copies of anything you sign your name to."  She said, "Take the original home and keep the duplicate until they have to be sent to the government or wherever," she said, "but don't leave them in your file at work."  She didn't know what I was doing.  I did what she said.  And probably the second year I got a phone call one morning and one of the persons who work with me came in and he was ashy like this you know his skin all the color was gone.  And I said, "What's the matter?"  And he said, "I can't talk about it, I can't talk about it."  My phone rang and I had a call to go over to the man who was in charge of grants and outside money.  And I went over, but before I did, I asked for the file.  I had told my secretary, "Anything I sign, make two copies of.  I keep the original, you keep the copies."  So she gave me the copies and I went to the office of this man and he had his stuff all out and he said, "Well you know, Rena [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft], we've got a little problem here with your budget."  I said, "Oh?"  He said, "(Unclear)" and I said, "What was that again?"  I wrote it down so then I opened my folder and I said, "I assumed this position on July 1st, 19-," whatever year it was, "and everything I have signed is here.  I have copies of it.  I need to see your papers and I will show you what I have."  "Well you don't need to see--."  I said, "Well you're the one that transmits this things to the office--to Sacramento [California].  I have what I have signed.  Now I don't know what you have."  "Well now, now let's not get carried away."  And I said, "Are you about to--." He said something, "You know, you may, you may have to pay some money."  So I got my checkbook out and I said, "How much am I gonna have to pay?"  "Well it would be around two or three thousand dollars."  I said, "Good, go get your checkbook 'cause when yours hits the desk then I'll consider, but in the meantime you need to look at these books that I have.  These are my records.  I don't know what you have in your folder, but these are all the invoices requesting money that I have had against this account."  "Oh close it up," he said, "Don't, don't get upset.  I can work all this out."  I said, "I thought you would be able to.  Don't you wanna see what I have?"  "Oh no, no, no.  I can work it out over here."  He was gonna make me pay for his own stuff if I had not listened to what she said.  So I got to learn a lot from her.  She didn't even know what I was talking about.  When it was over and I told her, she said, "Baby, I don't wanna hear about it."  She said, "You just be prepared for things like that all along and be sure."  I brought my files home.  I brought the original copies home for years, years and years and nobody ever asked me anything else about money but people will try to do that to you when they think--it was my first administrative job and thank God I got through it.

Speaker 1: You ask about spirituality--I don't go to a church.  I have, I have not joined the church since I first came out here and I became disillusioned with that church but I never changed my membership, I stopped going.  I go to church now down here at Bethel [Bethel A.M.E. Church, San Francisco, California], which is close.  I enjoy the services.  I go to eight o'clock service.  Sometimes when Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] is here, I'll go with him up to Saint Mary's [Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption, San Francisco, California] for Mass.  I don't understand all of it but I get the music they have a magnificent organ and sometimes they have organ concerts and I walk up there and just sit in the back and listen.  I'm not Catholic.  I was Protestant but I still am Protestant but I have not joined the church.  But I have very strong feelings about how you deal with people every day because as Papa [William Merritt, Sr.] used to say your life is your own sermon you know.  Everybody looking at it could see what it's like and they can make their own opinion.  It's not their choice any way.  It's yours in the end.  And that's the way I try to live my life.  I don't hurt people.  I try to do what I think is right.  If I'm in doubt about somebody I just leave 'em alone.

Speaker 1: So then you, you became president of the community colleges [San Francisco Community College Centers]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I got a call about that.  I have a friend who is in politics and she had been on the community college board [San Francisco Community College Board] and she told me I needed to apply for that job.  We went walking.  We used to walk every Saturday morning and we were walking and she said, "You can't miss this one.  You better apply for it, it's just made for you."  I said, "No I'm not going, I'm not going.  I like what I'm doing."  I had just gotten this grant through my superintendent to do some work for my principals and I was all excited and I went to church to Mrs. Hayes' [ph.] church and there were only like seven or eight of us most Sundays and there was a man named Sam [ph.].  I'm gonna write a bo- not a book, write a piece about the man named Sam.  Sam had gone to eighth grade in Mississippi.  He ran away and joined the [U.S.] Army.  His father was abusive to him, his brothers and his mothers, his father used to pick up a two by four and hit him in the head with it.  He had some limited problems with talking sometimes because he had this damage due to his brain but if I went into that church and there was something bothering me, when church was over, Sam would say, "Sister Bancroft [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft]?" And I'd say, "Yes Sam?" "Something going on in your life; I wouldn't worry about it if I were you, but just pray hard 'cause there's something going on."  And that's what he would say and I'd say okay that's my sign.  He used to come h- he came here, he died since I lived here but I used to always have him for Christmas dinner.  'Cause all, all his family lived in Mississippi.  He worked for the naval shipyard [Mare Island Naval Shipyard] in Napa--or Vallejo [California], wherever it is.  He washed dishes.  Had the cleanest hands you'd ever seen.  He washed dishes for forty years and whenever I had my family for dinner or friends I'd send somebody to bring Sam.  He was always a part of what I did up unti- you know because he had no family.  He had a niece somewhere and she'd come once in a while but holidays I used to have big dinners and Sam was always here and he'd usually (laughter), he'd usually say grace but he liked wine.  He liked sweet wine and so my brother [William Merritt, Jr.] used to send me, he couldn't mail it.  North Carolina wouldn't let you ship it into California.  California won't take wine from other states unless okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes can't (unclear) wine.
Speaker 2: I had to sneak it back, I'd sneak it back and I'd bring him back musca--
Speaker 1: Muscatel?
Speaker 2: --muscadine.  No the grape, muscadine.--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --for some of them and this was a sweet wine made with muscadine grapes and I would hide it here until Sam got here and the last time he came over here, I had a different couch.  He sat there I gave him the bottle of wine when he got here for Christmas dinner.  By the time he pulled the cork out--I fixed the cork for him, he'd take a little sip and he'd put it beside the couch and he'd lean back and by the time the day was over, he had had consumed the whole, but he, he somebody brought him and so he went home.  But he was very special in my life too 'cause he could just decide that something was going wrong with me and he just come up and he didn't hug and kiss.  He didn't want you to touch him too much but he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he helped you to make the decision to become the college president?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  He told me in church that morning.  He said, "Stand up."  I stood up.  He said, "You had a fight with a friend today."  There's no way for him to know that.  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Stop fighting, fill out the papers and wait for it to happen."  And I said, "What?"  He said, "It's a new job you know that."  He said, "You'll be ready for it.  It's gonna be your most challenging job, it may be your last job.  Fill out the papers, take 'em in tomorrow.  Go over and get the papers, fill 'em out take 'em right back."  I went over that Monday, got the papers, signed them, the next day I had an appointment to meet with the board that evening, Tuesday evening.  And I went into the meeting with them.  While I was waiting, this Chinese man came out and we became good friends but he was--he ended up being my vice president (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Story_ID: 398634
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So how was it being president of the, of the colle- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Division [San Francisco Community College Centers]?
Speaker 1: --did you enjoy it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had a lot of trouble with the chancellor, Hilary Hsu.  He had a bachelor's degree and I was just about finish with my doctorate.  He had lived in the United States from the time he came here to go to college but I guess they have their classifications and there's a difference between the Mandarins and the Cantonese--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and he's Mandarin.  He was very snotty.  He had a great deal of trouble dealing with me.  I threatened him.  I didn't mean to but he, he watched me like a hawk.  And he made problems for me and I always solved them.  And I never said anything to him that was unhappy or nasty until one day he called me in about something silly and I was working on some reports that I had to get in.  And I told him I said, "You're keeping me from doing my work. You want those reports this afternoon you need to let me go back to my office."  Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] was there.  He called Burl in too.  And he started and started and started, finally I stood up and I said, "I'm not staying here to have you just rant like this.  If you have a reason to have me here, fine, but your papers will be on the desk by four o'clock, and I'm going back to finish."  And I walked on out.  And I finished the papers and I took them back over there at four o'clock and when we got a new chancellor, I don't know what happened with him and the board [San Francisco Community College Board], but the board released him and--
Speaker 1: Oh my.
Speaker 2: --demoted him to teaching in the business department at the downtown center.  And when the new chancellor came, I was demoted from whatever I was head--as president of the centers division and I was made the dean of the evening division and when I had to sign students who were coming in to take evening classes, the fo- former chancellor who'd been so mean to me hid in the corner until everybody had gone and then he came over for me to sign his payroll. So I see him once in a while but I stayed seven years there and that was it.
Speaker 1: Oh wow.
Speaker 2: Stayed 'til I was sixty-two (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what kind of things did you do?  Really?  What kinds of things did you teach, did you do there?
Speaker 2: I was an administrator.  I had the responsibility for seeing that they kept the budgets straight, that their students performed well, that they kept the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990] up because we were the cash cow for the district [San Francisco Community College District].  We got less money per student because we were non-credit but we had over sixty thousand students whereas city college [City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] only has something like twenty-three or twenty-four thousand so they got--their teachers got paid more than mine did, but we had three times as many students or maybe four times as many students, more than that anyway, we did all right, but my job was to keep my money because when I got there, he took 60 percent of the budget that came from the revenue created by that division and gave it to his own office for the gener- the district office running and then the rest of it went to the credit side.
Speaker 1: Oh my Lord.
Speaker 2: So we had to have a little agreement about that.  I got it upped a little bit.
Story_ID: 398635
Speaker 1: But they still take 'em (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Could you, could you explain what non-credit you say you were on the non-credit side was?  What does that mean exactly?
Speaker 1: It means that you can take courses, you can pay smaller fees and if you're working, some of them were free many of the non-credit classes were free, but they were not counted for college credits for transfer.  The transferrable credits were the ones that were called college classes not, not non-credit.  They were college classes for which you could transfer--with which you could transfer to the state universities or to state college or to any private college or university.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: We had some classes in our program that were terminal after two years.  Some were terminal after eighteen months, LVN, licensed vocational nurses.  We did them.  They had RNs [registered nurse] out at the main campus and theirs was a three-year program.  We had all of the trades, so I worked with the union leaders and job placement in evaluating programs to be sure that we were training people for the jobs they were applying--ironmongers, electricians, all of the tradesmen were a part of the apprenticeship program and they were what I had to work with, and then we had a high school program over at John Adams [John Adams Center, San Francisco, California] for people who were applying, gonna be going to college and needed to make up credits, or people who had never finished high school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was over there.  And then at Chinatown [Chinatown/North Beach Center, San Francisco, California] we had mostly English as a second language.  We had the largest English as a second language program in the state--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --next to Los Angeles [Los Angeles Community College District] and San Diego [San Diego Community College District].
Speaker 2: Oh my.
Speaker 1: San Jose [San Jose Community College District] outruns us now.  But at that time we had a lot of students who did not speak English and it was during the time that there was an influx of Russians.  Remember when the Russians--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --came in?  Okay we had a lot of them.  They didn't wanna be in classes with Chinese.
Speaker 2: Oh well okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was no--we didn't, we didn't cater to their needs but the way that they got around it was many of them were Jewish and the Jewish community center had space for classes and we always had had classes there in various subjects depending upon what people wanted.  You know it might have been painting, it might have been food de- food preparation whatever they could accommodate and sometimes there were languages taught.  We had after the Russians came in large amounts back in I don't know what year it was we had teachers who taught their classes 'cause that was the solution, teach the classes at the Jewish community center, they'll come.  We offer them at Chinatown where we had more space at the time, they wouldn't go.  They wanted their own classes.  And we had some evening classes at the junior high school over here.  It's not Presidio [Presidio Middle School, San Francisco, California], but it's over that way somewhere.  So we had classes night and day.
Speaker 2: Oh my.
Speaker 1: I usually worked in the morning shift and one of the assistants worked in the evening.  Once in a while I'd take a night shift just to go around and see the classes.  I always made it a point to visit all of the sites but we had classes in the community centers, not just that one but over at Ella Hutch--Ella Hill Hutch [Ella Hill Hutch Community Center], which is the one in the Fillmore District [San Francisco, California], and they were mostly sewing classes.  We had--we did classes on demand.  They had what they called--it was six-week program in starting your own business.  You know those were little extra classes.  We had a lot of little stuff like that in the evenings, most often at the Downtown Center [San Francisco, California], which is at 4th [Street] and Mission [Street].  They have a big sign now that says City College [City College of San Francisco, San Francisco, California] they didn't used to have.  But the centers were all over so they accommodated people all over.  Marina was very popular for languages.  We--they had the classes at Marina Junior High School [Marina Middle School, San Francisco, California], which is way out near the river, near the water.
Speaker 2: About how long were you president [of San Francisco Community College Centers]?
Speaker 1: I don't know, from the time I went there in '85 [1985] until the last year.  We got a new chancellor and he made me head of the evening division and the adult programs.
Speaker 2: You were also a consultant, right for, for--?
Speaker 1: Yes, I used to do that for the state.
Speaker 2: For the state?
Speaker 1: After I retired I visited schools at the request of the, the people at state who gave money to high schools under compensatory education back then so I evaluated the programs with the test scores and sat in on classes and talked to people.
Speaker 2: You have had this wonderful, wonderful career.
Speaker 1: It's been fun.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Is there anything else you'd like to add that we missed in your career?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I used to tutor kids just for fun--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --and then I got to a point I didn't do that--
Speaker 2: I understand.
Speaker 1: --'cause I needed to rest at night (laughter).  But when I was younger I used to tutor students over at one of those--
Speaker 2: Community centers?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 398636
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what do you think was impor- the most important thing to you about the way you lived it?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I think it's been a good life.  It's not a lift I would have imagined.  I wanted to get married and have six children and be a housewife and cook.  I like to cook and made bread and canned vegetables and fruits like my mother [Sadie Herring Merritt] did.  I never got to do that except I make fudge and give it to people and I don't do jelly and jams 'cause it's too much trouble any more.  But once in a while I'll get, see some berries and I think I'll make some jam and give it away as Christmas gifts.  I have always cooked my troubles away, so I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Really?
Speaker 2: --I enjoy having people in.  One of the things that I don't regret, it has been an adjustment.  I made the decision to leave the house and come here, had a very nice little house.  I loved it a lot.  I have a lot of dinner parties.  I have a lot of people in.  But last year I got rid of the dining table that used to open up for twelve people because I had three leaves and now I have that one and I can seat four people and if you get on your knees and pull the levers right, pop up would come up and you can sit six people.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I don't do it often, but I can do that.  And I don't have the dinner parties any more.  I changed the furniture around in here and got fewer places to sit (laughter) so it gives it more space and I like it and I guess I'm, I'm grateful that I have had a full life.  That my, my jobs have been jobs I felt I did well in.  I have good friends.  I'm very pleased to have some really close friends.  I have a good relationship with my family except every now and then when my sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] and I have to go toe to toe and I have to do that again, but I'll get it done in time and it'll all be all right.  I have enough money to do most of the things I want to do and the things that I can't do right away I save for.  I've always learned how to save and sometimes I laugh at my own little economist.  My mother could take a dollar and make George Washington cry before she would spend it.  I watched how she would do things and I do a lot of stuff that isn't necessary but it helps to keep my budget in order and nobody knows it but me.  It's only me to take care of.  I'm not a clothes horse.  I like nice clothes.  When I buy them, I buy nice clothes.  I keep 'em a long time that's why I got a closet full, I need to throw some out.
Story_ID: 398637
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Everybody has a few (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there anything you would like to have done that you didn't do?
Speaker 2: No, except have a child and as I said I could have done that or I could have adopted one.  I wanted David [ph.].  He was the child that I kept when his father [Richard Bancroft] and I divorced but my lawyer said that he's got two living parents so while you're happy and he's happy now, he's going into his teen years pretty soon and then you'll have a problem.  He didn't understand it.  He thought I rejected him and I haven't seen him for ten maybe more years but I made the decision that I needed to stop having him come and spend time with me because it was always hard for him to say goodbye and for me.  He was not happy in the situation he had to go to but that was his real mother and I, I decided I couldn't do that.  So I guess overall I've had a good life.  And I don't feel bad about it.  I don't feel that--I ask, I asked one of my friends the other day, she's a young woman, very bright.  She does investments and she's put some of my money into stuff and I haven't told her I just called her and ask for a big chunk the other day and then I thought why did you do that?  And the last time I took money out she didn't like it.  And I said I'm seventy-four years old and if I die and I haven't anything left invested, that's all right.  You can sell the place I live here.  It's worth at least a half a million dollars.  It's worth a little more than that but there's enough to take care of me if I die.  And if I don't have enough, I paid enough taxes to go into a home and get some relief.  But I hope it never comes to that.  I don't expect it to, that I think I can take care of myself with what I put aside.  But the future does not frighten me.  Dying doesn't frighten me.  You know I think it's been a good life.  I'd like to be around another ten, fifteen years but I don't worry about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 398638
Speaker 1: What are your plans for the future?  What would you like to do?
Speaker 2: The only place I haven't been in traveling that I want to go is to South Africa.  Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] and I have done a lot of traveling but he doesn't travel well any more.  It's hard for him.  And I wouldn't put him through that.  If I feel I could go away and leave him for about a month, I'd go, but at this point I don't think I can.  So someday I'll get to South Africa.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: But if I don't it's all right, I'll be all right.  When I go, I go home I did something that some people think was silly, but I bought a house in North Carolina, and I keep it up and I'm not there but maybe five, six weeks out the year.  But the lights are on, the heat's there, the air conditioner works whenever I walk in.  My cousin lives across the street.  There's a gardener who keeps the yard straight.  I keep a car there.  It's a 1996 or '7 [1997] (laughter) Ford Taurus, goes just fine.  I drove it from North Carolina to New Jersey for that wedding for that child (laughter).  Burl was surprised.  He said, "How you gonna get there?"  I said, "We're gonna drive."  He says, "What do you mean you're gonna drive?"  I said, "We're gonna get up early one morning and we're gonna drive.  Put your clothes in the bag or hand 'em up whichever way.  Hang 'em up if you want to.  Take your tux because it's a formal wedding and we out of here."  And I drove to Washington [D.C.].  We stayed at a Marriot Courtyard [Courtyard by Marriott], not far from where my sister [Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell] lives and we picked her up the next morning and I drove the rest of the way to New Jersey.  And when the wedding was over, we spent two or three days up in Jersey and then we came back, dropped my sister off and then drove back and left the car in the garage at home.  That's, that's happiness for me, to sit on the back porch.  I got pictures of Burl sitting out with the umbrella.  We eat out on the little patio sometimes in the morning.  Only thing we can't do is have our glass of wine in the evening because you can see from the street our little patio on the back and people at home don't understand when you have, I put it out there anyway, I put my little bottle of wine out there and we have our little glass of wine before dinner.  But a couple of people have said, "You have a wine bottle out there every day?"  I say, "Yeah.  You know I don't drink it every day.  Don't drink the whole bottle every day, but yes I have wine at dinner sometimes."  But it's, it's good to have a place to go and to enjoy it.  I have a picture of the house up there.  It was built by one of my mother's [Sadie Herring Merritt] friends and one of my special people.  It's twenty one hundred square feet.  It's a little brick cottage with two bedrooms and two baths and a double garage and a den.  I'm gonna do the kitchen over.  It's supposed to be being done now.  I didn't like her kitchen.  She wasn't a cook.  But I like to cook so I just dropped a whole bunch of money buying new equipment for a kitchen that I may get to cook in five weeks out of a year.  But if that's the way I wanna spend my money, that's the way I wanna spend it.  My nephew in New Jersey, my sister's son, has keys to it.  I'd really like to see him move there.  He lives in Washington.  He has those two children.  They're back there on that table on the way out and he'll get most of what I have, not all of it.  I have some other nephews too, but he knows that house will be his.  I gave him keys last year and I said, "Come down on weekends."  The kids are so glad to be there.  He has one that's four and one that's eight and the little girl just runs back and forth across the backyard.  They can't do that in Washington where they live.  They live on a hill in one of those sloping front yards and the steep stairs that go down.  He finally put a bar to hold on because the first time I came down those stairs, I said, "I can't do this.  Somebody has to walk in front of me" because you know how some--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --so he likes it.  He likes what he's doing there.  He works in real estate in property management but I thought about leaving one room here for me and then renting the rest of it.  But I don't wanna do that.  And as long as I can hold out and met--and keep the both of them I will.  I don't think I'll ever live down there full-time but I don't know.  If something happened to Burl and I decided I wanted to go home, I could live there.

Speaker 1: What values do you consider to be the most important values you have?
Speaker 2: (Pause) That's a hard one to answer because a lot of people think I'm very rigid.  And I am about the principles that are important to me.  Lying, you know, cheating, none of those things I wanna have any part of.  Gossip, a little for fun every now and then, but nothing serious.  I'm basically--try to live the way that my parents [Sadie Herring Merritt and William Merritt, Sr.] raised me and once in a while when something comes up I think, well what would they think and so that, that really controls my behavior still even though I'm seventy-four years old.  There are times when I think now, what would Mama think of this or what would Papa think of this, and that kind of helps me to decide whether it's something I want to be involved in or not.  I don't belong to a lot of organizations.  Aunt Rena [Rena Hawkins] was an organization person and so I don't like to get caught up in social clubs and groups and things.  So some people think I'm--I don't know what they think, but I don't join their groups (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't care (laughter).
Speaker 2: It doesn't bother me.
Story_ID: 398640
Speaker 1: I have always had enough friends to get invited to the things that I want to go to if I'm not a member of the organization.  The only social organization I'm involved in is my sorority.  I was a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority].  I joined Alpha Chapter at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I wasn't active for thirty years.  After I retired maybe even more than that, I decided to--I affiliated with the Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] chapter once back in the '60s [1960s] and they squabbled over so many silly things at that time, it wasn't worth it for me.  So when I decided to become active again, I joined the graduate chapter down in San Mateo [California] where I knew more people and I'm very happy and we're a small group but we work well and I've been active with them for the past ten or twelve years and I usually work on the scholarship committee and I just got a call today about something I hadn't taken care of because we give our scholarships the first--second Sunday in May and I have to find--you don't know anybody young who is talented that we could give some money to?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'll think about that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause we do the scholarship.  I just--up until this year I interviewed students for Cal and I enjoyed it but Ms. Mary Ellen [HistoryMaker Mary Ellen Butler] got promoted and she appointed another woman and I really believe that she--my reason for being on it was because of Effie Lee [HistoryMaker Effie Lee Morris] and Donald Ray Young.  Do you remember Donald Ray Young?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: He used to work for the Sun Reporter.  He died of diabe- dia- the ravages of diabetes on his body, but he had been on that committee.  They have a program called the Incentive Awards Program and I contribute to it and so last--for the last two years or three I've screened for their students for scholarships.  I don't think Roberta [Roberta Joyner] likes me and she took over.  Mary Ellen is still the boss but she runs that program.  So they didn't ask me to interview this year and I was a little hurt.  I'm going to write Mary a little letter but it's gone now but I just wanted to know that I really enjoyed it and I met young people and we helped some of with was the sorority because we had money to give too.  But I don't, I don't really worry about the rest of it.  Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.] and I have a busy life.  He has a lot of things he has to go to and I have a lot of things I have that are on my agenda, so we stay busier than we want to most of the time.
Speaker 2: That's good, that's good.
Speaker 1: And so I don't have any problems up to now.
Story_ID: 398641
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What would you like your legacy to be?  How would you like to be remembered?  This is a strange question.
Speaker 2: That I did the best I could with whatever I was involved with for all of my life.  I help out with church every once in a while.  I did most of the times things I do for people only the people that do it that got--were recipients of whatever I tried to do know it.  But that's the way it's supposed to be.
Story_ID: 398642
Speaker 1: You have a wonderful story to tell.
Speaker 2: I was writing one just now when you were talking to Burl [HistoryMaker Burl Toler, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: One year I did a Rockefeller [Rockefeller Foundation] internship up in Portland [Oregon] and sometimes when I'm thinking back on my life, I'll think of a specific incident and I write down--what it is and then when I have some time like this morning, I jot it down.  I went to a meeting with the superintendent and his staff in Portland, I was never late.  He was very fussy about time.  I got stuck in the traffic going across the bridge.  Portland's northeast, southeast, northwest, northeast and if you get on one of those bridges and can't get across, you can't get across (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You get stuck, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so I was late getting to the meeting and when they asked why, I said there were cows on Morrison Bridge and one of the administrators said, "Ha, that's the silliest answer I've ever seen to this day, what an excuse is that?"  I said, "It isn't an excuse, it's an explanation.  There were cows on Morrison Bridge." But I said to Dr. Blanchard [ph.], "Excuse me, Dr. Blanchard, I did not mean to be late but I couldn't get across."  And so we went on with meeting.  About ten minutes later, one of the area superintendents came in and they said, "Hope your excuse is better than Rena's [HistoryMaker Rena Bancroft]."  And somebody said, "Well what was--?" He said, "What was, what was Rena's excuse?"  And he said, "She said there were cows on Morrison Bridge."  And he said, "There were cows on Morrison Bridge."  And then they looked around and of course everybody looked up to Will [ph.], you know, he wouldn't be lying.  "Cows on Morrison Bridge?"  And he said, "Yes."  They were transporting some cattle and the back came loose and the cows were out on the bridge.  I had seen them.  I didn't say a word.  I just sat there with my mouth closed.  And they straightened him out.  Nobody apologized to me for laughing, but I thought about that today and I started writing about the cows on Morrison Bridge because it's not the person who tells the truth all the time, it's the people who want to believe what they want to believe.  And I don't know how I'm gonna end it.  But anyhow I wrote the basic story down while you were talking to Burl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So one of these days I'll publish some of this foolishness that I scribble.
Speaker 1: No I would be very, very interested in reading your book.  I think you--
Speaker 2: It would just be sketches.
Speaker 1: Well, that's wonderful.  They were wonderful stories.

Our mother, Sadie Herring Merritt, my sister, Bertha Georgetta Merritt Campbell now, got her degree in library science, so she got a bachelor's degree the same year I got a high school diploma.  It was 1948.
Speaker 2: This was 1968 starting from the left Rena Merritt Bancroft, my mother, Mrs. Sadie Herring Merritt, and my sister, Dr. Georgetta M. Merritt Campbell.  We tried to do the same pose as we had done twenty years earlier with Mama in the center and us on the same sides.
