 Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  We are here in the Angie Debo Room. It is January 8, 2001. We are  preparing to interview G.D. Clair and Mrs. Hazel Allen of Stillwater,  Oklahoma. We can maybe just start out with where you were born, Mrs. Allen,  and maybe when if you choose to give that information.  I was born May 22, 1915, in Beaver County, Oklahoma. At that time, my  father was proving up claim, 80 acres. You have to live on the place. There   s  not much in a way of trees or anything where you can have lumber, so those  people had a dugout. The story goes that I was born in that dugout. Sometime  later my folks moved to Kansas. This was in 1915 and the dust bowl years  didn   t start until quite a lot later than that.  Right, the dirty thirties.  The dirty thirties, and they were dirty.  Do you remember any dugout days at all?  No, because my grandpa was a builder, and he built a house for my folks.  When I was not quite two the family moved to Kansas for a few years, and  then they came back. When I was fourteen, my mother died. The next year, I  think it was, that the dust bowl days started.  In Beaver County? You were there? You came back to Beaver County.  Yes. It was mean, meaner than a snake  laughter . When you think that those  people out there were farmers that depended on their livestock. You depended  on the cream that you got from the milk that you milked from your cows every  day and the eggs from your chickens for your grocery money. Then you just  stand out there and you see everything blowing away, nothing green. Your  cattle are starving, your chickens aren   t laying anymore eggs; it   s pathetic. It   s  discouraging. That   s the only income you had. If you didn   t happen to have  some money in the bank, you were up the creek without a paddle.  There wasn   t much money.  It went on day after day after day. Then, when I got into the workforce I went  to work for the Southern Great Plains Field Station in Woodward. Part of their  5  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Kite  Clair  business was to show the people how to get around those dust storms, how to  control them. I   ll always remember, it was during that time too that people  were changing from horsepower to tractor power. There was a man who came  into the field station to talk to our fellas about the land. Of course, if we had  known when we first went out there that there were some tracts of land you  should never have touched with a plow. It was sandy, and it blew instantly.  They didn   t know that. People at the field station were trying to tell them that  if you have a field that   s been used and the wind is blowing the topsoil away  go out there and work it up. When land has been worked it doesn   t blow like it  does when it has a clean sweep.  Work it up by filling it up and breaking it up.  Yes. So this man came in and the people were telling him to go out there and  work his land, and every time it smoothes out to go out and work it again. He  listened through all that, and finally he said,    You know, you guys are working  for the government. You   ve got all kinds of money; you don   t have to worry  about a thing. You can go out there and plow up every day if you want to. I  don   t have money for gasoline, and I just can   t do it.    Then he stomped out in  a towering rage. There were many of them like that. They couldn   t afford to  plow up their land again. Those that used horsepower didn   t have pastureland.  There was no pasture there. Tumbleweeds, great big old thistles that blew in  the wind, would get lodged in a fence. After a while other things would get  stuck in there with it. The next thing you knew, that was all full of sand and  the fence was covered up. The livestock could walk right over the top.  The next thing you knew, cattle were everywhere.  Then the government bought a lot of their cattle out there, and encouraged the  people to can the meat because there was a shortage of food. You just didn   t  have any money for anything. I   ll always remember one day my grandmother,  they lived in a nice two-story house, had Sunday dinner. There was a white  tablecloth on the table, and everything was real nice. Just as we set down to  eat that storm hit. On that particular date, there were storms every day or two.  By the time we got through eating and were picking up our dishes everywhere  you saw where a dish had set there was a ring. There was that much dust on a  white tablecloth. There was no plumbing, no electricity. People did have wall  telephones. If you did laundry or took a bath or whatever, you carried that  water from the well to your house. People didn   t have a shower every day.  They didn   t have a bath every day. You had a bath once a week, whether you  needed it or not  laughter . And you wore your clothes all week. When we  were in school we had clothes that we wore to school and when we got home  we changed clothes into our    growdies   . We wore that outfit all week. Those  dust storms just devastated the country, and blew away a whole lot of topsoil  that is now up and down the rivers or wherever.  At the bottom of the ocean, maybe.  Some of it went as far as New York City, you know.  6  Allen  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  Kite  Allen  Clair  Lemons  There was the one storm that was what they called the black storm, and it came  in from the west. We think from Colorado. My husband, of course at that  time we were teenagers, he and his brother had gone hunting that morning, and  they were on horseback. My husband had a German Shepherd dog named  Ranger, who always went with them. They got quite a long ways from home  and that storm hit. You couldn   t see your hand in front of your face. It was as  black as the ace of spades. They couldn   t find their way back, so they got off  their horses and put a rope on the dog, and he brought them home.  The dog led them home, huh?  The dog brought them home.  What a story.  At that time the air was so thick with dust in the house that you had to hang a  wet sheet or a wet towel over the windows to catch that dust so you could  sleep at night. That   s how bad it was. Everything you had was full of dust.  In those days, when they made the buildings, they would make the windows  just like any house. They   d make them so they   d go up and down. As the dust  bowl came in and took all of the moisture out of the air the wood started  shrinking. That left quarter-inch cracks in all of the windows. The dust really  came in then, much more. There were times when they   d hang the wet sheets  out, and they   d fall down just by sheer weight. Then they   d have another one  ready to go. The houses just had cracks everywhere.  You didn   t have a four-bedroom house; you had a four-room house. That   s if  you were lucky. A lot of people just had a two-room house. You guys can   t  visualize such a thing, but raise a family of five kids in a four-room house that  had a glassed in back porch. My mother used to make it a house rule for us  kids to pick up our toys and put them away. She   d say,    If God would happen  to come in the night, I don   t want him to step on your things.     Laughter  She  had a method to her madness. She didn   t want to have to pick those things up  or have to step on them herself during the night.  She put the fear of God in you to pick up your toys.  Yes. And as I say, you depended on your cream. You milked your cows  every morning and every night. You fed the calves and chickens. You  depended on the eggs and the cream for your grocery money. You didn   t go  into a grocery store and find all of the wonderful fresh foods that you find  now. You found potatoes and maybe some cabbage and maybe some turnips  and some things like that, but to find lettuce or fruits and bananas and that sort  of thing, in the winter time you didn   t find that.  In the area where I was at     Which area did you grow up in?  7  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Clair  I grew up in Knowles. Do you know where Knowles is?  Yes.  Back then Knowles did not have electricity at all. The whole countryside  didn   t have electricity, and so the grocery stores, for meat, every Saturday  night, the grocery man and my dad were good friends, so they would go out  with two or three others and ice down an old tub full of pop and beer. They  waited until dark, and then they   d go out on the range and pick out a cow or a  calf and they would shoot him. They   d have the eight-frame on the truck, so  they   d string it up. They would let it bleed and then they would go ahead and  skin it on out. My job was to hold the lantern. About ten o   clock I gave out,  so they   d stuff me in the back seat and put a blanket in the back of the pickup  and finish the job. They   d finish about eleven o   clock at night. They did that  because of the flies-it kept the flies down when they butchered at night. That  was Friday nights when they did the butchering. They hauled that back to my  dad   s place, which he had a service station.  He had the only electricity in the area because he had what they call a Delco  meter. It was a cast-iron generator, and he owned a service station right on the  corner. He was very popular because he had iced beer boxes. The old farmers  didn   t have any money. Beer was about a nickel a bottle, and so was gas. My  job was to pump up the gas in the tanks. They would buy a nickel's worth of  gas in their old Model-A   s just to get back and forth to the house. Back to the  meat building, we   d bring this in and cut four or five great big, nice steaks off  of it. My mother would stay up until one o   clock in the morning cooking the  steaks for them. Fresh meat, they didn   t care. It didn   t have to age; it was  meat. The rest of it they would take down to the grocery store, and they had  these big glass-cased ice boxes. In the meantime somebody had gone to  Beaver. That   s about 30 miles away from Knowles. They had the ice plant  there. They would bring the ice in great big 100-pound blocks on the back of  the pickup wrapped in blankets. Back at the grocery store, they would chip  that all up and cover the meat. Saturday and Monday we had meat in the  grocery store. Outside of that it was gone. Everybody knew that Saturday and  Monday was meat time. You were talking about the grocery store there. I was  young, seven then, but I can remember so much of it. The grocery store man  and my dad were good friends, so I got the job of dusting off the cans in the  grocery. That kept me real busy with the feather duster because it would come  in faster than I could get rid of it. That   s the way they had their meat. The  biggest problem they had was keeping dust out of things like peanut butter. If  you bought peanut butter it came in a barrel, and you   d take a big brown  wrapping paper and they   d give you a couple of scoops, wrap it all up, and  hand it to you. If you didn   t get the lid back on it, then the next customer had  a little grittier peanut butter  laughter .  Extra crunchy  laughter .  I can remember living there for about the first year and a half before the dust  storm came. I went to school in Knowles, and then I later went to school in  8  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Kite  Clair  Beaver. When the storms came we could see it coming. It would be just death  quiet. They would give us masks to put on, and then they   d send us home.  We went right home. As soon as you got there, a little breeze would come up,  and then it   d start. It   d pick up and just get black. You couldn   t see the gas  pumps. Like she said, you couldn   t see the hand in front of your face. It   d go  on for four or five hours and maybe all night long. The next morning, the  mornings were always death quiet. Everything had settled. Like she also said,  maybe we   d come back at ten o   clock the next day or maybe it   d skip a day.  When it came, you knew when it was coming. Like she said, the farmers were  destitute because they couldn   t raise a crop. My father owned the service  station, and he had a tank truck. He would sell gasoline to the farmers for their  plowing and all that. Back then everybody had a charge account. Well, it got  in the middle of the dust bowl and there wasn   t anything growing, there wasn   t  any moisture, and the farmers owed my father, which broke him. It broke  everybody.  Everybody went broke.  These farmers were friends of his, and they would come in and actually lay  their deeds to their farms down on his counter. They   d say,    I can   t pay that,  Cliff. I don   t know what you   re going to do with it, but you   re welcome to my  farm.    He   d give it back to them and say,    I don   t have any use for it  whatsoever, and I   m leaving.    25, 30 years later my father went through there,  and the ones that stayed, all those farms that he could have had, they hit oil all  over that part of the country. They didn   t get any water for the crops, but there  sure was a lot of oil.  Did you know somebody out there named Dickson?  That doesn   t ring a bell. Now my aunt taught school there, Maxine Davis.  The Davis family came from Iowa in a covered wagon, and that   s how she got  there. She was my second grade school teacher. You didn   t know a Davis.  I   ve often wondered about that.  No, but my sister married a man from Knowles, and his name was Dickson.  Oh, okay. Well, like I say, I was about seven years old. I remember a lot of  the country, a lot of the ways, but I don   t remember any names. There   s one  name that just pops out every time I think about that area, and he had a  gasoline company, Groendyke. They   re very big now. The old Groendyke  and my dad were good friends. He started in Buffalo. He would bring the  tank truck up to my dad   s station. That   s how we got to know him.  I saw one of their trucks just the other day.  Yeah, they   re all over this state.  I see them too, yeah.  9  Kite  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  They started in Buffalo? I didn   t know that.  Buffalo, yeah.  My husband   s cousin used to drive one of their trucks.  Oh, is that right? Yeah, I actually remembered him delivering gas up there.  Competition was pretty bad, so my father had three big above ground gasoline  tanks. He had what they call ethyl in one them, regular gas in another, and  then they had coal oil or kerosene in the other one. It got a little touchy;  everybody was trying to make a nickel so to speak, so he would mix the high-test  gas with the kerosene, and beat everybody by about a penny. The Model-  A   s is all we had, so they   d run and the tractors would run. We had very few  big Buicks back then, but we had a few of those. We had several clans of  gypsies come through in the big black cars, the LaSalles and the big Buicks,  and they would have three or four carloads of those. They would hit a  business district like Knowles, the downtown area. Everybody would say,     The gypsies are coming, lock the doors.    Everybody locked their doors, and  if you didn   t they would swarm in your store, bundle up everything, and just  walk out the door with it.  Did they actually shop lift?  No.  They   d just walk in.  They just cleaned you out.  Do you remember the same gypsy stories and things?  Yes.  Do you know where they would come from?  Some of them would come through by my grandparents    place, and grandma  would try to feed them.  She would actually open her doors to them?  Yeah, she would try to give them some food because she felt like   well they  would tell her, that they were hungry.  They   ll take your chickens and cows. A lot of people tried to be nice to them,  but they were tough.  In those days too, there   s a vast difference between the medical world now,  and what it was then. If you needed a doctor, you called, and he came to your  house. If there was a baby to be delivered, he delivered that baby in your  10  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Kite  Clair  Kite  Clair  Allen  Kite  Allen  Clair  house. If you became ill enough to where you had to go to the hospital and the  neighbors found out about it, they got all set to go to your funeral. The  hospital was not all that great. If you were sick enough, because all of the  families had some kind of a doctor book, and they used that all of the time.  Oh you bet.  If you were sick enough to where you had to go to a hospital, well, there  wasn   t much hope for you.  You were in bad shape.  We had a hired hand one time, and I went out to the barn and found him out  behind the barn all done up in a knot. He was so sick and in such pain that he  could hardly talk. I ran and told mother about it, and she called the doctor.  They put him in the hospital. The whole neighborhood just knew that he was  going to die. He had a ruptured appendix, and he got well, but people just  didn   t believe that he could do that.  I don   t want to get off the gypsies just yet.  Okay. They   re not really a predominant part of the story, but they are part of it  because they came through the area.  I was wanting to talk a little bit about hobos or tramps that might have come  into the area, and how your family reacted to that.  We had a lot of those.  Very carefully.  Tramp knocking on the back door?  Some of them would do chores for you, for some food, but you were real  careful because some of them were criminals. You didn   t know whether they  would kill you or not.  Right across the street from my dad   s service station was a railroad. It had a  spur right there because they put the coal cars in it. That   s how everybody  heated out there; except for like my folks were well to do and they had  kerosene stove. There wasn   t anything to burn out there. There wasn   t any  natural gas that you had, so they brought in coal by the tray loads, just  shoveled it off. A lot of those hobos would get off the trains there. We were  right across the street. In the summer time, again like she said, we didn   t have  air conditioning or electricity, so you had to leave your windows up so you  could get some air, but it was still hot. They   d come poking around over there  looking for something, and we happened to have a German Shepherd dog. It  took care of all of the hobos and anybody else. When the lights went out, that  was it. I mean, you step on that property and he would keep you right there.  11  Kite  Allen  Kite  Clair  Kite  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Did Ranger eat some hobo stew sometimes?  All he had to do was just kind of give them a dirty look. He was a beautiful  dog, but he knew what he was doing. He didn   t put up with any monkey  business from anybody else. You could play with the kids, but all you had to  do was take one look and you knew he meant business.  Both times dogs kept tramps away.  Oh I think so, yeah. My mother used to feed a lot of them though. She really  had a soft heart. When she finally moved to Enid years after, there were still  hard times from the    38   s and    39   s, and that   s where we relocated. We were  downtown in the city area again, and we   d have hobos come up to the back  doors all the time, banging on the door. Mom would always feed it. They had  a mark they put on the telephone pole in the alley, which is an easy hit, so all  the future hobos that would come along the alley would spy the mark on the  pole and run up to the back door, banging on the door.  Do you remember what that mark looked like?  No, I don   t.  I think that they were not all alike.  No, I don   t think so either.  I think they just made a mark of some kind.  They made their own mark for the next time they came back through, and  other hobos picked it up; there   s a mark. I guess they thought you couldn   t  lose anything by knocking on the door. What might be an interesting story,  too, is back in those days they had bone yards, much like we have metal  salvage yards. There was open range all over that part of the country. I don   t  think I saw very few fences, except the ones that had cattle to keep them in.  There was a vast amount of open range. I   d take my wagon and my dog, I was  seven years old. You wouldn   t let a child that age do that now; they   d take the  child away from you, abuse or whatever. We   d go two or three miles out in  the middle of nowhere, and the dog would let me know where the rattlesnakes  were. He   d ruff at them, and most of the time they would run. We   d pick up  bones. I picked up a lot of buffalo skulls and all kinds of bones where people  had butchered out there or they had died and the coyotes had cleaned them up.  Then I   d haul that wagon clear back. Across the street of the railroad tracks  was the coal depot, and on the other side was this bone yard. It was three and  four stories high and a block long full of white bones. They would take those  bones and load those on the cars and haul them out of there to go make bone  meal out of them somewhere I guess. I would take maybe 15 wagonloads over  maybe a week or two. I didn   t do it everyday. I   d ask them,    Have I got there  yet?       Not quite yet.       Okay.    I   d go get another wagonload. Finally, after  about 15 wagonloads, I   d get a nickel. That was pretty good money then.  12  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Kite  Clair  Allen  Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  High finance.  On down from that, straight down about three blocks, was the main center of  Knowles. In the center of the street was about a ten-foot in diameter hand-dug  well, and that   s where everybody got their water. Everybody went there,  lowered their buckets down, would bring the buckets up and fill the water up.  We were fortunate enough to have a windmill on our backyard. Those days,  everybody banded together. I don   t care who you were. I don   t think many of  them declared any enemies. We were a mass of people that were destitute and  they were just helping each other any way that they could. If you had  something, they   d share it with you.  One of the things about the telephone is each one had a separate ring to it.  You might have two shorts, you might have a short and a long, you might have  two longs and a short, and then there was what they called the general ring. It  was a series of shorts. When there was a carload of coal in town there   d be a  general ring. Everybody was told that there was a carload of coal in town or a  carload of whatever they were selling or delivering in town that the people  would be interested in. There would also be an empty car come in, so if you  wanted to ship something out it would be there for you. Then, of course, when  somebody gave a ring, like my ring was a long and two shorts, everybody  could hear it. If they wanted to eavesdrop they could do it  laughter .  And they did, too.  You bet they did.  Now it   s confession time.  You   d better watch what you said on the phone.  You better be careful what you   re saying on the phone. If a family was in  trouble, if we had a fire or something like that, you gave the general ring, and  everybody came to help you. There was the good and the bad about it. That  was the only connection we had. That was before we had electricity. In the  summertime there was no such thing as air conditioning.  That   s something I can   t imagine.  You   d get up early in the morning, get your housework done, and close the  windows down to keep the heat out. Of an evening, the kids slept on the floor  in front of the door where it was the coolest.  We slept out on the porch.  Sometimes you slept outside.  Nobody ever bothered you. You wouldn   t do that today, but back then a lot of  bodies were on the porches, but there was nobody in the morning time. Like  13  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  she was saying about the air conditioning, I think one of the most pitiful things  that happened out there, like she mentioned, when you went to the hospital you  were in serious condition. If you weren   t before you got there, well you were  after you lived there for a while  laughter . The thing that you could  remember most of all was no air conditioning. All the windows were up, and  so all the hot air would blow in. They didn   t have anesthesia like they do now,  Demerol or whatever. They gave you a shot and you   re out. It was ether, and  ether carried on forever. You could walk in the door of a hospital and just get  sick smelling ether, every time you went to one. Every one of them was the  same way. I never will forget that smell. If you weren   t sick before you got  there, you certainly were after you   d been there for a few days.  We have come from a world you have never known and will never know,  praise God. You are going into a world that we have never known and will  never know. We   ve come a long way. When you think the roads out there  were terrible, they were mostly trails. My grandparents lived in a house that  was a Sears Roebuck house. It came in sections like they have now. People  think they have something new now; it   s not new. It was a two-story house.  When the folks were in Illinois, they had a three-story house, but it burned to  the ground. When grandpa built this house he decided he   d make it fireproof.  He covered the outside with rolls of tin that had places on them that made  them look like bricks. He put a corrugated tin roof on it. Shake, rattle, and  roll, let me tell you. That wind, ever so often, would blow it loose enough to  where you   d have to have somebody go up there and nail it down.  They didn   t have insulation up there either.  Oh no, no, no, no. That house was built for a house that had plumbing. The  bathroom was at the head of the stairs. It had everything in it but a bathtub. It  was a storage room for them. The roads were terrible. If it rained, it was one  royal mess of ruts and mud and one thing or another. You went to country  school. We went to Bluegrass School, and rode horseback. You carried your  lunch, and you had a little pack of grain for your horse. You put your horse in  a shed, and that was the way it was. Nobody thought anything about it. The  teacher, in those days, she was also the janitor.  The fire maker.  Yes. And the disciplinarian. Let me tell you, if you didn   t behave in those  days and you got in trouble at school, you had big trouble at home.  It was insulting your family. That   s what they   d tell you.    You mean you   d  insult our family name?    Boy, they   d give you another one. The principal had  all the authority in the world to paddle you.  You better believe it.  You knew when you got home you were going to get another one. Your dad  or mom would hear about it in two or three days, one way or another, so you  14  Kite  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Clair  might as well go home and confess and get ready.  You sound like you   ve had some experience in that area.  Oh yes, I have  laughter . The classes were nice back then, everybody studied.  You had all eight grades in one room. One teacher for all eight grades. Then  maybe a total of what in a class, 35?  Yeah, 25, 30.  The nice part of it was, let   s say that she was holding class for the fourth grade  here. You all came up to the front to recite, but those back there in the back  could listen and hear what was being said. You were learning things at that  time. It   s not like it is now. They had double seats. There were two set  together, and you   d better behave yourself or you were in big trouble. If you  had the misfortune of sitting with someone you didn   t like very well, well.  Get used to it because that was the way it was going to be.  That was tough. You just behaved anyhow.  If you were talking, low talking I mean, or whispering, Miss Locke, she was  my math teacher, would slip right in back of you and just get right a hold of  my ear like that. Then she   d just start picking it up and take you right out in  the hall  laughter . She   d just hold right on to that ear. Then she   d talk to you,  and then you   d go back and sit down. Your ear hurt for maybe two days.  They didn   t have any qualms straightening out kids then.  If they got after you once and you didn   t behave, then you came up and stood  on the floor. You had to stand by the teacher   s desk and face the audience, and  stand there for however long the misdemeanor was. If that didn   t work, then  came the paddle. It was super.  All of them had holes in them. I don   t know why they drilled holes in them,  but they all did.  More aerodynamic  laughter .  But our teacher, like you say, taught grades through eighth grade. It was real  funny. He had to go down to the basement to choke up the boiler and get some  more coal on it. When he left he would say,    I can hear everything that   s  going on in this class through the ventilators right up there while I   m down in  the basement. You   d better be good. When I come back it   s going to be study  time, and I don   t want to hear a word. I don   t want to hear a question.    He   d  say that everyday. He   d go down there soaking up the room. When he came  back there was a great big chaw right there. That   s why he didn   t want  anybody talking  laughter . Pretty quick he   d get enough of it, and then  somebody would start to ask him a question and he would go huh-uh. That  15  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  meant shut up. After he got done he   d go downstairs and fix the furnace again.  Then he   d come back and he   d be all right until his next chaw.  You were talking about the roads out there. The 64 Highway was gravel, from  Buffalo clear up to the intersection that was down in Beaver. While my dad  was there, the year before the dust bowl, they decided to blacktop that road. It  was a big undertaking. They were quite a ways away from everybody, as far  as motels. There weren   t that many motels back then, so they brought the train  cars out on the sites.  They hadn   t heard of motels in them days.  No, cabins they called them. They would bring their train cars out, three or  four train cars, bunk cars, and feeding cars. They   d work on that highway all  day long, and then at night they   d bunk up and get their food over there. If  they were close enough to some kind of a stream or a river, like Beaver River  comes down through that part of the country, that   s where we were talking  about the Sand Plums growing, just whirls and whirls of Sand Plums. They  make just delicious jelly, but back then you didn   t have enough money to buy  the sugar was the problem we had. Still, they made Sand Plum jelly. That   s  where everybody would go Sunday to take their bath, except in the wintertime.  The little stream was probably two feet deep by twelve foot wide.  You had more fun playing in the water.  Oh gosh, yeah. It was sandy because they   d washed the topsoil off. That was  the recreation area. Everybody   d go down and bathe. Families would get  together and go down. I think one of the things that I liked about back then  too, not that I   m overly religious, but nobody worked on a Sunday, except the  farmers. All businesses were closed. That was the time to go somewhere and  do something.  Getting back on the highway, my dad fixed all the big inner tubes that they had  on the tractors because they would get broke down. He had a vulcanizing  machine. Those people back then would do anything to have some fun  because they didn   t have any money to buy fun with. This one great big road  grater had a tube on it that was about 16 inches across, and it blew out and  ripped this big inner tube clear around. It left about four inches of all. It was  going to be like a week to ten days before they could get another inner tube.  That road construction crew was all held up because of that grater. So my  father said,    I can vulcanize that.    So they started betting if it would hold.  He   d vulcanized a patch about that big around. That little vulcanizer used heat  to put the patch on. Then he   d move over and put the other patch on. He  couldn   t stop because it was so hot the rubber had to glue together while it was  still hot. He couldn   t come back tomorrow. He was on that thing for 36 hours  straight patching that thing. They let him sleep for five or ten or fifteen  minutes, whatever the patch took time to do, maybe a half-hour. They   d wake  him up and he   d go make some more. Whole families were in there the last  day when they   d mounted this thing to put on the grater to see if it was going  16  Kite  Clair  Lemons  Allen  Lemons  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Allen  Clair  to blow up again. They had a game going. That was something interesting.  They were all betting a nickel or a dime or something like that. It held, so they  went ahead and finished the road. It was still running when they finished that  highway out there. That was something that people did. They had to get  together with themselves. Kids threw balls over the house, Annie, Annie  Over. Whatever you could do.  I was just describing that game. My mom played that game with me. The  Annie, Annie Over game. She   d throw the ball over and come, or I   d throw it  over, and then she   d hit me upside the head with it  laughter . That was a  game  We were in Wal-Mart and I had a ball, and I said,    This looks like the  ball that left the imprint on the side of my face  laughter .  They   d take you away from your mom nowadays. Brutality.  Mrs. Allen, what did your father do? What was his occupation?  Farming.  So you lived in a rural area, and yours was more urban.  We lived on a farm. Later on he got into the selling of tractors. Actually, he  was a misplaced farmer. He should have been a salesman because he was  good at it. He sold tractors. Of course, he sold them on time. They said when  he left Oklahoma he had some half a million, a million dollars out on the  books on the sales of tractors.  Back then that was lots of money.  You got your mail once a week. You took the Cappers Weekly and the  McCall   s magazine. You bought your clothing and fabrics and things like that  from the Montgomery Ward catalog and the Sears catalog.  Don   t forget about the feed sacks.  Well, yes. I   ve got a few feed sacks. Here is a copy of a Sears catalog. Here  is a picture that is similar to my grandparents    house. The price on it was   725, for a two-story house.  That   s a lot of money.  Was that assembled or you put it together yourself?  It   d come in sections, and it would come in on the train. Then you   d have to  go take your team and wagon, and bring back those sections. Then you   d put  up what you got and wait for the next shipment.  It even has a floor plan.  17  Kite  Allen  Clair  Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  This is similar to the one that he tried to fireproof.  The funny part of it was that he was going to paint that tin red, like brick was  supposed to be  laughter . He got the paint in a great big old barrel, but  somehow he never did get around to do that. Later on, just a few years ago  when that land was sold, they found that barrel. It had fallen loose from the  paint, and there was just a big ball of red paint in there  laughter . Somebody  took it out and buried it. I said,    Boys, there   s somebody due for a shock.     You bought everything from Sears or Montgomery Ward.  Oh yeah. Oh yeah.  So your dad farmed a quarter section, 80 acres, is that right?  I don   t remember. He had more than that. The 80 acres was over at Madison.  What he had, where we lived, was over south of that several miles. He raised  wheat and corn, and of course, you always had to have a garden. If you didn   t  raise your vegetables, potatoes, and things, you were up the creek.  You   d starve to death. You didn   t have money to go buy any, and they didn   t  have them for sale anyway.  You had to can it.  Everybody canned.  And you had a cellar. You kept that stuff all in there. You were talking about  the plums; we had about three varieties on our farm. One of them was great  big and kind of a golden color. They were just beautiful, and they made  beautiful plum butter and jelly. Then we had some of the regular kind that  were red. They were more tart. Then we had some little ones, and boy, they  were awful  laughter . You couldn   t get enough sugar on them. Picking  plums was one of the things that we had to do, pick currants and work the  garden.  While I   m thinking about it, I   ll expand on that just a minute too. It was a job.  They had thorns in there.  Yes, they had thorns that long on them.  And rattlesnakes loved to get underneath in there. I don   t know whether  they   d eat or protect them or what, but they just loved to get in there. Most  women would take a pair of old man   s trousers or a blouse or something and  cut the pants off and make sleeves with them to cover their hands. They just  left the fingers out to pick those plums. You earned them. You earned  everyone you got.  Yes, and you wore a sunbonnet. Did you ever see a sunbonnet?  laughter   18  Lemons  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Allen  Kite  Allen  Huh-uh.  She   s probably still got one.  No, I haven   t, but I could make one.  Probably one for sale in here. Sears always had sunbonnets.  I could make you one. There   s probably one in there if you look far enough.  What brand of tractor did your dad sell?  I can   t remember. I want to say Farmall, but I don   t believe that   s it. I think  Farmall came out later.  John Deer was real popular out here.  Maybe it was John Deer.  There were lots of John Deer   s out here.  There were people all around the countryside that wanted a tractor.  Oh gosh, yeah.  Of course, horses  Couldn   t beat them.  That   s right.  They weren   t very fast either  laughing .  So your father farmed right in the transition period from horse to tractor, and  then he picked up selling tractors?  Through all of that, it came about that he got an opportunity to sell them. He  worked on that, too. When you   re farming you get out, work the ground, and  plant your things; then you have to wait a while for it to grow. There   s a time  element in there. That   s when he would go out and work on his tractor  situation.  When he started selling tractors, did some of the chores on the farm shift to  other members of the family?  Yes. We milked eight or ten cows all the time, and sometimes more than that.  We   d feed the calves, and my sister and I did most of that. We   d feed the hogs  and work in the garden.  19  Kite  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Kite  Allen  What would a typical day be like for you on the farm?  You got up early in the morning, and got right out there and took care of those  cows. If it was a time of the year where they had to be fed then you fed them  and milked them. You brought that milk in and run it through the separator.  They   d never heard of homogenized milk in them days.  Nobody drank it.  No. If you drank milk, you drank the real McCoy. It was cream and all. You  put that milk through the separator. It had two spouts on it. One of them was  for cream, and the other one was for the milk that was left. You took the milk  that was left and fed the calves and the hogs and, of course, the cats. When we  were milking there was a cat that would sit right there and give you that  soulful look. Pretty soon you   d give a little squirt over there, and he loved it.  We always kept cats out around the barn because they kept the rats down. Of  course, there were the bull snakes too. I   ll always remember when I went out  to pick up this bucket of feed to go and feed something or other, and it was  kind of heavy. I looked in there, and there was a big old bull snake all curled  up sound asleep. I took him out and killed him right away. At that time, the  only good snake was a dead one. My dad got all over me about that. He said,     I had that snake all this time to keep the rats down.     They did do it.  Yeah, they do. That   s why he was like that.  Getting back to your milk though, you had to have a place to keep this cool  milk.  If you didn   t have any ice. Another thing, you were talking about going to the  ice plant, they had one in Laverne. The only time you ever had ice much  around your place was if somebody had a birthday and you had homemade ice  cream and cake.  That was a treat, wasn   t it?  Oh, yes. You kept that ice wrapped up in a big old blanket as long as it would  last. You didn   t have an icebox. You didn   t have any place to keep it, so you  put it in a big old tub and covered it up. That was how you did things in those  days. We used to have a man that lived with us and worked with fields. He  loved ice cream, but it always gave him a headache. He would take a bandana  and tie it around his head;    Give me another dish of ice cream.     Laughter.   Did you work in the fields with your father, or did you tend to the garden  more?  No. We more tended to the garden and the livestock. They did most of their  fieldwork with horses.  20  Lemons  Allen  Lemons  Allen  Kite  Allen  Kite  Clair  Did you just have the one sister?  No, I had two brothers and a baby sister. My baby sister was born on Easter  morning. The doctor came out and delivered her. When my sister and I were  finishing up the breakfast chores he came out and he said,    Sit in this chair,  and give this kid a name.    We thought she was just gorgeous, so I rocked her  and we talked about it and gave her a name.  What   d you name her?  Lola Louise. She is known as Louise nowadays.  Did they decide to abandon the Lola?  Well, that was her choice. She chose to do it that way. The doctor didn   t think  anything about that. He had a little breakfast with us, and since it was Easter  morning, I made pancakes. I shaped them like little rabbits for my little  brothers. The doctor came out and had a pancake, and went on about his  business.  Mr. Clair, what about your family life? What did you have as far as brothers  and sisters?  I had one brother, and he   s still here in Stillwater. We   re both retired, and we  both live together. He was about two years old when he was out there in that  panhandle.  There are two stories about him. One is that we went to Sunday picnic and a  swim party down to Beaver, down to a creek down there. Somebody hollered  at my dad and said,    Your baby is floating in the water.    My dad ran down  there, and sure enough, my brother was face down floating in the water. He  didn   t know what to do. The only thing he could think about doing was to  grab him by the feet and shaking him like that. He just sat there and shook the  water clear out of him. Pretty quick he got his breath. That was one close call  for brother.  It was wintertime the next time that an episode happened. He was about two  then. The gasoline truck came over to deliver the gasoline. They had round  tanks on those like they do nowadays, but back in the cab of the truck they had  a cut out in there for a barrel of oil. You didn   t buy cased oil then; you bought  it by the barrel, put a pump in it, and that   s the way you sold it. He delivered  the barrel of oil. He had two chains that went around to hold the barrel in. It  was about dark when the guy delivered the oil, and it was cold out. It was  probably 35 or 40  degrees , somewhere in that area. After he left, Mama was  getting dinner ready to go, and all at once, the brother   s not here. He was two  years old and it was dark out, so they had to use lights from the service station.  They turned all the outside lights on, and they started hunting for him. They  called the neighbors and went to the fields and everything hunting for him.  After about an hour of panicsville, the gasoline driver called from Beaver. He  21  Kite  Allen  Clair  Kite  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Clair  said,    I   ve got your boy here. When I got out to park the truck he was in the  oil well hanging on to the chain.    It was about 30 miles there and it was  wintertime, and there was a two-year old kid hanging on to this thing on a  chain. He   s some over 65 now, so he   s making it all right  laughing .  He made it.  By the grace of God.  By the grace of God. He doesn   t remember anything about it these days, but  it   s very vivid in my mind. I think it   s because I had such a good time. I was  collecting bones and had too good a dog. My dad took the tank truck one time,  and went out, which the fields were just covered with prairie dogs back then.  They   re gone because the fertilizer we used out in that part of the country  poisoned a lot of them, but there used to be colonies and colonies of them.  Hundreds of them, just running all over. If you came up to them they   d all  stick their head out and look at you and down they   d go. Like I say, they  didn   t have any entertainment back then, so we filled the gasoline truck up on  a Sunday. We   d all get together and go out to the Beaver colonies. We stuck  the hose down in their den, turned on the water. Water kept coming up over  here and water over here. Pretty soon, here   d come the prairie dogs. There   d  be two or three little ones and we   d grab them. You didn   t want to get a hold  of that big one because he had teeth that long. We got the little babies and  raised them. We gave them away except for one. All of the kids got one.  Mine was named Brownie. This was just like a dog. He finally got about half  grown, four or five months I had him, and we had a water bowl and feed for  him. You whistled for him just like a dog, and he   d come to you just like a  dog. He never bit, never did anything. So we had a salesman come by. A  storm was brewing, so they gave him my bed for that night. Brownie jumped  up in bed and slept with me. The next morning Brownie was a pancake  sad  sighs . It broke my heart. My prairie dog was gone. That just shows you  what they used to do back then. They   d go out and just do anything.  I think it was the fertilizer that brought them to extinction, not sticking the hose  down the ground  laughter .  No, that didn   t hurt them  laughing . They could multiply faster than you  could put the water down there.  Then they had a trap line. They   d trap these animals. That was part of their  income. They   d sell the hides.  There was lots of hide selling back then.  What was a typical day for you like, a more city life? Your dad had a  business.  You mean when I grew up?  22  Kite  Clair  Kite  Clair  Allen  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Clair  No, as a child in that area. What would you do? What would a typical day for  you be like?  In that area, of course, just going to school. I was too young to do anything.  I   d hunt bones or pump the gasoline flows up. Also, we used to have Progress  beer and Schlitz beer. Those were the two beers. Schlitz was a dime and  Progress was a nickel. Schlitz had a cone top on it with a cap. One of my  occupations was to take all these empty Schlitz cans and take a hammer and  knock this thing back down and inside. I   d take that little piece of iron rod I  had and beat it on the sides. Then that made an ashtray. I   d go up and down  the streets and sell them for a penny a piece. They bought them if they had an  extra penny; just to get rid of me you know  laughing . Anyway, just go to  school, I think. We didn   t last that long, a couple of years. Then we moved  back to Enid, Oklahoma.  You worked in a grocery store you said.  I worked just dusting cans off.  They also had a barrel that had pickles in it that you could help yourself. All  you had to do was just go along and pick one out if you wanted.  I might elaborate back to the gypsies because you were interested in the  gypsies. They used to do a lot more harm than they did good. They weren   t a  good clan. They came in to take everything they could get and run. You  couldn   t put them in jail. If you put them in the jail, they had to keep the  women and the kids and the men separate. Those women would howl and  holler and pinch the kids to keep them crying. Finally you let them out. You  could not stay in the jail. It went on 24 hours a day, screaming and hollering.  They wouldn   t get anything out of them anyway.  They knew what they were doing, didn   t they?  Sure they did.  How many were in a caravan?  I would say four to five cars and four or five in each car, 25 to 30. Like I say,  they would come into a grocery store, like my dad   s service station, and my  dad was a big man and he didn   t take anything off of anybody. When they  came up there he just shoved his pistol in his belt and shut the door and locked  it. You couldn   t lock up the pumps because they were full. They   d come up  there with their big cars and started grabbing hoses to fill their car up, so he  just grabbed the hose out of their hand. While he was doing that there   d be  two or three other ones doing that, and he   d just fire a shot and put the pumps  back. He said,    You start paying me. Give me  5, whatever you want, and  we   ll pump  5 worth.    One woman went around in back of him and grabbed  his billfold. My dad reached around to get her real quick, and broke her wrist.  He wouldn   t do it on purpose, but he didn   t know who was back there when he  23  Kite  Clair  Kite  Clair  Kite  Clair  Allen  Clair  Kite  Clair  Allen  Clair  reached around. They   d just reach up and get in people   s pockets. They   d get  anything they could get. That   s the type of people they were. They are alive  and running today also.  Oh yeah?  For six years over in Branson, Missouri, and I had 15 shops in a mall there.  We got a call one day that the gypsies were coming. They didn   t hit my place,  but they hit several other places. They   d just walk in the gift shops and start  grabbing. You couldn   t catch them fast enough, and they   d just haul it off in  cars.  When was this?  This was in    88,    89. It   s very interesting. They   re still very much alive and  running.  Do you know where they would come from?  They   ve always been migratory. They just move all the time.  I was going to say, they don   t have any place to be from. They just prowl all  the time, don   t they?  I think originally they were from Sicily. I think they   ve still got a whole bunch  of them over there. They had brightly colored trailers back in the olden days.  They like different colors of clothing, loud clothing and all that. I saw a movie  or news article somewhere on that about ten years ago about some country  where they come from. What sticks in my mind is Sicily.  Would you distinguish between those people and the regular hobos or tramps?  You   d see the gypsies coming and you   d get out your guns, but when a hobo  would come, you   d get out some beans.  So many people were down on their luck and didn   t have anything to eat and  didn   t have a job. You couldn   t find a job. People just chipped in to help each  other out. You could usually tell the difference between a hobo and a big old  bum. I don   t know how you could tell. They were very meek and nice to  everybody if they were just a hobo, and they   d work. They   d give you a day's  pay just for letting them sleep in the barn and have breakfast and go on their  merry way. My name is G-I-B, short for Gilbert.  Like Cousin Gilbert.  Yeah. Call me Gib. An old uncle hung me with that 100 years ago. Clair.  -------  -------
