 Gill. Today is February 20, 2010. I   m visiting with  Julie Adams in her parents    home here in Dallas, Texas. This interview  is for the O-STATE Stories Project and the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Julie, I appreciate you driving over and meeting  with us today and taking the time to interview.  Sure.  I thought we might start with the beginning, a little bit about where you  grew up, things you were involved in, a little bit about your family. Can  you share some of that information with us?  Sure. I was born in Oklahoma City in 1954 and we lived there; I don   t  remember because we moved when I was one to Memphis, Tennessee.  Lived there a year or two and then moved to Conway, Arkansas. That   s  my first recollection of any placed we have lived.  And how long were you in Conway?  About six years, I believe. Then, we moved to Nashville, Tennessee for  a year in 1962. And then in 1963, we moved to Dallas and we have been  here ever since.  Dallas is kind of your home      Dallas is home.  Where you grew up and went to junior high and high school.  Yes.  What high school did you attend?  5  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Lake Highlands High School. It   s in the Richardson School District in  northeast Dallas.   What were  some of your activities in high school? Organizations you  were involved with?  I was very active in high school. I can   t even remember all of them now.  (Laughter) In a lot of different clubs and organizations. I, like my father,  am a people person so I enjoyed being in those organizations.  Now, we said in early interviews with your dad that somehow you  escaped Oklahoma State University.  Yes. (Laughs)  You are a Red Raider out of Texas Tech.  Yes.  What year did you enroll in Tech?  1972. I was there from    72 to    76.  And your major there was?  Elementary education, which is a little ironic because I   ve never taught  in elementary school. I   ve taught everywhere else. (Laughter)  Well, maybe, can you share a little bit then about what you did after  graduation? Can you share a little bit of your life to this point after you  left college?  Sure. I got my first job in Arlington, Texas so I have lived there ever  since. (It is a suburb of Dallas.) I was placed in junior high; I was math  specialization. They needed math teachers in junior high and I thought  they   d lost their mind but they said,    No, try it for a year and if you  don   t like it, you can change to elementary school.    I tried it and  absolutely loved it, so I taught in junior high for ten years and then went  back and got my secondary certification and taught in high school for  nineteen years and then retired. I have taught at the college level now,  Tarrant County College, for six years.  You taught math all this time?  Taught math the whole time.  6  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  And math now, as I understand, was not your major?  Well, it was elementary ed but with a math specialty. I do love math.  Which math courses were you teaching in high school?  I taught Fundamentals of Math through Algebra II, so geometry, algebra,  all of those.  Geometry, algebra, trig, all those?  Yes. Taught them all.  And now you have retired?  Yes.  So you taught nineteen years in high school, so twenty-nine years     Twenty-nine years with Arlington Independent School District.  You   re still pretty young to be retired. What are you doing now, Julie?  Right after I retired I had four part-time jobs and now I am down to two  part-time jobs. (Laughter)  Do you want to share some of those?  I sold tickets at the high school games and I worked at World Trade  Center with a friend of mine that is manager of a show room over there.  That was just during markets, so that was very temporary. Then, I have  worked with the Texas Rangers, I sell tickets there. It is a great  atmosphere; really fun. This will be my fifth season there. Then I have  taught at Tarrant County College ever since I retired.  So you are teaching math?  A couple of math courses, yes, each semester.  What level courses are you teaching?  They are the developmental courses to get people ready to take college  algebra.  Ones that maybe had a little shortage of background in math out of high  school.  7  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Right. We have a lot of students who come back to school that have  already married and have families that are coming back to get their  degree.  Part of it is they have got to have so many hours of math at a certain  level so they have got to pick up some background they didn   t get?  Right.  Do you enjoy teaching those types of students?  Yes.  Is it rewarding for you?  They   re the greatest because they are very serious about it and they   re  coming back to better their lives, so I really admire. It is much harder  once you   ve established a family and have a full-time job.  Now, you had an older sister?  Yes, Katy.  She was how much older?  Four years older.  She attended school at Oklahoma State University.  Right.  Did you ever visit her at OSU?  Yes. In the four years she was there, we went up several times. I think  we always went up Homecoming and parents    weekend. Of course, I  was enthralled because I was the younger sister. (Laughter)  What were some of your first impressions of OSU and Stillwater?  Oh, beautiful campus. She was in a sorority there, Tri-Delt, and I would  stay with her at the house and that was always fun. She would set up  blind dates for me so I thought I was so grown up. (Laughter)  Now did Mom and Dad know you were dating college guys when you  were in     8  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  I don   t know if they knew that or not. (Laughs)  Probably shouldn   t have asked that because they are listening in now.  (Laughter)  But, since they   re in the room right now then I   ll say yes, they did.  What are some special memories of OSU that they have shared with you  about their OSU experience? Your mother and dad both graduated from  Oklahoma State University.  Right.  When you were growing up, did they tell you some stories about  Oklahoma State that you remember?  Just how happy they were there. They loved it. Talking about dating  each other and meeting out on the Theta lawn and walking around the  campus at Theta Pond and going to the football games   they really,  really enjoyed it. My sister really enjoyed it, too. She had a great  experience there.  Since you shared some of her feelings about Oklahoma State, her father  had been there, and then her grandfather being in the first graduating  class, was that kind of neat for her? Was that a special feeling for her?  Yes, yes. I think we have realized the importance of that in later years,  actually, because we just really didn   t talk about it too much when she  was at school there. Oklahoma State has just been wonderful to our  family and included us in several things. I think as that has occurred that  we have realized the importance of that even more now.  Are there some special stories that your dad has told you about his  experience? I mean, he had two different experiences at OSU with pre-  World War II as a student and really coming back after the war. But do  any particular stories stick out in your mind that he shared with you?  Maybe humorous stories? Things that happened to him? Special times?  I know two things that were very important to him and that mean so  much to him are the Betas  Beta Theta Pi Fraternity  at OSU. He says  that really changed his life, even for the better. He loved his time with  the Betas and he   s been a faithful, faithful alum. Also, meeting my  mother there. He talks about how wonderful that was and how they  would dance and she would fill up   back then they had dance cards,  apparently, and you would sign up for a specific dance with that person  and he always made sure that he was on her dance card. (Laughter)  9  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Probably more than once.  More than once, yes. (Laughter)  That   s great.  But they really enjoyed their time there.  I understand that you were sort of the designated coordinator of the  Adams    family reunion, this last reunion? The one they had in  Arlington?  Yes.  You must   ve picked up a lot of stories from there so I wanted to ask you  some questions about that. From your perspective, listening to these  stories, what   s the collective memory, the common experience that ties  the Adams family together? Since you went to Tech, you   re not part of  that but you had a chance to observe it. What ties the Adams family  together, because we   re talking about three or four generations from  four different brothers spread across the United States. What   s the tie  they have?  I really credit OSU for bringing our family together   our extended  family. As my parents have told you the story of meeting them for the  first time, from the Walter Adams family side, from the Walter Adams  brother and his descendants. It   s been amazing. It   s been an amazing  journey. It started in 1989 when they went up for the centennial  celebration and then it   s just grown from there and it   s just blossomed. I  credit my father for organizing that first reunion and that   s where we all  got to know each other and we just fell in love with each other. And  what a great group of people. We realized how much time we missed out  on all these years not knowing about one another. So through Oklahoma  State, that   s what brought our family together and we are very grateful  for that.  I guess this question answers itself but I   m going to ask it anyway. Have  they stayed close together? When they had the reunion in    90 and the  centennial at OSU and then the nine    it was the    91 reunion, I guess,  that was the first one?     91 was the first reunion and    96 for the centennial celebration of the  first graduation.  That   s the one where we had the reenactment of the commencement  exercises there in Old Central?  10  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Yes. Then we had the next one in 2001. We   re trying to have them about  every five years. Then time lapsed a little and then we had our last one  in 2009 last year.  And 2001 was held where?  In Angel Fire, New Mexico again.  Still at the property in Angel Fire?  Yes, at the cabin.  Wow, it must be beautiful up there.  It is. It is.  Can I get invited to the next one you have in Angel Fire?  Sure. (Laughter) You   re welcome. I feel like OSU   s just our extended  family now.  Can you share some information about the reunions? You were talking  about where they   re held. What   s the format for your reunions? I  remember attending part of yours one evening when Diane Adams had it  in Stillwater. Can you talk a little bit about that? Your dad had  mentioned that everybody would talk a little bit about what part of the  family they were from and their history. Can you share a little bit about  how the reunion goes and how you organize it?  This last one we met in Grapevine,  Texas  and stayed at the hotel there  and didn   t have too many activities planned but we had picture time. We  had one evening where we went out to dinner together and before we did  that, we met in the room and everyone told who they were and how they  were related to the four brothers and what they were doing at this time,  their profession and their families and all.  What are some of the more unique stories you recall? You   ve made how  many of these now?  Four.  So you   ve had a chance to observe and listen an awful lot. What have  been some of the more unique family stories you   ve heard?  Oh, goodness. I can   t think of anything off the top of my head. (Laughs)  I   m sorry.  11  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  They talked about the Run of 1889, about claiming the quarter section of  land     Yes. Did you hear the stories about William Henry Harrison Adams,  which would be my great-grandfather, who I never knew, and the  Oklahoma Land Run? They made a movie about that several years ago  that kind of brought it to light and I realized it was dangerous because  everyone was racing and running over the other to get to their land first.  That was pretty incredible and he must have been an adventurous man to  come into Indian Territory. Then, the stories of my grandmother coming  to Indian Territory to teach, choosing that over any other safe place to  go. I think she was very adventurous, too.  Another story about her when she was twenty or twenty-one, I believe,  she went to San Francisco to visit some relatives in 1906, and that   s  when they had the big earthquake in San Francisco and she was there  during the earthquake. The family had a china shop and they lived above  the shop and so they told her this was a very monumental occasion so  they said,    Pick out something to take home to remember this by.    We  still have the chocolate pot that she brought home that has the sand and  the dust burned into it from the fires in the earthquake.  How unique. That   s great.  Yes. So then she moved shortly after that to Indian Territory and that   s  where she met my grandfather, Homer, and the rest is history, as they  say.  That   s right. Are there some OSU stories you remember? Some of them  would talk about their experiences, particularly some of the younger  generations from Arthur   s sons and then of course your dad.  Not anything specifically. Just about what a wonderful experience it was  and my dad says his life really started at OSU. He   s never looked back  and gone forward. He   s a very honorable man and I   m so proud to call  myself his daughter.  Julie, because you were in charge of the invitation list for this last  meeting, I   m  going to  ask a question I asked your mother but in a little  bit different way. Out of the four brothers, to the descendants of those  four brothers, from what order are you having the most representation  at the family reunions?  I think our family, the Homer Adams  side , and we have groups of  pictures with the different family members and of course, every family  member can   t make every reunion, but I think Homer Adams is probably  12  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  the largest. The second largest is Walter Adams descendents and then of  course Oscar Adams has the one living daughter and she has three  children. She   s the one in San Diego, so that   s the smallest one of the  family and then the Arthur Adams is probably the third largest.  And Arthur, for a couple of generations, they were pretty strong. Now  they   re Texas folks, right?  Oh yes, we   ve settled in Texas, and proud of it. (Laughs)  And very proud of it. Let me ask you this: in the four families, who are  the family historians? If you were going to get the stories of those  families, Arthur, James, Oscar, Walter, who are the historians?  Dwain Sehon I credit with a lot of the family history. He put together a  beautiful book that we have and it has everything from pictures to  obituaries and he has done a lot of research. Recently he sent, before the  last reunion, a genealogy page, for lack of better terms, that dates back  to I believe it   s the 1300s in England.  Wow.  Then, also Walter (Bud) Adams has done a lot of the research, too.  Bud   s his family   s nickname and Diane   s Walter is Bud      Yes. There   s so many Walters and Arthurs and all in our family that the  nicknames are to help keep everybody straight.  Speaking of the historians and the family genealogy, I had a chance to  talk to Dwain back in December  about being related  to the two Adams  presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams. There   s not a direct tie  to the family, but there is a tie. Is that right?  It   s my understanding that we are descendents through the uncle   s side  of the family. Not the direct descendents. I understand also we   re direct  descendents of Samuel Adams, the patriot. (Laughter)  The Boston Tea Party Sam Adams?  Yes, the Boston Tea Party. But, the kids nowadays know him best for  his beer. (Laughter) His picture on the beer bottle. But he was a patriot.  In your family, who is the family historian? Is that your dad or is that  you? Who keeps the family history?  13  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  Adams  Gill  I   m very interested in it, so I do a lot of that. I   m an organizer like my  father is and so I really enjoyed organizing this last reunion. We had a  great turnout and now we feel like we know the other family members  so much better that we just pick up where we left off, so we love getting  together.  Now one more last question about the historians. In the Arthur Adams  family, would Art Adams or Art Robertson be the historian in that line in  the family?  That question probably would be better answered by them. I   m not sure,  to be honest. But they   ll be here in a little while so I   m sure we   ll talk to  them about that.  And at your last reunion, how many did you have in attendance, the  Arlington reunion?  A little over forty. Forty-two, forty-three.  So, you normally have between forty and fifty     Forty and fifty, yes.  We   ve talked an awful lot about the family. Is there anything that we  haven   t talked about? Are there some things that someone listening to  this series of tapes thirty, forty, fifty years  from  now would want to  know about the family that we haven   t talked about?  Gosh, I   m still learning about the rich history of the Adams    and  Oklahoma State and I   m very appreciative of Oklahoma State and what  they mean to our family. I appreciate all that you   ve done and that  you   ve brought our family back together.  Thank you. I appreciate it.  -------  -------
